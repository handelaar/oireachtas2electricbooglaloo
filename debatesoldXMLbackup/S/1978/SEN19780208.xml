      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House this evening, she proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The inadequacy of information provided in relation to supplementary welfare allowances under the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act 1975.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

As I understood it, the arrangement has been accepted that there would be a period set aside for motions in every month in which the House is sitting.

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1977: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) (for the Minister for Justice) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators, will, I am sure, be generally aware of the proposals in this Bill. Its purpose is to bring an end to the system of ground rents so far as concerns new dwellinghouses and indeed to replace the entire system of leasehold sales of such houses, with its concomitant restrictions on home ownership, by a system of sales in fee simple.  A further Landlord and Tenant Bill that I will be promoting in the immediate future will contain my proposals in relation to existing residential ground rents.  That Bill is <Col N="201" /> now being debated in the other House: it is one of a trilogy.  Meanwhile, the Bill now before this House is designed to put a stop to the further creation of such rents.  That, to my mind, is the most urgent requirement.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to do this by denying validity to new ground leases, that is by simply making void any attempted future ground lease of an ordinary dwellinghouse.  One question that may be asked is what will be the cost of doing this?  That is, will it make new houses more expensive? The answer to this is of some importance, because the increased costs that would be involved in compelling the sale of houses in fee simple rather than by way of leases was given as the main reason for not going ahead with a prohibition on the creation of ground rents when the Bill of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967 was before this House.</P>
      <P>My predecessor of the time&mdash;Deputy Lenihan&mdash;was very keen to introduce such a prohibition, but he was reluctantly forced to the view that the extra cost made the proposal impracticable at that time.  It must be remembered that around that time the purchase price of a £20 ground rent would have been at least £250 and that the same sum would then have represented the deposit on a typical Small Dwellings Act house.</P>
      <P>However, things are very different now from what they then were.  I am fully satisfied that today the grant of a fee simple instead of a lease reserving a ground rent will not have any appreciable effect on the price of new houses.  The new system will certainly have no ill effect as regards the total repayments which a typical house purchaser has to meet following purchase subject to a mortgage or loan.  For, even if a notional ground rent is capitalised and the freehold house price increased accordingly, the corresponding net increase in loan or mortgage outgoings will certainly not be greater than the amount of that notional ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that may be asked is whether the Bill is justifiable in as much as it proposes to restrict an owner's freedom to dispose as he <Col N="202" /> wishes of one particular kind of property, that is, residential building land.  I do not think that this is a question that nowadays need be argued at length.  The situation that this Bill proposes to change is a situation where a house purchaser, having paid a considerable sum for the site of his house&mdash;either as a component of the price of that house or as a separate transaction&mdash;is thereafter required to make further annual payments by way of ground rent.  That is a system that is no longer defended by any representative section of the community.</P>
    <P>In the past, before the enactment of the 1963 Planning Act, there may have been a case to be made for the system of selling dwellinghouses on the basis of long leases that reserved ground rents and that imposed restrictive covenants on the owner-occupiers so as to preserve the amenities of the neighbourhood.  The necessity nowadays to get planning permission for new building, and for alterations of a kind that could affect the amenities, renders the leasehold system obsolete. For landlords, the only real significance nowadays of that system is its financial aspect.</P>
    <P>This brings us to another important consideration bearing on the principle on which this Bill is based.  The owner-occupier is concerned with much more than the financial aspect of the leasehold system.  This system denies him full ownership of his own home.  The emotional objections to the system are not nowadays likely to be underrated by anyone concerned with the matter. But the emotional aspect is not the only one.  The State already recognises and actively supports the principle of owner occupation of housing and this Bill stands four square with that principle.  It ensures that in future owners of dwellings will be full owners, the emphasis being on &ldquo;full&rdquo;.  Moreover this Bill opens the way towards a simpler and less expensive system of legal titles based on ownership in fee simple in place of the present jungle of leasehold titles. This should have considerable benefits as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I turn now to deal with the actual <Col N="203" /> provisions of the Bill.  The essence of the Bill is the proposal in subsection (1) of section 2 that in future any attempted new ground lease of an ordinary dwelling will be void.  This means that apart from renewals of existing ground leases, and apart also from the special provision in subsection (4) of section 2, both of which cases I will discuss in a moment, any such attempted lease will simply be a nullity.  As far as the public sector is concerned the prohibition on the creation of future ground leases of dwellinghouses is, by section 4 of the Bill, being extended to local housing authorities.  I shall return to this provision also later on.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at this point that I have given full consideration to what might be called the &ldquo;half-way&rdquo; system of prohibiting ground rents. Under such a system the whole lease would not be voided but only the provision in it reserving a rent.  This, of course may be superficially attractive, particularly because it would enable conveyancers to continue their old practices of giving long leases.  It must be ruled out, however, because it ignores the essential popular and justified demand which this Bill is designed to meet.  This demand is not simply for the redemption of the rent.  It is a demand for full ownership which can only be met by way of ensuring that new houses will be sold in fee simple rather than by way of long leases.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that this will mean that conveyancing practices will have to change when the Bill becomes law. Many developers and their legal advisers have, I am aware, very wisely anticipated the legislation and are already selling dwellings in fee simple only.  I can only commend such persons. As for others who may persist until the last moment with old practices and take the risk of giving void leases, I think it only fair to point out that the relevant proposals in this Bill have been public knowledge since the Landlord and Tenant Bill which lapsed with the dissolution of the 20th Dáil was circulated in January 1977.  On top of that, the Bill contains safeguards for parties who may become the genuine <Col N="204" /> victims of such practices, and I will be coming to these later on.</P>
    <P>A related matter to which I should perhaps draw attention is that, after the Bill has become law, any attempted creation of a fee farm grant of a dwellinghouse will be void just as will any attempted ground lease in the ordinary sense of that term.  This is because, in the present Landlord and Tenant Acts, the expression &ldquo;lease&rdquo; is defined as including a fee farm grant. Section 5 of this Bill provides that the Bill when enacted into law shall be construed as one Act with the preceding Landlord and Tenant Acts.  In consequence, references in this Bill to a &ldquo;lease&rdquo; include where appropriate references to a fee farm grant and the proposed prohibition on creating ground leases of dwellings extends to the creation of fee farm grants.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in recent years the ancient form of conveyancing by way of fee farm grant has become more popular.  However, it is a form of title which does not give the tenant full ownership.  This fee farm grant is not a fee simple, the legal estate which most closely reflects full ownership. What this Bill is all about is ensuring that houseowners will be full owners of their homes.</P>
    <P>Renewals of existing ground leases are excluded from the prohibition under subsection (2) of section 2.  The right of a ground lessee to obtain a renewed lease, known as a reversionary lease, as an alternative to acquiring the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act, is an important right in itself.  The preservation of this right is a matter of some consequence and is also in keeping with the general principle enshrined in the existing ground rents legislation that while the tenant has the right to terminate his liability to pay ground rent he is not forced to do so.  Even if it were decided to abolish in the future the right of an existing ground tenant to obtain a reversionary lease on the ground that the grant of a fee simple on termination of a lease is a better alternative, it would not be appropriate to do so in the context of this Bill.  Such a change would be better dealt with in the context of any future changes in the law relating to renewal rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> As the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill makes clear, the Bill does not extend to multiple-dwelling buildings.  I am aware that newly-constructed self-contained flats are nowadays quite frequently sold under arrangements that can involve payment of rent.  However, transactions involving the sale and purchase of such flats are in a special category where different considerations apply and they are accordingly outside the scope of the Bill, which I am bringing in for the benefit of owner-occupiers of ordinary dwellinghouses.</P>
    <P>Senators may find the text of the Bill somewhat difficult to follow because of the cross-reference to the provisions of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  This, I fear, was necessary because there is no legal definition of the term &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;.  Ground rents can only be legally described as rents reserved by particular types of leases.  These leases may vary quite a lot but they all record a landlord and tenant relationship in which the tenant can be seen to own the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest, and I suggest this Bill is all about bricks and mortar. These categories of leases have been identified at different times and described in various enactments, particularly in the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967.  The most extensive existing description of the kinds of leases concerned is in section 3 of the 1967 Act and it is by reference to this that section 2 (1) of the Bill sets out the proposed prohibition. These are the kinds of leases the lessees under which have the right to purchase the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>There is one addition to this list provided for in the Bill.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission furnished a report&mdash;their second report&mdash;in which they identified further classes of ground leases in addition to those covered by the Act of 1967.  However, in practice only one of these further types of ground leases could give rise to the creation of a ground rent in the future.  This one type of ground lease, with which section 3 deals can arise where the householder or developer is himself the owner in fee simple of the lands involved, where the <Col N="206" /> house is already built or partly built at the time of purchase and where the builder or developer sells the house by way of a long lease, usually with a substantial fine and reserving a ground rent.</P>
    <P>What the Bill proposes, therefore, is to declare void any future attempted lease of a dwellinghouse if that lease is of a kind that creates a ground rent.  This, I accept, is a rather Draconian solution, and it is for that reason that I have had a very careful examination made of all its possible consequences. Subsections (3) to (7) of section 2 of the Bill, as amended in the course of its passage through Dáil Éireann, are designed either to close off possible loopholes or to deal with practical difficulties that may arise.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible, for example, to circumvent the proposed prohibition by giving a long lease of a vacant site and building a house on the site afterwards.  Quite naturally, leases of vacant land as such are not being prohibited.  However, if a long lease of land is made in the future, if that land has a house built on it subsequently and if the total area of the land is such that all of the land is subsidiary and ancillary to the house, then that lease will be rendered void by section 2 (3) of the Bill.  It will be clear from what I have said that the scope of this provision is restricted to house sites.  In effect if a lease of a vacant site is given after the passing of the legislation and the lessee wants to put a dwelling on it afterwards, he will like any other developer have to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 2 is designed to copperfasten, as it were, the prohibition proposed in subsection (1). This provision is designed to protect house-purchasers in future who might find that, having made substantial payments to secure their new houses, they have simply been given a void lease. The proposal to give the house purchaser in such a case the right to acquire the fee simple at the expense of the purported lessor is meant to be a formidable deterrent and it serves to warn builders, developers and others concerned that after this Bill has become law they must take due care not to give void leases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> On the other hand, section 2 (5) of the Bill is designed for the protection of builders or developers who currently may find themselves saddled with leasehold land in course of residential building development.  Such a builder or developer would be unable to sell his houses otherwise than in fee simple because of the prohibition in this Bill.  At the same time he could find himself in the position of being unable to acquire the fee simple at any reasonable price, or indeed at any price.  The Minister for Justice had consultations with prominent members of the legal profession, and this provision is the result.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (5) proposes to give the builder the right, for a period of one year, to acquire the fee simple in the land under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  As amended in Dáil Éireann, the subsection gives this right to persons who at the time the Bill becomes law either hold the land under a lease for a term of not less than 99 years of which not less than 50 years remain unexpired, or who have an enforceable agreement for the grant of a 99-year lease or for the assignment of a 99-year lease.  Planning permission for housing must have been obtained at the time the Bill becomes law.  The relief is restricted to persons with building projects already in hand as evidenced by the existence of planning permission.  It is also relevant, in this context, that this provision of the Bill is in no way novel.  It was introduced by way of one of a number of amendments to the Bill which lapsed.  These amendments were circulated last spring.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it can hardly be said that insufficient notice has been given to the business interests and the legal advisers involved, particularly since the provision in question was drawn up to meet their requirements.  There should therefore not be any difficulty or confusion about that provision.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (6) of the Bill is a provision of a somewhat technical nature to cater for the difficulty the Bill poses for the trustees of a charitable housing trust who, under the terms of the trust, are not empowered to sell the houses to their tenants in fee simple and who <Col N="208" /> yet would be unable to sell by way of ground lease once the Bill had become law.  Section 2 (6) proposes to give the trustees the necessary power to sell to their tenants in fee simple.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 2 was inserted in the Bill in the course of its passage through Dáil Éireann.  The subsection is designed to cater for the following type of situation.  It could happen that a long-term lease of land is made after this Bill has become law and that a sub-lease is made of part of the land held under that lease.  After the land held under the sub-lease has been developed, say by the construction thereon of industrial premises, the lessee under the original lease may construct houses on the remainder of the lands and under section 2 (1) of the Bill this could render the entire lease void.  Sections 20 and 21 of the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, contain provisions to protect any sub-lessee whose lease is a building lease or a proprietary lease in a case where his lessor's lease is terminated for non-payment of rent, breach of covenant, and so forth. These provisions of the 1958 Act have the effect in such a case of making the building lessee or proprietary lessee, as the case may be, a direct lessee of the lessor who gave the terminated lease. The new provision in subsection (7) gives the same protection to an innocent sub-lessee in a case where a lease was rendered void in the circumstances that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill contains the provisions to deal with the situation as it arises in the public sector. Dwellings provided by housing authorities are excluded from the provisions of the landlord and tenant code by section 3 of the 1931 Act and purchasers of such dwellings have not a statutory right to acquire the fee simple interest in their dwellings under the 1967 Act.  However, under section 4 (1) of this Bill the prohibition on the creation of future ground rents will be extended to sales of local authority dwellings.  This is a historic aspect of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A new dwelling can be sold by a housing authority to a person other than the existing tenant, as, for example, to the first occupier when he <Col N="209" /> takes up occupation.  In this case the dwelling is sold at cost, less the equivalent of any grants payable for new private houses.  As these sales are analogous to sales of private houses, it is intended that the fee simple should in future vest in the purchaser.  Where a dwelling is sold to the local authority tenant, however, the sale under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, is heavily subsidised from public funds as compared with the financial assistance available to private householders.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, for housing authorities to ensure that in the case of a resale of such a dwelling the vendor and his dependants are not left without adequate alternative housing accommodation and also that the intended purchaser is in need of housing.  To meet this situation the Bill provides that, while the sale of such a dwelling will be in fee simple, certain special conditions will apply. These will operate for 25 years from the date of sale and will stipulate that the dwelling shall be used as the normal place of residence by the purchaser or his successor in title and that the dwelling cannot be resold without the consent of the housing authority.</P>
    <P>I must point out that special conditions, including those I have mentioned, apply to sales of all local authority dwellings at present and extend to the full period of the lease, which is normally 99 years.  Under the Bill, tenant purchasers of local authority dwellings will, in every case, acquire title to their dwellings in fee simple free of any ground rent, but subject to the two conditions specified in section 4 (2) for a period of 25 years.</P>
    <P>Local authority tenant purchasers have never heretofore had the statutory right to enlarge their leasehold interest to a fee simple interest or to obtain a reversionary lease.  However, under this Bill the benefits accruing to owner-occupiers in general will also extend to future tenant purchasers, subject to the conditions which are designed to ensure that housing accommodation provided at a heavy cost to public funds continues to be used for the purpose for which it was provided for at least a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> In conclusion, I should like to say how pleased I am to bring before the Seanad a Bill that marks a fundamental step in the development of full home ownership in the State.  As I have already hinted, it will bring about a most important change in conveyancing practice in as much as all new houses must in future be disposed of in fee simple rather than by way of a long lease.  The general reception the Bill has got indicates widespread agreement with the principles on which it is based, and there has been a general and genuine effort from all sides to make the detailed provisions as effective as possible.  This is an approach which I find very gratifying, particularly since these detailed provisions are far from simple.  I know that that is how the Members of this House will approach the Bill and I look forward to a useful and constructive debate. I ask the House if possible to give me all Stages today.</P>

      <P>I do not like to start on an abrasive note, but the answer to the Minister's request is, no.  This is a Committee Stage Bill, which is essentially very technical, and quite obviously a Bill of that nature must be teased out section by section.  It can only be teased out properly after hearing the full debate on the Second Stage.  The Minister presumably will listen to the points made and in his reply will deal with those points.  The adequacy or otherwise of his reply will then determine what approach has to be made on Committee Stage.  I do not wish to appear unco-operative but I cannot agree to all stages being taken this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might as well know the score early.  The principle in this Bill, the prevention of the creation of future ground rents, is acceptable to us on this side of the House.  It is something that has been sought for a long time.  It was first recommended in 1961 and various recommendations were made since, but were consistently resisted by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I welcome their <Col N="211" /> conversion to the acceptance of the principle that ground rents should be abolished.  When that party were in Government during those years the moves to end this system were consistently opposed and the conversion even though it is late is welcome.  I wonder is it because now there is an acceptance of the principle that ground rents should be abolished or is there an element of political expediency, arising from the experience of that party when in opposition, having to listen to and placate various lobbies in this area.  Having regard to the earlier consistent opposition, there is some ground for believing that this Bill is the result of that sort of activity during their term of opposition.</P>
      <P>There was no move by Fianna Fáil when in Government in the earlier days on this question of ground rents. Motions asking for legislation for the compulsory buying out of ground rents the first of them as far back as 1946, and Private Members' motions in 1960 in the other House, were rejected.  The late Deputy Seán Dunne in 1961 sought and was refused leave to introduce a Bill to prevent the creation of further ground rents.  In 1964, the Landlord and Tenant Commission, recommended the prevention of the creation of further ground rents.  That could have been inserted in the Ground Rents Bill of 1967, but even that recommendation coming from that non-political source was rejected. I mention these points to support my case that the conversion of Fianna Fáil to acceptance of this principle has been recent and is a matter of political expediency answering the lobbies to which they were subjected when they were in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill forms one part of a Bill which I had the honour of proposing to the last Dáil.  That Bill had three parts. It had a part to prevent the creation of future ground rents, which we now have before us today.  It had a part to make easier the purchase of existing ground rents, which the other House is debating today, and it also proposed the amendment and revision of the entire landlord and tenant code in relation to occupational tenancies.  Of the three parts, the part providing for the <Col N="212" /> revision, amendment and improvement of the general landlord and tenant code is by far the most important.  It is literally of immense commercial and legal significance in the life of this country.  As yet, there is no sign of that part of that Bill being proposed to the Oireachtas.  We have these other two, unimportant, in comparison to the third portion brought forward but not the third portion which is the most important part.  These two are important in themselves but are not as important as the third portion to which I have just referred.  This is a serious omission on the part of the Government because the situation that will result from lack of amendment in that field will be quite chaotic.  The present Bill is re-enacting in nearly similar terms the provisions of the Bill which was introduced early last year although there are a couple of differences in it. Some of these differences are committee points and we will no doubt go into them in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One point, which raises a matter of principle, is the question of extending the powers of the Bill albeit in a limited way, to local authority houses. The original Bill excluded local authority houses from any of the changes proposed for other type of dwellings. This was done in recognition of the fact that the situation of a purchaser of a local authority house is not analogous to that of a person purchasing a private dwelling.  In the case of a local authority house, the site would be provided by the community and the house would have been built by the community. In the case of the private person he would have bought his own site and he would have built his own house.  It is clear that there is no analogy between the two situations. Because the community was involved in providing these houses, the community should be left with control over those houses.  Very often there is extreme pressure of space in urban areas, and it is important that local authority houses should be kept under the control of the housing authority, so that they be kept available as residences.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that if any measure of control passes out, even 25 years hence, there could be undesirable consequences <Col N="213" /> from the point of view of housing within the community.  Many local authority houses are in large compact estates and are possibly strategically placed in regard to the urban area in question.  Under the planning code generally, local authorities have an obligation to provide for urban development and urban renewal as the need arises.  Critical to discharging that obligation is the power to have control over the property which could be strategically placed in that area, and that property very often is local authority houses.  Consequently it is important that the community, through the local authority, should retain control of that housing, so that its obligations with regard to proper planning can be fully carried out.  The House can see that if that control is diminished or abandoned, there might be great difficulties in the way of carrying out schemes of urban development 30 or 40 years hence, when there will be no controls whatever on these houses.  The controls proposed by this Bill last for only 25 years.  For these reasons local authority houses should be excluded.  The situation as regards the owners of them is not analagous to that pertaining to the private sector. What they are being given in this Bill, if it is being presented as putting them on the same footing as the private owner, is something of a confidence trick.  They are not being put on that footing at all.  The restriction for 25 years on sale and the necessity to get the consent of the local authority are significant and fundamental differences. It is a confidence trick to try and present the picture that local authority houses are now being brought in, and that this is an historic moment in the law of the land as the Minister has just attempted to suggest. They are being very seriously restricted.  It would be more honest to exclude that type of dwelling completely, rather than to pretend that it is getting the same status as private dwellings in regard to prohibition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>The basic thing that was needed was the ending of the ground rent.  In the last 20 or 30 years the amount being charged for ground rent was a reasonably noticeable burden on a house. <Col N="214" /> It was the weight of that burden that generated the initial demand for the abolition of the system.  In the case of a local authority tenant the ground rent is £1 and the only covenants contained in the lease are generally covenants to insure, to keep in repair, not to use for business, not to assign without the consent of the local authority. I am sure the House will agree that none of those covenants could be described as onerous, or improper, having regard to the fact that the house was built with community money in the first instance.  The ground rent, the element which gave rise to objections to the system, was only £1 per year. No one could seriously complain that that was a burden or something that could not or should not be carried. It would have been better to have maintained the exclusion of local authority housing from this legislation rather than to try to pretend to local authority tenants that they will be put on an equal footing with other purchasers, when they are not.  I have indicated strong reasons why the differences in their situation should be honestly faced up to.  They should be excluded from this legislation.</P>
    <P>The thing which gave rise to the campaign to change the law was the existence of fairly substantial ground rents.  The Minister said in his speech, that it was not possible to devise a legal system that could do away with the ground rent part alone, and that there were difficulties of definition, which made it impossible to tackle the problem by tackling the ground rent element only, and that as a result the methods proposed to deal with the problem is to end the entire lease which charges the ground rent.  There is in this an element of throwing out the baby with the bath water.  I am sure Senators will be aware that in many of these leases there are covenants which are for the benefit of the householder and for the benefit of his neighbours.  Granted, they diminish his ownership in the sense that the necessity to obey these covenants put him in a different category from a person who owns a fee simple which is an absolute title.  His title is not absolute in the sense that he has to obey certain <Col N="215" /> covenants which are devised for his good and the good of his neighbours. It is suggested that these covenants can no longer be drafted in the future because of this legislation, that their place will be taken by the provisions of the planning code.  I accepted that argument when I proposed the original Bill.</P>
    <P>It is still a correct argument, though I admit that it could be argued that the restrictions and controls which are imported into our law by the planning code will not be as effective in maintaining uniformity in an area in maintaining proper maintenance of dwelling houses as would the system of the covenants in the leases.  Because of the insuperable difficulty of dealing with the problem by attacking ground rent alone it was a question of whether to continue ground rents and ground leases for the sake of having these covenants, or to get rid of this inequitous system as was demanded.  On balance the approach in the Bill is right.  We have to get rid of the system and trust to the planning code to ensure that whatever uniformity, proper procedures and proper standards had been procured by the covenants, will be maintained by the planning code. This is something on which there could be debate, but I certainly thought that the measure was justified because of the offensive nature of ground rent as such, and the widespread and genuine demand for the ending of it.  I would concede that if the drafting difficulty of dealing with ground rents <i>per se</i> could be overcome, I would prefer to see the matter attacked in that way.</P>
    <P>There are some other differences in this Bill from the earlier Bill introduced. One notable one is the provision where land is held on lease for at least 99 years before the passing of the Act, with 50 years at least unexpired, and there is planning permission for the construction of dwellings.  There is then a period of one year allowed before the body of provisions come into effect.  One year is too short, and that period should be two years.  There could be commercial, legal or planning obstacles, or there could be conditions attached to existing <Col N="216" /> permission which could slow up the completion of the formalities within the year prescribed by the Bill. There could be commercial difficulties; there could be legal difficulties, and it is quite possible that they might not be resolved within the period of one year.  If there were difficulties of nobody's creation, over which the parties concerned might not have any direct control, it would be unfair that there would be prejudice.  It is not unreasonable to think that one year might not be sufficient to solve these, if there were a whole combination of them.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give us his views as to why he is confining the period to one year rather than two years as was originally proposed?  I also ask the Minister to comment on the scope of this Bill as compared with the original Bill.  The original Bill, in section 108, as far as I recall, applied to leases which would have been created under section 66 of the original Bill. My recollection is that the range of leases to be created under section 66 would be wider than that provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the other House a number of points were raised by Deputy O'Keeffe and the Minister for Justice in dealing with them indicated that he would give them consideration between that debate and this debate and that he would announce his mind on those points in the Seanad.  One or two points that the Minister made in his opening speech could by implication be dealing with the points raised on Committee Stage of the Bill.  That is my interpretation; I do not know if the Minister intended to deal in that way with those specific points.  Perhaps when replying to this debate the Minister will deal specifically with the points which were raised in the Dáil on Committee Stage and which the Minister promised would be dealt with in the Seanad.  The Minister's attitude to those points will be of some concern to us in deciding our attitude on Committee Stage.  This is a Committee point but perhaps the Minister might deal with it at this stage, so as to shorten Committee Stage.  The protection given in subsection (4) of section 2, I take it, applies to a person whose <Col N="217" /> lease is voided under subsection (1). Am I wrong in thinking that it does not give the same protection to a person whose lease is voided under subsection (3)?  Perhaps the Minister would deal with the case where there is a lessor who makes a lease of the entire property to a lessee, the land is not built on; the lessee assigns the entire property, and his assignee does not build on it either, but assigns it to a second assignee who decides to build.  What would be the position of the last assignee having regard to the provisions of subsection (4)?</P>
    <P>I reiterate, that the principle in the Bill is acceptable to this side of the House.  We consider that the most important part of the landlord and tenant code needing revision is that relating to occupational tenancies.  In view of the fact that the Bill providing for this revision was drafted and had a Second Stage debate in the last Dáil I had thought that it could come forward very quickly in the life of this Oireachtas, because there is a serious demand for reform.  At the moment, on the renewal of a lease the courts are constrained to grant a 21-year term, and the rent that they grant it at is the market rent as of the date of the court hearing and that rent has then to inure for the 21 years.  A moment's consideration will show Senators that after ten years that rent may be grossly inadequate.  The reform proposed was to change the term to 35 years and have automatic reviews of the rent every five years.  That is the way it should be.  The circuit courts now are finding themselves in the position of having to grant renewals of leases for 21 years at a rent which they know in a number of years may not be adequate and may not possibly reflect the market value of the property.  The result is that in some cases the law is being strained and the initial rent being granted is too high for the current time but it is trying to compensate for the inevitable fall of money during the years ahead. That is just one example of the way in which the law is deficient at the moment and in which it has been deficient now for some time.  The change that was proposed in the Bill which was introduced last year was <Col N="218" /> recommended by the Landlord and Tenant Commission nearly a decade ago now.  Other substantial changes were recommended.  The need for them was present when the Commission reported and the need is still there and is even more urgent now. I appeal to the Minister to bring forward that part of that Bill at the very earliest opportunity, and to indicate to the House what his intentions are in relation to it.</P>

      <P>Speaking as one who has been in public politics about ten or 12 years, I have always favoured any effort that might be made to bring about an end to the ground rent system.  It is a bit tiresome to have to listen to the last speaker, Senator Cooney, engaging in what I can only describe as party politics, in relation to who had got there first, or to who is the best.  My recollection is that Senator Cooney's party did not decide on this question until the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition did so immediately before the last local elections in 1974.  However, I am not interested in that sort of scoring.  I hope we will see less of it in the Seanad.  As far as I can recollect, from studying the Bill, this Bill has a number of additional powers that were not in the previous Bill.  When one considers that the three political parties were in agreement on proposals to end the creation of ground rents, whatever the difficulties about ending ground rents as such, it still might have been through the Dáil and Seanad a couple of years ago. It can be described as a notable social advance.  There is no question that the whole system of ground rents was and is socially undesirable, if not to some degree morally wrong.  This step, as well as the Bill now in the other House, could be regarded as a step forward out of the bad old days of landlordism and rack-renting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One should not discount totally the advantages that existed in that type of leasehold system.  There was, for instance, control over bad or undesirable developments.  I, as one who would have preferred to see development at that time being controlled by a public planning authority, rather than by <Col N="219" /> what one would describe as the well-meaning paternalism of landlords, have to acknowledge that some of the buildings we are looking at, and some of the squares around us here, are something worth while, and that perhaps if the leaseholds had not existed and commercial interests could have exploited these areas 50 to 100 years ago, we might not have the very fine squares or even the very fine road system of old Dublin that exist.  Although I am not paying tribute to the older system, it did have some advantages. It is therefore all the more important that once one is hopefully looking at a new era in which all ground renting will be ended, we as a socially-conscious community should keep in mind through our locally elected representatives, that good order and planning are all the more necessary for environmental purposes.  There is no question about underlying motives behind this.</P>
    <P>An individual should have the right not only to the ownership of his or her home but the right to be able to dispose of it freely without any restrictions. The very fact that you did have in the old law the right conferred on a landlord to take over a house because the ground rent was not being paid is something which I am sure would be objected to strenuously by all of us even though the courts in all probability would not have upheld that right.  Nevertheless, it is a good thing to see that the way is becoming clear towards complete freehold ownership of homes and the ground under the homes.  One can point to some advantages on the equity side and possibly earlier advantages in the same way in regard to the use of property as a security, not so much for the creation of money as for the creation or the development of enterprise.  In that sense the situation that we are coming into now may put individuals in a better position to engage in enterprise themselves.  In the old days when you had a house on which there was a pretty substantial ground rent and you went to the bank with it you were less likely to get the form of security that you wanted than if the <Col N="220" /> houses was entirely your own to dispose of as you wished.  I expect that under the old system ground rents in bulk became probably a significant element in the creation of security. One might almost describe it as the creation of money in a sense.  That was one of the things that was socially undesirable about it, but it may have had its values in that sense also.</P>
    <P>I am not competent to deal with all the technical areas that the Minister has dealt with but I certainly welcome this Bill.  I welcome the other Bill that is going through the House.  I would have to point out of course, because of the amount of misunderstanding and misrepresentation that there has been over this issue generally, a Chathaoirleach, that the problem has not been a lack of desire to end the obnoxious ground rent: the problem has been how to end it in a way that was not going to cost the taxpayer very many millions of pounds.  Under our present system of law the Government in office have not the power simply to draw a pencil through the legal right of people to property.  That is why it was quite wrong to suggest that we, at the last election, promised to abolish ground rents.  We did undertake&mdash;and I was a member of the committee which sat and discussed this question&mdash;to introduce a means that would help to bring about an end to ground rents.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not among those of whom I am speaking now so his interruption is not going to help in any way.  The fact of the matter is that ground rents have to be removed by some means or other and the public authority or the Government is not in a position to do so of its own free will without costing the taxpayer very many millions of pounds. However, that is not an issue that I should be dealing with here at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> I would like again to welcome this Bill.  It is a social step forward and I would look forward to other steps coming from the other House into this House along the same lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Members of the Seanad are prepared to welcome any measure which is directed towards the removal or preventing of ground rents, and therefore we welcome this Bill because it will prevent the creation of new ground rents on private dwellings.  However, I think that it is necessary, despite Senator Brugha's sensitivity in the matter, to refer to the introductory speech of the Minister which must inevitably spark off a certain bitterness or resentment. That speech was lacking in a degree of honesty which the Seanad should come to expect.  It did not refer to the fact that in January, 1977, a Bill was introduced which would have accomplished the purpose of this Bill, and which would also have accomplished the much broader purpose of the reform of the landlord and tenant code.  I really do think that it is&mdash;to say the least of it&mdash;strange that the Minister should appear to take such satisfaction at introducing a Bill in the Seanad that he claims marks such a &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; step.  Why have we waited over a year unnecessarily for this measure to be received by Members of this House and received without any dissent on the principle of it?</P>
      <P>As the first Labour Party Member to speak, I, too, wish to refer to the historical situation and to record what Senator Cooney has already referred to, the fact that a Bill was introduced by Deputy Seán Dunne of the Labour Party over 17 years ago, in 1961, which would have gone further than the Bill which we are considering here today and further than the Bill which the Minister is at present, I understand, putting through the other House. This was the Ground Rents (Prohibition and Extinction) Bill 1961.  It was introduced by Deputy Seán Dunne in November, 1961, and is referred to in the Conroy Commission on Ground Rents which reported in 1964.  At page 17 of that report the provisions of the Bill are summarised as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> In November, 1961, Deputy Dunne moved for leave to introduce a Bill dealing with ground rents. The Bill provided that:</P>
    <P>(1)  After the date of the passing of the Bill it would be illegal to create a new ground rent;</P>
    <P>(2)  After the passing of the Bill a tenant would have the right to purchase a ground rent from his ground landlord at a sum not greater than 15 times the normal ground rent which the tenant was liable to pay;</P>
    <P>(3)  Any amount paid by the tenant as ground rent prior to the passing of the Bill should be taken into account in the purchase price of the ground rent.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cooney said, that Bill was refused a First Stage.  In other words leave to introduce it was refused.  It was never even allowed to be printed and discussed, and at that time in 1961 Fianna Fáil were in power and could have allowed the Bill into the Dáil even for the purposes of discussion of the principles or they could have put it forward themselves at that time. This must be put on record when the Minister purports to come into this House in a way that suggests that somehow this was a novel and fundamental idea that Fianna Fáil had suddenly thought of, rather than the reality that Fianna Fáil has delayed by over a year the debate in this House on precisely the same point and principle which was contained in sertion 108 of the Bill tabled by Senator Cooney when Minister for Justice under the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Senators who have spoken in opposing on principle the system of holding land on the basis of ground rents.  For historical reasons this is an alien system which we inherited, and which runs counter to our very strong cultural identity with land and desire that the ownership of land should be in the actual householder, the person living in the house, and that the person is not merely the owner of the bricks and mortar with somebody else owning the ground itself.  It is undesirable from that <Col N="223" /> historical perspective and it is socially undesirable because it provides a system of unearned income <i>in perpetuum</i> for the landlord and his successors and heirs.  One other undesirable aspect of it was that in very many cases the payments are made to non-citizens, to absentee landlords or to non-residents&mdash;perhaps payments have to be made to Irish companies somewhere else in the country&mdash;but in any case the system is one where the person, instead of having the full ownership of the land, has to go on paying this ground rent.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Brugha's point that at a certain stage, in the last century and at the turn of the century, there were some positive functions of a landlord under the system and there could be good estate management implied in it, but I think that those considerations no longer weigh at all.  To begin with, most of the functions that would have been functions of the landlord in good estate management are now functions of the local authority, and, secondly, we have had too much experience in recent building of estates, since the war, of cases where the landlord has not fulfilled even the most basic covenants and where spaces which should have been developed as propor play areas or park areas are left neglected.  Cases which green spaces in the building estates were left as eyesores, left in a very bad state and have actually been a source of contention because they are not the responsibility of the local authority, they are the responsibility of the landlord and the landlord has not been prepared to fulfil the basic functions of estate management.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the worst evils of the ground rents system has been the abuse of the system where the tenant has sought to apply for permission to carry out structural alterations. If there is to be a change of user, for example, which requires structural alterations then there have been cases where the landlord has refused permission unless a fine or special penalty is first paid.  This is a very undesirable further imposition on the householder in the particular circumstances, and it is the type of <Col N="224" /> abuse which can arise when we have a system of land holding of this sort.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should look carefully at the possibility of any adverse effect of this measure by rendering void any attempt to create future ground rents might have by way of increase in the cost of housing.  I would be inclined to agree with the Minister's argument here, that the manner of purchase of a house is usually by way of mortgage or loan, and what in reality affects the house purchaser is not the initial sum but rather the total of the repayments over a substantial period, and that on that basis it might be possible to argue that in fact the prohibition on the creation of future ground rents will not have any significant effect on house prices.  But I would maintain that it should have no effect at all, and that great care should be taken to ensure that there is no adverse effect on house prices.  I believe there are broader issues underlying this.  Very often one of them is that the price of the site has a lot to do with what the ultimate price of the house will be; and I would like to ask the Minister present here today or preferably the Minister for Justice if he is able to reply to this debate to indicate whether it is proposed to have control of the price of sites and whether the speculative profits that are made in this area are a matter which the Government intends to try to control, because otherwise it will be very difficult to prevent the escalation of house prices apart from local authority houses.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister in his reply to indicate whether he intends to introduce control of rents on the purchase of flats in multiple dwelling buildings?  These were excluded from the Bill which was introduced in January last, and they were excluded from this measure, but I would like to know whether the Minister has in mind a measure to control the fact that a person purchasing a flat, which is as much that person's home as a house on its own is a home for other people, has to pay a rent and the payment of the rent is, I think, very analogous to the payment of a ground rent in relation to individual <Col N="225" /> private dwellings.  Although I can see reasons why because of the complexity of the situation it might have to be tackled separately I think it is an issue which should be tackled without delay.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Cooney in asking when the whole reform of the landlord and tenant code and the other provisions which were in the Bill introduced in January last here will be reintroduced into the Dáil and Seanad?  I ask this in particular because I think that landlord and tenant law has become far too complex and far too difficult for the consumer, for the ordinary citizen, to understand. If a citizen wants to understand it that citizen must go and avail of the advice of a solicitor.  This is particularly inequitable in a situation where we do not have a comprehensive system of civil legal aid and advice because it is only those who can afford to seek the advice of a solicitor in relation to their rights&mdash;in relation to what steps they can take&mdash;who are in fact protected by the law.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise this dimension, that in this area of landlord and tenant there are very serious problems affecting people who do not have private means, who do not have money to seek the professional advice of a solicitor and pay for that advice.  When the Pringle Report on civil legal aid is published&mdash;and one understands that that is imminent&mdash;I think it is very important that discussion on civil legal aid does not narrowly focus on areas of family law.  This area of landlord and tenant, of people's property rights, is just as important for those in need of legal advice, who need help with the very complexity and technicality of pyramids of interests and of the type of language used in relation to landlord and tenant law&mdash;the whole code.  These people need advice in this area at least to the same extent as they also need advice in the area of family law.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is extremely important that the attitude is not taken that somehow family law will be selected as a pilot scheme or isolated in some limited way as being an area where the Government will be prepared to introduce <Col N="226" /> some limited scheme of civil legal aid.  I believe that the principle is one based on justice, on equality before the law, on the fundamental principle of access to advice, access to our courts for a remedy in a situation, and that it cannot be confined artificially to areas of family law, not even on the basis of the greater need in the area of family law.  There is just as much need in particular cases for untangling the legal complexity affecting a person's home, affecting a person's right to live somewhere, affecting a person's right to provide the family with a roof over their heads, in a particular place.</P>
    <P>This measure is in itself one which the Labour Party welcomes.  It is one small step along the way for which Sean Dunne lit the light in 1961, and we would also be prepared to welcome the other measure which is going through the Dáil as a second step, but I urge the need for a much more radical and comprehensive approach to reform in the area of landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped when I decided to speak on this Bill that one could say that it was very largely an agreed Bill, and I would hope that to a very great extent the principles underlying it are indeed principles on which we could agree on all sides of this House.  The Bill itself may be a very complicated one but there are fundamental and basic principles involved.  I would regard this Bill as a necessary step towards the clarification of the whole question of land ownership and the elimination of landlordism as a factor in regard to private dwelling houses, people's homes.  It is necessary that as a first step, we abolish or prevent the possibility of further ground rents being set up.  It is a necessary initial measure in what is going to be a difficult and complicated subject.  It will not be easy to fully abolish ground rents&mdash;there are aspects of the Constitution and many other factors involved&mdash;but it is the direction in which we should move because we are dealing with one of the absolute fundamentals as regards a person's private life and one's wealth and ownership in general.  It was freely recognised until the industrial revolution <Col N="227" /> that land was the basis of wealth. In actual fact today the value and importance of land are even greater than they were then, except that perhaps the importance has tilted towards the ownership of land in cities and urban areas generally rather than in the rural connotation which previously existed. To a large extent land is still the basis of wealth.</P>
      <P>As regards this and many countries landlordism has been very much the curse.  A large part of our history has been the gradual unravelling of landlordism, but we have thought about it almost entirely in the context of farm land, of people owning their own land, their farms.  Perhaps today the emphasis should be on the ownership of people's homes.  No person truly owns his home if he does not own the land on which it is built.  That person is still effectively a tenant, owning just the bricks and mortar.  I would hope that just as landlordism in rural areas has been at long last abolished so, in due course, landlordism in our cities, suburban areas and towns will also be abolished and people will really own their own homes.</P>
      <P>Irish land law, as I understand it with only a layman's knowledge&mdash;no doubt I will be quickly corrected if I am in error&mdash;has four main bases, first, English statute law, secondly, English common law; thirdly, Irish statute law and fourthly, Irish common law.  English common law&mdash; and again I am open to correction on this matter&mdash;is really grounded on the feudal system.  This system, however, bears a very different meaning here to that pertaining in England.  The feudal system was basically a relationship between landlord and tenant which was intended to be and, perhaps, in historical times very often was a beneficial relationship.  The feudal relationship here in so far as it existed at all was entirely one of benefit to the landlord and to the negation of any benefit to the tenant from whom the land had often been confiscated in the first place.  Nonetheless, it still forms, to some extent, a basis of our Irish land law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second basis of Irish land law is <Col N="228" /> English statute law, including laws passed at Westminster and relating to Britain and Ireland and those relating solely to Ireland.  A third basis is Irish statute law.  Irish statute law relates not only to the laws we are passing today and those laws which are passed in Northern Ireland but to all those laws I understand passed between 1310 and 1800 by the old Irish Parliament.</P>
    <P>Then there is the Irish common law with its various principles and so on introduced by judges and conveyances and relating primarily to Irish conditions and the Irish situation.</P>
    <P>If we review these four bases of law, whatever about the fourth one, Irish common law, the other three&mdash; the English feudal system, the statutes passed at Westminster and the statutes passed by the Irish Parliament between 1300 and 1800&mdash;almost all these laws were inimical to the interests of the vast majority of people living here. I say this advisedly because in many ways&mdash;no doubt distinguished legal Senators will quickly correct me if I am wrong&mdash;I understand that one of the features of the law of landlord and tenant is that throughout the ages it has almost invariably been made by the landlord rather than by the tenant.  So, we not only suffer from this general principle of landlord and tenant law but we also suffer from the fact that three out of the four basic elements of our law are all elements loaded against the Irish people as a whole.</P>
    <P>Historically, the English related this to the countryside through farmers owning their own land.  Of course, it applies equally well to the city dweller today, and it is an anomalous and ridiculous system that people should still be obliged to pay ground rent to landlords on the basis of confiscations made throughout the centuries.  It is high time we finished it but it may be very difficult technically to do this.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of this Bill which I think one must welcome very wholeheartedly is the support it gives to the principle of home ownership.  This is an excellent feature.  The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing it in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> As the Minister has pointed out, one of the few possible bases for maintaining the position with regard to ground rents could be related to the maintenance of amenities and so on. Until recently it used to be argued that with a leasehold relationship the state of buildings, what was done with them as regards amenities and so on could be, to some extent, controlled.  This is a very dubious and patronising attitude and certainly with present day planning laws it is completely outmoded and there is no longer any possible justification that I can see in it.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of which we must take a great deal of cognisance because it affects everybody, and that is the absolute certainty of legal title and the expense relating to that.  Buying one's house is probably the major purchase any one person or one family make in their lifetime.  This Bill is a good step in ensuring that a person will have full legal title to his home and that he will really own his home and the land on which it is built.  The law is so complicated in relation to home-ownership and housing generally that I hope the Minister will bear in mind the considerable expense which people feel naturally obliged to enter into when buying a house.  It is already the greatest expenditure of money that most people are involved in, and it is very sad that on top of that they should have to safeguard their investment by paying very high expenses in order to ensure that they have a clear legal title to their premises.  I hope that this is something we can look at in the general context of the abolition of ground rents and of house ownership.  It will be much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I am very glad also that any attempts to circumvent the abolition of ground rents have been carefully examined and I hope effectively prevented. It is most important that no loopholes be left through which speculators and others could evade the purposes of this Act.  The situation with regard to builders who <i>bona fide</i> have purchased land over which difficulties might arise as regards giving houses in fee simple were their position not covered, has been, I am glad to see <Col N="230" /> looked after, as has also the position of any innocent sub-lessees.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental principle and an excellent innovation&mdash;on which I hope most Members of this House, perhaps not all, would agree&mdash;is that it should now become possible for people in local authority housing to buy their own houses, not only the bricks and mortar, but the house as a home which they would truly own under the safeguards which the Minister has mentioned.  This is a fundamental change which will have beneficial effects for generations to come.</P>
    <P>This is a necessary, beneficial, and civilised Bill and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>Listening to the kind of genteel exchange of artillery from both sides of the House earlier brought my attention to the realistic facts behind this Bill and what has made it possible.  With the sense of grievance from the Opposition that they had not brought in the Bill in their time and the justifiable complacency and satisfaction from the Government for having brought it in&mdash;and they have to get credit for that&mdash;it struck me that in fact the hero of this little drama is not Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, but inflation.  Consider the figures, beginning with what obtained in 1967 when Deputy Lenihan, then Minister for Justice, thought of bringing in this measure and when £250 would buy out a £20 ground rent, and then look at what would now be the case.  At that time £250 would buy out a £20 ground rent for all time, and it is searingly evident that it was not opportune to bring this in in 1967 and it is opportune to bring it in now.  Even though ground rents have been a burning question down through the years, they are less a burning question in genuine financial terms now than before.  At this moment we know there are a lot of ground landlords not even bothering to hunt up the £6 or £12 or £20 annual rent that is due to them.  In many cases that I meet in the course of my day inflation has so eaten into the value of ground rent that it is no longer, in terms of finance, a terribly important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a meritorious Bill and I <Col N="231" /> welcome it as much as anybody else welcomes it.  Its merits have to do with two things: firstly, what the Minister himself stressed, that is the emotional force of the Bill.  A man or woman likes to own his or her house outright, not just the bricks and the mortar but what is under foot as well. The satisfaction of owning something <i>in toto</i> is profound satisfaction to both the peasant and the bourgeois mind, and largely our mentality is dominated by these two states of consciousness. There may be the odd aristocratic spirit among us, and that of course does not rule out the desire for property or ownership either.  In a country largely composed of small property owners it is very, very satisfactory for someone eventually to buy his ground rent even for what is now a rather derisory sum and say: &ldquo;I own the whole thing.&rdquo;  The emotional appeal of the Bill is admirable.  There is a lovely sense of reassurance about the phrase &ldquo;total ownership&rdquo;.  The Government are to be justly congratulated on having introduced it.  It is a matter of only six or nine months between the two contending parties, but the present Government have almost brought off this part of it.  There is a trilogy of Bills involved, as the Minister has said, so we look forward to the other consignments in this general package.</P>
    <P>The second satisfaction I get from the Bill and the second palpable, clear advantage of the Bill is the neatness of it.  It is legally a neat Bill.  A good deal of what Senator Robinson referred to as &ldquo;that pyramid of interests accumulating on the lawyer's desk&rdquo; has been abolished at a stroke so that Seán Citizen knows that when he is buying something he can buy it outright. That incredible jungle of circumstance, of searches and documents of all kinds that the most simple of people have to go through when they want to purchase a house, at least has been reduced to this extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Just another Act to read?  I do not quite get the full force <Col N="232" /> of the Senator's interjection.  In any case it seems to me rather neater. There are a lot of lawyers on this side of the House, of course, and there is the sense of treading on sacred if not indeed dangerous ground when one begins to hold forth on this subject at all.  The ordinary man not thus equipped can at least understand that he can own something absolutely. That is an absolute value and advantage in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The way the Bill has come about makes one contemplate a little wryly the whole democratic process.  At this moment for most people in terms of money the difference between, say, paying £20 <i>ad infinitum</i> yearly and paying £200 now is hardly worth talking about.  For instance, inflation has literally halved the value of ground rents in five years.  What will it have done in another five years?  You can imagine a lovely vista where you can see your £20 disappearing over the horizon, becoming worth £15 then £10 and so on, and in 20 years' time it will be a speck in the distance which you can contemplate with a certain satisfaction.  If you compensate yourself by buying the holding out now, you get the emotional satisfaction of saying: &ldquo;It is not hanging around me any more.&rdquo;  You miss the drama of the diminishing £20 note as it goes down through the years.  You cannot win on every side.  That is why history has caught up with this measure.  It was not opportune to adopt it previously.  No Government seemed anxious to take it on, no matter what is said on both sides of the House, until now when it has become comparatively painless.  That is not to take from the genuine satisfaction which the Government should feel in regard to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill is a bit of a thorn beneath the rose.  There is a sting in the tail no matter what one does.  Senator Robinson asked if there was any way of preventing developers from building this loss into their prices. Have the Government control of the price of development land for housing now?  Will it increase now that the developers cannot look forward to their annual accumulation of small <Col N="233" /> sums from each householder on an estate?  I am sure I will be corrected if I am wrong in this matter, but Senator Conroy's facts seemed to be sufficiently well researched to be impregnable to the very formidable attack building up on this side of the House, and he seemed certain, as I am, that there is no way in which you can stop a man putting up the price of his land and waiting for the market to come along and bid for it.  He will sell at what he can.  One of the disadvantages of this Bill will be an initial disadvantage of the price of houses going up.</P>
    <P>Inevitably the developers will build that loss of ground rent into their initial cost, and that is going to be a disadvantage, particularly for people who are now at their wits' end trying to get a deposit.  One of the biggest human problems that exist for people buying houses at the moment is the accumulation of a sufficient deposit to enable them to start borrowing.  The rate of borrowing is large enough and the price of houses is high enough, but people are going to need a larger deposit.  As I said before, you cannot win.  The Government have had to balance one thing against the other and I think they made the right decision, but it is wrong to ignore the fact that one of the side issues of this Bill, apart from its inevitable spin-off, will be the fact that the prices of houses will go up a little if not a lot.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Bill which is worth considering is the whole question of flat dwelling.  Senator Robinson has asked for some means by which ground rent or its equivalent could be ex-pugned from that.  I cannot see how that can be done, but people living in and renting flats should be considered by the Government, who are looking in a fairly panoramic way at dealing with the question of house ownership and house purchase and all the related difficulties.  Society as it stands puts a great premium on owning one's own house.  One of the most poignant situations if one comes up against it is that of young couples who are living in flats and who are trying to get together a deposit for their house.  They are paying rent and that rent is disappearing <Col N="234" /> down the drain.  If they are paying out for five years it becomes an almost intolerable futility and a frustration for them.  They are trying to accumulate the means of buying a house on one hand and on the other they are paying out money which could very well go towards that end.</P>
    <P>I am putting as a solid suggestion to the Minister that people who are living in rented accommodation and paying out large money monthly or weekly for their rent could be allowed that amount somehow or other free from income tax.  The Government would either keep that tax remission or maybe invest it in a building society in the meantime, and when the couple come to buy a house the tax remission on what they have paid in rent could be available to them as a means of getting together a deposit on a new house.  If even a moderate gesture in that direction could be made there would be great spiritual gain for people in this position.</P>
    <P>I presume the philosophy behind this Bill is to make as many of our people as possible absolute owners of property and housing; to give them a larger stake in the country.  What I suggest would give a provisional stake in the country to people who are paying rent, in terms of frustration, futility and almost despair at the moment.  It would give them the hope that that rent would at some time accrue to them in a deposit.  Let the Government not give it back to them until there is absolute proof that the house is bought.  If that suggestion does not fall on fertile ground now I guarantee to put it forward again and again in the coming weeks, because the legislation coming up gives admirable, absolutely welcome, scope and hospitality to this kind of suggestion.</P>
    <P>Consequently I look forward to what the Minister referred to as a trilogy of Bills.  One of them is already available to us.  It is passing through the Dáil at the moment.  It is a trickier Bill than this one because it involves the buying out of existing rents and it is attended by a great number of problems.  The third Bill we have not had hard news about.  Perhaps <Col N="235" /> in the formation of that Bill I would urge on the Minister that he would bear in mind some of the points that I have made.  I compliment the Minister for having brought in the Bill, which it would be very hard to fault ultimately as humane, progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Martin seems to have two misconceptions and I would like to clear them at the start if I can.  One is that this Bill grants people absolute ownership of their houses.  It does no such thing. Secondly, he suggests that legally this is a neat Bill.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and if this Bill passes in its present condition it will prove to be a source of considerable income to solicitors and barristers.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the overall purpose of the Bill.  Enough has been said about that already and I do not propose to beat it any further, but it is a very difficult area, and when the Government, the Opposition and everybody decided that ground rents were an evil thing and must be abolished the parliamentary draftsmen were faced with the difficulty of how we are going to achieve this.</P>
      <P>A ground rent is claimed in a lease, and a lease is something that is fundamental to conveyancing in this country. Leases have uses far beyond the making of money by landlords.  Some of the proposals of this Bill could have consequences which are unforeseen at the moment.  The Bill can be primarily dealt with satisfactorily only at Committee Stage and I would urge the Minister not to press for that Stage to be taken today.  I am speaking now mainly as a solicitor and I can see problems that will inevitably present themselves if the Bill is passed in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the Senators who are not lawyers and who do not understand conveyancing it is worth while spelling out the method the draftsmen use to bring about the prohibition of future ground rents.  Basically the Bill says that if a lease contains a provision claiming ground rent the lease is void &mdash;not that provision claiming ground rent but the entire lease is void.  That <Col N="236" /> gives a situation in which a purchaser of a house who had taken a lease ends up in effect with nothing.  There is no ground rent, but there is no legal estate whatever vested in the person who is in effect the person whom this Act purports to protect.  The person is given the right to acquire the fee simple.  In other words he gets a lease which has provision for a payment of a ground rent in it.  This Act makes that lease void at that stage and if the tenant takes no step to put the situation right he has no legal title whatever. That is a very important point because you are dealing here with houses about 80 per cent of which are secured by mortgages and building societies are going to cause difficulties in respect of this provision.  You must consider as well the position of a person who is not familiar with the law and with the provisions of this new Act and who does nothing.  That person in effect will go on and on having no legal estate for his own house.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to conceive of a way in which one could define a ground rent and move from there and provide that no ground rent shall ever be permitted or that the creation of further ground rents would be prohibited. There was a proposal in the Dáil by Deputy O'Keeffe which provided that the provision claiming a ground rent would be rendered void.  The objection of the Minister for Justice to that was that he wanted to ensure that not only would a tenant not have to pay rent but that a tenant would have absolute ownership of his house, and the Minister made it clear that this Bill would in effect bring that about.  The Bill would not do that, because the definition of a lease under this Bill refers back to the 1967 Act and the 1967 Act in effect gave people the right to buy out the fee simple of their house, in other words to stop paying a ground rent.  On my reading of this Bill I think it is still possible to have a lease as such.  It would be an unusual lease that would not claim a ground rent, but it would be possible to transfer a property subject to covenants, and the Minister's hope that this Bill prohibits future transfers like that does not make <Col N="237" /> sense.  Furthermore it will be possible to make transfers in the future that, although not providing for a payment of a ground rent as such, could provide for recurrent monetary payments.  This could be by way of initial fine broken up into instalments and spread over a period, but I am convinced that rent charges or other some quite unusual legal animals will present themselves on lawyers' desks in the future and ways and means of getting round this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I am fully in agreement with the stated purpose of the Bill, but I do not believe it can achieve that.  Some points that arise in the few sections in the Bill concern me.  I would like to mention them and perhaps the Minister could indicate whether anything can be done about them.  Senator Cooney made a very important point.  Section 2 (3) provides that where a lease is made after this Act and at some stage subsequent to the granting of the lease a dwellinghouse is built on the land the lease becomes void.  That is a good thing if we are talking simply and purely about a building site designed for a dwellinghouse but I wonder about this.  For example a person leases a field to a company who propose to build a factory on the site and who propose not to erect dwelling houses on it at all.  After that lease is made the people who are the lessees under the lease may erect a dwellinghouse on the land, for a foreman or perhaps for the devious means of forcing their getting their right to the fee simple.  That could happen under subsection (3).  There should be some saver for the exclusion of leases of land that are not intended to be used for the purpose of the erection of dwelling-houses.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (4) provides that a person who has purchased a lease that is void under subsection (1) has the right to acquire the fee simple, but subsection (3) also provides that leases shall be void in certain circumstances but does not grant any right to the person caught under that subsection to acquire a fee simple.  There seems to be a lacuna there somewhere which needs correction.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cooney's point <Col N="238" /> about the one-year limitation that relates to developers who have planning permission at this stage having the right to acquire the fee simple.  The period of one year in which they have the right to exercise that right is not sufficient.  I can see problems arising. Sometimes it takes quite some time to get planning permission.  They may not have planning permission now and it may take them six or eight months before they get it.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider that matter and even go further than the two years suggested by Senator Cooney and perhaps make it three years.  I do not think it is going to create any problems if there is a longer period given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Difficulty is inevitably presented by legislation such as this while you are bringing about such a big change in our law.  There is a system which is widespread in Dublin where a developer who is building an estate himself and who owns the land or who has an arrangement with the person who owns the land does two things with a proposed house purchaser. The first is he enters into a building contract with a person which relates purely to the building of the house.  The second is he enters into an agreement with that person to give him a lease of the land when the house is actually built; so there are two contracts involved.  One is the contract to build the house and the other is the contract to grant a lease when the house is built.  I can see a little problem arising.  If for example I entered into that type of arrangement with a builder a month ago and this Bill becomes law at some stage in the near future but before the house is built, one of my two contracts will be completed at that stage, namely the erection of the house, and I will have paid my money, but the other contract is a contract to grant a lease that is now void under this Act and therefore that contract would in itself be void.  I have no protection under this Bill; there is <Col N="239" /> nothing that says to me that if I hold such a contract at the moment I will have the right not only to my lease but to the fee simple.  There is no saver in this at all for existing contracts, and I could be left in a situation where I could have paid for a house and never have the right to get even a lease of the ground, never mind the fee simple.  I think that requires to be looked at.</P>
      <P>There is a whole pile of landlord and tenant legislation on our books at the moment.  There is more of it coming and, as the Minister quite rightly said, this is a very difficult Bill to read because of its references to Acts one way or the other.  I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister for Justice that some codification be done in relation to all our landlord and tenant legislation.  It would be very well worth while.  I know this codification of laws frequently causes difficulties, but in an area as complex and difficult as this it is an exercise well worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I must welcome the Bill. Landlords have been taking money for years that they were not entitled to, because when the person purchased the house the landlord got his money back out of it and therefore they have been getting more than their fair share.  Any measure that would do something about rectifying a situation like that to some degree must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The land on which a house is built is a consumer product.  The goods that are within the house are consumer products, and in my view the purchaser of the house is entitled to the ownership of the ground on which the house stands and which surrounds it.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill in the Labour Party because we believe that the private ownership of land has led to serious inequalities.  There is no real desire and never has been on any Government's part, whether the Government we were in or otherwise, to follow the philosophy that the land that makes up this island is the most basic asset we possess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the description &ldquo;consumer goods&rdquo; arises, and it should <Col N="240" /> never be left open to speculation by individuals and institutions.  We consider this morally wrong.  On some occasions we have individuals buying land as a hedge against inflation, as a means of avoiding tax.  It is not just individuals: we have also had institutions doing it, and this is why we believe that any type of legislation that heads in a direction whereby consumer goods which the private person owns are protected is to be welcomed</P>
    <P>The community must have more control over the development and the distribution of this basic asset.  Our lack of control in the past over the ownership of agricultural land, for example, in the hands of the wrong people, has meant inequalities and lack of productivity in the industry of agriculture.  If rural land is held by people who will not primarily invest in agricultural production, then there is an inequality and it affects the productivity levels of agriculture as a whole.</P>
    <P>I say quite bluntly that we in the Labour Party appreciate and welcome any step that tends towards correcting any imbalances in society.  We see an imbalance in the field affected by the Bill, and we believe that though the Bill may have its weaknesses and the solicitors may be able to argue and tear it to pieces and put forward proposals and so on, we still see it as a step in the direction of adjusting an. imbalance in society.  Things like this will always be well received by us because we believe in a system that says that every citizen has a right to own any consumer goods as distinct from a citizen who favours a few controlling them.  I look forward to Bill No. 2 as a further development in the erosion of the inequalities.  I will not go so far as to say that I hope Bill No. 3 will produce a comprehensive community land Act&mdash;I think that would be a little too much to expect.  I am not saying that in a sarcastic way: I am saying it because I believe that some day we will have to get around to that if we want to do something about controlling this very basic asset.  We look forward to any Bill that heads in the direction of putting the controls of our land in the hands of the community.  I <Col N="241" /> am not saying this Bill does it.  No. 2 Bill may not do it, but possibly inevitable developments will lead to a very comprehensive land Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the Seanad.  As everyone has said, we welcome the general idea behind this in so far as it is meeting a need which is being expressed for what is in it, and essentially any point that I would want to make on it would be made an Committee Stage&mdash;a point which has been made by other people. I thought it would be right, though, to draw attention now to a matter that I think the Minister's mind must be redirected to.  That is the question of the effect of the planning code as being a totally satisfactory substitute for the covenants which existed in leases.  At this point I do not want to get involved in regard to the enforcement of positive covenants where these, are conveyances of freeholds as distinct from the incidental creation of leaseholds. However, at this stage I would simply advise the Minister to reexamine and satisfy himself entirely that the provisions for the enforcement of a proper scheme for development in the planning code will be a full substitute for what at present arises under covenants in leases.  I know the Minister's mind is made up on the abolition of leases&mdash;there is no point in wasting time on that; it is the principle of the Bill and I will not argue whether it is right or wrong&mdash;it is not at this point my concern&mdash;but if we are to stop the creation of leases, and I accept one cannot make progress unless one does, we may have to consider some statutory provision to deal with the maintenance of covenants, particularly positive covenants in freehold property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have a situation otherwise where the development of the land will simply be sterilised.  Let us take a man living in a house in which he is reasonably comfortable.  He can control the area around him.  He may consider development if he could be assured that any development of the land he is prepared to release can be controlled by him, that it will not be a question of the planning authority controlling <Col N="242" /> it: in other words, he must be assured that the amenities will be preserved in the way that he wants. There is only one way in which he can do that, by a covenant enforceable not merely against the people with whom he will make the contract but against their successors in time, indefinitely.  As a totally unintended effect of this Bill we may have some land capable of development, providing dwellinghouses for the people, not developed because of the inadequacy in our law with regard to this question of covenant.</P>
    <P>As I said, I will not go into detail on the thing, but to summarise it very simply, a negative covenant to prevent somebody doing something would seem to be enforceable on the old Leicester Square case of 1848, but the positive covenant which will involve the expenditure of money by the keeping of something in repair, for example, is only enforceable if it is incidental to a lease.  There has been a development in British law with regard to this which is not at all certain to be followed, and when we are abolishing leases we ought to put in some statutory provision to make quite sure that these positive covenants can be enforced as well as negative covenants.</P>
    <P>That is the main point I wanted to direct the Minister's mind to at this stage.  When we get to Committee Stage he may have thought further about it.  During the debate we have talked about the advantages of home ownership, pride and satisfaction about owning what you have.  That is all connected to the fact that you look after your own better than you look after the bench in the park.  You do not own that.  You look after the chair in your own kitchen better than you would look after the bench in a park. Likewise, the man who is developing property which is near his property is much more likely to look after the enforcement of the amenity provision than a town planning authority whose officers may live five to ten miles from the place.  That is of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>The second point is one of principle arising out of something the Minister <Col N="243" /> said.  We ought not to be saying that a Bill like this was introduced in January 1977 and that wise people ought to have arrangements and have known that provisions against the creation of leaseholds would become law.  There were lots of things proposed in January 1977 that have not become law and that will never become law, and if people are to be burdened with the commercial responsibility of following every proposal of every political party in or out of Government and to be caught if they do not make the right decision about them, I think that is wrong.  The principle ought to be that when the law is changed it is at that point only that the people have got to look at the law.  The proposals in this Bill might never become law.  Before the Bill has been signed by the President, Leinster House may be hit by a bomb.  These are still only proposals.  While they remain proposals, the law that allows the creation of leaseholds remains until the day the President signs this Bill if it is passed by this House.</P>
    <P>Contracts with regard to leaseholds ought to be saved from the provisions of this Bill in the meantime.  Otherwise it will have consequences that nobody can work out.  There is nobody in a position in this House to say that there are no contracts for the sale of properties by way of lease in existence at this moment which will not be at existence at the time this Bill is enacted.  If there are such contracts, and leases cannot be made pursuant to such contracts because such leases will be rendered void, there must be a saving of the situation of people who have shifted their whole position.  The real sufferer in this situation may not be the builder, who may have got part of his money already through temporary finance provided by the banks. The real person who may suffer in this may be the buyer of the house who may be held up without an estate to offer to a building society to secure a mortgage.  He may be held up for a very long time if the position of the builder is that he cannot grant the fee simple.  This right may take the purchaser a long time to assume: there may be grandchildren living in <Col N="244" /> Australia on whom notice must be served.  Meanwhile he has laid out his money on the acquisition of a house without any title to it, burdened with the heavier interest charges of temporary finance piling up all the time without any repayment schedule.</P>
    <P>There ought to be a saver for that situation.  It is likely that the number of situations like that will be small but it does not matter if there is only one or two or ten, I know positively that there are many more than a few &mdash;there must be people who still do not know very much about this.  You would be astonished how little our proceedings are followed by people who are busy in their own businesses, and we ought to take every step to save the delays for people who have purchased their first house so that they are not held up by our failing to provide for that situation.</P>
    <P>There are other points which can be dealt with on Committee.</P>

      <P>We will deal with that point too when I come to it, but on the question of political will the Senator mentioned that this matter has been lying on the stocks for a year since January 1977.  The reality there, as she well knows, is that Fianna Fáil were not in power for six of those 12 months.  Consequently the Senator's then association with Fine Gael obviously did not bear fruit in the six months that she could be vicariously responsible for them.  I know the association between Fine Gael and Labour has now more or less broken up and they do not want to think about the past&mdash;they want to go on in their separate ways.  That is a matter for the Senator, but if she talks about honesty in the presentation of my statement she might also be honest with herself and the House in her remarks.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney mentioned the conversion of Fianna Fáil.  There was no suggestion of a sudden shaft of light in relation to this legislation.  Fianna Fáil always have been a socially conscious party.  We do not have to have the present day sophisticates who presumably suddenly have become aware of their responsibilities in relation to the community coming to tell us what our responsibilities are.  This is a form of gradualism: we are now reaching the point where we feel it is proper to introduce this type of legislation and there is no question of a conversion to the legislation or of political expediency, which was suggested by Senator Cooney.  I fail to see the point of that unusually unintelligent reference to political expediency.  I would have given the Senator more credit than to have made it.</P>

      <P>I know the Senators present themselves as a very civilised and unusual race of politicians, and may be they find that a TD coming down from the other House is a crude intrusion on their normally civilised way of dealing with legislation. In my own way I must answer these charges and if I do it in a less than urbane fashion by the standards required in the Seanad, please forgive me, but answer the charges I intend to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney, in the more constructive part of his speech, spoke on the question of extending the Bill to local authority houses.  It does not surprise me that he does not agree the Bill should be extended to local authority houses.  I would have thought that it is probably part of his political upbringing and philosophy that the less well-off sections of the community should be kept less well off and in all the circumstances I can understand his feeling in relation to that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the Bill at present in the course of passage in the other House and of a third Bill. They have been described by me as a trilogy.  The third in this pyramid of Bills will deal with consolidation and further amendments of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  I understand the Minister for Justice has promised that when this Bill and the Bill going through the other House have passed all stages he will come to grips with the more comprehensive consolidating <Col N="247" /> legislation, and we hope that the third part of this legislation will see the light of day some time before the summer recess.  They are the Minister's present plans in relation to the passage of this package of legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney argued that local authority tenants should not be included. I understand from my officials that this conflicts with a statement made in the Dáil earlier today on the No. 2 Bill, that had the 1977 Bill not lapsed it would have been amended by the former Minister for Local Government to include local authority tenants.  I would remind Senator Cooney that Deputy Fergus O'Brien in the Dáil this morning took a completely different line on the Bill; he expressed agreement that the Bill should cover local authority tenants. Maybe Fine Gael could get their policy straight as to whose attitude should prevail.  I might add that Dublin City Council requested the former Minister for Local Government to abolish all ground rents, including local authority rents.  The fears expressed by Senator Cooney about possible planning difficulties arising from the abolition of ground rents or local authority houses seem in all the circumstances of that request from the Dublin City Council, probably the largest single local authority in the country, to be groundless.  In that respect, and I suggest the request by the Dublin City Council to his former colleague, Deputy Tully, supports the legislation now before the House and the idea that local authority tenants should be included in the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from what Dublin City Council or others think, it appears to me to be absolutely socially very desirable that the law should not be selective, that it should apply right across the board.  If the law applies to people living in private housing estates, then I do not see why the same entitlement should not be provided for those living in local authority houses.  That seems to me to be a matter of equity and social justice.  That is why we have brought in this Bill, without any apology whatever.  We do not have to be supported by Dublin City Council, though that is persuade and helpful, <Col N="248" /> and we are grateful for Dublin City Council's views on the matter.  It is the basic philosophy of Fianna Fáil that we should have social justice applied right across the board.  That is the principle of this legislation dealing with ground rents.</P>
    <P>On section 2 (3) Senator Cooney raised the position of an assignee of a lease of land made after the Bill has become law.  The subsection refers to anybody who builds on land for a consideration. Senator Molony has promised to introduce an amendment to subsection (5), and if Senator Cooney does the same in relation to the earlier subsection, we can consider such proposals on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney referred to the comparative urgency to abolish ground rents now and some years ago&mdash;that some years ago ground rent abolition could have affected house prices materially.  There was a suggestion that builders might add the money they lose through this Bill into the purchase price of the house.  It would be a matter for the purchaser's legal adviser to ensure that the house has been reasonably valued, that the ground rent element has not been built in in a hidden manner.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney asked when the third and last of these Bills will be introduced. I stated that that would happen before the summer recess. I understand that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, considers that this Bill should be introduced as a matter of urgency in the light of the Supreme Court decision which re-stated the procedure to be adopted in fixing renewed occupational rent on a 21-year lease.  The Bill will be brought forward as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha made an excellent contribution, and correctly pointed out that the abolition of ground rents on dwelling houses has two aspects, one preventing the creation of future ground rents and the second dealing with the problem of existing ground rents, which is a separate question, being tackled in a separate Bill before the Dáil at the moment under the title of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill, 1977.</P>
    <P>To return to Senator Robinson's <Col N="249" /> contribution, I may state that the Ground Rents Commission was appointed in December 1961 to report substantially on the matters in Deputy Dunne's Bill.  The commission reported in 1964 and the first Ground Rents Act of 1967 followed.  As to the second point made by the Senator, this Bill accepts as policy that landlords control of amenities and so on should be replaced by control under planning legislation.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald also expressed concern on this matter and has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter on Committee Stage.  I would appreciate his views.  I very much appreciate the manner in which he put his point of view, and I appreciate his giving me notice of his intention thereby enabling us to deal in greater depth with his concern on the Committee Stage.  Senator Robinson raised the question of the control of the price of sites, and such control is not envisaged in the context of landlord and tenant legislation. As I pointed out in my speech, the proposals in this Bill cannot adversely affect the house purchaser.  In relation to legal aid for the house purchaser, we look forward to the publication of the Pringle Committee Report on civil legal aid.  Senator Robinson seems to think that this publication is imminent and seems to have a knowledge of the matter.  I cannot help her on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson inquired about the question of the control of house prices arising from the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents.  The Government introduced the scheme of £1,000 new house grants last July and consequently by definition the form of house price control which then applied to State-assisted houses and schemes of four or more houses was extended to all houses and flats for which the grant is now sought.  In that way one <Col N="250" /> can see that the control of house prices will be under review at all times.  Senator Conroy's very well-researched speech indicated knowledge of the law in an academic fashion but nevertheless interestingly traced the history of the land and land agitation from the beginning of time up to the present. Senator Conroy remarked on the manner in which urban land has increased in value relative to non-urban land, and pointed to the importance of this legislation which will enable house purchasers to acquire complete ownership of their sites.  The Senator's point about the legal costs of purchasing a house is strictly outside the scope of this Bill.  However, the No. 2 Bill contains proposals that Senator Conroy may find interesting in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin in his deep philosophical discourse on the whole question of land, a person's right to ownership, a person's personal involvement, full ownership of one's home and so on, expressed the need for some form of tax concession in relation to rented private accommodation. The £1,000 grant to first-time owner occupiers of houses is, it can be argued, designed to assist persons in the category the Senator mentions. However, I thoroughly agree with Senator Martin's point of view on this. I have been in politics for some years now, and one of the greatest hardships affecting young people wanting to buy their own homes for the first time is that they have to go into rented accommodation. They have to save hard and the money going for rented accommodation is literally going down the drain.  Senator Martin's proposal should be seriously examined by any concerned Government.  It is my intention to bring his point of view to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  It is a very fine point that crystalises speeches we have been making over the years on that subject. It is a very worth-while suggestion which I assure him will be examined in some depth.  I cannot say whether, at the end of the day, the suggestion will be taken up.  Matters of tax changes relating to the structural changes of the tax laws take a considerable amount of time.</P>
    <P>Nobody can refute what was said <Col N="251" /> by Senator Molony, who, I understand is a solicitor in his own right.  The Senator set out very clearly his views on the Bill, and obviously he has a very clear background knowledge of land law generally.  I would assure him that if he puts down an amendment to section 2, subsection (5) of the Bill, we will seriously consider the proposal to extend the one year to two years. This point was also made by Senator Cooney.  If they put down an amendment in their joint names I shall be glad to deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Alexis FitzGerald's question about notice of the possible production of the Bill, I accept his point that only when something becomes law should it be examined in relation to a person's problem and that we cannot deal with our day-to-day problems in anticipation of a proposal that may never see the light of day.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte seems to have a very basic, doctrinaire socialistic approach to the question of land.  I do not want to appear to be patronising or anything like that.  It would be an impertinence on my part even to attempt to do so. It is a rigid point of view which I could not altogether agree with.  There would probably be constitutional difficulties in relation to his general proposals. The Senator mentioned the possibility of introducing a comprehensive community land law legislation.  Senator Harte will find that much of what he desires in relation to landlord and tenant law will come with the consolidating Bill proposed by the Minister for Justice, which we hope will have its first reading or Second Stage in the Dáil before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>There is much more that I could add to the various points made.  I have no doubt that I have missed replying to a number of them.  There are three of four general areas of concern expressed by the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies. We have a fair assessment of the worth of the Bill.  I have no doubt that minor matters will be raised on the Committee Stage.  But when Opposition Deputies can only pick three or four major matters which would concern <Col N="252" /> them in relation to the legislative purity of the Bill the Bill is a good one.  Nobody has disagreed with the principle of the Bill, to abolish the creation of future ground rents on dwellinghouses. Once the spirit and the intention of the Bill is acceptable to the Seanad in a general way, we can be happy that it is a good Bill.  It will be received very well by those people to whom it is directed.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to section 17.  The section as drafted would have had the effect of removing the former penalty of forfeiture set up in section 2 (3) of the 1887 Act in addition to fine and imprisonment for cases involving trade description offences, though it would still have remained for other offences under the 1887 Act.  The implications of this have been further considered and it is clear that the power to forfeit offending goods is in some cases essential.  Even apart from its penal aspect it is sometimes necessary to withdraw goods from commercial circulation. This amendment is proposed, therefore, as it will mean that although the penalties of fine and imprisonment for trade description offences are all now substituted by those now provided; the position with regard to the forfeiture of goods as laid down in the earlier Acts will remain unchanged. Section 2 (3) and section 12 of the 1887 Act provide that a person guilty of an offence shall be liable to forfeit articles, instruments, and so on and the Court may order forfeited articles to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of.</P>

I am satisfied that the various points which I raised only for consideration have been objectively considered by the Minister.  I was not pressing any of them.  The main one, <Col N="254" /> relative to the amendment of the Principal Act, to which I gave a great deal of thought, totally daunted me as to how the draftsman could have done it any other way, unless we had a Trademark Bill at the same time, to cope with it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is unusual to speak on the Fifth Stage of any Bill, but I do so because of the importance of the Bill.  We are enacting what is a major change in our criminal law.  It is very many years since we had a change as widespread as this change in the law.  I suggest to the Minister, because of the inherent difficulty with which she was faced in relation to the drafting of the Bill, which makes it a difficult Bill even for lawyers to understand, lawyers in Ireland who in essence have not had an effective trade description code for the last half century, that she should consider publishing a guide to this Bill.  I know that there are problems for the executive in presenting what the executive understands any Bill, or Act as it then would be, to mean, but that should not make the Minister hesitate. Everyone in Ireland is a consumer and everyone will be affected by the change in this law.  Traders are consumers as well as the final purchasers, and they also will be affected.  It is exceedingly difficult to understand the Bill.  It would be a very worth-while job for the Minister to employ somebody with skills of the kind that lawyers do not normally have, to make things lucid, to produce a document which would give information to the consumer about what the Consumer Information Bill contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had determined to make this speech earlier today, and I went into my office and I happened to put my hand on a document on my desk entitled, Wildlife and the Law, a guide to the Wildlife Act, 1976, and I found that what I was proposing as something new has already in fact been done in relation to a much less important code than this one.  I know this is not quite the Minister's job, but the Minister can talk to other Ministers.  In relation to this and other what I call, legal legislation of this <Col N="256" /> kind, whenever, a new code comes in or a fundamental change is made consideration ought to be given at Government level to subsidising some young scholar to produce the Act with a commentary, elucidating it for practitioners. There is not one lawyer in 100 at the moment who knows a thing about trade descriptions law, and these are the people who will have to advise their clients with regard to it.  They cannot be expected to understand it by reference to the UK code, which is different in a number of respects.  They will need the guidance of study and study will not take place.  There is youth unemployment, and it would be a very useful employment of young skills, to get these young people to produce by subsidisation a work of this kind, which, incidentally, would not merely be of use to consumers.  If people intend making investments here, they will want to know the law on all sorts of things.  There should be some easy way whereby one could tell them what the trade description code here is.  They will not be as interested in the wildlife law as they will be in the trade descriptions code.  They are assisted at the moment by a guide produced by the IDA on the tax relief for export profits.  There should be a similarly lucid document available for them, so that they can obtain fast answers; they do not want to be held up for weeks while somebody down at the law library decides that this means something or other.  I strongly urge the Minister to take up my first suggestion, which would be within her competency, and to encourage the promotion of a study on the full meaning of this.</P>
    <P>Here we have a new code.  On the whole I welcome it.  I am unhappy about some aspects of it, such as this business about the history and contents of books.  I am unhappy about how that will work or about what is in mind.  I am a little unhappy about the invasion of privacy aspect of it, in relation to certain people, the endangering of confidentality, if people enforcing it get information which it really is important to keep secret.  On the whole it is a good measure worth enforcing.  There is no point in having a Bill unless it is enforced.  There must <Col N="257" /> be some scheme or structure for implementation.</P>
    <P>What will happen when the President signs this Bill?  There will be a director of consumer information and we will have the local authority enforcement officers.  Will additional people be taken on?  Will there be a method for training them?  Is there a booklet of instructions for them ready or when will it be ready?  The Bill comes into effect immediately.  How quickly will it be enforced?  I am pressing, now that we are getting a Bill, that it should not simply be a dead letter.  The Merchandise Marks Act which existed before has been a dead letter.  The existing code has been a dead letter for 50 years.  I could find only one case on it reported, in the 50 or 60 years since this State was founded.  We must see that this new code which is bringing up to date an important area of our laws is real, and that there will be an efficient, intelligent, wise and just system of administering it by the executive.  There are problems and we want to feel that they are not going to be fooled about what these problems are.  You have the sort of problem a doctor has in telling his patient what is wrong with him.  He may have to tell the patient the opposite of what is wrong with him.  He must not be in any danger of being prosecuted under some section of the Consumer Information Bill even though it does technically apply to such situations.  One would like to be sure that the administrators are alert and made sensitive to all the nuances and problems involved in this.</P>

      <P>May I express certain reservations that I have as a lay person, not a lawyer, about the tendency that it appears to me is apparent in this legislation, the tendency to blur the distinction between criminal liability and civil liability?  I feel that the right to compensation ought not to depend upon a criminal conviction; it should be litigated separately in the civil courts where the rules of evidence are quite different from those obtaining in the criminal courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill or Second Stage expressed the opinion that it was restricted in that the amount <Col N="258" /> of compensation would be limited by the fines imposed as a result of conviction. If the Bill is to entitle a complainant to compensation surely it should be full compensation and not partial compensation.  What happens if the loss suffered is not proportionate to the amount of the fine?</P>

      <P>We lost opportunities to rectify it on this occasion and I believe in taking every opportunity that one can in a matter such as this. I believe that this is so in two particular areas and I would urge the Minister to bear this in mind for the future and when she gets another opportunity to consider it.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator FitzGerald put his finger on the problem when he asked what is going to happen now, because, in effect, when this legislation is signed and becomes law nothing may come of it.  It now rests with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to decide what he wants to do about the director.  He is under no obligation to appoint a director.  He is under no obligation to make sure that director has a budget and, as we pointed out on Committee Stage, the independence of the director is hampered by his status in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to get the directorship off the ground; to establish the office, to get a director in and to get things moving.  But I would urge her to bear in mind for the future the usefulness to the consumer generally of having a director in an agency that is independent of any Government Department.  I think that is important.  Apart from the conflicts that arise in regard to activities in Government agencies themselves, it is only in the context <Col N="259" /> of a totally independent and enterprising agency that a director can function properly.  The only other point I want to make is in relation to section 17 of the Bill.  Section 17 is the section that provides for what Senator Cassidy was referring to, the ability of a court when considering the criminal aspect to impose a fine that will serve as compensation for the victim.</P>
    <P>Dealing first of all briefly with what Senator Cassidy said, I do not think there is any problem presented by the fact that a judge who is dealing with a criminal matter is going to consider a civil aspect to it.  A judge will be conscious of the rules of evidence that should apply and the legislation itself can provide so that nothing unfair is done in relation to any party to the matter.  The argument in favour of merging the criminal and civil aspect is that, in an instance such as this where we are creating a crime, whereas formerly the only litigation that could come out of it was civil litigation, it seems pointless that there should be duplication, that there should be, first of all, a criminal prosecution and some time after that a civil prosecution.  You are wasting the time of the court and also making inefficient a system that could be much more efficient.</P>
    <P>I know that section 57 of the Road Traffic Act ran into difficulties and we discussed this on Committee Stage. The amendment which the Minister introduced on Committee Stage&mdash;for Senators who were not aware of it&mdash; provided that this system of imposing a compensatory fine on the defendant or on the convicted person can now only be adopted in the District Court. I made the point on that occasion in a general way because I was not sure of what I was saying at the time, that if the matter were proceeding in the High Court or Circuit Court at a criminal level there was no reason why either court should not have an increased jurisdiction and that the right to impose a compensatory fine would be given to the Circuit Court, the High Court and equally the District Court.</P>
    <P>I have gone to the trouble since of reading High Court judgments in relation <Col N="260" /> to the constitutionality of section 57 of the Road Traffic Act and it is quite clear from that that the reason why section 57 was found to be unconstitutional was that the amount of compensation that could be awarded by the District Court indicated that the offence could not properly be regarded as a minor offence and therefore was not triable by the district justice.  All I am suggesting is that at some stage in the future the Minister might see fit to give the power to the Circuit Court judge where he is dealing with the criminal aspect under this Bill to impose a compensatory fine that is fitting to his court, namely, an unlimited figure.  I would ask the Minister to consider this for the future because, as I have already said I complimented the Minister on introducing that amendment in the Dáil and I am sorry that it seems to have got lost on the way through because of what I regard as a misinterpretation of a judgment of the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with the proposal made by Senator FitzGerald despite the fact that it will probably have the effect of doing some members of the legal profession out of jobs occasionally because if this booklet is brought out as effectively and as clearly as it should be, then many points that are probably somewhat obscure at the moment will be quite clear and it will not be necessary to get any legal advice as to what they really need.</P>
      <P>However, I would just like to make one point and that is that this Bill is merely one of a number dealing with much the same field and I think it would be better to wait.  There is at least one other Bill which will be dealing with much the same kind of country and it would be as well if such a booklet is going to be produced that it should be comprehensive.</P>

      <P>While I agree with Senator FitzGerald's suggestion about bringing out a guide to consumer legislation&mdash;it is a very good suggestion&mdash;I was going to make the point made by Senator Ryan that as <Col N="261" /> we are having two Bills&mdash;the Consumer Protection Bill will follow very closely on the heels of this one&mdash;it may be better to wait and have the two together.  Also one of the director's functions will be to ensure that the provisions of this legislation or indeed any future consumer protection legislation will be made available to the public and will be brought to the attention of the public at all times and continuously over a period of time. As I say, I am well disposed towards the points made by Senator FitzGerald subject to the consideration mentioned by Senator Ryan.</P>
      <P>Both Senator Molony and Senator FitzGerald spoke of what is going to happen now.  I would hope, and I would like to assure both Senators that my intention now is, that we would get on with the appointment of a director as soon as possible; that the advertisement would go out for applications and that, after going through the list of applicants the appropriate person would be appointed to the job.  One of the amendments I brought in today was designed to help the director to have finances so as to be able to get on with the job. As Senator FitzGerald rightly pointed out, unless we start immediately on the right foot with the Bill, the whole area of consumer legislation, which I think Senator Molony rightly pointed out has been neglected to a considerable extent here, would fall apart.  We must have a back-up service to any legislation which is introduced.  Otherwise that legislation becomes inoperable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cassidy made the point about compensation.  Of course any of the cases can be litigated separately.  As Senator Molony pointed out, the Bill does not take away from the individual the right to seek civil redress.  In fact it gives the individual an additional right.  This was one of the matters we discussed on Committee Stage and both Senator Cassidy and Senator Moloney made very valid points in regard to it.  I assure both of them that it was taken into account between then and now and we felt that the Bill as it was should stand.  All legislation must be reviewed from time to time and always be monitored, and this will be <Col N="262" /> the function of the director and, of course, of the Minister in charge also. Therefore I can foresee that as time progresses and as various developments become evident to us in the consumer field, there will possibly be amendments to this Bill from time to time and perhaps to other Bills that will follow.  I should like to thank all the Senators who took part in this debate.  This legislation is very important and I am delighted that it has been my privilege to take it through to its conclusion.  I should like to thank all of you for being very co-operative and to say that at any time when reasonable points are made I will be prepared to consider them sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will be aware these reports are required by section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972 which provides that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.</P>
      <P>The Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Reports together summarise significant developments in various areas of Community activity from 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1977.  They include reviews of the European Councils held during that period in Luxembourg, Brussels, The Hague, Rome and London.  Developments in the Common Fisheries policy up to mid July 1977 are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports deal with European political co-operation, policy decisions taken by the Community, legislation enacted by the Community and proposals for Community action, with the <Col N="263" /> emphasis on the significance for Ireland in each case.</P>
    <P>As annexes to the reports are lists of Ministerial Regulations made under the European Communities Act, tables showing subsidies, grants and loans received, lists of meetings of the Council, plenary sittings of the European Parliament, plenary sessions of the Economic and Social Committee, Irish members of Community bodies and visits concerning Community affairs.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware from the introduction to the Eighth Report that it has been decided to publish these reports at six-monthly intervals, each report to cover the period of the presidency of the Council just concluded. With the reports now being published on a more logical basis, the Minister hopes it will be possible for parliamentary time to be set aside for debates almost automatically twice a year.  Debates on the reports would then provide a regular opportunity for a broad discussion of European Community affairs.  Now that the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities has been set up it should be possible to debate the reports of the Joint Committee at the same time. This arrangement would, we feel, best meet the recommendation made by the Joint Committee in the report on its functions and work published in March 1977 that a definite time be set aside for two debates each year on Joint Committee reports.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to some of the major developments in the areas of Community activity during the period covered by these reports. Senators will appreciate that the matters referred to occurred before the change of Government and so do not reflect the input of our policy to the Community.  In addition, Senators may wish to raise matters which refer to developments subsequent to last June.  I will be happy to deal with these matters in my reply.</P>
    <P>In the area of European political co-operation the Nine, in accordance with the inter-governmental procedures established for this co-operation, continued to meet regularly at ministerial <Col N="264" /> and official level to consult on and as far as possible to co-ordinate their foreign policy positions.</P>
    <P>Particular attention continued to be paid to the situation in Africa.</P>
    <P>In declarations on Africa made in February 1976 and in April 1977 the Foreign Ministers of the Nine expressed concern at the situation in Central and Southern Africa, affirmed their willingness to co-operate with any African State in the rejection of attempts by any State to set up a sphere of influence in Africa, stated their support for the Organisation of African Unity and their commitment to do everything possible to promote democratic majority rule and nonracial Government for the peoples of Southern Africa.</P>
    <P>In separate statements the Nine have expressed their deep concern at the attitude of the illegal Rhodesian authorities which had endangered efforts to find a solution to the situation in that country.</P>
    <P>As an expression of their continuing concern over the situation in Namibia, the Nine made demarches in 1976 and 1977 to the South African authorities which set out the essentials of a settlement which would gain international acceptance.</P>
    <P>In May 1977 a statement on behalf of the Nine was delivered at the United Nations Conference on the situation in Zimbabwe and Namibia held in Maputo, Mozambique, which re-affirmed Nine support for independence and majority rule in S. Rhodesia and Namibia.</P>
    <P>The Nine continued their consultations on matters arising from the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, CSCE.  The Final Act contains a declaration of principles guiding relations between the thirty-five participating States and detailed provisions aimed at encouraging contacts and co-operation in the areas of security, economics, education, culture, as well as in the humanitarian field.  A follow-up meeting began in Belgrade on 4 October.  This meeting is engaged in reviewing the extent to which the participating states have implemented the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and in discussing <Col N="265" /> means of facilitating and improving implementation.  In this context the Nine have maintained close co-ordination and co-operation both in the review of implementation and in the promotion of proposals aimed at facilitating and improving further implementation of the Final Act.</P>
    <P>The Middle East continued to be a regular topic of discussion among the Nine.  On 29 June last the European Council issued a statement outlining the common approach of the Community to the question of a resolution of the Middle East conflict.  This statement, the text of which is annexed to the Tenth Report, is indicative of the very significant progress which has taken place in the development of the Community's Middle East policy since the last such declaration in November 1973.</P>
    <P>During the period covered by these reports both Greece and Portugal submitted applications for membership of the Communities. Since the Tenth Report was written, Spain has also applied.</P>
    <P>Accession negotiations are in progress with Greece and indeed are about to enter on a more active and substantive phase.  As regards Portugal and Spain, the Commission is at present conducting an examination of the applications received from those countries in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties which require that the opinion of the Commission be obtained before action is taken by the Council.</P>
    <P>Although the three applications are being dealt with separately on their own merits, the overall consequences for the future of the Community and for its common policies of an enlargement involving all three countries must be borne in mind.  Ireland has welcomed the applications for accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain.  We have admired the return of democracy in these countries and have recognised that the prospect of membership of the European Communities has played no small part in the process of democratisation. However, we are concerned that enlargement must lead to further integration and progress towards the achievement of the stated aims of the <Col N="266" /> Community.  We have already made our position clear both as regards the provision of adequate resources to deal with the problems of an enlarged Community and as regards the necessity for reform of the Community institutions. We have also stated that, if the Community is to deal effectively with the applicant countries, positive action will have to be taken to eliminate existing regional disparaties.  The Government attaches great importance to the pursuit of an effective regional policy, which would involve the use of all Community financial instruments to alleviate problems such as these existing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The approach I have outlined will guide our attitude to developments in regard to enlargement.</P>
    <P>An important development during the period under review was the coming into effect on 1 June 1977 of a new treaty, commonly knows as the Budgetary Powers Treaty.  This treaty changes certain financial provisions of the treaties establishing the European Communities and of the treaty establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The main significance of the new treaty is that it gives the European Parliament the explicit right to reject the draft Community budget as a whole and to request that a new draft be submitted to it.  Another power which the new treaty grants to the Parliament is the sole right, acting on a recommendation from the Council, of giving a discharge to the Council in respect of the implementation of the budget.  This power of discharge, which in effect amounts to a power to declare the accounts for each year finally and duly closed, was previously exercised jointly by the Council and the Parliament.  In addition the new treaty makes it obligatory for the Council to consult the Parliament and to obtain the opinion of the new Court of Auditors before it makes financial regulations relating to the management of the budget of the Communities. Previously the Council could make financial regulations without consulting either the Parliament or the Audit Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> Another provision of the new treaty is that it has now been made more difficult for the Council to reject a proposed modification by the Parliament to the Community budget, where such a modification would not increase the total expenditure of a Community institution, that is to say, where a proposed increase in expenditure in one area would be offset by a reduction elsewhere.  The new treaty provides that in future, such modifications will stand accepted unless the Council votes by a qualified majority, namely 41 votes out of 58, to reject them.</P>
    <P>The treaty also provides for the creation of a Communities' Court of Auditors to replace the existing Audit Board.  The new court consists of nine full-time members appointed for a six-year term of office by the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament.  The members of the court took their oath of office on 25 October 1977 and on that day, four members were chosen by lot whose initial term of office will be limited to four years.  These are the members from Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Italy.  At its meeting on 9 November 1977, the Court of Auditors elected Mr. Michael Murphy of Ireland as its President.</P>
    <P>The Court of Auditors will assist Parliament and the Council in their exercise of powers of control over the budget, and it will have extensive powers at its command.  For example, it will be able to investigate all revenue and expenditure of all bodies set up by the Communities unless the relevant constituent instrument precludes such examination.  It will be able to carry out on-the-spot audits in both the institutions and in the member states if necessary.  In the latter case, the audit would be made in conjunction with national audit offices or competent national departments.  It may also, on the request of an institution, submit observations or deliver opinions on specific questions.</P>
    <P>The Court of Auditors has been set up to meet the difficulties generated by the increasing size of the Community budget and the need to ensure <Col N="268" /> more effective control over the financial management of the Community.</P>
    <P>While the effects of the new Budgetary Powers Treaty will be to immediately strengthen the powers of the European Parliament in relation to the Community budget, it is expected that these powers will be much more significant when the Parliament is elected directly by the people of the Community.</P>
    <P>This brings me on to the subject of direct elections to the European Parliament, which was debated in this House and in the Dáil before Christmas in the context of the European Assembly Elections (No. 2) Bill 1977, which laid down the procedures for the holding of direct elections in Ireland. The Bill became law on 9 December 1977, on being signed by the President.</P>
    <P>As you know, the first direct elections were scheduled to take place throughout the Community in May or June of this year, but unfortunately it has now been found necessary to postpone them.  The delay is primarily due to the situation in the United Kingdom where the House of Commons on 13 December 1977 rejected the use of the PR regional list system in favour of the simple majority system &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo;, for the direct elections.  As a result, it would not have been possible for the UK Boundary Commission to draw up the required new constituencies before the deadline of May 1978.</P>
    <P>At the Council of Foreign Ministers on 17 January 1978, the reality of the situation was accepted with some disappointment and the meeting agreed that the European Council in Copenhagen on 6-7 April should set a new date for the elections&mdash;probably some time in the first half of 1979.</P>
    <P>We regret the fact that this postponement was necessary but we should now look forward to the holding of the first elections next year and work towards a high poll in order to give a strong mandate to the new directly-elected Parliament.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture continues to benefit significantly from membership of the European Community.  During 1977 payments received under the FEOGA <Col N="269" /> Guarantee Section amounted to about £245 million, a figure which demonstrates the significance of the Community's Common Agricultural Policy to the agricultural sector in Ireland. This is only part of the benefit.  There is in addition the gain&mdash;estimated at £175 million or so a year&mdash;from our exports being sold at the higher EEC price levels.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been some problems for the agricultural sector since Irish accession to the Community not the least of which has been the failure of the Community to evolve a common organisation of the market for sheepmeat.  The Government is continuing to press for a common organisation of the sheepmeat market and the Commission has recently promised a proposal by April.  Throughout the transitional period our sheep farmers have had to operate in the face of continuing uncertainty on access to the lucrative French market for lamb. However, since the end of the transitional period on 1 January last our sheepmeat exports are being admitted freely to the French market.  We now have the opportunity of developing a very valuable export market for top quality lamb.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Common Agricultural Policy which is in need of review, and which is in fact being reviewed, is the question of monetary compensatory amounts, or MCA's as they are usually referred to. Senators will be aware that MCA's are a device originally introduced to offset the effects which exchange rate fluctuations have on the price system of the Common Agricultural Policy and on the competitiveness of the agricultural exports of the member states.</P>
    <P>Because of the fall in the value of sterling in the past few years Irish exports of agricultural products were burdened with an MCA which amounted to a considerable levy and which reduced their competitiveness on the markets of the other Community members.  Successive devaluations in the green pound, as it is known, have reduced the MCA's chargeable on Irish exports to a more tolerable level. The Government are determined to press for a complete overhaul of the <Col N="270" /> MCA system, in consultation with the European Commission and the other member states.  The resulting system will, it is hoped, provide for regular automatic adjustments in the MCA system.</P>
    <P>Early in 1977, because of a wide divergence between the Irish and British green pound rates and the fact that certain processed agricultural products were not covered by the MCA system, Irish manufacturers of certain processed agricultural products, notably biscuits and confectionery, were placed at a severe disadvantage compared with United Kingdom manufacturers of the same products.  It was necessary initially to take national measures to safeguard the interests of Irish manufacturers. Import levies and export subsidies were introduced on the goods in question and these were later replaced by a Community-wide MCA system for these products on 4 July 1977.</P>
    <P>The Community continues to have a large surplus of dairy products which it is endeavouring to reduce.  Among the measures adopted as part of a package designed to achieve a balance between supply and demand in the dairy market was the introduction on 16 September 1977 of a coresponsibility levy of 0.9p per gallon on milk. This is to be paid by milk producers to Community funds and used to improve the market outlets for dairy products. The reluctance of dairy producers to pay the levy is understandable but it must be noted that any increase in the market for dairy products will be of benefit to Irish dairy farmers in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is one which must be reviewed and adapted regularly to meet the changing needs of and situations arising in the member states.  The Government attaches considerable importance to the need to review the Community's directives on structural reform in agriculture. The Commission has recently produced proposals to amend and improve these directives.  We will examine these proposals carefully and shall aim at securing a worthwhile improvement in the Community's policies on structural reform.</P>
    <P>The reports deal with a period <Col N="271" /> which has seen the extension by the Community member states of their fishing limits to 200 miles, and the consequential efforts of the Community to arrive at a revised common fisheries policy, efforts which to date have not been successful.  The extension to 200 miles took place in the context of the failure of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference to reach finality and because of the declaration of 200-mile fishing limits by a number of States including the United States, Canada, Norway and Iceland.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers of the Community meeting in the Hague on 29 and 30 October 1976 accordingly agreed that member states of the Community should by concerted action extend their fishing limits in the North Atlantic from 1 January 1977.  At this meeting the special needs of Ireland's developing fishing industry in formulating a revised policy were recognised. Agreement was also reached on the principle that the cost to Ireland of protecting the extended Irish zone should not be disproportionate to the volume of fish taken by Ireland in that zone.</P>
    <P>Initial efforts towards the end of 1976 to arrive at a revised internal fisheries policy failed to achieve agreement in the Council of Ministers. In those discussions the special position of this country and our need for a reserved coastal belt were emphasised. It was also pointed out that negotiation of substantive arrangements with Third Countries was contingent on settlement of a revised internal policy.</P>
    <P>Following on the failure of the Council to reach agreement on revised permanent arrangements efforts were made to put in place interim arrangements for 1977.  On the external side temporary arrangements were applied to those non-EEC countries who had traditionally fished in the waters of member states, restricting the volume and areas of their fishing activity. These arrangements for limited periods were renewed from time to time.</P>
    <P>The problem of internal conservation measures proved more intractable. This country's position was that a quota system was not in itself sufficient <Col N="272" /> to conserve stocks and in the absence of agreement on comprehensive conservation measures the previous Government, as Senators will be aware, took unilateral action to limit the size of boats operating in Irish coastal areas which resulted in legal action by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The case against Ireland at the European Court of Justice is dealt with in the Tenth Report.  The unilateral fishery conservation measures brought into force on 10 April were suspended by order of the court on 18 July 1977. A further oral hearing on the case before the Court was held on 14 December and the Advocate General of the Court delivered his opinion on the case on 19 January last.  The final judgment of the court is expected soon and because of this, I am sure Senators will appreciate that I cannot make any comments on the matter.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive revised proposals for a permanent regime were put forward by the Commission in early December 1977 following intensive bilateral consultations. These, as subsequently supplemented, cover quotas, which would give Ireland a very substantive increase in catches, conservation and control measures, a system of fishing plans to regulate activity particularly in waters of interest to Ireland, structural adaptation measures and finally proposals to implement the undertaking in regard to a financial contribution to Ireland for surveillance costs.</P>
    <P>These latest measures are outside the scope of the reports before the Senate and I do not, accordingly, propose to deal with them at any length. The Irish approach has been constructive and the Minister for Fisheries has indicated our willingness to negotiate on the proposals and to consider the possibility of combining fishing plans with a reserved coastal zone.  It became apparent in recent weeks however that it would not be possible to arrive at agreement on the basis of these proposals as they stood and efforts to agree on a package of interim measures for 1978 at the Council of Fisheries Ministers last week, without prejudice to the permanent revised regime, likewise came to nought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> Turning to economic and monetary matters, it has to be admitted that the movement towards economic and monetary union in the Community has been sluggish in recent years.  The objective, set a few years ago, of achieving economic and monetary union by 1980 is now clearly unattainable. The lack of progress in this area is in part, but not entirely, attributable to the preoccupation with the energy crisis, the slow rate of economic growth, and the high level of Community unemployment.  I must add, however, that the situation has not been helped by the existence of doubts as to whether the commitment to the objective of economic and monetary union has been wholehearted on the part of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally supported the general objective of economic and monetary union.  It is our view, however, that the elimination of economic disparities between different parts of the Community is an essential prerequisite to the achievement of any real success in moving towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The European Council on 5-6 December 1977 discussed the prospects of economic and monetary union.  A communication submitted by the Commission to the European Council proposed a five-year action programme, the details of which would be specified annually: at the end of each year the European Council would review progress and approve the active plan for the following year.  The European Council welcomed the Commission communication and reaffirmed its attachment to the objective of economic and monetary union.  This renewed commitment to the goal seems most timely, prior to direct elections to the European Parliament, and enlargement of the Communities.</P>
    <P>The period under review saw recovery from the recession in most member states.  The rate of economic growth attained in 1977 was an estimated 2½ per cent, compared with over 4½ per cent in 1976.  At 5 per cent, Ireland in 1977 had the highest growth rate among the member states. Although growth was weak throughout the Community in 1977, some progress <Col N="274" /> was made on inflation and external imbalances.</P>
    <P>High unemployment is the most pressing problem in the Community at present.  The restoration of full employment must be given priority at both Community and national level. There is need for a sustained effort to eliminate unemployment in the medium term, and in particular a solution must be found urgently to the pressing question of youth unemployment.  Prospects for 1978, on the basis of unchanged policies, suggest an improvement in the Community's growth rate to 3½ per cent with demand and production showing a slow expansion in the first half of the year.  Unemployment in the Community as a whole is expected to rise, but a reduction is forecast for Ireland.  The rate of inflation in the Community should moderate again in 1978, to an annual average of about 8 per cent, as against 9½ per cent in 1977.</P>
    <P>The Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which was held in Nairobi in May 1976 adopted a resolution&mdash;Resolution 93&mdash;on an integrated commodity programme which called for negotiations with a view to commodity arrangements being drawn up for 18 named commodities.  The Resolution also called for steps to be taken towards the negotiation of a common fund.  In the period under review Ireland as well as the other Community member states participated in negotiations on the integrated commodity programme.  A United Nations negotiating conference took place in March 1977 and was adjourned without reaching agreement on the question of a common fund.  However, within the Community itself agreement was reached at the European Council on 25-26 March 1977 on the principle of the establishment of a common fund.  This agreement enabled the Community, together with the other industrialised countries represented, to reach agreement on the principle of the establishment of a common fund at the final stages of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation (CIEC) in Paris in June 1977.  It is a source of satisfaction that the Community spoke with one voice <Col N="275" /> and played a positive role in CIEC.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund resumed on 7 November 1977 but was suspended on 1 December 1977 without having reached agreement on the establishment of a common fund.  It is likely that a further negotiating session of the conference will be held in the first half of 1978.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Community's Global Mediterranean Policy agreements have been concluded, or existing agreements amended with most countries of the Mediterranean region, involving trade concessions, economic and technical co-operation and financial assistance.  The agreements are designed as a model for relations between developed and developing states, and, I would suggest, illustrate the Community's imaginative policies in their relations with countries at different stages of development.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of these agreements will contribute to a more balanced relationship between the Community and their Mediterranean partners.  The Community attaches importance to consolidating and strengthening its relations with these countries by demonstrating, through these agreements, its desire to contribute to the economic and social development of the region.  These co-operation agreements have been signed by all of the member states and are now in the process of ratification.</P>
    <P>During their last session, Dáil Éireann approved the terms of motions relating to the accession of three new States to the Convention of Lomé, Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and Papua, New Guinea.  The value and effectiveness of Community policy in these areas are illustrated by the desire of so many countries to participate in such agreements.</P>
    <P>Under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade&mdash; GATT&mdash;the so-called Tokyo Round of international trade negotiations was launched in September 1973.  The main areas of the negotiations are agriculture, tariffs, non-tariff measures, safeguards and special and differential treatment for developing countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> Very little real progress has been made in these negotiations since 1975 mainly because of the unfavourable world economic climate and more recently the election and change of administration in the United States.  The most difficult issues between the developed countries concern the EEC and the United States, principally in relation to agriculture, tariffs and safeguards. The problem of differential treatment for developing countries is also very difficult.</P>
    <P>Because of the slow progress being made the deadline for completion of these negotiations has been successively extended.  At the Downing Street Summit in May, the major participants committed themselves to seeking substantive progress in 1977.  President Carter's Special Trade Representative, Mr. Robert Strauss, at a meeting with the European Commission in Brussels on 11 July proposed an accelerated timetable which envisaged the conclusion of the negotiations in 1978.  The attitude of the Community to the timetable is one of overall positiveness tempered by a concern to ensure that balance in the results is maintained.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the negotiations in the light of these developments are better than has been the case for some time and if the current political will can be translated into positive action there should be considerable progress within the next six months. An informal high level meeting in Geneva on 23 January 1978, at which the offers of various participants were tabled, inaugurated the substantive stage of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Since 1972 contacts between the Community and COMECON have been taking place.  These culminated with a meeting last September between the President of the Council and Commissioner Haferkamp on the one hand, and Mr. Milai Marinescu, President of the Executive Council of COMECON, on the other.  Mr. Haferkamp, the Vice-President of the European Commission, as the Commissioner responsible for External Relations, led the discussion on the Community side.  The Commission will be responsible for the conduct of negotiations for the Community. <Col N="277" /> The discussion was useful and constructive and marks an important step towards the recognition by the COMECON states of Community competences.  As a result of this meeting, it is expected that negotiations towards the conclusion of a co-operation agreement between the European Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will begin early in 1978.  The Community has also re-affirmed that its offer to conclude individual trade agreements with each of the state-trading countries which are members of COMECON is still on the table.</P>
    <P>While most trade relations between Ireland and third countries are now regulated at Community level there are certain fields of intergovernmental economic activity where, subject to compliance with Community consultation procedures, competence is retained at national government level. Examples of these areas are agreements on the development of economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation, between Ireland and the USSR and between Ireland and Poland which were signed during the period under review.</P>
    <P>The agreements provide an inter-governmental framework to facilitate the development of co-operative projects between economic, commercial and other interests in the two countries concerned.  In State trading countries such as the USSR and Poland, where most aspects of economic activity are controlled by the State the provision of such an inter-governmental framework is seen as an important step to provide support at the official level for Irish exporters and other economic operators with an interest in doing business with the countries concerned</P>
    <P>One of our main criticisms of the Community has been the lack of a comprehensive regional policy backed by an adequately endowed regional fund.  Only this can solve the problem of the increasing disparities between the richest and poorest regions of the Community.  We have always seen the elimination of such disparities as an essential step towards cohesion and progress in the Community.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Paris <Col N="278" /> Summit of December 1974 decided to set up the European Regional Development Fund for three years with a ceiling of 1,300 million units of account&mdash;about £540 million.  Of this we were to get an effective 6.42 per cent or £35 million.  This was completely inadequate for our needs.  It represented only a small proportion of the public capital programme, even in 1975.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached at the European Council on 5-6 December last that the size of the fund will be 1,800 million European units of account&mdash; about £1,230 million&mdash;over the three years, 1978 to 1980.  Our share of this has not yet been fixed but we expect it to be about the same percentage share as for the earlier period.  This should give us a figure of £75 million with a 1978 figure of £24 million.  This total marks a considerable advance on our share of the earlier fund and will go some of the way towards helping us attain a rate of economic growth sufficiently fast enough to catch up with the richer members of the Community. However, I would like to stress that we do not accept even this increased fund as representing a real Community effort in this area.</P>
    <P>Negotiations, referred to in the Tenth Report, are still continuing on Commission proposals to set up a framework in which a Community regional policy can evolve.  This will entail co-ordinating national regional policies and assessing the regional consequences of Community policy in general.  The exact details of the framework will, it is hoped, be decided on soon.  Ireland is in favour of this set of proposals.  The development of a Community regional policy will be a significant step towards the realisation of an economic and monetary union and the present proposals, if they are accepted, should significantly assist the development of such a policy.  Also under discussion are proposals about revising the regulations which governed the fund for the last three years.  We hope that revised regulations will soon be agreed to.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the regional policy dimension of the enlargement of the Community.  Enlarging <Col N="279" /> the Community makes the realisation of a regional policy of which a substantial regional fund would play a major part all the more imperative.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the members of this House that the major social problem facing the Community at the moment is unemployment.  Six million people&mdash;5.7 per cent of the Community's labour force&mdash;are out of work in the Community.  Ireland has the most serious figure with 9.7 per cent of our labour force unemployed.</P>
    <P>During the period covered by the Tenth Report there were two major conferences on the problem.  The Standing Committee on Employment, consisting of the Ministers for Social Affairs of the Nine, the social partners and the Commission met in early May 1977 and discussed the question.  The Tripartite Conference, which has the same membership as the Standing Committee on Employment with the additional attendance of the Ministers of Finance of the Nine, met at the end of June and agreed that the Commission would undertake a study of: the cost effectiveness, and implications for industrial output, of work sharing schemes; the role of employment creation in the tertiary sector; the effect of increasing competition from the Third World on the pattern of investment in the Community and the promotion of public and private investment which would create jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition the Commission is to keep the overall situation regarding employment, investment and growth in the Community under review.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged that a further tripartite conference will be held to consider these reports when they are ready.</P>
    <P>The two European Councils in March and June also discussd the problem of employment with particular reference to what the Community as a whole could do about it.  The points covered included borrowing at the national and international level, reduction in working hours, longer schooling periods and earlier retirement.  Senators may wish to note that since June last there have been two further meetings at ministerial level on this subject. <Col N="280" /> At the end of October the Social Affairs Ministers considered the question of money from the European Social Fund being used to help the creation and maintenance of jobs particularly for young people.  The Commission was instructed to prepare and submit to the Council proposals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In November last the Standing Committee on Employment held a meeting devoted to youth unemployment. The Committee felt that particular priority should be accorded to measures designed to strengthen the links between post-school training and employment.  Such measures are to be financed out of the social fund if the latter has sufficient funds.  The committee also urged the Commission to increase the aid and co-operation between member states in the development of employment market institutions. Ireland indicated at that meeting that we strongly supported the idea of strengthening the link between training and employment in the context of the European Social Fund.  We emphasised that extra resources must be provided for any aid the Community may make available.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment was also discussed at the December European Council.  The Council conducted a wide-ranging discussion of the economic and social situation in the Community. It was agreed among other things that &ldquo;the level of unemployment remained a major cause for concern&rdquo;. It approved a number of immediate objectives&mdash;increased coordination of economic policies, the strengthening of monetary solidarity, the development of the Community's financial means and the search for Community solutions to structural problems.  The Council stressed the importance of contacts with the two sides of industry through the tripartite conference, and requested that the follow-up work to the last tripartite conference be expedited.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund was set up in 1961.  It is primarily concerned with training and retraining schemes for workers.  We have benefited considerably from it since our accession. In the past five years over £50 million <Col N="281" /> has been committed by the fund to projects in Ireland of which the total for last year slightly exceeded £20 million. This represented about eight per cent of the total fund for 1977.  The major single Irish benefactor is AnCO. In 1977 about 12,500 people received training from AnCO&mdash;an increase of nearly 2,000 on 1976.  The cost of this training was assisted considerably by the European Social Fund.  Commitments from the fund to AnCO increased from £5.8 million in 1976 to £8.0 million in 1977 for programmes started in 1977.  In addition a further £2.1 million was committed to cover training schemes run by sixty-two private companies in co-operation with AnCO for the same period.  5,325 trainees were involved in these training programmes.  The money put up by the European Social Fund was matched with a similar sum paid by AnCO on behalf of the IDA.  The companies themselves are to pay the balance of £3.7 million.</P>
    <P>A further revision of the fund was completed towards the end of 1977. The revised regulations governing the fund came into force on 1 January. They include a number of improvements which are expected to benefit Ireland.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, section 5 of the 1972 European Communities Act provided that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the Community and I think it is regrettable that so many reports should come together. I am glad the Minister has undertaken to bring the reports to the House soon after they are published.  This is necessary if the Members of the Oireachtas are to be kept informed of developments in the Community.  I agree with the Minister that there is a necessity for more frequent discussions of these topics within the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The malaise in the European Community does not arise so much from the economic crisis of the past as from the fact that member Governments refused to give it its due.  They do not take into account the European dimension and they tend to attribute all that is positive in it to their own <Col N="282" /> action and all that is negative to the Commission.  Indeed neither by word nor action have any Government of the Nine set about explaining what Europe is all about.  The regional fund, for example, as has been mentioned by the Minister, is but a cliché here as far as the man in the street is concerned, but from the Commission's point of view it is an expensive cliché at £42 million since the fund was founded in 1974.  It is unfortunate that it is not possible to find an individual in the street who will say, &ldquo;I owe 30 per cent of the job I have to the fact that the European development fund has set up the project in which I work.&rdquo;  While nothing is made clear about it the ordinary person cannot understand and when things go wrong everybody blames the Community.</P>
    <P>Nationalistic habits have prevented us from making the most of the Community, and so long as these persist it is hard to give the Community the chance they deserve.  Unless this attitude is changed&mdash;and if Europe is to remain in business is must be changed &mdash;the Community will be eroded and dissipated.  That would be a waste and a sad contrast to the attitude towards the Community of those countries outside it.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to query the Minister on the changes that have recently been made in the Department of Foreign Affairs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the briefings that members of the Community have received from the various State Departments and from the semi-State organisations to date.  I had occasion to ring a Department on Monday for a bit of information and was told that in future all such inquiries must be made in writing in the first instance to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not object to the procedure, but the only point that I would wish to make is that very often none of us who are working in the Parliament can reasonably be expected to be an expert to have opinions on the very wide range of topics that come before the European Parliament for discussion.  Therefore at very short notice we may have to ask some Department what the Irish position is or which option we should adopt, and if we have to go through two Departments <Col N="283" /> to get a message it slows down the job.  For instance if I have a query about Aer Lingus am I to take it that in future I write to the Department of Foreign Affairs, they write to the Department of Tourism and Transport, they in turn write to Mr. Kennedy in Aer Lingus, and then there are the three steps back again?  The debate would be long over before we would have that information.  I do not mind the red tape so long as it does not inhibit the members or perhaps deprive us.  After all in my five years' experience we have worked as a team in the interests of the common good.  We have found ourselves, with very few exceptions, on the same line in the Parliament even without prior consultations.</P>
    <P>I have also noticed since returning to the Parliament after Christmas that each time I come through Dublin airport I am subjected to personal minute and intensive scrutiny by the customs officials.  I accept that we must have spot checks, but as the Minister will appreciate, the plane complement for Brussels is made up of 80 per cent of senior Irish civil servants, Ministers, company directors, people from the trade unions and farming organisations, and if each week they see McDonald with his case spread out and customs officials going through it minutely they surely cannot be blamed if they think that that fellow is on to some smuggling racket or another.  It is extremely unfair, and I think that I am being singled out for special attention.  I want an assurance from the Minister that I am not being singled out for special political motives because I would very much regret that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that, but it is hard to take it when the smuggling racket is going two ways across the Border at great damage to industry and the agricultural economy and at huge costs to the Community coffers, and at the same time these customs people who cannot get after what should be their legitimate work can waste time with a guy such as I.  I have never in the five years exceeded the quota. Indeed if you get up at six in the morning, do a five hour stint at a meeting in Brussels and get back home at 12 o'clock at night you are not in very much humour for going on shopping sprees.  However, the Minister might suggest to the customs officials that between planes they might read Bunreacht na hEireann and in conjunction with it articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Treaty of Rome&mdash;after all it is a customs union&mdash;before they pick us out for special scrutiny again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand how the security people have to check. I never bring in my full quota.  To get back to the business before the House, I read in a newspaper this morning a headline which quoted the Bishop of Galway, Dr. Casey, launching his Lenten appeal for Trócaire.  I should like to join with him in asking the public to be generous and to contribute <Col N="285" /> to the laudable aims of Trócaire and to support the work they are doing.</P>
      <P>During the past five years I have been a member of the European Parliament and also a member of the executive of the Lomé Convention.  As a member of those bodies I have had an opportunity to visit 14 or 15 of the new African countries, the emerging nations, and I have had a chance to visit missions, to speak with government and non-governmental people and to stay with missionaries on their missions.  I have had an opportunity to get an insight into the work they are doing and of their tremendous need.  To understand what poverty is people must go to see it and experience it for themselves.  It can be quite frightening when one comes across the two-tier society for the first time.  If the Irish people saw that more clearly I feel sure they would be more generous.  The EEC is certainly doing its part in this respect.  Under the terms of the Lomé Convention the Community is pledged to transfer 390 million units of account of financial aid to the ACP countries before 1 March 1980.  To this figure must be added an amount of 160 million units of account which will be transferred to the overseas territories of the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>What is our share of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the breakdown of the figures: Belgium, 6.25 per cent, Germany, 25.9 per cent, France, 25.9 per cent, Italy, 12 per cent, Luxembourg, 0.2 per cent, Netherlands, 7.95 per cent, United Kingdom, 18.7 per cent, Denmark, 2.4 per cent, Ireland, 0.6 per cent.  It is a fairly substantial fund.  When we talk about developments and aid and what our contribution is, it is a mistake to quantify it either in millions or in percentages.  This is not what the programme is about.  I am sorry that the Government did not increase this in the budget, did not maintain the momentum of annual increases that was set out by the previous Government in a very ambitious target in 1973.  It is true that they met that target with the exception of one year. Had the Government been able to <Col N="286" /> Minister, Chief Jonathan paid a warm maintain the target increase this year it would perhaps have compensated for that.</P>
      <P>Reading the newspapers today it would be a mistake if we were to quantify the amount of aid.  It is also a pity that sufficient money was not provided this year to meet all the demands that have been made to date on the Department.  There is a considerable shortfall there.  Even if we had met the demands we still would not have met the target Deputy FitzGerald set out in 1973.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the role of the Community through the aegis of the Lomé Convention, it is important that this work should be undertaken not just by Governmental organisations but by non-governmental organisations.  On a recent visit some months ago on the first delegation from the European Parliament that went to the United Nations in New York, the Secretary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, went to considerable pains to stress the role that non-governmental organisations must play in bringing about greater equality and a new social order in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, though I support Dr. Casey's Lenten appeal for Trócaire and I would hope people will contribute generously, I think we must not overlook the excellent work that is being carried out on our behalf by the Department of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with practically all the other Departments of State, with people from all the semi-State organisations who are being seconded and who are giving up their time in the true Irish missionary spirit to the development of those emerging nations in Africa. Deputy FitzGerald showed considerable foresight in selecting the small country of Lesotho which is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa&mdash;it is a small land-locked country of fewer than 1 million people, 40 per cent of whose work force work within South Africa&mdash;for the greatest concentration of our aid, which in real terms is small in comparison with what the larger countries can give. Nevertheless, on a recent visit to Lesotho where I attended a meeting of the Lomé Convention the Prime <Col N="287" /> and special tribute to Mr. Greene from the Minister's Department who, I take it, must be head of that section, for the work he is doing.  He also said that the contribution of all the Irish people there was quite significant.  They did not have the colonial undertones that perhaps other people had.  They are obviously very well picked and they do a wonderful job.  Not only do they carry out the work that they undertake to do but they are able to encourage by their example and their dedication the local people to provide for themselves the kind of future that is necessary.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to provide £X million and give it to a country. What the people in the underdeveloped areas, the new emerging nations, need are technical skills and know-how.  That is not provided by finance alone.  Therefore the work of the people who give up their time to go out in our development and aid programme is all the more important. It is something we should feel proud of.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell at some length on this important matter because I do not think it has been mentioned in the House before.  I would hope that the Minister would take the earliest opportunity and visit Lesotho in particular, or the Sudan or any of the countries where we have concentrated aid.  That visit should be given high priority. There is a role here for Members of this House who could take the time off.  The Government should provide the opportunity for our people actually to see for themselves the kind of work that is going on, so that through the dissemination of information, we could bring the public with us.  If any Irish person was to see the advancement and the efforts that have already been made and the way they are appreciated, I think it would make one feel proud to have been a contributor even via the tax man to that kind of work.</P>
    <P>This is why we should place greater emphasis on this heading in the Department. Apart from the fact that it is necessary to perhaps counter in some way&mdash;although I do not think this is too serious&mdash;the power blocs in the world who are bidding to turn the <Col N="288" /> heads of these small countries and take them for strategic reasons, in our situation we can go with at least a Christian spirit and see these people being equipped with facilities to improve their lot and the lot of those who come after them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to put high on his list of priorities a visit to some of these projects to see the conditions and the achievements of our people there, financed by our taxpayers, and if at all possible he should be able to bring at least some Members of this House from all sides to see the work that is going on.  No matter where one goes in the world, and we in the European Parliament get around a considerable amount, every parliament that I have come across has a foreign relations committee.  Members of parliament nowadays must be well briefed and the best possible way of doing this is to expose them to the problems and let them see for themselves.  It would be money well spent if our people were to go out there.  They would have a greater appreciation of the tremendous work that so many thousands of our Irish missionaries have been doing for many years, generations back, in bringing a better standard of living to people in distant lands.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to some Ministers in Nigeria last year and I was amazed when they told me of the tremendous debt that country of 88 million people owe to Irish missioners in the main and also some English Protestant missioners who almost single-handedly provided educational, social and hospital services for the population.  This is a tremendous tribute.  Living with some of the missioners, the Kiltegan Fathers, I found that they are almost totally dependent on the help that they get from the home missions.  This is something which people very often tend to forget.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the Lomé aspects and with our activities in Lesotho.  I especially mention the contribution An Foras Talúntais have made and indeed Mr. Gallagher and Dr. Andy Cole who spent some time there, and the very considerable plan they have drawn up.  I hope that the proposed programme will be speedily <Col N="289" /> implemented and that the Department will be able to make whatever allocations are necessary to ensure that the programme of development in the very remote region of Lesotho would be expedited.  At the present time the general population there, who would appear to be the poorest of the poor and a very gentle people in the main, are living in a very remote area with no through roads or communication. They are living in the highest spot in the world&mdash;I think the lowest part of that kingdom of Lesotho is in excess of 5,000 feet over sea level.  They have particular problems there, unique to themselves.  There are certain hardships for our people who undertake to go there and I hope they will not be subjected to any frustrations by having to wait for additional finance to continue with their work.</P>
    <P>There are two very interesting projects there.  One is a teaching centre which is organised by a Mr. Murphy, something new in possibly all of Africa.  It had been established in Australia, where it did excellent work for many years.  I was very happy to meet Mr. Murphy and a Miss O'Doherty, and the response they are getting to their organisation there is extraordinary.  Most African people, it is true to say, have a great desire for learning, and I think here that again perhaps we could strengthen that team if at all possible to ensure that that work will continue at the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>I was reading a letter in <i>The Times</i> the other day from one of the priests in a leper colony there.  I met while I was out there Dr. Seoirse O'Quigley who is also attached to a leper colony. I do not know if that is in receipt of any special funds from the Department, but from reading a letter from a chaplain to one of the leper hospitals or communes there it would appear that the shortfall in what the State supplies is of unfortunate proportions. We could ask the officers of the Department the next time they are out there to take a closer look at the work Dr. O'Quigley is doing and see if they can be a little more generous in that regard.</P>
    <P>A very interesting development there <Col N="290" /> and one that the Lesotho Government take great pride in is the knitting factory that has been set up by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards under the guidance of a Mr. Finlay.  The people have old traditional weaving crafts there, but they have not been brave enough to develop them.  They have a very old traditional production system.  In a very remote place Mr. Finlay set up a small factory which is turning out some beautiful items of apparel.  This is something we should encourage, because all these people are very clever with their hands and all they want is the technical know-how and finance to provide modern machinery.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister spoke of the necessity to provide a new road link with the northern part of Lesotho.  I am glad to see that the Department of the Environment are making available some engineers for this purpose. This is a new team of Irish people going out and I expect that this road development will also be funded from the Community: it would appear to be a fairly expensive job.</P>
    <P>One of the Irish people who has made a very notable contribution to the economy there is Noel O'Hara who is on secondment from the ESB. He took over the electrical supply company there and went in as general manager and has brought up the permanent force to more than 5,000 personnel. This is something new in Africa, because most Africans are paid by the hour or day and it is a new introduction to have a full-time force. These people are only seeing electricity for the first time.  It was imported from South Africa for the first time and the organisation was very haphazard. Thanks in the main to the expertise and the dedication of people like Mr. O'Hare and his colleagues, they have brought up the efficiency of the service to almost European standards, and this is a great tribute.  At the same time it is necessary to mention that these people on every possible occasion make use of Irish materials imported there if there is a shortfall in supplies.  The Department of Agriculture brought over Connemara ponies which they think will be suitable for the terrain <Col N="291" /> there.  I hope to have the opportunity to go back there in a few years to see how all these developments have affected the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>Over the years people like to think, in African terms, of making people from those distant lands into new Europeans.  I think this would be a terrible mistake.  The role embarked on by the Department of Foreign Affairs is to have these people improve their living and working conditions within their own environment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if it would be possible to introduce a Supplementary Estimate during the year to enable all the applications that he has to date in his office to be met because as far as I can gather&mdash;and I worked very closely with his predecessors in this particular field&mdash;there must still be applications from the Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, a few from India, Columbia and Peru.  The two in South America are quite important even though they are far away, but the people in South America in the main are of Christian origin and Fr. Cregan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am a Christian democrat and it is one of the driving forces we have.  Father Cregan has been doing slum clearance work in Columbia.  I should like to thank the Minister for having given a hospital in Peru last year a year's supply of medicine. That was a tremendous effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the coming year I would hope that every effort will be made to ensure that a greater proportion of the Vote being provided by the Department will be channelled through the Christian missionaries.  When I say &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;, I mean Church of Ireland or Catholic.  They have all over the years done a tremendous job, and it is <Col N="292" /> recognised that there is a greater scope and a greater need for channelling money in support of community projects that our missionaries have in hand.  Perhaps next year, even if the Minister does not get around to bringing in a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose alone, he will do his best to ensure that the original 1973 target will be at least maintained if not exceeded.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned direct elections to the European Parliament, and I would hope that at the next EEC summit the Taoiseach will press for a definite date to be fixed, whether it is in May or June 1979 or the autumn of this year.  It is necessary to fix a definite date because there is a clear need for the greater democratisation of the Community.  I do not think the Community will surge forward again until people of the Community have an interest which should be awakened by direct elections.  I hear the dates of 6 and 7 June 1979 being mentioned.  At the next summit I hope the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs will do their best to come down on a definite date so that we will have something to work towards.</P>
    <P>The Minister during his opening remarks almost forgot a regional policy. Regional policy is an area I have more or less specialised in over the last few years.  I was President at the Commission during 1974-75 when the fund was founded and I worked very closely with Commissioner Thompson on getting the fund off the ground.  It is a pity we got such a small proportion, but £40 million is £40 million.  When the fund was begun our country had the only perfect regional structure of any of the Nine.  We had nine regional development organisations.  It is a pity that these organisations are not used more, and I would ask the Government seriously to consider giving the regional development organisations at least a voice in the ordering of the priorities of grant aid applications for their areas so that boards of the RDOs and the technical committees would be able to come together and say: &ldquo;We will place the projects that the Government submit on their B-list to Brussels in our <Col N="293" /> own order of priorities&rdquo;&mdash;what will suit their own country or their own region.</P>
    <P>I do not think that at this stage it is too much to ask.  People just decry the regional fund as if it were nothing. I do not think that is good enough.  The regulations clearly state that there should be a notice on each project, whether it is infrastructural, or a factory, saying that this project has been aided by the regional development fund.  While I go around a lot in this country I have never seen such a poster or notice declaring that.  There has been £40 million spent here and yet there is not a clearcut indication of improvement, and it is a pity.  It was pardonable in the first few years when we were anxious to get the fund moving that the Governments were allowed to allocate the money to on-going programmes where plans were already under way, even in cases where factories were built, but I think it is time for a change.</P>
    <P>I can see with the development of the consumer lobby in the Community a greater attack being made and being sustained against the common agricultural policy, which presently accounts for 83 per cent of the community budget.  That is a considerable amount of money.  If the CAP is to lose some of its financial allocation, the regional policy should benefit from it, because the regional fund is designed so that the wealthier regions share the burdens, and bring up the poorer areas to a higher standard.  No progress has been made in this over the past five years, or even over the three years since the fund was funded. The ratio of income per capita between the richest and the poorest areas is still something like 5.5 to 1.  This is an unacceptable figure.  No national Government is doing its part to really correct the situation.</P>
    <P>The great need in this country is for a transport policy.  We have never had a transport policy.  I am not satisfied that our transport industry is getting compensatory consideration for the fact that they are operating from an island and from the most peripheral region in Europe.  The Government is <Col N="294" /> not doing enough to equip our transport operators.  No matter where they go they must cross one or two channels to get to the lucrative markets in Europe.  It would be of tremendous help to the transport industry in bringing down costs if there were daily sailings to and from Rosslare.  This would necessitate the provision of a second pier there.  I hope that the Government will give priority consideration to expediting the provisions of that pier, so that we could get the Normandy Ferries which I think are the most popular for most of the lorries supplying to the Continent.  It would mean that they would not have to queue for perhaps a day at a time to get on.  It is unsatisfactory to have a sailing every second day.</P>
    <P>I was quite disappointed last year at the reluctance of some semi-State organisations to pull their weight and to co-operate with the people who are carrying out experiments that have been funded by the European Energy Commission and the Irish Science Council for the production of energy from fast growing forest trees.  It is surprising the numbers of State and semi-State organisations that have considerable acreages of land but are very reluctant to make some available for this important experiment.  I hope that the pressure will be kept on to ensure that all nationals, both Departments and semi-State organisations, will do their best to ensure that these experiments will be carried out as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned briefly the enlargement of the Community. Practically every month in the European Parliament we meet politicians from the applicant nations.  I estimate that Greece will gain admission perhaps in 1981.  That is not very far away and I wonder are we doing enough to prepare ourselves for enlargement. It is very difficult to speak against enlargement of the Community, but at the same time, there are so many areas of the Community where we have not got common policies.  It will really add to the problems if we just have the Community enlarged by people who will certainly benefit from membership, rather than contributing to membership.  This is <Col N="295" /> something that we would want to give more thought to.</P>
    <P>We must all welcome the return to democracy in Spain and Portugal.  A delegation from the Spanish Government party is coming here, either at the end of this month or next month, and there will be an opportunity for Members of the House to meet them, to hear their views on the Community, and on their aspirations for the community. I hope that every effort will be made by as many Senators as possible to have an exchange of views with these people when they come, so that they can make up their own minds on what the Community will be like after enlargement.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I could not agree with the Minister in relation to fisheries, when he said that the Government are doing enough.  It is a pity that the Government have not maintained the stand that the National Coalition Government made.  They made very good advances.  The ground gained has been more or less lost, leaving the entire fishing industry in a very difficult situation.  The Government will have to make greater efforts to introduce a national fisheries policy, to give these people a new sense of direction.  I do not know what the exact position is, but politicians from the other member states are so smug about the whole thing, and if they are quite happy with the progress of the negotiations, we certainly cannot be in a happy situation because that means that they are likely to get what they had looked for, off our shores and we will certainly suffer.  The Minister for Fisheries should have been more open and should have brought the public along with him by at least letting them know exactly what he was looking for.  From the discussions I have practically every week with my Dutch and Belgian colleagues, I have formed the opinion that the country has lost out to a considerable extent in this important area. I suppose when eventually the agreement is reached, the House will have an opportunity of discussing the new fishery agreement, that is, if agreement is ever reached.  The Minister for Fisheries has not given either the <Col N="296" /> fishermen, the Houses of the Oireachtas or the public open answers, so that we could make any sort of an honest assessment about exactly where we stand, or if we can compliment him in his role or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned COMECON and discussions Vice-President Haferkamp had during the year.  This is significant.  COMECON have up to now, over the last 20 years, refused to recognise the Community and have refused to have any dealings with it.  They are the last people to seek talks with us.  The Community presently have trade relations with something like 78 or 79 countries throughout the world and they are certainly the strongest trading block in the world.  We are very often slow to recognise that when we decry progress of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In relation to the common agricultural policy I am disappointed with the progress of the price talks, the price increases this year.  Perhaps it is because over the last four or five years the farming community have become accustomed to the agricultural price increases of the order of 29 per cent, 25 per cent, 19 per cent or 18 per cent that Deputy Clinton produced over the years for the farmers.  It is extraordinary that agricultural taxation should get a 40 per cent jump in the budget in a year when the Minister for Agriculture says he is expecting a 3 per cent increase in agricultural prices.  This is something which will take a bit of explaining.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have the answers to it.  In the common agricultural policy as a whole greater efforts should be made.  I hope that the Department of Agriculture will avail of every opportunity to secure greater expenditure to strengthen our allocation under the guidance section, because it is money that will aid the long-term development of our agricultural industry. It is a once-off expenditure as well.  If greater resources were transferred from the guarantee section to the guidance section it would give those consumer oriented people across the Community less scope for expressing views against the concept of the <Col N="297" /> common agricultural policy, a policy which we must accept has done a tremendous amount for every section of the community.  We do not speak sufficiently of the achievements of the Community.  Some people think that the common agricultural policy is a means by which the price for agricultural products paid to farmers is monitored.  At the same time it is designed to keep the price paid by the consumer down.  At present the Commission is paying considerable levies on flour, butter and many items used daily by housewives in this and in every country in the Community.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs every success in his work.  I hope he will be able to travel around the Community and make the necessary comparison. Our standards and way of life are preferable to many European areas. There is a greater contentment here with the ordinary state of family life than in any other part of the Community. That is something we should strive to foster and continue.  If we are able to push the development of our economy at the rate that the last Government pushed it, even coming out of a very difficult period, the country will go from strength to strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the appeal by Senator McDonald for help for the Third World.  In doing so I would draw attention, as he did, to the hidden contribution in this area.  The area in question relates to the contribution being made involuntarily by the taxpayer. There is the danger that emphasis on that area would cause us to overlook the tremendous contribution that is being made voluntarily by human beings in providing technical skills and money.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the speech he delivered.  I thank the Minister and his Department for putting together a pretty comprehensive survey of the European Community position and for setting out the very many advantages which we are getting from our membership of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refer to the absence of discussion. <Col N="298" /> We have not had opportunities to discuss and get to know what is happening in the Community.  Because of this lack of discussion there is a feeling that Europe is a bit of a mystery. That is not a good thing.  I therefore welcome the proposal to have more regular discussion.  I hope we will have it.  This has been promised before, but we are now in the position where we have four reports before us.  However it gives one the opportunity to cover the ground in relation to the European Community and to take stock of our position and of the Community's development since our original membership, bearing in mind that it was only on the 1 January of this year that we reached full membership, apart from one protocol.</P>
    <P>Despite some genuine disappointment in relation to the regional policy about which we had great expectations that were not fulfilled, Ireland has benefited enormously from membership of the Community.  Apart from the material aspects set out by the Minister here, our membership has brought us an increased sense of confidence in ourselves, brought about by success in areas such as exports and so on.  Our sense of identity has been strengthened by the continuous interaction between ourselves and the members of the Community.  That sort of benefit is intangible, but nevertheless it is significant.  We can be seen to be playing our part in the affairs of Europe, in the Council of Ministers, in the Commission, through our civil servants who are involved there, in the Parliament and in the parliamentary committees.  That is, despite all the forecasts of doom that we heard before we became members, and the way in which many people were frightened into believing that the reduction in tariffs and so on, would bring an end to everything here.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the past few years, some of which are covered in the reports, the areas in which we suffered economically, did not have as much to do with our membership of the European Community as many people appear to think.  A good deal of the ill effects, resulting in a considerable degree of unemployment <Col N="299" /> arose from a pretty fair measure of dumping of materials, partly from outside the Community, being imported through a member state, and also because of the effects of inflation itself, and in the areas of the textile trade recently, because of what we regard as the improper use of support in the United Kingdom employment subsidy which is having a considerable effect on the market here.  This question has been taken up by one of our Parliamentary members with the Commission, and the Commission is at present investigating it.</P>
    <P>I have found that in Ireland there is too much criticism of the European Community, mainly from people who tend to live in a rather narrow isolated world of their own.  As I have said already Ireland has been unsuccessful and I will deal with a couple of areas in which success has been notable. In the agricultural sphere there has been a dramatic change.  In many areas rural family life has been virtually lifted out of slum conditions caused largely by the policy of subsidisation of foodstuffs introduced in Britain during the last war and continued right up to the time of our entry to the Community.  The only prospect we had of getting our agriculture out of that situation was through membership of the European Community, which gave our agricultural foodstuffs the right of way into Europe.  As the Minister pointed out, we received substantial support amounting to something over £400 million for last year.  There is no question either of our dramatic success in the area of industrial exports to the United Kingdom and to other European countries.  There should be ahead of us now a period of considerable expansion in the export of Irish-made industrial goods, provided we are able to keep our cost increases well below that of our competitors. If, for example, we can keep down our cost of living index, and are able to agree on a salary and wage increase of not more than half that which may be agreed in Britain, where negotiations are also going on, the way will be open to our industrial enterprise arm to create many thousands of new jobs, jobs that could not be created <Col N="300" /> here in any other way.  The reverse could be the case.  If we were not prepared to be restrained and as a result were to drive up our inflationary rate, those thousands of potentially new jobs would never materialise, and over the next couple of years, many young people would have to remain idle, with its consequences.  In that sense, I believe it is in our power, to solve to a considerable extent our economic problems, the main area being the one which relates also to Europe, to get jobs, to bring an end to unemployment. I feel we can do this if we believe it is worth our while to do so.  There can be no doubt in the mind of anybody who objectively studies the situation, that if the recent oil and trade recession had taken place in a situation where we were not members of the European Community, the economic consequences that would have influenced our lives would have been very serious and far worse than what we have experienced.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the areas which are the most relevant at present the areas dealing with direct elections, with the expansion of membership, with the prospects of economic and monetary union, the question of a positive regional policy, and the policy of political co-operation in Europe.  Despite failure to make progress in many of the important areas to which I have referred, the bringing together of the nine member states&mdash;originally six now nine&mdash;and the slow but steady progress in integrating the economies of the nine countries, and the development of a community sense of citizenship, constitutes a significant contribution to stability and to peace in a very confused world.  At one time Europe was looked on by the rest of the world as a cockpit of war.  Now the very existence of the Community functioning through the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Parliament, helps to create the kind of stability which is essential to progress.  In that sense it is regrettable that the British attitude of reluctance and apparent lack of political decisiveness, is the only cause of delay in the holding of direct elections. The other eight members are for them, and are politically ready to go.  I admit <Col N="301" /> that the British have said that they are also for them but, nevertheless, their internal political situation is causing delay.  That situation does not, I would argue, justify failing to fix a date once and for all.  It is important that the Council of Ministers' meeting next April should fix a date.  It is not impossible to arrive at a date when all members, particularly Britain, would be able to have direct elections. This delay is preventing the normal democratic process from taking place and I believe it is necessary as soon as possible to give the European Parliament a greater feeling of democratic strength.</P>
    <P>The question of expansion of membership has been referred to here, and I am sure we all welcome the decisions of Greece, Spain and Portugal to apply for membership.  It is a very good thing to see&mdash;a gradual introduction of democracy and of the democratic way of life into these countries. Only those who have lived in countries that have not enjoyed complete freedom have any idea of the dangers and the fears, the political discrimination, that have been a major factor in many of these countries.  I welcome also the decision of the Council of Ministers to apply a democratic test to all future applicants to membership of the Community.  It is sensible to point out that, while we welcome the future expansion in membership, at the same time failure to date to apply a realistic regional policy, that is the development of the less developed or poorer areas of the Community, has left the Community in a position where some kind of accession period will have to be set out in regard to any future members because of the serious consequences that sudden accession could cause in economic terms within the existing Community.</P>
    <P>The question of economic and monetary union has been under discussion in some of the committees and in the Parliament for quite a few years. This is a desirable long-term aim&mdash;I regard it as pretty long-term.  It is desirable because economic and monetary union should bring an end to economic instability and monetary fluctuations which have done so much <Col N="302" /> harm and indeed still continue to do damage.  Once economic and monetary union has been achieved, it should bring that sort of situation to an end, the kind of situation that has caused sudden changes in the values of currencies leading, in our situation, for example, during the previous administration, to the cost of servicing overseas loans being almost doubled within a few weeks.  However I believe that a realistic regional policy must be developed before one can even begin to think about economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Recently the European Council, that is the Heads of State, gave some of their time to this question of regional policy.  Most of us would agree with the view that the European Council was originally envisaged to meet so as to give the Community political direction at the highest level and create the political will to move forward.  Such a will would have allowed the Community to read just its sights, to concentrate on what could be achieved in the short term, be it economic and monetary union, social union or democratisation of the institutions.  Experience so far has shown that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>It would seem at present as if the European Council&mdash;and I refer to the Heads of State, not the Council of Ministers&mdash;has now become a sort of appeal court.  When the Council of Foreign Ministers have failed to arrive at decisions which they should arrive at under the treaty, the fixing, for example, of the amount of regional fund should not become a preoccupation of the Heads of Government.  It should form part and parcel of the Community framework itself and the size of the fund should be agreed to in the ordinary budgetary way.  In that sense a regional fund must be accompanied by a Community regional policy.  I cannot see this coming about if member states are constantly haggling over the amount of the fund.  A Community regional policy, backed by a realistic fund, must be viewed as the mechanism by which balanced development can take place within the Community so that the gap between the well-off and the less well-off regions can be narrowed by the application of <Col N="303" /> a realistic regional fund which is substantial enough to ensure progress.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the area of political co-operation, which I regard as being potentially of major significance to all the members of the Community and indeed to the other European countries and to ourselves.  This is becoming an increasingly important area in Europe. As the Community integrates itself, the development of a common foreign policy and the political evaluation of what approach should be adopted towards, say, the Middle East problem or other areas, will become increasingly necessary.  The development of a consensus foreign policy will probably take some considerable amount of time.  It will be necessary, for example, for the Nine Ministers to adopt a common stance which can have an impact on any situation that may arise which, of course, would be much more preferable than to have the position where the policy adopted was simply a reaction to events rather than an anticipation of them, which we have experienced in the last few years.  In that sense, the beneficial effect of any development can be influenced by pooling our ideas in the interests of maintaining stability and influencing where possible situations such as that existing in the Middle East.  That is the way in which I believe political co-operation should develop and at the present time new means have been evolved whereby the Commission and the Parliamentary Committee involved and the Council of Ministers will have the opportunity at regular intervals to exchange views on different political problems.  If that procedure develops successfully I believe it may be the beginning of a means of arriving at a consensus policy for the Community whereby all member states, through the institutions, can contribute to the building of a better Europe and, we would hope, to the building of a better world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion when we discussed the European elections some weeks ago I took the opportunity then, with your indulgence, to make a far-ranging survey of the whole question of our membership <Col N="304" /> of the EEC.  I do not propose to repeat any of that this evening.  Nevertheless there are one or two points I would like to expand and in that way to take advantage of this motion.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, first of all, that Senator Mary Robinson, referring to my contribution, said that I must be living in an ivory tower if I thought that the whole topic of the EEC was a bore.  She reminded me that the decisions made in Brussels constantly impinge on our lives in Ireland and, of course, I accept that.  I just want to clarify that as regards public interest in the EEC it is, I think, almost non-existent or at least it is certainly not at a very high level and I made the point that those who are interested in getting a high vote for the direct elections would want to take that into account.  Of course, I accept that, and indeed it is becoming painfully and increasingly evident that the directives from Brussels are impinging on every facet of our life here.  While I accept that correction by Senator Robinson, I still maintain that there is a level of public apathy about the EEC that our politicians who are interested in bringing out a high vote should note carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Senator Brugha's speech with attention and with some disbelief because it seems to me that he represents the kind of person who is involved in EEC politics and therefore tends to project his own interest to the nation at large here.  I cannot accept, for example, that membership of the EEC has in any way strengthened our identity.  In that connection, during the period of the great debate in 1971-72 I maintained that that type of argument was meretricious anyway; I did not see that going into Europe or staying out of Europe would make any difference to our sense of identity, that this is really a kind of internal matter, a matter for our own national personality.  In the event, I cannot see any evidence that our membership of the EEC has in any sense strengthened our national identity here.  Tens of thousands of Irish people go on holidays to Europe and a number of them make, as I have already said, jaunts to Brussels&mdash;sometimes <Col N="305" /> well subsidised&mdash;but the overall impact has been very slight on our national identity.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha referred to the fact that Britain is foot-dragging on the matter of direct elections.  The reason why Britain is foot-dragging is very simple.  No true Englishman can think of the Mother of Parliaments being somehow downgraded by a European Parliament and in Britain there is a deep-seated resistance to any kind of political integration of that sort.  I agree with Deputy John Kelly, one of whose main concerns is the degree of imitativeness in Irish life and normally I do not take what Britain does, or what English people say, as a model but I think in this one case we have a lesson to learn from the very cool approach English people have towards the EEC.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed the EEC and the matter of direct elections we have increasing evidence that there is no &ldquo;give&rdquo; in Brussels about our special needs on fishing.  The fact is that the big brothers having plundered their own coastal waters are now intent on plundering ours.  As an independent Senator I think it is very much a matter of party politics for people to say that Deputy Garret FitzGerald would do better than the Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I think that the Minister or Deputy FitzGerald is equally irrelevant in this case; the fact is that there is no question of getting any kind of recognition of our special interests as a poor relation in the EEC.</P>
    <P>One of the passages in the document we have here introduced from the Minister has a section on the EEC and Africa.  I think this is typical of EEC policy towards the outside world: the whole approach towards Africa is bland; there is much talk about Southern Africa and the need to establish majority rule in places like Rhodesia.  What we have here, of course, is a concern and a very self-interested concern for political stability in Africa, in our own interests.  In general it might be said that anything the EEC does in relation to Africa and the Third World generally is only the repayment of a colonial debt or else a matter of enlightened self-interest. <Col N="306" /> But I do not see anywhere in this document a specific reference to South Africa.  There is the comfortable and safe blanket description of &ldquo;Southern Africa&rdquo; but there is no reference to the position in South Africa and to the very negation of democracy in South Africa, to the system of apartheid. Surely if the EEC is concerned with democracy, if it is fastidious about the admission of nations like Spain and Portugal and Greece, if it says: &ldquo;We welcome them because they are now democratic&rdquo;, it should apply the same standards to Africa as a whole.  I think that our parliamentarians in the EEC and our Ministers in the Council of Ministers should press for a strong policy in the matter of apartheid in South Africa.  I should think indeed that it would be in conformity with the EEC's professed concern for democracy that it should adopt a policy about banning advertisements for employment in South Africa.  There is no day that we do not have recruiting boards in our cities and advertising of positions in South Africa attracting our citizens to that country.  That is all an implicit acceptance of the viciously anti-democratic system which obtains in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I must say that Senator Brugha's remarks on foreign policy did nothing to reassure the feelings of disturbance I have about that section in the Minister's speech which says:</P>
    <P>The Nine continue to meet regularly at Ministerial and official level to consult on and as far as possible to co-ordinate their foreign policy positions.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing is sliding in, as you might say, unbeknownst to us.  What does this mean for us?  Does it mean that we are going to surrender whatever shred of foreign policy we have left and pool it again at the direction of our masters in Brussels?</P>
    <P>During the campaign on the referendum in 1972 we were solemnly assured that membership would not affect our traditional sovereignty, our traditional neutrality and would in no circumstances mean a military alliance or participation in a military alliance.  I am aware that there have been specific disclaimers in the other House by the <Col N="307" /> Ministers concerned that there is any intention on our part to join NATO or join in a military alliance but it seems to me that if you talk about a common EEC foreign policy it necessarily entails the consideration of a military alliance.  To that I am totally opposed and I believe I speak for a great number of my fellow-countrymen. That is something which should be watched carefully.  In no way will there be acceptance of a military alliance in this country and in no way is neutrality and whatever sovereignty we have left going to be further eroded by participation in a military alliance. Far from being comforted or excited by this prospect of a common foreign policy I am extremely disturbed by it.</P>
    <P>I accept membership as a fact but I do not see it through the rose-tinted spectacles which are too commonly worn in both Houses on the question of Europe.  Senator Keating's observations in this regard are very sensible&mdash; his reference to matters like Brussels pressure on the question of nuclear energy in Ireland, Brussels pressure on the Irish steel situation.  Indeed the recent Dublin visit to the Minister by the Commissioner concerned did not allay any worry on that score.  I believe Senator Keating was right when the advised our representatives in the EEC to recognise that we are in it for good or ill but to adopt a tough and cool attitude in all our European deliberations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address myself to these various statutory reports we have had <i>vis-à-vis</i> our involvement in the EEC. I particularly welcome this debate but in doing so I regret the delay there has been before reaching it.  I am not saying that in a partisan political sense, because we have been culpable since our entry in not being up-to-date in arranging debates on this issue of our involvement.  This series of reports starts with 7 July 1976, so we are really discussing today events which are historical to a large extent and I regret that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with one or two points Senator Murphy made in his interesting contribution, particularly <Col N="308" /> in regard to Africa and the EEC and his view that there is less than adequate commitment by the EEC to the South African position on the issue of apartheid.  I cannot go along with him on that because, having read the most recent report of July 1977, there was an unequivocal commitment against apartheid as practised in South Africa.  In the section on Africa in which reference is made to Rhodesia and Namibia it says that there is continued concern at the failure of South Africa to facilitate an internationally acceptable solution to the problem of Namibia.  In addition to that, the Nine marked the international day for the elimination of racial discrimination in March 1977 by sending a message to the Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid the text of which read&mdash;I will not quote it all:</P>
    <P>The people and governments in the nine countries of the European Community unreservedly reject all forms of racial discrimination as defined in Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of Forms of Racial Discrimination.  In particular they condemn the degrading practice of apartheid in the concept of separate communities for different races... believe that all people, whatever their race or colour, have the right to take part on an equal footing in the life and the institutions of their country and should be enabled to do so.  The Nine governments are opposed to all forms of racial, religious and political discrimination wherever they may occur.</P>
    <P>The text of a further declaration from Ministers of the Nine is contained in Annex 6 of the same publication. Again there is an unequivocal commitment and a general declaration on Africa.  I will not read it because it is one page long.  In the context of the South African position, I see a note here that the foreign Ministers repeated their condemnation of the policy of apartheid in South Africa and would continue to oppose all forms of racial discrimination wherever it exists.  So, the commitment is fairly strong there.  It leads us to the <Col N="309" /> consideration of matters concerning the Third World and the recent controversy in the newspapers again this week about the lack of adequate commitment by the Government to the Third World.  Frankly, I believe that in a civilised and Christian country, a country which has had such a sense of mission to the Third World since our early history we must have the strongest possible commitment to the Third World and to attempting to eliminate as far as we can the poverty and the paucity of development which exists there.</P>
    <P>We must do this from a humanitarian point of view.  Even if we wanted to be pragmatic and narrow and even if we wanted to think exclusively in economic terms, if we continually go to the EEC and seek special treatment within an EEC context on the basis that we are the poorest and the least developed country of the Nine&mdash; which is absolutely true, taking into account the <i>per capita</i> income within this country in comparison with the other eight&mdash;we have an extremely weak case if we are going there against a background of less than adequate commitment by our country to the Third World.  In my view everything is relative; whilst we are poor in the EEC context there is no doubt that we are living on the fat of the land in terms of Third World conditions.  I do not think it is sufficient justification of present policy to suggest, as somebody suggested recently, that the Irish contribution has been that of strong, human involvement in the Third World through the missionaries, both religious and lay, that we have sent there for generations.  That is merely part of the commitment there should be.  The commitment of our people in going to the Third World, the establishment of missionary, medical and other relief centres is a tremendous headline for this country and is one of the great achievements of this country in this century.  It is even more important that if there is this type of voluntary contribution from the churches and from the professions and from so many lay people it should be backed officially by whichever Government is in power at that time.  I would agree with a policy of <Col N="310" /> giving them all we can in terms of a proportion of the gross national product.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy to an extent, but his slight cynicism, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator chooses to call it that, realism, I accept his point, to an extent.  It seems to me that within this country there has been a continuing sense of euphoria which has not ceased since we became members.  There are good reasons for optimism and good reasons for encouragement based on the performance to date since we became members.  It has helped our country greatly.  Obviously, as Senator Murphy suggested, the EEC has not strengthened our identity but I do not know that we necessarily want it to strengthen our identity because I think there is already a very strong sense of national identity.</P>
      <P>The EEC psychologically have helped us enormously to shed some of our introspection, the introspection of living in an island, the introspection of speaking our own language along with the English language, the introspection of continuing dominance by Britain in matters of trade, the introspection of the continual conflict on this island both North and South.  Involvement in Europe has helped this country enormously in broadening the perspectives of people and of Governments, Oppositions and politicians, and this has been greatly welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these benefits which we have had, we do not appreciate sufficiently here the reservations there are among other member states, particularly among the larger member states, about the EEC as a unit and about the problems that centre on issues such as sovereignty, about which we certainly have an easier view than the British have or than the French would have. We do not appreciate sufficiently the political reservations in Britain or the lack of will there for economic or monetary union or ultimate political union.  There is very strong opinion against such concepts of which we <Col N="311" /> would be in broad support, and the involvement of some of the larger member states is merely on a pragmatic basis.  The tendency of the French is to continue to be a large nation state and to go their own way in so far as they possibly can in regard to many of the rules of the institutions of EEC.</P>
    <P>There is possibly a lack of appreciation here also of the German attitude. There is a very strong German nation, one of the most powerful economically in the world at this time, holding great power in the economic and monetary field, a Germany which in the earlier years of the EEC showed a generosity in the economic area in terms of subventing a large slice of the EEC budget to help less prosperous regions in many different respects including agricultural policies.  There is not sufficient appreciation within this country of the distinct changes there have been in German policy, not just in a governmental sense but in a bipartisan sense, and among the German people who do not feel any longer a sense of guilt in a modern generation for the happenings of the Second World War and who do not feel that with their strong economy they must pay for the weaknesses there are in other economies in Europe. The resultant restraints stem from that attitude so that only a fraction of the regional and other funding we were taught to believe we would have when we entered the EEC is available.  I do not think this factor of Germany or one or two of the other stronger nations is sufficiently appreciated here.  We still tend to be a little more optimistic and possibly a little more euphoric than we should.</P>
    <P>I will go from that into one or two specific items.  The Regional Fund in particular has to me been singly the greatest disappointment since our involvement in the EEC.  My disappointment with the Regional Fund stems to a very large extent from my west of Ireland background in County Mayo because one of the planks in the referendum which had such overwhelming support when we advocated membership of the EEC was that the west of our country, where we have the lowest <i>per capita</i> income with the <Col N="312" /> smallest size farm unit, with land of subsistence level or less in many parts, at least would benefit, through being the poorest single region in the projected European Economic Community of the nine countries, from substantial funds pouring into it for infrastructural reasons and for all kinds of other reasons which merited voting in favour of Europe.  This has not emerged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in raising in the Seanad the inadequacy of information being provided in relation to the supplementary welfare allowances under the Act which came into force last July is to highlight the shameful failure to carry out the clear legislative intent in that Act.  The Act was welcomed as a new measure which abolished the old home assistance scheme with its connotations of public charity and poor law relief for the destitute.  The new Act was to replace this with an entirely different approach of the entitlement to benefits based on the assessment of need and the provision of further supplementary allowances where these were justified on the basis of need.  This is very clearly set out in section 2 of the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act, 1975.  Section 2 of that Act provides:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unhappily, this clear legislative intent is not being carried through and the ultimate responsibility for this must rest with the Minister.  In the seven months since the Act came into force there has been a striking failure to implement in practice the clear legislative intent which was welcomed on all sides of the House when the Bill went through in 1975.  I am sorry the Minister is not able to be here this evening.  I was informed of this privately, I understand the reason, and <Col N="313" /> I accept that Ministers cannot always be present when matters are raised like this on the Adjournment.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for being here to respond to this Adjournment Debate.</P>
    <P>The new Act is not being implemented in the way that was intended and in the way that is clearly provided in section 2 of the Act because there are, to say the least of it, curious and very worrying deficiencies in three areas on which I want to focus tonight.  The first is in the application forms being used to claim the benefits, the second is in the information provided by the Department about the whole supplementary welfare allowance scheme, and the third is in the general publicity&mdash;or, as I am going to point out, lack of publicity&mdash;about the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>I will begin with the application forms because this is possibly the most serious matter.  Under the old home assistance scheme in force prior to last July the application forms which were filled in by persons seeking home assistance had a heading &ldquo;Eastern Health Board&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Home Assistance Application&rdquo; and the serial number was M.39/76.  This form asked for details of name and address, date of birth, rent payable, to whom, differential and so on, particulars of persons residing in the household, particulars of members of the family not residing with the applicant, a declaration by the applicant that the information is not false or misleading, and over the page a certificate by the home assistance officer.</P>
    <P>A shameful situation prevails in that the old home assistance forms are still being used.  They were being used yesterday to my knowledge in health centres in Crumlin, Cabra, Tallaght and Ballymun, and these forms have superimposed on them the fact that it is now a supplementary welfare allowance application.  Where there would have been reference to the home assistance officer there is now reference to the community welfare officer &mdash;merely a change in the name.  There is a change in the name on the form but it has the same serial number M.39/76.</P>
    <P>In other words, the old home assistance <Col N="314" /> form is still being used for people applying for benefits, a form which departs from the clear legislative intent.  This form does not convey to the applicant that he is entitled to benefits as of right on the basis of assessment of his needs.  Furthermore, it does not convey to the applicant that the applicant has a right of appeal. I will come to the question of appeals separately later.  This form does not perform probably the most important thing and that is to convey to the applicant that an entirely new scheme operates.  How on earth are the people who are supposed to be benefiting from supplementary welfare allowance&mdash;and let us remember that these are the poorest section of the community, the truly deprived, the destitute, those who are suddenly bereft or long-term without any means, probably without a permanent address, who may be living in borstals, who may be in very impoverished and deprived circumstances&mdash;to know there is an entirely new scheme in operation?  Before last July they filled in a form identical to this except that it had the word &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;supplementary welfare allowance&rdquo;. How on earth are they going to know that there is now an entirely new legislative intent about the benefits to which they are entitled?  That is why I use strong words like &ldquo;shameful&rdquo;. I believe it is shameful.  It is an indictment of our society when a situation like that can carry on for a considerable period.  Lest there be any doubt about whether these forms are in use in the health centres I wish to put it on the records of the House that as of yesterday, the 7th February 1978&mdash;seven months after the Act itself came into force&mdash;these forms were being used in Ballyfermot in the health centre there, in the health centre in Main Street, Tallaght, in the health centre in Quarry Road, Cabra and in the health centre in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>The usual attitude of the community welfare officer is to hand out these forms to anybody who comes to apply. In some cases the community welfare officer assists the applicant in filling in the form.  In other cases, and specifically in the Tallaght area, for example, the person is told to take <Col N="315" /> away the form and come back a day or so later with the form completed. Again I would maintain that in view of the type of person who would be applying, and given the special needs of such a person, this is entirely inadequate. These people require full assistance and a clear explanation of the form.  In particular one of the key factors which must be explained is the change from the old home assistance scheme to the supplementary allowance scheme, and that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement as of right to benefits based on need.  It should be emphasised that part of the change from the old home assistance scheme to the supplementary allowance scheme was that the supplementary allowance scheme was a scheme giving a right to benefit based on need and furthermore if persons were dissatisfied with the assessment&mdash;that if they felt their rights were being infringed, or that they were not being given the proper treatment by the community welfare officer&mdash;then they were to have a right of appeal which is clearly set out in the Act at section 7, which provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a person who is dissatisfied with the determination of an officer of the health board of a claim by him for supplementary welfare allowance an appeal shall lie against that determination to a person (being either another officer of the health board or a person not such an officer) appointed or designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may by regulations made under section 21 of this Act provide for the making and determination of appeals under this section.</P>
    <P>The present form being used gives the persons no idea that they have any right of appeal.  That, as I say is shameful. That is disgraceful, because the clear legislative intent is that they would have not only a right of appeal but a right to know that they have a right of appeal These forms are often just handed out to people who cannot know what their rights are.</P>
    <P>Furthermore I would maintain that <Col N="316" /> there is a deficiency in any case in the appeal system, because it is clear from section 7 that the legislative intent was that the Minister would make regulations providing for an appeal either to somebody in the health board or some other person. Regrettably the appeal is to one person rather than to a three-man appeal tribunal, but that is the clear meaning of the section.  However, no such regulations providing for an appeal structure have been made by the Minister. He informally designated the programme officer in each health board area.  That, again, I would maintain is entirely inadequate when we are talking about rights of beneficiaries&mdash; a right for beneficiaries in very real need&mdash;who are entitled to appeal from what they claim to be a wrong determination of their needs in the particular case.  The whole approach seems to be one of continuing the discretionary aspect and of playing down or indeed disguising the fact that it is a question of rights which includes a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a serious distortion in the implementation of the Act.  It is disgraceful that seven months after it came into force the old home assistance forms are being used with only the change of name of the person implementing it from home assistance officer to community welfare officer. That is my first point: that the application forms are denying the legislative intent, are not informing the applicant of a right of appeal, and are not making it clear that the whole scheme is on a new basis and that there is a new approach which should be of benefit to these people who are in need.  The second point is that there has been a failure to provide general information about the scheme.  I would refer here to the annual booklet brought out by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am sure it is familiar to everybody in this House. Deputies and Senators use this a lot in their advice centres, and other local representatives use it.  It is a very useful booklet published in April each year by the Department, giving a summary of social insurance and social assistance services.  This one is the booklet for the year 1977 published in <Col N="317" /> April 1977.  At page 77 of that booklet it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Act, 1975, provides for the replacement of home assistance by a new scheme of supplementary welfare allowances. The Act will be brought into operation by Ministerial order and full particulars will be published when this is being done.</P>
    <P>I would maintain that full particulars were not so published.  I will come to the other aspect of publicity as my third point.  Full particulars should have meant that as of July 1977 there would be either an entirely revised booklet of the Department or alternatively an insert to be put into the existing booklet, which would be circulated to everybody who had this booklet not just the local representatives, social workers, and local community officers, but also to the potential beneficiaries, to anybody in receipt of social welfare who might be somebody who would be entitled to a supplementary allowance.  One of the most important aspects of the 1975 Act which came into force last July is that it is supposed to be a supplementary allowance Act which provides for a minimum based on need and if necessary a supplement.  So it is an Act that should be of interest not just to those who might have been receiving the old home assistance, but to other people who although they are receiving some other benefit have genuine needs which can be assessed, have special need because of the particular circumstances&mdash;because of the family circumstances, because of the number of child dependants, adult dependants or whatever it may be, because of a lack of a home, the lack of shelter and the lack of adequate food&mdash;and therefore it was important that the Department at the time of the implementation of the scheme circularised in leaflet form adequate information about the scheme.  This, as I say, could have been done either by a new booklet of all the schemes of the Department or else a leaflet that could be inserted into it.  Neither was in fact done.  I understand that there is now a one page leaflet in existence.  Apparently <Col N="318" /> it was to have been inserted into the booklet but it has still not been in fact circularised or inserted.  It may be in stock somewhere and available to be done, but it has not yet been done.</P>
    <P>The third failure was a failure to use the public media, both last July in particular, and at regular intervals since last July, to publicise the scheme. As Senators will know, this is normal practice when an entirely new scheme is introduced.  The Department take large sections of space in the newspapers and advertise the scheme.  It is not uncommon for schemes to be advertised on radio and television to draw attention to the fact that there is a new scheme in operation and what the scope and intent of the scheme is.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that it is particularly necessary to do this when the people whom it is aimed at are those who are really in need, who are not mobile, who are not able to get around and who are not perhaps as highly motivated as others, and who therefore need to be reached out to and informed of their rights; informed that they can apply and that they can be assessed on the basis of need and that apart from the minimum they can either get a supplementary allowance in money or other form of supplement to ensure that their basic needs are satisfied.  The only advertisement of these benefits that I could find since last July was contained in a general advertisement of the improvements in all social assistance and social welfare allowances as of last October. It is under a general heading &ldquo;All Social Assistance Pensions and Allowances Increased&rdquo;.  The table following shows the current and the new maximum weekly rates of payment applicable generally from the beginning of October 1977.  This included all benefits such as non-contributory old-age pensions, blind pensions, widows' pensions, single women's allowances and so on.  Under the heading &ldquo;Supplementary Welfare Allowance&rdquo; it shows the increase from the original figure in July of £9.80 a week for a man to £10.30 as the increased rate.  It does not give any indication in this advertisement that there is also <Col N="319" /> entitlement to supplementary assistance in case of need, and this contrasts very strikingly with the advertising and operation of supplementary legislation in other jurisdictions&mdash;in Northern Ireland or in Britatin and elsewhere&mdash; where this type of scheme is in operation which is very regrettable indeed.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is necessary to ensure, first of all, that new and adequate forms are used for the applicants themselves, because they are the people we should be most concerned about.  I did come into possession of a copy of something called the &ldquo;Claim Form for Supplementary Allowance&rdquo;.  This is a form which clearly was intended to give an account of the new scheme and it is my understanding that in one or two of the health centres at the moment the community welfare officers use it not as a form&mdash;even though it would be better than an old home assistance form&mdash;but they use it as an explanatory leaflet if somebody asks them about the terms of the scheme. I do not know what happened about this form: whether the Department decided in some way to have new forms and then did not like the look of them when they saw them and suppressed them, but certainly this is not the form actually being used.  This is not the form in general circulation. It is used in two of the health centres I mentioned by some community welfare officers just to give an indication of the kind of scheme it is.</P>
    <P>But what is needed is the immediate introduction of a new claim form: the publicising of the scheme by means of an explanatory leaflet circulated by the Department, and also very substantial publication in the media of the terms of the scheme.  Furthermore, I would say that there is a strict statutory duty to introduce a proper appeal structure. The Minister should bring in regulations establishing an appeal structure as he is required to do under section 7 of the Act.  There should be a standardisation of the approach by community welfare officers to applicants under this Act.</P>
    <P>I have made the various points that I wanted to make this evening.  I think that it is important, as a final <Col N="320" /> point, to ensure that there is uniform behaviour and response by community welfare officers in implementing the scheme: that they do assist people in filling in the forms, and that they inform people of their rights, of their right of appeal and of the supplementary aspect of these benefits, because that was the clear legislative intent and that is what we must ensure becomes the practical implementation of the Act on the ground in the health centres for those in need.</P>

      <P>The unavoidable absence of the Minister for Social Welfare affords me this opportunity to visit the Seanad for the first time in my capacity as Minister of State.  I would like to take the opportunity to say to you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and to the Members of the Seanad, that I look forward to working in close co-operation with you in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the many points made by the Senator are an accurate picture of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as it was designed to be and as it is in fact.  At the outset, lest there be any doubt in Senators' minds, I feel I should state what exactly the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is intended to do. The title of the scheme and of the Act under which it is administered may give the impression to some that allowances are payable only as a supplement to some other income. This is not so.  What the scheme has done is to replace the old home assistance system which provided help to necessitous persons on a purely discretionary basis.  One of the principal objectives of the new scheme was to give, as of right, to every person in the State whose means were insufficient to meet his needs and those of his dependants, a title to a specified rate of allowance.  The amounts of the allowance to which persons with no means are entitled are spelled out in the Act.  The method of assessment of means is also specified in the Act and a person who has some means receives the specified allowance less the amount of the means.  The first <Col N="321" /> thing that the scheme was designed to do was to ensure that persons with no means, or with little means, received the basic allowance as of right.  I am satisfied that the scheme does this.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister for State saying that I am inaccurate?  Is he saying that I am wrong in asserting that these modified home assistance forms are the forms being used?  These were the forms being used yesterday in these health centres.  How am I inaccurate, and how is the new scheme possibly being implemented through the use of these forms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing the scheme was designed to do was to ensure that everyone with no means or with little means would receive a basic allowance as of right.  I am satisfied that the scheme does this.  This is in sharp contrast with the old home assistance scheme where payments varying from county to county were made to destitute people on the purely subjective judgment of a home assistance officer.  Now the amount payable and the method of assessment of means are determined statutorily and the old poor law approach and the stigma which unfortunately attached to it have thereby been eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the specific allowance the scheme provides for a variety of additional allowances to meet special or urgent needs.  In the case of special needs this usually takes the form of a continuing addition to the basic allowance or other income while urgent need is usually met by way of a single payment. Special needs may arise in a number of ways.  A person may have to pay a high rent for accommodation. In such a case he could qualify for an additional allowance to supplement his basic allowance, other social welfare benefits or income from any other source.  Likewise if a person or his dependants because of old age, ill-health or infirmity require extra warmth, an additional allowance for heating can be made.  A person with extra expense due to special dietary needs would get a supplement in respect <Col N="322" /> of these needs.  These are only some examples of the circumstances in which additional allowances may be paid under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Urgent needs can arise in people's lives as a result of unforeseen events. A death in the family can on many occasions involve expenses which cannot be met out of ordinary income. Disaster caused by, for example, outbreak of fire or floods may require the replacement of some essential items of furniture and clothing.  More mundane emergencies are such situations as the threatened cutting off of electricity or gas because of the inability to meet bills at the time due.  The scheme is designed and has provision to deal with all these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I stress that in the matter of the basic allowance, its calculation and the title to it, there is no discretion whatsoever. If a person has no means he qualifies for the full amount of the allowance; if he has some means he qualifies for a reduced allowance. There is of necessity a certain discretionary element in determining the amount of some of the additional allowances, but the community welfare officers are expected to perform their duties with common sense and humanity and to exercise their judgment and discretion not only for the relief but also for the detection of need.  I am satisfied that in general those officers do live up to the humane standards expected of them.</P>
    <P>On the question of publicity and information I do not agree that the applicants for supplementary welfare allowances are not given adequate information about their rights.  Shortly before the introduction of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme in July 1977 a special Press conference was held to announce the commencement of the scheme and full information was given about the scheme in a Press release issued by the Government Information Services.  At the time this was given wide coverage in the Press and on radio and television.  Apart from my own Department many voluntary organisations and other agencies are monitoring this scheme and are providing information to those who may need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have had the question of a large advertisement in the newspapers under consideration for some time, and I am happy to say that the advertisement will appear in the papers on Sunday next.</P>

      <P>This advertisement will draw attention to the scheme and will inform the public of the benefits available, how to claim and where they can get further information.  Attention will be drawn in the advertisement to the right of appeal if a person is dissatisfied with a decision on his or her claim.  These measures should make doubly sure that no one will remain unaware of the existence of the scheme or of his right under it.</P>

    <P>As to the administration of the scheme I should explain that while it is under the Minister's general direction and control it is administered by the regional health boards as part of their community care programme.  In order that there would be uniformity of administration throughout the country guidelines were issued by the Department to the community welfare officers who were directly involved in the implementation of the scheme. These community welfare officers, contrary to what has been said, have power to award supplementary welfare allowances without reference to higher authorities, and in fact normally do so.  There may, however, in some cases be a limit on the amount they may <Col N="324" /> award by way of a single payment, and they may have to seek approval from their supervisors.  This is a reasonable requirement and I am not aware that it causes any delays.  Senior officers can always be readily contacted personally or by telephone when required.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding about the circumstances in which my consent has to be sought for payment of an allowance.  The only occasion on which my consent is necessary is where it is proposed to make a continuing additional allowance of more than £5 a week.  Incidentally I would not withhold my consent to any such proposal without very compelling reasons and I am glad to say that to date all such proposals have been approved.  No limit is imposed on the amount which a health board may grant in cases of urgent need; it is a matter entirely within their own competence.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of the system of appeals at present in operation under the scheme. While I do not necessarily maintain that the present system is the best one, I do wish to point out that there is an appeals system and the persons whose applications are rejected are informed of their right to appeal. These appeals are determined by senior administrative officers of the health boards appointed by me for that purpose.  It is true that I have not used the powers given to me in the Act which permit me to make regulations governing the appeals.  I have not done this because so far the present informal procedures appear to be working reasonably well.  The number of appeals has been small and they have been dealt with quickly and efficiently.  I have received many suggestions regarding the appeals system and the introduction of more formal and elaborate structures.  I am weighing all the considerations involved in these suggestions and I will, I hope, in the near future be in a position to make a decision as to which system would best serve the needs of the claimants to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that generally the scheme is operating <Col N="325" /> reasonably satisfactorily.  It has provided assistance as of right to a substantial number of persons and families who are unfortunately unable to provide properly for themselves.  It is a comparatively new measure and undoubtedly has had teething troubles. Every effort is being made to remedy the deficiencies that came to light. Further training of the field staff is in hand and emphasis is being laid on the administration of the scheme in the <Col N="326" /> most liberal and humane fashion.  On this point of the teething problems I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare the point made by the Senator with regard to the form and I have no doubt that the Minister himself will be in contact with her on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 February 1978.</P>
