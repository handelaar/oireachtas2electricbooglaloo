      <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirleach, I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my sense of shock and outrage at the murder of Signor Aldo Moro.  This murder was a calculated attack on the Italian parliamentary system and an attempt to undermine democracy in that country, and is something which in one way or another affects all of us in every democratic country.  I hope I may, on behalf of the Seanad, express the sympathy of all Members with the family of Signor Moro.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House wish to be associated with this vote of sympathy.  We, too, are shocked at this savage deed, not only because we share a lot in common with the people of Italy and the <Col N="2" /> Christian Democratic Party of Europe to which we as a group belong, but because the countries of Europe feel at the moment that they must unite solidly together to promote and preserve the democratic system that Signor Moro so ardently believed in and for which he gave his life in dedicated work.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> On Second Stage I tried to initiate a discussion on the principle of the licensing of road haulage and my contention was that it is now time to consider the abolition of licensing altogether. Clearly if one accepts the Bill in principle, as we accepted it on Second Stage, then these are two incompatible aims.  I still think that is the correct course and that the abolition of licensing will be forced on us by the EEC at any rate, so in one sense we are talking unreally here.  If one agrees with that, what can be done?  The licensing system in this Bill should be widened and the substance of all the amendments I am putting forward is to try to widen the scope of the licensing system.  Clearly the argument is a technical one &mdash; it is how far do you extend your scope?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the general argument to start with because I seem to be the only Member of the House who put forward the idea that licences should be abolished.  Nobody else supported this.  People said that licences should not be made too restrictive, they should be wider, they should give more scope for people who already have not got licences to operate in road haulage systems.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the case for retaining some sort of licence as against the case for abolishing road haulage licences altogether.  I referred to the position of CIE, and certainly when the licensing system was started the argument was that we wanted to protect our own national transport system which was in a delicate position.</P>
    <P>The industrial development of the country was at a much lower level than it is now and the whole system has changed.  As far as I could gather from the Minister's reply on Second Stage, licensing is not now needed to protect CIE.  There is an unanswered substantive argument as to whether there should be licensing at all and perhaps the Minister would refer to it on this section.  Certain countries in the EEC have no licences and others have a less restricted licensing system than our own.  One of the very telling facts against licensing that I produced <Col N="5" /> on Second Stage was that in 1973, the latest year for which I was able to get figures, in cross-Border haulage the northern-based hauliers hauled three times the total tonnage that was hauled by southern-based hauliers.  This was clearly due to our destrictive licensing system.  If I was a haulier living in the Cathaoirleach's area I would have a handy little office just a mile or so across the Border and I would operate all my lorries and pay all my taxes up there.  Only a handful of road haulage licences have been issued since the initial Act in 1933.  They change hands now at a premium of £9,000 per licence and that cost is passed directly on to the consumer in higher transport charges.  One of the arguments we get in every economic report is that transport costs internally are far too high, and one of the reasons clearly is the restrictive licensing system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Second Stage debate that if one accepts that there has to be licensing &mdash; I do not accept that&mdash;then the question is to decide the cut-off point.  The Minister said when he was making decisions in the Bill as to the figures which I have asked in these amendments to be extended and enlarged, he was guided by expertise in other countries.  It is a subjective argument and by no means a political argument.  There is no division on the two sides of the House.  I was the only person to make the case for the abolition of licensing.  People on both sides of the House on Second Stage indicated clearly the situation as it stands, that very little attention is being paid to the law in certain parts of the country.  The law is being flouted right, left and centre.  Is there any point in making the sort of adjustments that the Minister is making in this Bill if people are going to continue to flout the law?  What is going to be done about that?  We should face up to the substantive problem and we should consider the abolition of licences.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a report which the Minister and his officials will have considered in their study of the situation.  It is the British Ministry of Transport Committee on Carriers' <Col N="6" /> Licensing Report when there was restrictive licensing in Britain.  The situation was not as restrictive as the situation here now but there was restrictive licensing.  I quote from the report at page 6:</P>
    <P>We therefore recommend:</P>
    <P>(1) <i>The abolition of all restrictions on the capacity of the road haulage industry and on the work for which a lorry may be used.</i> There should be no statutory bar to entry to the hire or rewards sector of the road transport industry.  Traders and manufacturers should be allowed to use their own vehicles for any work they choose to undertake, including carriage for hire or reward.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The introduction of a system of permits to ply as a carrier of goods</i> (whether for hire or reward or on own account or both).  These permits should be available on demand but held subject to good behaviour as regards all aspects of safety of lorries....</P>
    <P>That is essentially the case which I arguded&mdash;that the only restrictions regarding road haulage should be concerned with the safety of the vehicles. We might have to have overall restrictions on size applying to all vehicles on Irish roads, but I think as far as the general argument is concerned there should be no licensing at all.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6 are designed to exclude a larger class of essentially small vehicles.  The original figures in section 2 of the Bill were 2.5 metric tons unladen and 6 metric tons laden weight.  My amendment would be 4 metric tons unladen weight and 8 metric tons laden weight.  This would exclude a much larger number of vehicles from our present licensing system and it would mean more freedom and more flexibility in the road haulage industry.</P>

      <P>I support Senator West's amendments and in doing so I compliment him on the amount of research and the really intelligent study which he has devoted to this measure.  If it were not for him it would have passed very quickly through the House without <Col N="7" /> being challenged at all.  With regard to the general argument for the abolition of licences I would only have one objection to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I promise not to go any wider of the mark than Senator West did.  A passing reference is all I had in mind.  Not just the efficiency of the vehicle but the reliability of the driver is in question when you are thinking of a code of conduct.  In considering that it should be borne in mind that a very rigorously enforced code of practice and behaviour in the whole area of road transport would be worth considering.  The idea involved in these amendments would be to create a better industry, to promote more strenuous competition and ultimately to rid the roads of a lot of otiose, unnecessary and inefficient vehicular traffic which we have now. These amendments would certainly lead to a greater degree of professionalism in the situation as it exists and looking forward in the long term perhaps to examining more carefully the possibility of the abolition of licences entirely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic argument for the amendments put down by Senator West is that there should not be licensing of hauliers.  He is looking for the total abolition of the licensing system and his substantive argument is that there is a need to have everybody get into competition with everybody else.  Would he suggest that doctors should not be licensed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he suggest that dentists should not be licensed or that any other section of the community should not have within themselves some safeguard for the community, not for the industry itself?  I put the point that licensing is necessary.  His arguments are for the abolition of licensing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> He suggests that CIE do not need protection.  OK, CIE should not need protection.  His other argument is that this will be forced upon us by the EEC.  Nothing is going to be forced upon us by the EEC that this Government will not have a part in.  It will not be forced upon us.  He mentioned cross-Border haulage and that three times the volume of traffic was carried in 1973 by cross-Border hauliers in the North rather than in the South.  This is a substantive argument for the Minister's position in that in the North of Ireland more of the hauliers are licensed so therefore as a percentage of the tonnage carried licensed hauliers in the North carry more than licensed hauliers in the South.  I presume the Senator was not speaking of own-goods haulage when he mentioned haulage or goods hauled.  I presume he referred to licensed haulage.</P>
    <P>The safety of the vehicle is paramount. The safety of the public is also paramount.  If we do not have a licensing system we will not have safety for the public or safety for the driver.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>A variety exists in the control systems in the other EEC countries.  The only country in the EEC which has an exceptionally free system is Luxembourg and in all probability its location and its size have something to do with that.  It will be accepted that qualitative licensing will always be necessary because of the responsibility of the haulier for the property which has been entrusted to his care as well as in relation to road safety.</P>
      <P>Senator West is arguing not, as he says, for de-control but rather for quality control.  This is in accordance with my own policy and is introduced for the first time in this country in section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> Contrary to the views expressed by Senator West, there is no indication whatever that the EEC will bring in the abolition of licensing controls.</P>
    <P>I will just deal briefly with the whole question of liberalisation.  There seems to be an impression that liberalisation should take the form of a radical cutback on existing controls so as to open up the industry to a variety of newcomers. This is not in line with the situation with which I have to deal. The position is that from the thirties to the early seventies licensed hauliers operated under very severe restrictions. Only now in this Bill are we getting to the first significant easement on the control of fleet sizes established 45 years ago.  It is not just that the restrictions have prevented the emergence of a professional haulage industry able to keep up with the needs of our growing economy; we have, in addition, prevented existing licensees from exercising their business capabilities in full and earning commensurate awards.  There is another impression of this which appears to exist&mdash;that the licensees got their licences for nothing and can now cash them in on the artificial value which is attached to certain licences.  Of course this view is out of touch with reality.  Numerous licensees acquired their licences at considerable expense in very recent times.  For example, in the three years to the 31 December 1977 over 320, or nearly 40 per cent of the licences, have changed hands.  The people who acquired these licences, took their courage in their hands and made a very substantial investment and they simply cannot have their enterprise rewarded by arbitrarily writing them off at this stage.  Even in instances where licensees have held their licences from the very beginning, like every other long-held asset those licences have acquired an asset value which represents part of the investment in the business and which cannot be arbitrarily written off.</P>
    <P>From what I have said it follows that the first phase of liberation should be liberalisation of existing licences. These are the people who have the experience and who have the talent on which to build a new haulage industry. <Col N="10" /> They are the people who have borne the restrictions of the past and who are entitled to get the opportunity now and this is the first opportunity they have got to develop their business as they think fit.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to create conditions in which this development can take place.  The House will remember that during last week's debate some Senators felt that we should extend the exemption for light vehicles above the six metric tons laden weight proposed in the Bill and Senator West has made a specific suggestion that we should increase it to eight metric tons. I do not feel that we should.  The exemption proposed in the Bill is, I think generous.  It is intended to meet a particular requirement mainly in rural areas and it does not intrude to any great degree on the proper business of the professional haulage industry and I would include there CIE.  It will relieve it of some obligations which it could not economically discharge and I selected a cut-off level, as I mentioned in my Second Reading speech, which is recognised for a number of exemptions throughout the European Communities.  It is virtually certain that if we were to increase the cut-off as Senator West proposes we would have quite a considerable amount of interference in the licensee haulage business, and that includes CIE, and if I were to accept eight tons laden weight there is no reason why I should not accept ten tons laden weight.  What we should remember is that our basic aim in this Bill is to establish a highly efficient professional haulage business.  The people who are capable of doing this are the people who have, as I said previously, borne the brunt of the day in relation to this business over quite a considerable number of years under very restricted circumstances and I think that they should get the opportunity to do so.  By increasing the exempted weights we would simply be encroaching on the opportunity of these people to do what we want them to do, and what they are capable of doing, and what they are getting an opportunity of doing for <Col N="11" /> the first time.  In those circumstances I do not see how I could accept the amendment put forward by the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up some of the points raised by the Minister and by Senator Lanigan.  I appreciate Senator Lanigan's knowledge of and interest in the road haulage business.  I made it clear on Second Stage that I was not in favour of a total free-for-all approach in which there was no quality control and no safety control over the lorries on the road.  Of course I am not in favour of that but that would be the only control I would argue for.  We must have firmer controls, better controls and controls more efficiently administered than we have at present.  That would by my argument on the problem of safety of vehicles. As I said, and I would support the finding of the Geddes Report, that should be the only restriction on road haulage.  It is absolutely clear that the situation in Britain is different from this country.  I do not by any means advocate that we should slavishly follow everything that Britain does and every piece of British legislation.  I am always arguing against that but I think we should, and we are now in a position to do so, judge issues entirely on their merits.  If the recommendation of a report in Britain happens to suit our situation then we just make up our minds and we go ahead and choose whatever is necessary here.  If that particular recommendation suits us, that is the one we should choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Lanigan's point that anything the EEC does will not be done without the agreement of the Government in office.  However, as he knows only too well, the situation is just a bit more subtle than that.  One has only got to look at what is happening over the situation, say, in fisheries to realise that what the Government want is not necessarily what the EEC is going to agree on.  We all know this. We cannot expect to be a member state of an organisation like the European Economic Community and to have all take and no give.  One of the things <Col N="12" /> that is likely to be standardised in EEC terms is the whole problem of road haulage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned CIE and I should like to quote again from an article entitled &ldquo;Freight Back on the Rails&rdquo; in <i>Business and Finance,</i> April 1978, where it talks about the problem of CIE losing certain traffic but gearing itself up to give a more efficient service in certain areas.  We all agree that that is what CIE should be doing and I quote:</P>
    <P>While CIE believes that this may lead to the loss of certain traffic which cannot be integrated in the new system, there is considerable potential for increasing the railway share of the national unit load traffic movement.  It is expected that, with the wide coverage and improved train frequencies, it will be possible to offer a service which is competitive with road over the medium to long journeys.  This should result in increased business. The transfer to rail of this traffic should improve conditions on overcrowded roads particularly in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>  I certainly would support that.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that CIE are hoping to gain bulk traffic at one end of the scale and at the same time they are expecting to lose sundries and other smaller traffic down at the other end of the scale.  That is a natural development and is one that has been supported in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the various Bills concerned with the financing of CIE.</P>
    <P>In connection with the system of licensing which we are discussing, I should like to ask the Minister for some figures.  How many road haulage licences at present have been issued by his Department and in particular how many have been issued since 1933? It is my feeling that relatively few licences have been issued since 1933. The whole situation has changed.  I can see no reason for this.  The Minister said that present licensees should have the opportunity to get appropriate financial reward for their work.  If licences are changing hands at the current price of £9,000 they cannot be <Col N="13" /> things out of which people are not making money.  Somebody in the industry said they were licences to print money.  If a road haulage licence costs £9,000 then people must be making lots of money out of those licences. Perhaps some of the road hauliers, because of the restrictions, are doing extremely well.  Anybody who is prepared to pay out £9,000 is doing it because, even at current prices and with the present restrictions &mdash; and the present restrictions are more restrictive than the figures the Minister gives in this Bill &mdash; there is a lot of money to be made out of road haulage presently without this Bill at all.  My contention is that because of the restrictive system, because of the cartel system which the licences at present are operating, which is maintained by the State, some people are making too much money.  If the system was opened up and if there were no licences except for quality licences then we would have a more competitive road haulage industry and the costs all round of road transport inside the State and from the State to, say, Northern Ireland, would be lower. I would like the Minister to give the number of licences issued at present and the total number of licences which have been issued since 1933.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of licences issued from 1933 to 1945 was 850.  These are the general merchandise licences.  No new licences of that type have been issued since then but quite a number of merchandise licences other than existing carrier licences were issued, for example, for refrigerated transport and for various other types of commodities.  The total number of general merchandise licences is 850.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the point made by the Senator in relation to the present value of the licences, it could be said that the effort and energy of the people concerned with these licences made up their businesses and really it is a transfer of a business and not a transfer of a licence.  They would not otherwise be worth the money that is being paid for them.  I can remember when I came into the Dáil first I found quite a large number of people who had omitted <Col N="14" /> to pay the sum necessary to keep a licence alive&mdash;I think it was £1 a year &mdash;it was of such little value at that time or prior to that time.  So if they have achieved a value now it is because of the effort that was put into it by the people concerned and that is why I feel we should give every opportunity to the holders of the merchandise licences plus CIE to prove themselves.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to provide a professional, up-to-date haulage business. If we are successful in that and if we can convince a number of industries that are presently using what is generally known as own-account transport that they should transfer to licensed haulage then it would be to the advantage not just of the licensed hauliers but also of CIE.  Perhaps, more important still, it will leave capital available for the development of the industry and the provision of new jobs.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned with making any change in the Bill which would take from the opportunities which we are making available to the licensed hauliers and to CIE to develop.  I believe that any increase in the unladen or laden weight granted in this Bill would have the effect of reducing the opportunities available to the licensed hauliers and in these circumstances I could not accept the amendment.  I am prepared to give the licensed hauliers the opportunity which they never had until now because the vast majority of them were restricted to one vehicle per licence and we will see how that will work.  Of course if it is necessary to make a change in that respect in future we can always consider doing so.  As things stand at the moment I think we should not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>

      <P>To put the record straight, or in case anybody is under any misapprehension, I have an interest in the haulage business.  In dealing with this Bill I must say that I would be arguing against my own interests in the sense that I am not involved in haulage but my family have been involved <Col N="15" /> in own-goods haulage and are still involved in own-goods haulage. To that degree I assure Senator West that I am not speaking on a sectional basis.  In a sense, I could be said to be talking against my own interests.  On that basis I hope he will accept that what I have said has been totally in line with what has been presented in the Bill.  I have not been dealing with the Bill on a sectional basis.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned that the charge of £9,000 was a licence to print money. I would just ask him how much it costs to put a student through college today to get him into the situation where he can go into business?  He should relate the cost of putting a student through college to the cost of a licence and there lies the kernal of the question which he has asked.</P>

      <P>I fully accept what Senator Lanigan has said about his own interest.  I did not mean that he was being sectional in any way or I certainly would not have implied it.  What I did mean to indicate was that he knows something about the business because he has the experience.  In a sense I was saying that his contribution would be more valuable on that account.  What I would ask him &mdash; and I think he might comment on this&mdash;are the figures that we are arguing about in these amendments likely to cause people who operate own-account haulage to transfer to a licensed haulier?  That is something the Minister has just said is one of the aims of these figures and is this likely to happen.</P>

      <P>I would say even more so.  The situation would be better if we had a higher-lower limit for the licences.  The Minister keeps on saying that if we widen the licensing system we will discriminate against decent people who have licences.  What about the people who have not licences or the people who have not been able to get licences?  We have been discriminating against them since 1933.  I am not criticising the Minister or any political party but he says that the hauliers <Col N="16" /> have, of their own effort, made something out of the Irish haulage.  I am not trying to run down the hauliers at all.  I think that there are many people who are doing extremely well. If the situation exists, as it has existed, and will I believe exist after this Bill, the haulage licensing set-up will be too restricted in the national interest.  I do think that there has been severe discrimination on behalf of the authorities against the people who have not had licences.  It has been virtually impossible to get licences in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Of course, as I said on Second Stage the law is flouted right, left and centre.  In some parts of the country having a plate or not having a plate does not matter at all.  The Minister and his officials know this.  In some parts of the country the Garda Síochána have given up the unequal struggle of trying to prosecute people who have not got licences and who are hauling goods for other people.  Everybody knows that.</P>
      <P>Some of the specific items that I have put down on amendment are to try to overcome this problem.  I believe that this situation is going to pertain after the passage of this Bill.  We are passing a Bill which we know in advance is going to be flouted right, left and centre.  That is one of the things that worries me about this whole situation.  If it was somewhat more liberal &mdash; and that is the purpose of these amendments &mdash; then a more reasonable law could be enforced and there would be some hope that public opinion would support the law.  As the Minister knows, if you have a law which public opinion regards as too restrictive or as favouring one particular group of people, then the public will pay very little attention to it.  The Minister knows quite well that that is the situation at the moment.  I should like to think that it will not be the situation after this Bill is passed but I regret to say that the plate business, after the passage of this Bill, will be flouted in all directions in certain parts of the country as it has been flouted before.</P>

      <P>If you were an independent observer at the back and you had to try to decide between Senators Lanigan and West as to who the haulier up front was, I am afraid there would be no need to show your decision. Senator West has submitted his amendments only for the sake of submitting amendments.  With respect&mdash; and I know a wee bit about this business myself &mdash; he is quoting from journals and magazines instead of speaking about the real grassroots of the haulage business since 1933.  Anybody who secured a limited licence in 1933 and has held it for 45 years, built up a business in dark and evil days when there were restrictive practices in restricted areas, when licences were issued for ten miles, 50 miles, for one county or for two counties per province. Today, they are issued for the Twenty-six Counties.  These licences were for a limited type of merchandise, for itemised commodities.  It was only as a result of various amendments that we got licences for general haulage for the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to liberalise the haulage business in order to modernise it so that the hauliers will be able to compete effectively with their European counterparts, where they will have roll-on roll-off facilities with the same efficiency as continental hauliers.  The Northern hauliers also take a sizeable amount of haulage business from the South.  I wish to compliment the Minister for this liberalisation.  The Bill was wisely scrutinised for many months.  It was the result of close consultation with the people in the business.  There is an old saying &ldquo;There is no one for the Army but the soldier&rdquo;, and there is no one able to talk about the haulage business but those engaged in it.  They are the people providing the service. Senator West spoke about other people being discriminated against since 1933 and I say to him that were it not for the people engaged in road haulage who kept the wheels of industry moving, our transport system would have been a failure during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a small licensed premises <Col N="18" /> in the country costs anything from £40,000 to £70,000, yet a haulage business can be bought for £5,000 to £9,000, having been built up over the last 45 years.  That is not profitable unless the business can be modernised and is allowed to compete effectively with continental hauliers.  It should be modernised on European lines.  If our hauliers are able to modernise and compete they will be able to expand their business and provide a service not only for this country but also for the European Community.</P>

      <P>I have not got the information here but, in any case, I operated on the basis of what was happening in other EEC countries. With regard to Senator West's point where he suggested that I was discriminating against those who did not get licences, I want to make it clear that it is not a question of discrimination; it is a question of how the industry will be developed so that it will be capable of competing in the EEC.  I believe that by liberalising the transport system, as set down in the Bill, we will be giving an opportunity to our hauliers for the first time to compete on equal terms.  These hauliers are professionals. They have, as Senator O'Toole said, operated this business over a number of years and they did <Col N="19" /> so under very restricted conditions.  It was not possible for them to compete with hauliers in countries where the system was more liberal.  There was a reason, in the 1933 and 1944 Acts, why it was decided against liberalisation.  It was intended to see if it was possible to provide more goods for transport by CIE.  We now accept that that idea was not a successful one and for that reason the first real effort at liberalisation was made in 1971 and now this Bill goes much further.  The people who operated this business, including CIE, have the right to get the chance to develop which they did not have before.  Any increase in the laden or unladen weights will have a detrimental effect.  If all we had to do was throw the gates open for everyone to come into the industry, there would be professionals, non-professionals and in the early stages, at least, a fair amount of chaos.  If we develop the industry along the lines laid down in this Bill we will achieve a professional and worth-while haulage industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways I am quite prepared to accede to your ruling that we do not run through this particular discussion again but it is important to have it debated at one stage on Committee Stage because all the amendments are on the same line. First of all, I cannot accept Senator O'Toole's assertion that he is an independent observer over there.  The only Independents are over here, along this little stretch of bench.  Much as I appreciate Senator O'Toole's knowledge of the industry, there is a very powerful road haulage lobby.  I do not blame them for putting their point which they will do with a great deal of force and they have every right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument I have been trying to put forward is that it may not be in the national interest to accept everything that the road hauliers ask for. Senator O'Toole almost asserted that this Bill was everything the road hauliers asked for.  I do not believe that because I do not think any Minister would ever be in a position <Col N="20" /> to accept everything one particular lobby asked for.  On the other hand, in my argument I am trying to look at the question from a wider point of view.  The kernal of my point is that more liberal legislation would reduce transport costs nationally.</P>
    <P>My own opinion &mdash; and I think that Senator O'Toole and Senator Lanigan might agree with me &mdash; that any really efficient road haulier and anybody who has worked in the business since 1933 and has the professionalism, the correct equipment, well-trained drivers and a really first-class concern, will do well no matter what the legislation is governing the road haulage industry. My concern is that a restrictive legislation can protect someone who in fact is inefficient and who may not be running his lorries properly and who is not giving as good a service as could be given by someone else down the road, but the fact is that he has the licence and the other man has not.  The amendments are all addressed to this. The Minister said, in reply to Senator Markey, that he has taken the position of the other EEC countries into account.  Britain did have a restrictive road haulage licensing system but decided to abolish it.  The British industrial position is considerably different from our industrial situation but that does not mean that this particular thought should not be in our minds.</P>

It is stated in that book that there is no restriction on those who wish to stand for a university constituency but that they be over 21 and be Irish citizens.  There is a restriction on people standing for the panels.  They must have certain expertise in agriculture, industry, administration or cultural education to stand in open competition.</P>

      <P>I think they know about it.  I still think that my amendment is right and that the high or low limit on the weight of truck which comes into the licensing system would be desirable.  I would not try to undermine the CIE situation.  I am not clear from what the Minister has said whether my amendment would widely affect CIE.  It seems to me that they are not worried about the lower end of the trade.  What they are interested in is the development of bulk transport, freight trains and so on.  They would not be worried about this extension. The Minister may not notice this but I have been a supporter of CIE in every relevant Bill that has come before this House since I entered the House eight years ago.  Perhaps I am the only Member of the House who does not own a motor car &mdash; maybe there is a glamorous Senator on the far side who also does not own one although she may have bought one since her increase in salary.  I would accept that sections of this Bill would adversely affect the position of CIE.</P>

      <P>This is merely to widen the area where restrictions on agricultural goods at present apply regarding the carriage of animals.  My original intention was to try to frame an amendment which exempted all agricultural goods from this Bill.  In view of the rapid development of our agricultural industry that would be a good thing.  I felt that the amendment had no chance of being accepted so I decided to settle for an amendment which would link horses with cattle, sheep or pigs in being exempt from the merchandise licensing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned already in my Second Reading speech that I was opposed to commodity exemptions and I explained that the exemption for cereals was proposed only for historic reasons.  The exemption for cattle, sheep and pigs appears in this Bill and is simply a re-enactment of the exemption as introduced in 1971.  A proposal made in 1971 to have horses included was rejected at that time.  My objection to the exemption is more one of principle than of application to specific commodities but objection to commodities can be relevant. The suggestion that horses should be exempt simply because cattle, sheep and pigs are exempt is no more valid than a proposal that any other animal or, in fact, any other item should be exempted because cattle, sheep and pigs are exempt.</P>
      <P>The transport of cattle, sheep and pigs is unique in that it relates to a highly-specialised traffic which links the farm, the marts and the food industry. It is for this reason it was exempted in 1971.  I cannot see where any of the considerations here would favour the exemption of horses.  As I said previously, I am opposed to commodity exemptions because if one continues along the lines of exempting various commodities one would end up where one would have practically everything exempted and that would defeat our purpose of trying to build up an efficient industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Reference was made by Senators on Second Stage to the exemption of seaweed and general agricultural haulage. We have had cases made to the Department, and made on previous Bills, for the exemption of fish, livestock, fertilisers, soft fruit, lime, forest timber and so on.  If we are to follow this up we would simply be exempting everything and we would not be able to develop the type of haulage system that we all desire.  In most instances the various matters or commodities that are suggested for exemption would result in one-way haulage only.  As I mentioned in my statement in relation to own-account haulage, that would be inefficient because that is what makes own-account haulage inefficient&mdash;the haulage can only be done in one direction. This means in effect that two vehicles would be necessary to do the work of one and this has an effect not only on the haulage business but on the environment, on the roads and so on. I prefer to confine myself to the exemptions which are outlined in the Bill.  To continue to exempt a variety of commodities would have the effect of hindering rather than helping the development of a professional road haulage industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has seemed to put forward an argument in principle which would indicate that he does not agree with the exemption of cattle, sheep or pigs.  If he argues in principle the honest thing to do would be to abolish subsection (b) of this section altogether but if one accepts the principle that farm animals are exempt from the restrictions then I really think that horses should be exempt, too, as being a similar type of animal.  If one accepts cattle, sheep or pigs then one should accept horses as an exempt livestock.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 25, after &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;sugar beet,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is to include sugar beet as a crop, along with wheat, oats or barley, which would be exempt in moving from the farm to <Col N="24" /> the processing stage.  This is one of the commodities to which no law applies at all as far as I can see. There is the widest flouting of the restrictions by plate in the sugar beet growing areas.  I am certain that this will continue and it seems to me that for exactly the reasons that the Minister says &mdash; historic reasons; they were more than historic at the time they were put forward &mdash; newly-harvested wheat, oats or barley are exempt from the licensing restrictions, sugar beet, too, should be exempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The same arguments apply to this amendment as the arguments put forward in relation to the previous amendment.  I might add here that CIE and the licensed hauliers are doing an excellent job in getting in the beet harvest and I think we should leave it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that CIE and the licensed hauliers are not doing enough because there are not just enough CIE and licensed hauliers around when the sugar beet all comes in together.  Everybody knows that. The licensed hauliers and CIE are doing their best but their best is not good enough and that is why the law is flouted left, right and centre at the time of the sugar beet harvest.  The problem of transporting sugar beet is a very considerable problem and I would agree with the Minister that CIE and the licensed hauliers are doing, their best but their best is not good enough.</P>

      <P>I disagree with Senator West.  I would suggest that if there is some backlog of materials going into the factory that the holdup is at factory level.  It is not at transportation level.  The materials can be got to the factory if the factory can take them but, due to a lot of other problems, when the harvest comes in at one time the problem is not one of haulage but of taking in the product at the factory end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that as one of the problems in the beet industry but this Bill does not stretch to regulating the sugar beet industry.  There are four factories taking in sugar beet, their intake is limited <Col N="25" /> so that they can only take it in at certain times and the licensed part of the haulage industry cannot cope with it.  Everybody knows this and everybody knows that the stuff is hauled by people without plates.  That is the reason I propose that sugar beet be included in this section.</P>
      <P>This argument does not apply to the trade of horses.  There is not a great unlicensed trade of horses but there is a great unlicensed carriage of sugar beet.  We know the various difficulties. It is a very bulky crop.  It tends to be grown in certain parts of the country very widely and these areas have a certain number of licensed hauliers.  I have grave doubts about factory restrictions.  The arguments which applied when exemption was granted for wheat, oats or barley should be granted in the case of sugar beet.</P>

      <P>The Senator will recall that when I referred to illegal haulage I mentioned that I was convinced that because of the extra capacity which we are allowing to each haulier in the future, illegal haulage would become extinct.  Even if I were to accept what Senator West says about illegal haulage in relation to beet, which I am not accepting because I have not the evidence to show it.  Nevertheless I think he will agree that because we are going to increase the number of vehicles per licence, the licensed haulage industry and, as I said, CIE who have been dealing pretty well with this particular aspect of the agricultural industry, will be able to do it very much better in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the fines introduced by this legislation <Col N="26" /> stand at a maximum of £500 and that the forfeiture penalty has been eliminated.  Seeing that under this Bill it will be easier for a person to get a haulage licence and that we have exempted altogether hauliers up to 2.5 metric tons and that the aim is to have a more efficient and professional haulage service, I would have thought it would be all the more important to penalise illegal hauliers.  Anything which interferes with the obtaining of a more efficient haulage service should be heavily penalised.  The maximum fine of £500 is not high enough when one considers that the maximum has been £320 for the past couple of decades.  If one were to look at the fall in money values in that period the £320 would carry a par figure at present of at least £1,000.  In view of the fact that the forfeiture penalty has been eliminated I would have thought that a far more excessive fine would have been proposed in the Bill. The Minister is hoping that the extension of liberalisation of the licence system will in time eliminate illegal hauliers.  Then there is the problem of that.  There will always be people anxious and willing to take advantage of any illegal situation and will see a fine of £500 as a minimum imposition on them, when balanced against the monetary value of haulage loads being carried.  The equivalent of a fine of £500 could well be carried in the smallest corner of a present day haulage truck.  It is not a deterrent, particularly in view of the elimination of the forfeiture penalty, against illegal haulage in the future.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate what the opinion of the haulage association is in this regard.  I would have thought they would be quite adamant that there should be very heavy fines on illegal hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, the £500 fine is a satisfactory level. Senator Markey has mentioned the fact that forfeiture of the vehicle which was in the previous Bill was being dropped.  It has been dropped because it was just pure nonsense.  No justice would order the forfeiture of a vehicle worth £25,000 for a traffic offence or <Col N="27" /> other type of offence for illegal haulage. It was never done nor was it ever likely to be done.  It was bringing the law into disrepute to leave in a section which quite obviously would never operate.  I am convinced that the development which is possible under this Bill, where each licence holder who has one vehicle on his licence will now be entitled to have six and so on, will reduce the amount of illegal haulage which went on to some extent in the past.  It must be remembered that the EEC Access Directive will have some relevance to this.  Those who enter the haulage business in the future, in some instances from 1 January, but also those who entered it from 1975, will have to conform to certain conditions. If people consistently break the law they may find themselves in very considerable difficulty.  I could not imagine anybody spending an enormous amount of money on a vehicle simply to engage in illegal haulage in the future. It is not like some years ago when you could buy a truck for a relatively small price.  Therefore, the fines proposed in the Bill are satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I have a note here on fines which were imposed in 1978 when the forfeiture of a vehicle was provided for. These fines were £20, £10, £10-£15, £50, £20, £10, £5, £5, £10 and £20, in different cases although a considerably higher amount of fine could have been imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It has just occurred to me that the figures the Minister read out for fines seem to indicate that the district justices who imposed them did not take a very serious view of breaches of the Road Haulage Acts. I would like to know from the Minister if we are going to be serious about this.  Is some sort of effort to be made to crack down on illegal road haulage once this Bill has been passed and is the Minister's Department going to contact the appropriate authorities and the Garda and say &ldquo;Look, now we have a liberal Road Haulage Act and we want you to really get on the tails of all illegal road hauliers, have them up in court and have them find&rdquo;?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the fines as they stand are reasonable because the liberalisation which has been allowed in the Bill will, as the Minister said, stop a lot of the illegal haulage which has developed.  It has not developed because people were deliberately flouting the law.  It was developing in areas in which there was a need for haulage of a type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the motivation behind the original penalty of the forfeiture clause, it was certainly not introduced in the existing legislation as something to be largely ignored. At the time it was introduced it was introduced quite seriously as a measure for which there was need and which would be imposed when the occasion required.  The fact that it has now been withdrawn altogether would appear to be a case for a much heavier fine on conviction than is at present applicable, even in simple monetary terms.  Certainly £320 in present day monetary terms would be at least £1,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned EEC directives on safety control, quality standard, testing and so on.  Whether those directives will ever penetrate down to illegal hauliers, who would find themselves in very hot water as a result of not complying with them, is something about which I have some doubt. Those directives will be aimed largely at the licensees rather than illegal hauliers.</P>
      <P>The whole question of whether the fine is appropriate or not is mostly one of individual judgement.  I do not think it is adequate as a deterrent for illegal haulage in the future and I foresee such illegal haulage continuing.</P>

      <P>Arising from the remarks of the Minister about the rather derisory fines imposed on people who <Col N="29" /> have been in breach of the Road Haulage Acts, the situation that keeps emerging from every section of this debate is that it seems there is to be no extension of licences and therefore existing hauliers are to be allowed more and more to increase their licences. The situation that exists is one where we have to admit that the law is not just being flouted but it has been admitted from the other side that a genuine void exists and this void has been filled by illegal hauliers all over the country.  What is needed is a larger extension of licences to a larger number of people rather than an increase of the powers of the people who have got them.</P>
      <P>You could almost hear the engines of the Opposition revving up at the beginning of the debate when Senator West moved his amendment.  It was suggested that he was only putting down his amendments to pass the time: he was a frivolous mathematician wandering in from the shaven lawns of Trinity College among the lorries.  It is reasonable that the haulage lobby should protect itself, but it should not try to run an innocent man like Senator West into the ditch.  That seems to be the process that is going on today. Certainly on the next amendment, No. 6 I think a very strong point is to be made for this amendment.  It is a situation where one has to fight back.</P>

I might also add that it is not correct to say there has not been an extension of licences.  In the Bill we are introducing a new type of licence which is for import-export traffic and we are granting licences in the enlarged exempted areas.  Senator <Col N="30" /> Martin suggested that we regarded the amendments as frivolous.  We certainly do not.  The fact that I do not accept the amendments is one matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 10, to delete &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would have the effect of giving the holder of a current licence an opportunity further to increase his fleet by a factor of ten rather than of six.  Again it is a matter of judgment.  If this amendment were accepted it would help the licensees and I would be inclined to give them more leeway rather than less, seeing that one has accepted the fact, whether one agrees to or not, that licensing remains.  I argued with Senator O'Toole on section 2 that there should not be any licensing, but section 2 has been passed.  My argument is that we should extend the number of trucks per licence from six to ten.  This would be in favour of the people who at present hold road hauliers' licences.  The question is how far does one go in this respect.  I think increasing the numbers somewhat further than the proposal the Minister has made would help to increase the efficiency of the people who currently have licences.</P>

      <P>I disagree with Senator West because I think that he is misinterpreting the Bill.  It is not multiplying the number of vehicles by six, it is multiplying the number of vehicles per licence.  There can be more than <Col N="31" /> one vehicle on a licence, so you multiply and you can get your multiplier up to such a degree that you will have total liberalisation, which is what the Senator was on at the beginning in his first amendment and which is what he is back to.  I would suggest that six is a reasonable number and I think that within, the industry it would be considered a reasonable number.  There have been problems in the past where people have been stuck with two licences and it meant that if they wanted to change from the carriage of grain to the carriage of heavy vehicles they had to buy a licence.  They now have the multiplier.  They can have an articulated unit, a flat bodied unit or a low loader.  I think the multiplier of six per licence is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator West has said, this is a matter of judgment.  My judgment is that it should be six and I spent considerable time considering this aspect of the matter.  I considered the number suggested by Senator West and I decided ultimately on six.  I might add that on Second Reading Senator Kilbride felt that it would endanger the small man to have a minimum of six vehicles per licence. He visualised that the small operator who could not, for some reason put on more than one or two vehicles would be uncompetitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the larger firms.  That is one extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West suggested in his proposal that the multiplier should be greater than six because six is too small.  I wanted to give him an idea of the different views that there are on this matter.  Generally speaking, I felt that the haulier with six vehicles or, as I said earlier, between five and ten, was in the best position from the point of view of the safest type of business. I decided that I would stick to six mainly because of the fact that on the Continent five to ten appeared to be the number.  We here are in a somewhat different position from the continental situation because of our size and I felt that six would be the best number for this country.  Of course it would also affect the numbers at the top, that is, I had a maximum of 80 which meant <Col N="32" /> that in some instances the multiplier was less than six.  If we were to have a multiplier of ten there would be too much compression; at the top figure of 80 large and medium firms would be too close and therefore I thought that six was the best and the Senator himself said it was clearly a matter of judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there are 800 licences at present. Can he tell us how many trucks these 800 licences cover? I am a little concerned about the growth that could be and perhaps the Minister could indicate whether from his representations and discussions with the hauliers' association and other interests he can tell us if it is anticipated that a considerable number of existing licensees will take up this opportunity of having six trucks per licence on the road instead of one truck per licence.  I am a little concerned there might be too quick a growth in the number of haulage trucks on the roads, considering the condition the roads are in now. One certainly cannot foresee any reduction in the number of haulage trucks that will operate from Northern Ireland in and out of the Republic.  One cannot in the short term contemplate any great reduction in the number of haulage trucks licensed within the Republic. I certainly do not contemplate in the short term any great reduction in the number of illegal haulage operations also in the Republic, so I am concerned about the effect on the roads and the road network generally if there is a considerable increase in the number of haulage trucks which could operate in the short term.  I would be obliged if the Minister could give me first of all the number of trucks which the present 800 licences cover, whether the multiplier in the Bill is the result of his discussions with the hauliers' association or other interests, whether he thinks there will be an increase in the short term which could impose certain dangers from the point of view of the safety of the existing road network.</P>

      <P>I was reminding the Senator in case he had forgotten.  I do not think he need be concerned about rapid growth because by contrast with the North of Ireland where haulage transport was liberalised in 1967, we still have the vast majority of hauliers with only one vehicle.  I do not think it is likely to grow as quickly as all that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that roughly similar circumstances would be likely to apply but apart from that, the figures we have show that, when liberalisation took place in the North, the total number of vehicles was reduced there.  I think that was possibly for two reasons, one that perhaps in some instances there were larger vehicles.  As well, there was a transfer from one-account licensed hauliers, which is our objective, and that would reduce the number of vehicles on the road as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the number is a matter of judgement.  What will the Minister's policy be as to the issuing of new general merchandise licences?  The number in this section and the number that I have proposed in the amendment, from six to ten, would be greatly affected by the issue of new licences, and if the Minister could give some indication of his policy there, then we would be in a better position to make judgment on the appropriate number of vehicles per licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience in other countries the number six will produce an upper limit which has not been achieved, say, in Northern Ireland except in a few instances.  I do not think six or ten will make all that much <Col N="34" /> difference.  With regard to what my policy will be, of course we are giving an opportunity here to the hauliers to develop and I will be watching very carefully how they respond to it because it is on that basis that any further consideration will be given to the issue of licences.</P>

We have to be satisfied that there is a need in a particular area. To date we have not found that particular need.  I would hope that, with the increase which is possible under this Bill when it becomes law, the haulage industry will cater better than ever before for the business which is available for them provided they become as highly professional as I hope they will now that the restrictions under which they worked previously will have been removed.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3) (a), page 6, line 4, to delete &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to extend the area in the shape of a circle centered at the General Post Offices in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway to circles of uniform radius of 30 miles, and allow free carriage of merchandise in these areas.  I know that the cities differ in size, and perhaps that is the argument for the different radius which the Minister has proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the city of Cork, for example. The development of Cork is becoming very spread out.  It has moved <Col N="36" /> out along both sides of Cork harbour, east and south of the city, and if one wanted to be realistic about the industrial area in Cork which is covered by the general global term of Cork city area&mdash;the Cork industrial area&mdash;it certainly would need a radius of more than 20 miles from the principal post office, particularly if the distances are measured by road.  I take it these are not distances measured as the crow files&mdash;that is a crucial point&mdash;that these are distances measured by road, and if they are distances measured by road, then 20 miles is certainly not enough for the Cork city industrial area.  The Minister might clarify that for me.  Are these distances measured as the crow flies, in other words on a map, or are they measured by road?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the restriction would not be quite so severe, but I still think there is a case, particularly in the Dublin area, for extending the radius to 30 miles.  All the principal towns in the country should be treated equally and there should be a radius of 30 miles in which there can be free unlicensed carriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator West.  The differential between Dublin, Cork and the other provincial towns should be somewhat more than five miles.  The very nature of Dublin and Cork cities should demand a bigger radius there than 20 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened here is that these were the exempted areas. I decided that I would license the people who operated vehicles within the exempted areas, and to more or less compensate for that and to cover the point made by Senator West that we would extend the area to take in a more realistic area, I extended the various areas by five miles.  I considered extending them further but I found&mdash;and the Senator will find this if he looks at a map&mdash;that if the areas are extended very much further than five miles they will be overlapping. There would be the liberalised type of system that Senator West is looking for except that it would exclude <Col N="37" /> parts of Kerry and a couple of marginal areas along the west coast, but you would ultimately have a situation where everybody in the country, apart from those few places, would be entitled to have a licence as of right so that it would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>My main purpose is, and my reason for licensing the operators within these new areas, was that there would be a kind of pilot scheme for the testing out of quality controls, but to extend them any further than I did would simply mean that we would have the whole country included.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 6, line 26, after &ldquo;(S.I. No. 386 of 1977)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or seeks to engage principally in merchandise transport to or from Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to overcome or to make an attempt to overcome the imbalance in the transport figures crossing the Border which I quoted the last time.  I do not have the figures I quoted, but the gist of the figures is that in 1968 the tonnage carried across Border by Northern-based hauliers was equal to the tonnage carried by Southern-based hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there was a liberalisation in the Transport Acts governing the industry in Northern Ireland so there were no restrictions under the licence other than in respect of the quality of the vehicle.  The situation changed so dramatically that in 1973 three times as much cross-Border tonnage was carried by hauliers based in Northern Ireland than by hauliers based in the Republic. That is a ludicrous situation.  It means that the situation we are amending through this Bill should have been amended many years ago. Everybody who goes out into the roads knows that the whole country is full of trucks from Northern Ireland. Maybe they are only carrying loads in <Col N="38" /> one direction, but I do not think they are; most of them get two-way loads. However they are dominating the situation in the Republic, and we should do something to give our hauliers a better opportunity.  The reason for this amendment is to give an exemption to hauliers who engage principally in transport to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the point made by the Senator relating to an imbalance.  This is part of the reason for the Bill.  We are trying to provide that our hauliers will be able to compete with Northern Ireland hauliers and with international hauliers generally.  In the particular circumstance there is not very much I can do about this amendment because under the provisions of section 6 (4) of the Bill the Minister can grant licences only for operation in the new areas designated in section 6 (3) so that the holder of a new area licence will be entitled to operate only within the new area specified in the licence; that is, for example, within 20 miles of the GPO, Dublin, 20 miles of the GPO in Cork, 15 miles of the GPO in the cases of Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  A licence granted under this provision would not entitle a person to go to Northern Ireland.  There is no point in the amendment.  The basic reason why this Bill was brought in was to give our people and opportunity to compete.  They could not compete where the vast majority of them could at best put only one vehicle on the road.  No matter how worthwhile, go-ahead or enthusiastic these holders of merchandise licences might be, they had not the opportunity of developing as they would like.  If he had only one vehicle per licence he could not develop his business without a very considerable input of capital.  In this Bill we are giving them an opportunity of providing more vehicles.  As soon as our hauliers begin to make use of the facilities available to them under the Bill, we will find that they are capable of competing with Northern Ireland hauliers.  The vehicles which are licensed in the new areas can operate only within the new areas.</P>

The Minister must know about the mess at customs clearance because it is on his back doorstep.  I am sure the Minister would be willing to consult with his colleagues in the Department of Finance, Customs and Excise, Revenue, or whoever are responsible for that frightful bungling in Dundalk.

      <P>The great advantage of reclamation and its importance is that it is capital expenditure which has lasting results.  The greatest asset that we have in this country is our land. Anything which can be done to improve the quality, productivity and potential of the land would receive support from both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Plans for reclamation have been mentioned many times.  Perhaps it is not widely realised that land reclamation, in particular drainage on virtually any scale and certainly on the scale envisaged in draining a major river, is enormously expensive.  This is one reason why it has been so difficult, with our limited financial resources, to do all that one would have wished to do I endorse the suggestion of my colleague, Senator Brennan, that this is an area in which we might reasonably hold discussions with the appropriate EEC authorities.  Any development or improvement in the land and in the resources of the Community generally would be an improvement to the whole Community and very much within the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  I hope that EEC support will be forthcoming in this matter.  We might reasonably look for such support from the EEC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On my appointment to the Office of Public Works I set about examining the overall position regarding the various draining schemes with particular emphasis on the river Shannon.  I studied the Rydell Report and the report prepared by the Office of Public Works and the ESB, and I was very impressed by the submissions in both reports.  I was somewhat disappointed to note that over the last number of years no effort was made to prepare the second stage of the investigation. On our entry to the EEC we had a golden opportunity to finalise that second report and to submit it to the Council of Ministers for their consideration. I have a particular interest in the reports.  Where drainage is concerned the Shannon is not just a big joke.  At the mention of the Shannon people seem to smile and say: &ldquo;Oh, are you going to drain the Shannon?&rdquo; The Shannon is something real for me and efforts must be made to bring this dream to reality.  The problem of the Shannon flooding has been the subject of much study and speculation over the last 150 years.  Some Senators have referred to the Rydell Report which was produced after the floods of 1954 and 1955.  Following that report, investigations and studies of the problems were carried out by the Office of Public Works with the aid of the ESB.  These investigations confirmed conclusions arrived at by Rydell, that there is no simple solution to the Shannon flood problem and that any acceptable solution must be sought in a comprehensive approach, <Col N="42" /> catering not only for flood relief on the Shannon but also for the tributory catchment drainage and providing for the needs of power, navigation, recreation and other uses of the river.  The investigations indicate that a solution on this basis is feasible both from the point of view of execution and economics.  However, it would be undoubtedly a complex project and the formidable proposals of engineering works involved are reflected in the estimated cost which I am led to believe is in the region of £70 million at today's prices.  The scarcity of capital at the disposal of the State and the many other development projects competing for the limited engineering resources available have been reasons for many years for the Shannon project being deferred.</P>
    <P>I understand that a full investigation would cost about £1 million.  We have lost precious time in this respect and this is one sad aspect of the whole problem of the Shannon river.  I am impressed by the arguments that it is a desirable project on economic, social and national grounds and therefore I have decided to have the matter reconsidered. I am having a new line of inquiry opened to see if funds for this great project can be secured.  If the results are favourable, and I hope they will be, I have no doubt that the Government will give serious consideration to the project.  In the event of this being sanctioned I can assure the Members of the Seanad that the necessary steps will be taken without delay to prepare a scheme for the Shannon.  I am exploring a number of avenues to try to secure the necessary finance for this project.  I arrived at this decision some time ago because I was so impressed by the two reports made by Rydell and members of my own staff.  For that reason I do not wish to elaborate further but I have no doubt that the Senators will be aware of any progress that will be made in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would call upon the Government to think seriously about the draining of the <Col N="43" /> Shannon and its various tributaries. Since the fifties, when we had the last official report on it, it has been claimed from many political platforms that the Shannon would certainly be drained.  This was not said by one Government but by successive Governments. I come from an area that is dependent on the success or failure of a well-designed Shannon drainage scheme.  I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister of State that it is vitally important that, while in a nation such as ours and in an economy so small as ours it cannot be expected that the economy could carry such a high capital cost, we should at least carry sufficient political will to carry out such a project.  At this very moment in Brussels the Minister for Agriculture is in a bargaining position about the allocation of the famous £15 million for land drainage and arterial drainage.  I understand that pressure might be put on him, as part of the deal being negotiated in Brussels this evening, to forget about this £15 million and that it would be renegotiated at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is true, I want to place on record in the House that I would be totally against any type of involvement that would allow a major scheme such as this to be withdrawn on the pretence of satisfying Agricultural Ministers from other EEC countries.  We acknowledge that we have to get outside help.  If the 200,000 acres that are flooded along the Shannon and its tributaries &mdash; in agricultural terms for between three and six months, were brought back to their full potential under the new technological methods in agriculture, straight away we would have sustainable family farm incomes for 20,000 to 30,000 more people.  The economists of this nation should grasp the important fact that a vast injection of money into the drainage of the Shannon and its tributaries will not alone stabilise the population in the rural areas but will actually increase it.  What could not have been done on 50 or 60 acres of land ten or 12 years' ago can be done now by virtue of new technology, drainage equipment <Col N="44" /> and a better and more guaranteed outlet for farm projects.</P>
    <P>If there is any significance in the rumour that our drainage grants might be dropped to be renegotiated at a later date, we would certainly be critical of this.  This decision will rest on whether the Government are sufficiently interested in and committed to the scheme for draining the Shannon. I believe one of the reasons why no attempt was made to drain the Shannon in the past was because of difficulties from an engineering point of view.  Firstly, I would ask the Minister of State is it possible, from an engineering point of view, to drain the Shannon?  Secondly, I would ask the Minister if it is necessary to have the Shannon drained before the Dunkellin River in south Galway and the Suck in north Galway could be drained and is it likely that either of those two very important trbutaries of the Shannon will be drained this year, assuming that the Minister for Agriculture brings back the much talked of and publicised £15 million for land drainage?</P>
    <P>An overriding factor at this stage from the point of view of the economists here must be the necessity of job creation.  In addition to the sustainable family farm income for 20,000 to 30,000 more people plus at least another 10,000 to 15,000 in food processing and the services that go hand in hand with farming, 30,000 to 40,000 additional jobs can be created by virtue of this investment in the Shannon and its tributaries.  There would be a great &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; if the IDA managed at this stage to provide 30,000 or 40,000 lasting jobs.  I would put it to the Minister that it is important not alone from the point of view of the agricultural sector but from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <P>We are losing out very heavily on EEC grants because it is not possible to drain much of the land I am talking about because of waterlogging.  I am aware that a tremendous number of farmers have been rejected and are not given the chance of applying for the EEC modernisation scheme for land drainage because there was no outlet <Col N="45" /> for the water from their land.  Even on that point the grant at the moment, while we would prefer it to be much higher, would work out at about £100 an acre.  We are losing that because the farmers cannot get this grant from the farm modernisation scheme because the off-fall is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We have a record in this country when we do not want to do something of hiring a group of surveyors and giving them a certain type of brief.  We expect them back in about five years' time with the report and at that stage we have a new set of circumstances and hence a new survey will be necessary. I hope the Government will not indulge in this type of jig dancing.</P>
    <P>There are factors other than farming that influence the development of the Shannon but nevertheless it is vitally important that, as it is the top priority, whatever else happens we must take note of the thousands of farmers along the Shannon and along the tributaries of the Shannon.  From what I know of the contribution the ESB will have to make to the river and equally the contribution that the river makes to the ESB, it is compatible with the drainage of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Mention was made earlier of the recreational facilities and the boats on the Shannon.  That is very important indeed and we are delighted that so much use has been made of it.  I am also aware that the lowering of the level of the Shannon at certain places will not hinder this type of facility for foreigners and our own people on holiday here.</P>
    <P>If another report has to be compiled, or if the last report has to be updated, there should be no reason why the best possible expertise should not be immediately commissioned.  When I say immediately, I am not talking about this time next year, or this time two years.  We should do the job now.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned a figure of £70 million.  If we got away with £70 million we would be doing extraordinary well.  On the other hand, I would say that £70 million for the type of spin-off in productivity and jobs would be money well spent.  I <Col N="46" /> would ask the Minister of State to bring this to the notice of the relevant authorities.  As the Minister himself said, when one talks about draining the Shannon it becomes rather a joke. I wish to go on record as saying that the matter has not been confined to any particular political party or Government over the years.  We all had a go at draining the Shannon at one time or another, but it still remains to be done.  I would ask that either a new report or an updated report be put before the relevant authorities within 12 months.  It should not be impossible to do.</P>
    <P>There was much talk about the help we are supposed to be getting from Brussels but if that business in Brussels does not materialise this evening then it is a retrograde step if that is accepted by the Government.  Under such circumstances I will have to acknowledge that this Government is not committed to the drainage of the Shannon or its tributaries.</P>
    <P>This is not the type of issue that should be let lie.  I believe whatever Government are in power will grasp this nettle and will relieve the terrible flooding problem right across the country.  It will certainly be a feather in their cap and we await the decision in Brussels this evening or this week. If it is part and parcel of the package that this £15 million will be used for drainage here then I am prepared to accept that this Government are committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion. It is a very comprehensive motion in so far as it deals with the river Shannon, the agricultural considerations, the tourist amenity and the requirements of the ESB.  I would further welcome the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Wyse, who said that he was reconsidering the Shannon scheme and was preparing a scheme and that that scheme would be put into operation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Connaughton and other Senators missed that statement. I would like to repeat that I welcome his commitments to prepare a scheme. There will not be any jig dancing by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> Senator Cooney described very well the plight of the farmers who have land along the Shannon and its tributaries in a situation where their land is flooded for half the year and sometimes for more than half the year. One can imagine the frustration they feel.  One can also imagine how they feel when they get a bill for rates on this land.  Unfortunately the land is rated very highly and this adds to the problem.  Some studies I have seen have shown that if the Shannon could be drained, the extra income of each farmer would be about £80 to £100 per acre.  The agricultural needs of the farmer must be our major consideration. The acreage is enormous.  If one includes the tributaries of the Shannon it varies from 150,000 to 200,000 acres, almost one-fifth of all the land in the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister of State has shown by his announcement that he is taking into account the farmers who have land along the Shannon. The Rydell Report has shown that the agricultural consideration is not incompatible with the tourist amenity or with the requirements of the ESB. I was interested in Senator Cooney's remark about the tributaries of the river Shannon.  The river Inny was the subject of an arterial drainage scheme. Could the same not be done with the river Suck and the river Broma?  The river Suck in my constituency in the north Galway area has been a cause for concern for many years. Frequently we get replies from the Office of Public Works stating that minor rivers, for example the river Shivan, cannot be done until the river Suck is drained and the river Suck cannot be drained until the river Shannon is drained.  One wonders if it is a geographical accident that the river Inny could be tackled but that the river Suck has not been tackled until now.</P>
    <P>There is also the navigational aspect of the river Suck.  Bodies like the Ballinasloe Chamber of Commerce have made representations from time to time asking the Minister for State if the Suck could be made navigable <Col N="48" /> into the town of Ballinasloe.  They organised a seminar and members of the farming community, members of the inland fisheries, representatives of the public works and the local public representatives went on a tour of this river and managed to get within three miles of Ballinasloe.  Everyone agreed that the agricultural consideration would be the priority if we were going to make any improvements on the river to make it navigable into Ballinasloe town.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the response from Brussels to our application for drainage.  Unfortunately drainage does not seem to be a priority with the EEC.  It was with great joy that I heard recently that £15½ million was to be made available by Brussels to this country for drainage in the west of Ireland.  That figure, I heard, will be increased.  We welcome that.  If we got enough money from Brussels we would not be discussing separate motions on draining the Shannon or draining the Erne because we could put the money to use in the 12 western counties where it has been earmarked for use.  Not only would schemes to drain the Shannon and the Erne be prepared but rivers such as the Dunkellin which flows across all east Galway, and which is number ten on the priority list at the moment, would be included also.  The position at the moment is that neither the Shannon nor the Suck are on any priority list whereas the Dunkellin is.  Perhaps it would be a better idea if we considered the 12 western counties, where most of the drainage problems occur, as an area where that money should be spent.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that nothing was done about the Shannon in the last few years because now that we have this commitment from Brussels we should have a scheme ready.  We will have to face the fact that a new scheme will have to be prepared since the Minister of State has reconsidered the Shannon.  I hope that will be done as soon as possible and that we will be able to answer the legitimate pleas of the farmers who have land along the Shannon.  They have been neglected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> They are paying high rates on land which is flooded in some cases for more than half the year.  I hope we will be able to promote the Shannon as a tourist amenity.  We all hope we will have more and more tourists every year, that this will not be incompatible with the energy requirements of the State and that we can proceed not only with the Shannon but with the other rivers that need to be drained in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on just one aspect of this proposal and that is the updating of the report.  This kind of research is essential to anything that is done.  The basic requirement here that the Rydell Report be updated is the main one and it is the one I should like to lay stress upon.  Action taken on the spur of the moment or without proper advice very often results in chaos.  One aspect of this which I am glad to see has come to public notice is one that has involved the development of our waterways as a tourist amenity.  One of the biggest scandals of the country has been that these enormous resources have been lying fallow and stagnant for so many years.  This is particularly true of one county, Leitrim, which has needed the attention of our planners.</P>
      <P>There seems to be hope now that the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell canal will be linked to the Erne.  If that were to happen it would be seen not just as an advantage to the area but as a symbolic gesture of trust in the future of that rather neglected part of the country. There is no doubt that the kind of beauty and amenity that Ireland has to offer can best be savoured in terms of these inland waterways.  The slow and leisurely rhythm of life we have in Ireland is best reflected in that form of tourism.  I look forward not only to the updating of the report but to large developments particularly in that crucial, neglected area between Ballinamore and the Erne where so much could be done in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem which has become urgent lately.  Farmers have become very conscious of the loss they are suffering and have suffered over the years.  They have become <Col N="50" /> irritated because while much progress is being made in other areas, this problem which affects one-quarter of the farmers in Ireland, has not got the attention it merited.  A problem that involves so many farmers, so much of our natural resources, so much in tourism, energy and agriculture, should be looked at.  We all know what is involved in the preparation of reports, having a proper analysis of the cost carried out and taking all the possibilities into consideration and so on.  We know the length of time this takes in other areas.  With a problem of this magnitude, since we have not even at this stage begun to think about it, when will there be any action or even the blueprint for a solution? At the moment, the frustration of some sections of our community has manifested itself in their opposition. It is unfortunate that it has come against the ESB who themselves should not be held responsible for all the problems involved.  The first people who come to the attention of the farmers are the authorities who own the fisheries in the Shannon.  It is unfortunate that the relationship between the ESB and farmers has deteriorated recently.  You have the situation where farmers in the Shannon area are coming together and saying they cannot foresee themselves co-operating with this body in the future if there is not some solution proposed for the problems that they have had to live with for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the old problem of flooding in the river Shannon and for many reasons this must be looked at immediately. Today, for instance, there is the question of the tourist interest.  Tourism is beginning to become an important industry in the regions mentioned earlier by Senator Martin.  We have seen a flourishing industry develop around Carrick-on-Shannon and on other locations on the Shannon.  We see a lot of employment being generated, many visitors enjoying the amenities and much money being spent on building and repairing boats in that area.  We have only started to use the Shannon as a tourist amenity. At this stage, before this industry <Col N="51" /> develops and the tourists and others involved start to accept the Shannon and use it as it is, we should prepare a plan for the development of the river. The levels of water that navigators are using at the moment may not be necessary at all.  But, if, over a period of years people start to use the river as it is, then we will find a situation where, perhaps, if we start a drainage scheme for the development of the river for use as a source of energy, we may come into conflict.  At the moment I cannot see that there is necessarily any conflict there but I can see a situation, as the tourist industry develops on that river, that if we do not come to terms with the situation and gear the whole industry to the sort of river we plan for the future, rather than the sort of river that is there at the moment, we could create problems for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to seek finance to prepare a report that would up-date the Rydell Report.  I would hope that the Minister would see this as an urgent priority.  Considering the sort of resources that this country has at the moment and the sort of money that is being spent, say in the disadvantaged areas scheme, I do not think the amount of money required to do a very worth-while survey here is beyond the limit of our resources. Having regard to the sort of assistance that we might be able to seek in the future through some sort of European fund or through an improvement in our economic situation during the next couple of years, this project is well worth the investment that the Minister speaks about.</P>
    <P>The pressure for action is coming from farming interest.  Farmers have a good reason to be aggrieved in the present circumstances.  First, there is the problem of flooding that was always there.  However, farmers have begun to notice in recent years that there are great inconsistencies in the way the river behaves.  People who live along the Shannon will claim that they grazed their stock at a particular place, at a particular time of year, 25 or 30 years ago but that today in the <Col N="52" /> same month they cannot go within 200 yards of that place.  They will claim that there were places where they tied up their boats years ago or where they took water from the river but that now they cannot go near these places at the corresponding times of the year.  They seek to get clarification of the situation from the ESB and the answer they get is that the ESB are not the sole authority responsible for controlling depths in the river.  They are told that the Board of Works have responsibility for one particultar lock or weir and that the ESB have responsibility for another.</P>
    <P>In this age people want to know where they are going; farmers want to plan for their future.  Members of the agricultural industry, in all that region, should be in a position to say whether they should have so many acres of land at their disposal for the next ten or 15 years.  The minimum we should be able to do for people who depend on agriculture in that area for their livelihood is to be able to tell them what the position is likely to be for the next ten or 15 years so that they can make their arrangements and assess their incomes on that basis.</P>
    <P>The short-term problem and a lot of the irritation that one notices with farmers in that area could be solved if we could have one body who would say to them: &ldquo;We are going to control the levels of water in the Shannon, and we are the only body responsible and if you want information at any time, it will be available to you.&rdquo; Such a body would let people know what the limitations were and what they could and could not do.  It is most frustrating for individual farmers or for organised groups who are affected by the problem to find that they cannot get the information they are looking for.  The agricultural interests involved have begun to think that they are not being told the whole story.  I would not accept that completely but on the other hand until there is one body who are prepared to give the decision and give the answers, there will continue to be this doubt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> Some farmers who have studied the problem down through the years make the point that the river is not being used to its full capacity for the generation of electricity.  There are many people who believe that with the oil crisis and the cost of generating electricity there is a good case for generating from whatever water is available at any time.  Right through the winter period all the water that is available should be used to generate power. There should not be any need to store power since I understand the power that is generated at Ardnacrusha is only used in peak periods and used to give flexibility and to regulate supplies rather than as a regular source of power where power is being generated most of the time.  People in the Shannon area have come to believe that it is not being used on a regular, consistent basis.  They feel that great amounts of water are being stored in Lough Allen on the off-chance that it may possibly be needed.  I do not think that this is a good reason to store water and to put hundreds of thousands of acres of land at risk on the off-chance that this storage may be necessary. Very often it is not.  If this case is being made by a number of intelligent people some effective answer should be provided. Until we know exactly what amount of electricity is being generated in Ardnacrusha we cannot ask people to tolerate the sacrifices they are being asked to make.  Once water is stored, once a supply of water is built up, there are no means of controlling that flood afterwards and so you sometimes have the situation in the months of April and May, even when rain is not falling, that a farmer wakes up some morning to find half his farm is covered to a depth of three or four feet of water.  This is believed to be unnecessary and furthermore nobody has provided an effective answer to farmers who say that two or three years ago when some dredging operation was in progress in the lower area of the Shannon the flooding problem was eased completely and they were back to the situation they enjoyed 35 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible to convince <Col N="54" /> people in the Shannon valley that there are not some means of regulating the river.  The levels of water that are required for navigation is another bone of contention.  The minimum depth is around six feet or slightly less, a level that was fixed by an Act of Parliament back in the days when heavy barges, when a different sort of traffic, was moving on the river. That situation should be reviewed. Before people start to design boats and to put boats on the river that require this depth of water, we should make up our minds what the minimum depth is so that the industry will gear itself to avail of the sort of depths required there.</P>
    <P>Another point which is becoming important is the question of the drainage of other rivers.  Down through the years a number of rivers have been drained and talks are going on about further drainage of the Shannon tributaries.  This is mentioned, too, in the Rydell Report, particularly with reference to the Suck and the Inny but it must be obvious to anybody in that area that if we are to proceed with a programme of draining tributaries we must first know and understand what effect this will have on the over-all problem of flooding.  The agricultural industry is so important, not only to farmers, but to the whole economy, in terms of unemployment and so on. That it would justify the sort of cost that would go a long way to solving these problems.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a conflict between our requirement for generating power and, say, the tourist people although this could happen if we are careless and allow it to go too far. These are the points that come up whenever the problem is discussed in the area and I am glad that the Minister at least has given some limited undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I am sure that we have all got the well-being of the people of the Shannon Basin at heart and I have no doubt that the Senators when they brought this motion before the House had given <Col N="55" /> full consideration to the matter because we are all quite well aware that the Shannon, our major river, flows from the Shannon Pot in Cavan all the way down to Limerick.  Possibly it drains the biggest part of our country because it is responsible not alone for draining the west and part of the north-west but also the midland counties.  It has been mainly in the midland counties that the Shannon has been the cause of the major flooding problem.</P>
      <P>Possibly the trouble here may have been with regard to the peat production on the midland bogs where silting has occurred.  The silt has flowed into the smaller tributaries and caused clogging of the Shannon's middle system. There is also the problem with regard to the ESB and the levels which they wish to maintain in order to secure a reasonable standard and a reasonable amount of surplus water for electricity-generation purposes.  Down the years they have been the main controlling body in conjunction with the Office of Public Works with regard to Shannon water levels and Shannon drainage. They also control the fishery rights of the Shannon.</P>
      <P>There have been commitments on the part of various Governments down the years to drain the Shannon and here I would like to congratulate the Minister of State for making available a sum of money for the investigation of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal which is a tributary of the Shannon.  In doing so he has shown his commitment to Shannon drainage and the drainage of the Shannon Basin.  I would also like to pay tribute to the previous Minister in the Office of Public Works who made available finances which had previously been suggested by the Government, prior to 1973, for the opening of the canal into the lake at Drumshanbo.  This is also proof of the fact that various Governments down the years have been committed to the provision of a comprehensive drainage system for the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People down the years have said that the drainage of the Shannon could possibly be one of the costliest projects <Col N="56" /> ever undertaken.  However, the Shannon Basin and the Shannon itself are responsible for the flooding of considerable tracts of land and with land prices presently reaching as high as £2,500 or £3,000 per acre for agricultural purposes.  this factor also would need to be taken into consideration by the consultants who are, at the request of the Minister, going to carry out a further survey with regard to the drainage of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Down the years we have seen tracts of land flooded due to the fact that very high levels have been maintained by the ESB.  The ESB, as I have said previously, are very interested in maintaining a high water level, especially in Lough Allen, which is very near to me at home and which I have seen at times flooding possibly 100 yards further than it will flood at other times of the year.  I wonder have the ESB that much need to maintain Lough Allen at such a high level.  They should carry out a further survey to see if they could allow it to be lowered considerably because I have seen hundreds of acres adjacent to Drumshanbo flooded at a certain time of the year due to the fact that the water is being held up by the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also shown his commitment to the drainage of the Shannon area with regard to the Bonet river which is a tributary which flows into Lough Allen.  We trust that this work will come to fruition in the near future.  But if we are to continue we must also consider the Shannon in terms of the tourist amenty it has proved to be.  Senator McCartin reminded us that the Shannon has been a considerable source of income to the small villages and towns which adjoin it.  Anybody who passes through Carrick-on-Shannon during the winter and sees the number of boats tied up there, but tied up for a very short period only, will realise the amount of money that has been spent on tourism by various organisations with regard to the provision of pleasure craft on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Shannon must be protected as well as being drained.  We must see to it that we leave sufficient water there <Col N="57" /> to facilitate the tourists who use it. I would like to mention at this point the fact that we must also look to the problem of avoiding pollution within the Shannon Basin because this could become a very serious problem in the near future with regard to the way that the Shannon is presently being used by tourists.  The problem of the lower Shannon is very small in comparison with that from Athlone northwards. The lower basin of the Shannon has very few flooding problems but the area from Athlone back to Dowra, where the Shannon flows into Lough Allen, is the area which is mostly affected by the flooding.  I have no doubt that the Minister, having given a comitment in the House today with regard to the future development and drainage of the Shannon, intends to see this as one of the major projects during his term of office as Minister of State in the Department of Finance to ensure that what has long being talked about is put in its proper prospective. We have all heard of Shannon drainage down through the years. Is is a project that has been used, as Senator Connaughton said, by all political parties.  No longer can any political party regard the Shannon as a source of cheap political talk because the proposed drainage of the Shannon must now come to fruition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed EEC funds for drainage in the western area I would think that the Minister would not let this go in his talks in Brussels as a bargaining point.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Agriculture is committed, as is everybody else, in regard to Shannon drainage.  The Shannon is becoming daily a greater problem for the farmers who adjoin it. We see tracts of land being flooded and we see also other smaller rivers with tributories where farmers are not now being allowed grants to drain into them as it is said that the drainage work would be useless due to the fact that these tributories are themselves held up by the Shannon.  I would ask the Minister, like my colleagues, to give his fullest consideration in the next six or 12 months to this problem. I have no doubt that if he brings <Col N="58" /> realistic proposals with regard to the Shannon before the European Community or before the Government he will receive favourable consideration. The Shannon, as far as we are concerned, is a major priority of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Various farming organisation have created lobbies within themselves and within various political parties with regard to this problem.  Everybody here has the welfare of the farming community in the Shannon Basin at heart.  Senator McCartin mentioned the fact that incomes could be greatly increased should the Shannon be drained. We all know that this is one thing that would greatly improve the lot of farmers in the Shannon Basin.  It is annoying for a farmer to see considerable tracts of this land under flood waters for a large portion of the year. However, I am confident that the Government will undertake the necessary work within a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, first that for those of us who have proposed this motion it is gratifying to see that it has been universally accepted on all sides of the House.  I note an acceptance of the priorities which are inherent to some extent in the wording of the motion, in that the first matter to be taken into consideration is agriculture and then tourism and thirdly the use of the river as a source of energy.  While they are listed in that order I would not venture to say &mdash; I do not think any Senator would want me to say&mdash;that there is necessarily a great gap between the priorities but the agricultural priority must be the first one.  It is quite clear that the waste to the country by having such an amount of land flooded is immense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned £70 million as being the possible cost but obviously that is a very tentative figure and in the absence of the report which this motion calls for it must be no better than a &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo;.  But even taking it as it is, if we consider that there are, conservatively, 150,000 acres flooded and, as Senator Kitt said <Col N="59" /> a loss of £80 to £100 an acre then, at £100 an acre that is a loss of £15 million per annum and at £80 an acre a loss of £12 million per annum, and if we translate the £15 million into the property developers' jargon based on a cost of £70 million it is a 4.5 years purchase.  That is most attractive for any investor and I do not think the nation can any longer pass up the waste of an investment which can produce that tremendous and pretty immediate return.  We talk about millions in departmental Estimates and at times of budgets and we are inclined to become blasé about millions and about hundreds of thousands.  To anybody who would say, for instance that something would cost only £10,000, I say &ldquo;Go out and earn £10,000 and see how difficult it is to get it.&rdquo; However, £70 million is a large sum of money in the perspective of modern budgets, but it is not a sum beyond possibility.</P>
    <P>I want to contrast this with an announcement that was made during the week to spend £100 million in making Cork a more efficient city.  I do not wish to engage in the politics of envy but I do not think for comparative purposes, and in the Parliament and the Executive deciding on priorities.  one has to contrast this with the possible cost of £70 million to produce an annual income of up to £15 million by draining the Shannon.  That is from agriculture only.  Undoubtedly Cork requires this and it is money that will be well spent but essentially what it will do is to make Cork more efficient and undoubtedly as Cork becomes more efficient there will be a cost-benefit to the national economy. Again it is something that will be impossible to quantify.  On the other hand, we have here in the context of the Shannon something which can be quantified quickly and easily and if there is to be a commitment to Cork of this vast sum, having regard to the debate that took place here, all sides must agree that the priorities would be wrong if that got priority over investment in the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The question of tourism is of vital importance.  There is no doubt that <Col N="60" /> the tourist industry on the Shannon is still undeveloped.  The report of the firm of consultants commissioned by Bord Fáilte who reported last year, Messrs Brady, Shipman and Martin, indicated that the number of boats on the Shannon could be considerably increased without in any way harming the attraction of the Shannon as a cruising waterway.  The real attraction of the Shannon is that it is the last place in inhabited Europe where one can attain solitude.  This is a very precious quality that has to be preserved and the consultants were conscious of this in preparing their report.  They did indicate that it could be preserved with a considerable increase in the boats using the Shannon.  If there is to be an increase in the number of boats using the Shannon, there will have to be a considerable increase in the facilities for them; mooring facilities, that is tying up places for overnight stops, jetty facilities at the shore and larger marina-type facilities.</P>
    <P>If there is going to be investment in these facilities the point that Senator McCartin made is most relevant and most valid &mdash; that before people are invited to invest in these facilities a plan should be prepared for the Shannon lest the plan, when it is prepared. conflicts with the siting of the facilities and their presence either inhibits the implementation of the plan or the implementation of the plan wastes their investments.  This is an extremely valid point and it adds urgency to the call that we are making here today.  The plan must be prepared in advance of this greater investment in the Shannon lest that investment be misplaced or the new facilities wrongly sited.  It adds to the urgency of this motion.</P>
    <P>I do not want to rehash everything that was said, but it was common case among all the Senators that the motion should be passed.  It was common case among all the Senators that control of the Shannon is required rather than drainage.  The Shannon is so immense that the basic approach is not one of drainage.  The Rydell Report indicated that control is what is required rather than drainage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> Control of the Shannon is urgent for the sake of the farmers living alongside it and its tributaries, for the sake of those engaged in tourism, and to make sure that the tremendous volume of water is efficiently harnessed to contribute to the State's energy needs. With respect to all of us who spoke here, the Minister's contribution was, when all is said and done, the one that really mattered.  The rest of us were creating a climate to assist him in his battle for finance.  His contribution, as an indication of his thinking on the matter was what we were all waiting for.  He indicated that the first thing he did when he took office was to look up the files on drainage and, in particular, he examined the Shannon probleb. He expressed disappointment that no effort had been made to bring the reports which were on his files any further.  Indeed, if he found lethargy in that direction he was entitled to be disappointed. It was heartening to hear of his disappointment while we might disagree with the reasons for it.  His implication of lethargy and non-interest is not correct.  He overlooked, as many people on the other side seem to overlook, the difficult financial time of the last few years when demands on funds were many and varied.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it is heartening for us to find that the Minister was disappointed. I would expect the Minister to overcome that disappointment now by an approach to this problem which will be active, energetic and enthusiastic. That was what I expected to come from the Minister's speech.  Unfortunately, his approach does not bear those characteristics and I greatly fear that his successor may be as disappointed when he looks back on the Minister's term.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he estimated the cost of the further investigation which is now needed at £1 million.  Then he said he was in the progress of looking for these funds.  As the Minister has returned to the House I will inform him that I am speaking of my disappointment at the lack of energy and enthusiasm for draining the Shannon and of his disappointment at the lack of action that preceded him.  I <Col N="62" /> am expecting the Minister to approach this problem with energy and enthusiasm to undo the lethargy of the past.</P>
    <P>I went on to say that the cost of further investigation would be about £1 million.  The Minister said that he was looking for these funds, that he was exploring a number of avenues. Again, I find this disheartening and in the pattern of previous official statements with regard to problems concerning the control of the Shannon.  It is in pattern totally and completely: great goodwill and great intentions but disappointing when a Minister of State &mdash; a member of a Government which was able to remove car tax with one stroke of the pen &mdash; says that he has to explore avenues looking for funds when the amount involved is £1 million.</P>
    <P>I made the point earlier that we could become blasé and careless about millions but in the context of the national budget £1 million is a very small sum.  I do feel slightly embarrassed at talk about going to Europe with hand out to get this comparatively paltry sum to do this work. I would ask the Minister to influence his colleague in Finance, and whatever other colleagues may be involved nowadays in deciding how the country's finances are to be spent, to get this £1 million as a matter of high priority.  The Government should read the call from all sides of this House for action to control the Shannon. What is wanted, initially, is a report. If it takes £1 million to get that report under way, I would expect the Minister to say to us with confidence &ldquo;I will have that money in next year's Estimates; that report will be commissioned next year&rdquo;.  I am surprised and disappointed and somewhat shocked and frightened that the Minister is not able to make that commitment.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I saw a banner headline in the <i>Evening Press</i> from under a newsboy's arm to the effect that the &ldquo;Exchequer pursestrings were being tightened&rdquo;.  I put this down as an evening paper headline and gave it the credence it deserves.</P>
    <P>When I hear the Minister of State <Col N="63" /> say that he is looking for funds, that he is exploring a number of avenues to get £1 million, I begin to get a little apprehensive about the national finances.  I hope I am wrong and I would urge the Minister, even if they are tight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the reports of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Commission's proposals relating to youth employment which was laid before the Seanad on 3 May 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to commence the debate on this report by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Commission's <Col N="65" /> proposals relating to youth employment and to welcome the presence of the Minister of State for the debate.  Because this is the first such debate, it might be helpful to recap briefly on the approach and the functioning of the Joint Committee.  Last October the European Commission issued a communication on the whole question of youth employment in the EEC.  It reviewed the size of the problem and the steps being taken in the different member States.</P>
    <P>When the Joint Committee were reconstituted last December one of their first tasks was to parcel out to the sub-committee on social affairs the consideration of this communication.  I am the Chairman of that sub-committee and we began to examine the contents of the European Commission's proposals and also their implications for Ireland.  We received a memorandum from the Department of Labour and we had private meetings with officials of the Department, with the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the CII.  We also had written submissions from the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Joint Committee visited the institutions of the European Community in Brussels from 19 to 21 March last and we had an opportunity to discuss the Commission's proposals with a senior official from the Directorate of Social Affairs. Subsequently, on 10 April 1978 the Commission issued formal proposals for a Council Regulation which would involve using the European Social Fund in this area.  This I will deal with later. We decided to appendix to the report the existing aid from the Social Fund as this would assist members in considering this new proposal in the area of youth employment.</P>
    <P>Turning to the report itself, the first task of the Joint Committee was to summarise the Commission's communication and analyse its proposals.  The communication contained an assessment of the dimension of the problem at the European Community level, and I quote from part of paragraph 3 where it is stated:</P>
    <P>The number of young people unemployed <Col N="66" /> has risen in that period (that is from 1969 to date) from 400,000 to 2 million and the proportion of young people among the unemployed has risen from 24 per cent to 37 per cent although they represent only 17 per cent of the working population.  The rate of unemployment of young persons aged under 20 is about three times higher than the overall average and that of persons between 20 and 25 years of age almost double the overall average.</P>
    <P>It was clear therefore from the Commission's general assessment of the situation at the European Community level that it poses a very serious problem. However, the Joint Committee on looking at the youth unemployment position in Ireland draw attention to the fact that it is substantially graver, will endure for longer in Ireland, and so it poses for us an even greater challenge.  At paragraph 5 we state:</P>
    <P>Unemployment among the under 25 age group constituted 43.6 per cent of the total unemployment even though they represented only 30 per cent of the labour force.  This compares unfavourably with the Community average of 37 per cent which is causing such great concern in all the member States.</P>
    <P>We go on to point out that where it is estimated that in the other member states, because of their demographic structure and birth rate, there will be a decline in the numbers coming on the labour force from the mid-1980s our problem will continue into the 1990s and effectively to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>We then reviewed the Commission's examination of the type of aids granted by the member states at the moment to try to cope with this problem of providing employment for young people.  The Commission concluded that there were two common types of aid and summarised the action by member states.  First of all, there are recruitment premiums, either in the form of direct payments to employers or a reduction in social security contributions and, second, subsidies for programmes involving the recruitment <Col N="67" /> of young persons.  The latest provisional estimate drawn up by the Commission shows that these national measures correspond to the annual expenditure of about 350 million units of account (UA) assisting the employment of some 220,000 young persons. That is against a background of two million young unemployed.  In their earlier communication, and in their actual legislative proposals last April they focussed on two proposals which are contained in paragraph 11 of the report.  These consisted of (1) an employment subsidy in respect of young persons under 25, newly recruited by undertakings in the production sector and, (2) in respect of wage costs, for young persons under 25 in connection with newly established programmes in the public sector.  They would be eligible for expenditure from the Social Fund in these two areas for recruitment premiums and for employment programmes.  The total amount of the wage subsidy would be £25 per person per week for the recruitment premium for a period of 26 weeks; and for the employment programme it would be £40.50 per person per week for 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposal recognises that certain regions have more acute problems than others and Ireland would benefit as one of the more deprived regions in this area and would get 55 per cent of the premium paid out of the Social Fund.  In other words, in the case of the recruitment premium there would be £11 approximately per person per week from the Social Fund and in the case of the employment programme £22 per person would come from the Social Fund.  The Joint Committee went on to assess the scope of these proposals.  At paragraph 15 it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee regards the Community's commitment to the principle of aid for wage subsidies to promote employment as a most important development which it warmly welcomes.  However it considers that the initial budgetary appropriations proposed are inadequate. When it is recalled that mem</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> ber States are already spending 350 million EUA annually the proposed Community contribution, welcome though it may be, is hardly likely to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the views of the members of the Joint Committee was that the Community proposals were welcome because they were evidence of a definite willingness to engage in a new type of Community action in the area of subsidisation of wages for the under 25, but that the budgetary provisions were totally inadequate. There is also criticism in the report of the fact that it is proposed to use the existing Articles 4 and 5 of the European Social Fund rather than try to have a separate budgetary provision which would be commensurate with the problem.  It is also clear from the Commission's proposals, from their analysis and from the size of the proposed Community aid that it could only be supplementary to aid at the national level and that it depends primarily on the action taken at national level.</P>
    <P>One reason why the members of the Joint Committee wanted to have this report discussed in either or both Houses of the Oireachtas is to draw attention to the particular gravity of the problem here.  It is significantly worse in Ireland at the moment than in any of the other member states and it will endure for much longer.  This poses the greatest challenge to us as a people at the moment: how we are to absorb, provide jobs for, provide a future for the very significant numbers of young people coming on the labour force looking for work, looking for the possibility of making a life in Ireland in the next few years.</P>
    <P>The report could not of course, examine in detail the approach in Ireland to employment creation.  That is a matter for debate here.  I believe that the Government White Paper in the emphasis it places on employment creation in the private sector totally fails to grasp, first of all, the dimension of the problem, second, the lack of attraction and incentive to the private sector to expand employment and third, the potential of this island, <Col N="69" /> the enormous natural resources we have, the potential for extending the public sector in productive areas in order to create more employment. Since I will have an opportunity to reply at the end I should like to stop now and I welcome the views of other Members on the report.</P>
    <P>There is just one final point: I think it is a very good precedent for the Seanad to note that the Joint Committee only adopted this report last Wednesday and already this evening we are debating it in the House, time having been given under the recent amendment of our Standing Orders. I should like to see this illustration of the kind of role the Seanad can play in examining the legislative initiatives being taken at European Community level which have very substantial implications here and in realising that in a vital area like youth employment &mdash;or youth unemployment&mdash;that the situation in Ireland is much graver than in any of the other European Community countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson has sewn into the records of this House the extent of the problem of youth unemployment in the European Communities. In fact there are two million young people unemployed.  Nearly 50 per cent of our unemployed population consists of young people and there is the worrying fact that because of the structure of our population the problem will take longer to get over and, possibly, looking at the worst side of it, things could get worse before they get better.  I do not want to engage in political sniping, but I think I should express my fear that the latter might be the case because I think we have a Government trying to deal with this problem who are more concerned with their political image and lack the courage, imagination and political will needed to try to tackle this very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe all political parties will have to pin their courage to the mast to try to adopt the type of radical approach that must be taken if we are to solve our unemployment problem, <Col N="70" /> particularly our youth unemployment problem.  The saddest fact of all is that after a general election all political parties tend to suggest that our unemployment problem was caused by the recession.  I do not accept that theory and I have never accepted it.  The fact is that during our boom economic years of the sixties and early seventies we had a serious and growing unemployment problem and the fact also is that for the past two years, or certainly 18 months, we have seen a tremendous increase in industrial and economic activity generally but we have not seen a corresponding impact on the unemployment figures.  This indicates clearly that our unemployment problem does not stem simply from the recession. Of course the recession aggravated it but generally speaking if we are to try to come up with solutions we must strive to find the real reason.</P>
    <P>I suggest we must look deeper into the structures of our society and into the political and economic system that has allowed unemployment to develop even before we had a recession.  This may sound simplistic, but I believe that during our boom economic years developments that were described as technological progress, technological advances, threw people out of work. It is simplistic to say that machines and computers and other forms of technological advances threw people out of work.  That is the only explanation why so many people were out of work even before we had a recession. When we come out of recession we may have some respite from the problem of unemployment and youth unemployment but unless we deal with the root cause of this we will not solve our unemployment problem.  It may lie low for a while but ultimately it will increase and come back in our faces in the finish.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concern of the European Commission on the question of youth unemployment but I feel the proposals will not be sufficiently well financed and I do not believe they are sufficiently fundamental even to begin to solve the real problem of unemployment. The changes that are required <Col N="71" /> are great and will require fundamental changes in our society.  The responsibility lies with the Government and all political parties and all politicians generally, the duty to make people more socially concerned and to make people more willing to allow a greater portion of our national wealth to be devoted to the creation of employment and particularly to the employment of young people.</P>
    <P>The fact, for example, that it is good election tactics and electorally popular to abolish car tax cost this country millions of pounds.  We could have used that money &mdash; we talked about it in this House today &mdash; to start draining the Shannon or other rivers. I have heard agricultural experts from my own part of the country reckon that the mid-west region could be drained for the amount of money that has been given back to the people in car tax, a tax that did not particularly bother people.  It is that type of fundamental change we must strive to bring about and we can only do it if we have the political will to encourage people to become less materialistic in their attitudes.  It is inevitable that with ever-increasing standards of living people require to sustain that standard of living with a greater share of the national cake, but we have a social responsibility in this which we have not discharged.  I say that not only of this Government but of all political parties down through the years.</P>
    <P>It is necessary in a debate like this to point to the social problems that arise because of unemployment, particularly among young people who have been out of work for one or two years after leaving school, who are bored and have not been trained educationally to deal with that type of situation.  Ultimately, because of a lack of self-respect and of financial independence that all school children look forward to when they graduate from school, it leads them into trouble with the law.  Anybody who attends Irish courts and particularly district courts will notice that time after time in the vast majority of cases the young people who are in trouble with the law <Col N="72" /> are unemployed and without gainful occupation.  That kind of thing should not be tolerated in our society.  Police reports published in England in the last six or eight months have clearly drawn an analogy between the increasing crime rate and the number of young people unemployed.</P>
    <P>That is the type of problem we will have unless we are prepared to deal with it in a fundamental fashion.  It is a problem that will remain with us and get worse.  I would urge people of all political persuasions and parties to adopt a realistic approach to it and try to inspire among people a lesser concern with materialistic considerations and bring about a fundamental change in our society which will enable everyone who wants a job to get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see this report which deals with an extremely important matter.  There is one aspect which worries me and that is a tendency these days to talk about shifting money from the capital side of investment to the social side.  The danger is that in our haste to do something about this desperate problem of the percentage of youth unemployed we would forget about the people who are already in employment.  It is as important to protect existing employment as it is to create new employment. We had some discussion at the IMI Conference in Killarney about this and Dr. Walsh spoke about reappraising these policies.</P>
      <P>We lost 58,000 jobs in manufacturing between 1972 and 1975.  That is an indication of the threat to existing employment.  We must be careful to keep up investment to protect those jobs.  In the recent IDA plan, where they talk about the job creating targets, they mention that they are catering for a 7,000 decline in jobs as well.  I am worried about ensuring that the figure would not be greater as a result of diverting money.  It is with great enthusiasm that I see the EEC are going to make money available to help support directly employment at youth level.  As the Irish situation is particularly bad, we will get 55 per cent under that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> If we are to achieve the targets that have been set&mdash;there are some figures that indicate the nature of the problem &mdash;we would have to get our investment up to something like 37 per cent of the GNP by 1980.  At the moment it is only about 33 per cent.  That is why I want to sound a note of caution about money going into the social side without there being capital behind jobs to protect them.  I quoted here recently an example of this and the magnitude of it.  When you compare the Leyland Company with Toyota you find that in 1966 in the Leyland Company 76 per cent of the added-value produced by that company went in wages and salaries.  That went to 106 per cent in 1976.  For Toyota it was 44 per cent in 1966 and 40 per cent in 1976. Behind each employee in terms of capital investment in Leyand there was £206 and in Toyota £2,000.  The market place determines the viability of jobs. Therefore we must be careful about the diversion of money.  I am delighted that the EEC are making money available for direct employment subsidy. Operating as I do in the inner city where the youth problem is worse than anywhere else, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report of the Joint Committee with mixed feelings. When one sees the dimensions of the unemployment problem as sketched in that report one must be pessimistic, particularly because of its extent and because its possible duration is longer than anywhere else in Europe in relation to the 20 years mentioned.  If the problem continues at the same size for that length of time I do not think that length of time will be available to solve it.  This society will not be as it is for that length of time with that cancer eating away at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would welcome with optimism the efforts being made by the Commission to solve it.  On reflection, these efforts are in the nature of placebos. That is all they can be termed: they are temporary payments to take people of the dole queues.  Everyone welcomes work for people even though it may be only temporary.  Nevertheless, we have to recognise it for what it is.  It is a temporary placebo.  What <Col N="74" /> is to happen to the people who are recruited into employment on the basis of these subsidies from the Government <i>cum</i> EEC when the subsidies run out? One resort would be to continue these subsidies <i>ad infinitium.</i> Will it be socially possible to let these people go?  If they cannot be let go who will pay for them?  We do not want to be in the situation that Senator Mulcahy has referred to where for social reasons we would have our industries over-manned. If they are over-manned they will not be competitive and our last state will be just as bad as our first unless there is a radical rethink of attitudes towards the use of technology <i>vis-á-vis</i> manpower, and all our competitors go along with the policy of over-manning, to put it crudely.</P>
    <P>As far as Europe is concerned that may be all right.  One of the great threats to western society and one reason why this problem is likely to continue is the threat from the Third World and the Far East.  If any of the the large Japanese industries decided to take on a corresponding competitor in Europe it could send it to the wall in a very short time.  The level of efficiency, productivity and the figures quoted by Senator Mulcahy prove that. From the Third World countries the amount of energy and different cost factors enable these countries to compete competitively and on very strong terms with industry in Europe.</P>
    <P>The whole future is extremely bleak. The bleakness extends over the capitalist world which by coincidence happens to be the free world.  I wonder whether in the system of market economies which we have had in the West there will have to be a fundamental rethink about the whole structure or where will the answer lie.</P>
    <P>The report on the Joint Committee in so far as it shows EEC thinking is depressing in this regard too, if all that the Community can suggest as a cure for this problem is the placebo of employment subsidy on a limited scale.  Far more fundamental remedies will be needed if we are to retain our society as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>As a non-member of the Joint Committee, I would like to <Col N="75" /> express appreciation of the clarity and brevity of this report, which brings out very clearly the disproportionate extent and probable long-duration of our youth unemployment problem.  It is natural that if we saw financial assistance for this coming from the EEC we should want to have our share, and we have a better case than anybody for getting a big share.  However, we should be cautious before becoming too warmly committed to wage subsidisation as a solution.  I was taken aback by the wording in the Joint Committee's report, paragraph 15, expressing a warm welcome for the principle of temporary subsidisation of wages.  It does not say &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; but what is involved is purely temporary subsidisation which leaves many basic problems unsolved. So I join with those who have said that we need a much more basic approach to the problem of finding employment, which problem reacts most on the growing numbers of young persons in our society.  The solution lies along the road which the Government have proposed.  Some of us will be expressing qualifications about the degree of the Government's reliance on global expansion of demand as a way of reaching full employment, but there is agreement that it is only by a global approach to promote, through increased investment and productivity, an increased output of saleable goods and services that we will have any firm or sure basis for solving the employment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This wage subsidy in so far as the EEC is prepared to contribute to it is a purely temporary <i>ad hoc</i> expedient rather than a principle.  Even if we are successful in claiming money for it, we would need to have a very well-thought out scheme about how we are going to use it.  One has to try to work out whether we would be applying this help in the private sector or the public sector.  If we apply it in the public sector, as Senator Robinson and some others seem to prefer, and I see plenty of scope for increased work there on improvement of our infrastructure, we <Col N="76" /> will not have the same problems as if we try to apply it in the private sector and then try to find some criterion on which we can safely withdraw the subsidy as soon as EEC funds run out after a year.  We, of course, will be contributing 50 per cent of the aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, almost half of the aid.  First of all, I cannot see offhand how one could differentiate between various private firms and decide just where this kind of help would be justifiable, and secondly, where it could be abruptly withdrawn after a year without ill effects and without giving the firms undue leverage on the State for a continuation of this support.  If wage levels are impeding new employment, then a much more straightforward way of dealing with that problem is to try to persuade the trade unions generally to go easier on their demands for increased real wages.  I see many pitfalls in this subsidisation idea.  I do not want to be too negative about it, but my preference would still lie, first of all, in the more general approach, over a period of years, on which the Government are already launched. Secondly, if we are having <i>ad hoc</i> aids they should be for specialised training and for employment premiums and other means of getting over certain difficulties, such as social insurance contributions, that employers may have in employing new workers, rather than becoming too deeply committed to wage subsidisation as a principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Senator Whitaker is not convinced that premium payments will help the employers to create employment.  If we are to encourage the creation of employment, particularly for the youth, it might be a better proposition if we provided that for anybody employed between the ages of 16 and 25 neither the employer nor the employee would have to pay a contribution to the stamp and that the rest of the employed would carry them.  That would be an incentive for <Col N="77" /> the employer which could well be considered.</P>
      <P>I hope I live long enough, whether I am in this House or out of it, to see free enterprise or the capitalist system creating full employment.  I will never be convinced that it will happen but I hope that some day somebody in the street will tap me on the shoulder and say, &ldquo;You were wrong.&rdquo;  Unemployment has become a very acute social problem in the developed capitalist countries.  In the fifties and sixties we had youth unemployed and emigration as we have now, but the problem is much bigger now.  Even though we appear to be acquiring all the trappings of a well-guided economy, as evidenced by our extensive statistics, our wonderful research, our budgets, special plannings and so on, from 1960 to 1970 we had 135,000 people forced to emigrate from this country where profits and wages were high.  We have failed in the past to bring about full employment and there does not seem to be any indication that we are going to do any better in the future.</P>
      <P>There is talk of more techniques, better methods of work, reorganisation, and so forth.  These do not create jobs; they reduce them.  There were people outside Leinster House today, representing the textile industry workers.  The textile industry is on its knees and cannot provide employment.</P>
      <P>Leadership in the creation of employment must be through the public sector, because control is exercised more easily over the public sector than over private enterprise.  When that is realised and admitted, then possibly we will see our way forward towards creating employment.  When private enterprise talk about unemployment they are talking about an acceptable level of unemployment and do not really mean full employment.  There is an unwarranted confidence in the initiative of private enterprise.  Even when the Fianna Fáil Government were going out of power in what seemed to be a good time, and although there was emigration, there were still 73,000 people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the White Paper, we <Col N="78" /> have had programming before.  We are not going to have any planning in the White Paper.  What we are going to have there is another effort at totalling up future activities.  Mention has been made of the grants and so forth from the EEC.  I do not think there is anyone in this House, who can point out any major industrial or economic development over the past 25 years that sprang from the sole initiative and action of private enterprise.  There always has to be public or State intervention and State aid, and the State has to be involved.  We do not seem to have the type of private entrepreneur who will go the whole hog with it.  If evidence can be produced that they have increased employment on their own it will be then possible for the Government to give conviction to the argument that the private enterprise system can do it.  We are pressing ahead on the same basis as we did in the fifties and the sixties and that failed to produce jobs then.</P>
    <P>The inducements and aids offered to private enterprise are the most attractive in the world, as they were then in the fifties and sixties.  The entrepreneurs were protected then with tariff walls which the Irish consumer had to pay for, and then they sold out to big institutions.  These were the people who were going to create employment for us.  Therefore I say that the private sector cannot do it alone, although I am not saying that they cannot do a good job.  With all the inducements we gave in the fifties and sixties we got absentee industrialists instead of absentee landlords.  I do not think we are away from that now.</P>
    <P>I am not attacking private enterprise for the sake of attacking it.  It is a plea in the only way I know how to plead, and I say to the Government in desperation, &ldquo;Do not rely unduly on the private enterprise system to solve your problems in this terrible period because that is not the way to solve them.&rdquo;  We are going to need over 30,000 jobs a year and we have to clear the present backlog of about 140,000 people, and the only way to tackle this is to adopt the attitude that it is not too abnormal, it is in managable proportions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Joint Committee for this very useful and informative document.  It underlines the gravity of the problem of the unemployed under the age of 25 illustrated by statistics which have already been summarised by Senator Robinson.  The Commission's legislative proposals to combat youth employment by making direct contributions should be welcomed.  It marks a new departure and while the sums envisaged may fall short of expectations, I think, nevertheless, they should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I wish to make just a few, very brief additional comments.  In particular I welcome the suggestions in paragraph 17 of the report where the Joint Committee believe that the cause of increased youth employment could be advanced if the mobility of labour could be improved among technically and professionally qualified and experienced persons in the under 35 age group.  In many enterprises there are creative, highly qualified people in positions where their creativity and potential are not fully utilised.  If the mobility proposed in the report, could be achieved, such people could exercise their initiative and potential in setting up new enterprises and in generating further employment.  This, of course, would fit in rather neatly with the new incentives provided by the IDA for enterpreneurs.</P>
      <P>On the somewhat vexed issue of capital-intensive versus labour-intensive industry it should be stressed that the IDA are concerned with job creation and it is worth remembering that given our geographical location on the fringe of Europe we do need a very attractive package of both capital and tax incentives to attract industry.  We are not located in the heartland of industrial Europe with its teeming millions and special measures are necessary in our case to attract industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the gratification expressed by other Senators that we have had an opportunity of debating the Joint Committee's reaction to the Commission's proposals and as one who <Col N="80" /> has no more than one occasion criticised the procedural approach in this House I am very glad that in the last few weeks we seem to be making some headway at last.  I take this opportunity as one who is not on the Committee, and who I suppose would not be very welcome on the Committee, of expressing my appreciation of the Committee's work on what is a highly onerous and complex task.</P>
      <P>What can one say about youth unemployment that has not been already said?  Senator Hillery spoke about the gravity of the situation.  I am speaking about the horror of the situation.  I am by temperament an optimist, though I am told that is somewhat unusual for an historian, but it is very hard nowadays not to feel a sinking of the heart at what lies before us in this matter of youth unemployment. This is no time to prophesy doom, Cassandra-like; that is an easy enough task, but it is very difficult to have any optimism about the future in this regard as a citizen when one walks the streets.  In Kildare Street today there is a demonstration from Youghal and the members of that deputation tell me that one of their chief concerns is not only present redundancies but the several hundreds of young people from the schools who will come on the employment market at the end of this academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us are parents of employable children in their late teens.  Some of us are fortunate enough to have them placed.  To the others what can we say when they ask us why is there not employment in Ireland?  We may say this is relatively a poor country, or this is not a developed country, and we find frank disbelief in their faces.  Any teacher must feel a sense of despondency but particularly in our universities this must be very strong because graduate unemployment is very much a part of the general problem. When you face a class of 120 students in their final degree year or when on conferring day you look at a packed <i>Aula Maxima</i> you wonder what the future holds for them.  Above all, as public representatives it is our peculiar responsibility to say what we <Col N="81" /> can and do what we can to improve matters.</P>
    <P>It is news to me that the youth unemployment problem in the EEC is relatively a grave one, but again our figure of 43.6 per cent &mdash; which is the unemployment figure in the under-25 group &mdash; of total unemployment compared with their relatively light 37 per cent indicates again how our problems are much worse than the general European problems.  It is some consolation that member states of the EEC have their own problems but I echo the reservations of other Senators who while welcoming what Senator Cooney called the placebos offered to us by the EEC, nevertheless find that the budgetary appropriations are inadequate and that they are placebos. But what can you expect from the EEC?  It is a community where the unrestrained rule of market forces in the economy, the profit motivation, rules supreme, indeed, that constitutes perhaps the <i>rationale</i> of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Therefore in the end we have to look after ourselves in this country.  We have a Government after all who were elected virtually on the pledge, if not to end unemployment, certainly to improve the position out of all recognition. Reference is made in this document to the fact that our problems are likely to last longer than the general run of our colleagues in the EEC.  I take it that what is behind that, partly at least, is the fact that the birth-rate in this country is greatly in excess of the average European rate and it may well happen that in ten or 15 years' time our European partners may be gently nudging us to take the same kind of measures of family limitation which we now condescendingly give to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Harte I do not believe that the private sector can offer us any hope.  Every day that I take my obligatory interest in public affairs and try to understand economic matters&mdash;and sometimes I am not altogether sure that economists themselves understand the economy &mdash; I become more and more convinced that the private sector is interested primarily in profits, in <Col N="82" /> rationalisation, and therefore more and more inevitably in modern technology resulting in redundancy.</P>
    <P>This morning we were told that the Bank of Ireland had made a profit of £43 million in this last year and that that was a 32 per cent rise in the profits of that bank group alone over last year.  In view of that kind of situation and in view of the blatant disparity of wealth and poverty which exists at every hand's turn, how can you seriously tell a teenage child that this is a poor country which cannot give him employment?  Again I do not want to be dramatic, I do not want to be a Cassandra, but it seems to me that the choice soon before us in this country is either that we constitutionally and gradually take over public control of the economy in all aspects or have it done for us by revolutionary movement in the streets.</P>

      <P>Before addressing myself to the contents of the report and the motion before us I would like to refer briefly to a point made by Senator Robinson in proposing the motion when she referred to this debate being a very good precedent.  My attendance here tonight at this debate is not to be regarded as a precedent for such attendance by any Minister or Ministers of State in the event that similar debates in the Seanad on reports of this Committee are held in the future.</P>
      <P>I would refer to some of the points that have been raised by Senators. Senator Molony started off by speaking about his desire not to get involved in political sniping, and then proceeded to refer to the emphasis of this Government on image rather than substance. Of course, the facts are the complete opposite.  He then proceeded to make his contribution and to connect youth unemployment with the Government's decision to abolish tax on cars up to a certain horse-power.  I took it from Senator Molony's comments that, in the unlikely event of his party ever again being involved in a Government in this country, he would be supporting the reintroduction of such a car tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> I agree totally with Senator Mulcahy that job maintenance must be a cornerstone of any Government's plans for an attack on the problem of employment, whether of youth or otherwise. I had the pleasure of speaking at a debate recently in this House when the present Irish goods campaign was being debated.  One of the main reasons for that campaign is the maintenance of existing jobs as well as the creation of future jobs.  Job maintenance has to be a central factor of any Government's plans for the elimination of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte said that he had no confidence in the ability of the private sector generally to tackle the unemployment situation and this, of course, was re-echoed by Senator Murphy alone. We could go into a long philosophical debate on that but time would not permit me to get involved in that tonight.  However, on some future occasion I look forward to debating that subject with the Senator and with Senator Murphy.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hillery made a very important point when he referred to the work of the IDA.  Let there be no doubt about it that in the IDA we have an internationally recognised body which, as far as industrial promotion is concerned, is superior to any such body in any country in the world.  We are very proud of the work that is being done by the IDA in what is becoming an ever more competitive field.  That is in the field of attracting foreign capital and investment for job creation purposes into any country.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Senator Hillery has given me the opportunity to refer to the work of the IDA.  This country owes much to the direction of the IDA and the field work done by the IDA around the world.  Yesterday I had the honour of opening an American factory in Trim.  I was very pleased to hear the chairman of that international organisation praise the work of the IDA.  They had honoured every single commitment they had made to him with regard to finance and to dates.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to the protest <Col N="84" /> outside the House by the workers from Youghal.  I met a delegation from the workers this evening together with the public representatives from the area.  I listened sympathetically to the points raised and I can assure this House that the matters raised will be considered by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the points will also be brought to the notice of the IDA.  In connection with the Youghal protest I would not agree with Senator Harte's view as far as the future of the textile industry is concerned.  I would see a bright future for the textile industry in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The problem of youth unemployment is one which affects all member states of the Community.  It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the Community should take action to supplement the efforts of member states in dealing with this matter.  Indeed, the Community would be failing in its duty if it failed to take such action.  The proposals put forward by the Commission contain a few different elements, the most important of which concerns the proposals for the extension of the European Social Fund assistance to measures aimed at providing employment for young people.</P>
    <P>More specifically, the Commission proposes that the social fund should be used to support the cost of recruitment premiums for young people in the private sector and for special programmes to recruit young people for newly created jobs in the public sector. The Government fully support the principle behind these proposals and, indeed, the Government manifesto set out a specific objective incorporated in these proposals, that the social fund should focus more on relieving unemployment particularly among young people.</P>
    <P>We regard the proposed breakthrough to support direct job creation from the fund as particularly important.  The Government, while they support the proposal, would see little or no point in extending the scope of the social fund if the new measures were to be introduced at the expense of assistance for existing <Col N="85" /> measures which are already subvented by the fund.  This is a point that has been previously made by Senator Robinson.  Accordingly, the Government regard it as essential that resources to finance the new measures be made available to the fund.  The Commission was also suggesting that the fund resources should be augumented.  The Government would not disagree with the Joint Committee's view that the initial budgetary appropriations proposed by the Commission are inadequate but they recognise the political difficulties of securing agreement at Community level to the provision of amounts higher than those suggested by the Commission.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we will be well placed to take advantage of the proposed new fund assistance.  Senators will be aware that we already have in operation a scheme of recruitment subsidies which involves the payment of premiums to employers who recruit unemployed people under 20 years of age as additions to their work force.  At the moment employers receive £14 per week for about six months for each eligible young worker that they take on.  Already, employers have applied under the scheme for premiums in respect of about 2,500 young people. Many young persons under 25 years qualify under our general employment incentive scheme which provides premiums of £20 per week for about six months.</P>
    <P>Special public sector job-creation programmes of the type envisaged by the Commission are also being developed in Ireland.  For example, as a result of a recommendation which the Employment Action Team made to the Minister for Labour this year, the Government allocated £4 million to local authorities to enable them to recruit young people on a programme of environmental improvement.</P>
    <P>Recruitment for this programme is going ahead at the moment.  Similarly, the Department of Education offered grants to youth and sports organisations to enable them to employ young people on desirable community works which would not otherwise be undertaken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> The community youth training programme organised by AnCO is another example.  This already qualifies for social fund aid on account of its training content.  As regards the comments in the Joint Committee report about the staff of the National Manpower Service, steps have been taken to expand the staff of the service.  An open competition for placement officers has just been completed.  It is hoped to recruit from this at least 30 additional placement officers over the next few months.</P>
    <P>I touched on the scale of employment challenge, particularly for young people, facing us in the future.  It seems likely that we will have to consider supplementing our traditional job-creation programmes with special schemes designed to alleviate the situation further.  The availability of EEC assistance for special public sector projects will make the development of such projects more attractive and render possible a higher scale of operations than if domestic resources had to be relied on.  These projects can offer lasting benefits to the community. At the same time they can offer the unemployed a worth-while experience of working life and perhaps develop some basic skills.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Commission's proposals should be decided upon as quickly as possible and I would hope that the target date set for their acceptance at the end of next month will be achieved.  I am sure that all Senators will join me in that hope.  The comments in this Joint Committee report will, of course, be borne in mind by the Government in relation to further consideration by the various EEC bodies of youth employment problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like those who have spoken before me I too welcome the opportunity given to Seanad Éireann to discuss this Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I would like to join Senator Robinson in thanking the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Confederation of Irish Industry for their stated commitment that they would <Col N="87" /> provide assistance in regard to this report.</P>
      <P>All of us will agree that there are many social and economic problems confronting this country.  Of great importance is the fact that so many of our young people are unemployed. That brings with it many social problems, other than having no job.  Senator Molony referred to the problem of crime.  I think there is a direct correlation between the fact that so few young people have jobs and the high rate of crime in our community.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney and Senator Molony seem to think the problem of youth unemployment is something that has existed in Ireland only since last June, since the new Government took office. I am sure he is aware, as I am aware, that the Government's manifesto and the subsequent action by the Government, the setting up of the Employment Action Team, the allocation of £20 million in the recent budget to the specific provision of jobs for young people, are indications of the seriousness with which this Government are looking at the whole problem of youth unemployment.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the report draws attention to the EEC labour force survey carried out here in 1975.  It shows that 50 per cent of the population in Ireland is under 25 and that 43.6 per cent of the unemployed are young people. The problem in Ireland is much more serious than that in other countries where the Community average is only something in the region of 37 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that Seanad Éireann should give the lead in discussing this very important report of the Joint Committee. Since 1969, with one year an exception, the numbers of young people under 25 who were unemployed throughout the Community has increased. The percentage of the total work force unemployed has gone up from 24 to 37 per cent.  It is very easy to trot out figures and talk in terms of two million unemployed young people throughout Europe but we must look at the reality behind the problem.  We must ask ourselves why there are so many young people unemployed. <Col N="88" /> The joint report gives three reasons.  It says that it is partly due to the recession, partly due to the increased numbers of young women entering the labour force and partly due to the number of young people as a whole entering the labour force.</P>
    <P>In my view, there are other reasons. One of the reasons is that so many highly educated and highly qualified young people are entering the labour force.  Their expectations are very high. They are not satisfied with taking any job.  This is regrettable because recently, when I spoke to a number of industrialists, I was horrified to discover that they could not find young girls to work in factories.  Factory work may not be the most pleasant job but the message I would like Seanad Éireann to send out to our young people, particularly the young people who are looking for a job, is to take any job because a bad start in life is dreadful.  I would rather see a person with any job, no matter what that job, rather than have no job at all. Let them not be too choosey.  Let them take the job that is available if the job they would like is not to be had.</P>
    <P>In this country in recent years there has been too much emphasis on academic training and too little on technical training.  The result has been that there has been a great shortage of people with the necessary skills to set up the industries which we need so badly in Ireland.  I would like to draw Senator Harte's attention to the fact that it is not public enterprise alone which will solve the problem. It is a joint problem for public and private enterprise together.</P>
    <P>One of the ways the Community can help is by allocating more money to young people to set up industry.  Initiative and innovation must be rewarded and must be assisted.  This alone will solve the problem.  We must give young men and women with the necessary flair the finance to set about building up industry so that our young people can have more jobs.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte also criticised the fact that the Government were not placing enough emphasis on the role of <Col N="89" /> the public sector in the provision of jobs.  The public sector can go so far but most of the jobs available through the public sector are jobs that are not productive and I would prefer to see the emphasis on the private sector where the jobs are productive.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that the problem of youth unemployment is a Community problem, which must be tackled by the Community.  The moneys allocated since 1975, 280 million units of account, are not sufficient.  The Community has a role to play in seeing that the most serious problem confronting it is tackled very soon.  I would like more Community money made available for the purpose of providing jobs for our young people. Side by side with that, national governments, particularly the Government in Ireland where it is a very serious and crucial problem, must provide the necessary incentives and aids so that our young people can have a real chance in life to secure a job.</P>

      <P>One aspect of this problem which does not usually get the attention it deserves and to which I was glad to hear Senators Cooney and Harney refer is the effect of long-term unemployment in areas of social concern. A symptom of the unease caused by continuous and enforced idleness is the high degree of absenteeism which exists at present in our post-primary schools in urban areas.  This is the subject of a report brought out by a subcommittee of Dublin City Council early in 1976 to which I have referred before in the House and to which I shall refer at any available opportunity I get because it is very important.  It says that:</P>
      <P>the cause of absenteeism is that young people no longer feel that the curriculum in the educational system offers them the practical help they need at this point in time.</P>
      <P>It seems, therefore, that many young people see no point in belonging to an educational system which fails to provide them with the help they need to face up to being part of the dole queue when they leave school.  The system has failed to respond to the stimulus of large-scale youth unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> Young people are entitled to expect and even demand that the educational system should respond to this stimulus. We are being less than honest if we continue to permit a system to exist that does not prepare them adequately for the future in which the spectre of long-term unemployment will be the most significant feature.</P>

      <P>This first debate on a report of the Joint Committee on European Community Secondary Legislation has achieved at least part of the objective and completed the cycle involved in having a scrutiny committee on European Community legislation. The report has alerted Senators to the problem in the European Community context, and to the still graver dimension of the problem in Ireland both because of the higher percentage unemployment of young people and the fact that it will extend for a longer period.  The Minister, and every Senator who spoke, referred to the gravity of the problem and its longer continuity here.</P>
      <P>It was a very interesting debate because it threw up an ideological divide which must be there in examining the priorities and emphasis in coping with unemployment.  That ideological divide will become sharper as the problem worsens.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney and Senator Molony raised the question that it is possible that the capitalist system would fail to cope with the problem.  I would go further and say we are seeing the death of the capitalist system or the free market system as the norm in western Europe and as the political culture in which we grew up.  It is very difficult in Ireland, because we are very conservative in our attitudes, to quite comprehend what we are seeing. I firmly believe that we are witnessing the slow death of capitalism and that it has gone beyond revival.  It is in that kind of context that we must examine both the scope of the problems and the way of coping with them.  That is not to deny &mdash; certainly for an interim period &mdash; that we must look both to the private sector and to the public sector for the initiative and the means to cope with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> I must take issue with the Senators, particularly Senator Harney and other Senators, who seemed to view the public sector as in some way &ldquo;unproductive&rdquo; or potentially less productive than the private sector.  I cannot understand the basis of this.  It is precisely when we expand the State enterprise involvement in the profitable sectors of the economy and in productive employment that we will begin to cope with the dimension of the problem.</P>
    <P>It might be useful to refer to our failure down the years to cope with the unemployment problem, even at times of growth and expansion in the economy.  There is a need for a very radical change of approach, not to undermine existing employment or penalise the private sector, but to realise that it is completely unfair and indeed resented by the private sector to expect too much from it in employment creation.  It is very interesting to see the way the private sector is running away from the attempt by the Government to pin them as the main job creating sector.  It is neither realistic nor is it going to help us to resolve this immense problem.  I would like to quote from the analysis in the report on youth employment in Ireland submitted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to members of the sub-committee.  That report stated:</P>
    <P>The White Paper expects that these growth rates will result in an average annual net increase of 29,000 in non-agricultural employment. The major contribution to this target is expected to come from manufacturing industry where an average growth rate of 13 per cent over the 1978-80 period to give a net increase in manufacturing employment of 13,500 each year.  What must be realised, of course, is that private enterprise never realised that level of growth in employment in the past.  In the 1960s the net increase in manufacturing employment was only approx.  3,000 on average each year.  In the period 1970-77, the net increase in manufacturing employment only totalled <Col N="92" /> between 2,000 and 3,200 workers. This is less than one-fifth of the net increase in manufacturing employment required on average each year if we are to reduce the unemployment figure to 50,000 by 1986.  Even the last performance of the manufacturing sector to date during the boom years of 1973 and 1977, only came to half of what is required.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions draws the conclusions from this that there is a need for a significant increase in State enterprise involvement in profitable sectors of the economy. It calls for that kind of involvement immediately: for a national development corporation that would be able to exploit the resources, to command the structures which we need because there is just no way in which we can continue as we are at the moment and expect some magic change in the volume of job creation which we have had in the past.  We must be able to predict patterns for the future from the experiences of the past.  We must realise that, as has been said by a number of Senators, unless we do commit ourselves as a very young country to radical change in our approach both to job creation and also to taxation and distribution of wealth within the country &mdash; a very radical approach indeed&mdash; then we will see a worsening of the social conditions, a growing disparity between those who have wealth and the poorer sections and a switching off of the generations who fail to get employment here.</P>
    <P>One aspect was not mentioned and I feel I ought to bring it in at this stage.  That is the possible dramatic increase in the emigration figures.  We know that these figures are increasing as it is, but if the Commission in its communication, as summarised in this report, points to the tapering off of the problem in other European Community countries by the eighties and we still have a graver problem right into the nineties and to the end of the century, what are we going to do? Are we going to see another drain of our young people, of very dramatic proportions, to service industry in the inner triangle of the European Community, <Col N="93" /> Germany and the Netherlands and so on?  That is a very crucial problem which is posed both by the analysis of the Commission and by the report itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister feels that the report will be of assistance to the Government in bringing home the dimensions of the problem here and arguing, as Senator Whitaker said, a special case for Ireland in relation to the size of our unemployment problem, the unusually high birth rate and therefore the longer continuity of this problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the number of Senators who waited till this somewhat late hour in the Seanad in order to contribute to this debate.  This is a very good first example of the Seanad completing the democratic cycle by noting and debating the report of the Joint Committee which has called to its attention a particularly grave and urgent problem.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not available for the debate and I regret that it is impossible for some other Minister to have stood in for him to respond to the debate as has been the custom in former debates on the Adjournment.  However, I welcome the opportunity through this motion to draw attention to the absence of adequate prior consultation with the unions involved before the recent &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of a decision by the Minister to sign the deeds of trust in relation to community schools.  Senator Murphy has indicated an interest in contributing to the debate, and I said that I would stop my contribution in time to enable him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> The proposal for community schools has been on the table for some time and has been discussed actively since 1971.  But it has been discussed in a very one-sided way because there has been an absence of adequate information, adequate consultation and genuine negotiation on the very fundamental and basic issues which arise.</P>
    <P>Even before tabling this motion I tried to ascertain precisely how the recent speculation about the intention of the Minister for Education to sign the deeds of trust for community schools had surfaced because since March there has been a very considerable degree of momentum following the apparent report of a decision by the Minister that he is going to sign deeds of trust in a matter of weeks. I thought it would be easy to find the authority for this.  Presumably I only had to find the reference in a speech by the Minister in the Dáil or even in a speech at a relevant function. Instead, like so much else concerning the issues involved in establishing community schools, it is shrouded in mystery.  There is no clear statement by the Minister that he is or is not going to sign the deeds of trust.</P>
    <P>There is no clear statement on whether or not there are going to be different deeds of trust in relation to different types of community schools, and there is indeed very little clear evidence on many of the issues on which one would have thought there would have to be open and frank consultation. A motion like this on the Adjournment cannot go into the very basic and vital issues involved, issues of Church/State relations and issues of management and control of these community schools.  It can only focus on the absence of adequate consultation with the unions involved since 1971 and right up to this recent apparent decision to sign the deeds of trust within a matter of weeks.  Indeed, until the consultations which took place last week with the TUI and today with the ASTI there were no general and detailed consultations with the unions on the subject of community schools as opposed to some reference on a much <Col N="95" /> longer agenda to community schools. Needless to say the unions involved have made several representations since 1972, particularly on the question of teacher participation in the management of the schools; opposing the idea of special places for religious; querying the provisions relating to the security of tenure of teachers and to the position of religious teachers.  But representations are not consultation, and they were not based on adequate knowledge of the basis on which the decision is to be taken, of what the possible areas of negotiation might be.</P>
    <P>This absence of open and accountable information and consultation has promoted the risk that the differing views&mdash;and of course there are differing views and differing interests of the parties involved, the teaching unions themselves, the religious orders, the Department; there are different priorities and different interests &mdash; may have become hardened and polarised so that it may be much more difficult to get ultimate agreement.  This could prejudice the operation of the community schools and undermine the kind of idea which was there initially and for which there was considerable enthusiasm about the role that the community school could play within the community.</P>
    <P>The teachers' unions were not consulted about or involved in the actual drawing up of the deeds of trust. Indeed, there appears to be some evidence that the religious orders who are involved were not consulted in the actual drawing up of the deeds of trust either, and if the Minister were here I would have hoped to be able to get from him some information about who exactly was actively consulted and involved in drawing up the deeds of trust.  This is vital to the whole process of consultation, because the deeds of trust as they stand at the moment &mdash; from the example of the deed of trust for Tallaght which was reproduced in today's <i>Irish Press</i> and which has been in the Library of the Oireachtas since before Christmas following the tabling of a question by <Col N="96" /> the Labour spokesman on Education &mdash; appear to pre-empt in a very important way some of the vital issues which relate to the contract of service or contract of employment of teachers in those schools.  This, therefore, raises a very fundamental question about what is the appropriate kind of consultation required.  If the deed of trust has pre-empted very vital areas which relate to the contract of service, the contract of employment of individual teachers, this is a strange way of approaching such a vital issue in a democracy&mdash;not to allow negotiation on those terms, not to allow the views of the teachers' unions to be very substantially represented at that stage.</P>
    <P>The questions which are still unanswered and which should be answered are, first, who was actively consulted in the actual drafting of the deed or deeds of trust for the existing community schools?  The second and related question is whether the deeds of trust are to be identical for the different types of community schools, whether they form an amalgamation of existing schools or the creation of a community school initially where there was not a school before and involving the different groups.</P>
    <P>Turning again to the question of consultation, it would be less vital to the teachers' unions to be actively consulted in the drawing up of the deed of trust if they had been able to negotiate the contracts of service of their members and if these contracts &mdash;whether in draft form or in final form&mdash;had dealt clearly with matters which one would expect to be dealt with in the contract of services: matters such as the manner of appointment, of promotion, qualifications, security of tenure and the question of dismissals.  If that had been clearly negotiated and there was confidence that the position of teachers was secured in that sense there might be less concern about an absence of consultation on the actual deed of trust.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as I say, the deed of trust on which there was no consultation has pre-empted or is purporting to pre-empt the very key issues that arise in all these areas, the key <Col N="97" /> issue of appointment; the key issue of promotion especially if you have, as the present deed of trust would purport to put forward, the question of reserved places.  How does this affect promotional opportunities?  How does it affect employment opportunities generally?  Then there are the much deeper issues.  Is it reconcilable with the provisions of the Constitution with regard to education to have reserved places for members of religious orders? There is the question of the security of tenure of teachers.  Here there is an interesting provision in the deed of trust.  I am quoting from the text set out in <i>The Irish Press</i> of today.  It is the final provision in relation to the conditions and it states that:</P>
    <P>No teacher shall at any time do or say anything which may offend or weaken the religious belief or the moral training in practice of pupils in the school.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand what a provision like that means, in the sense that I would have thought a provision of that sort would be superfluous. If it is not superfluous then I must regard it as opening up a whole discretionary area which would undermine the security of tenure of teachers. I know this has caused considerable concern.  It is the kind of provision which must make teachers more apprehensive about their general conditions of service and their conditions of employment in the schools.  As I understand it, the teachers in some of the schools have been teaching there for up to five years without any written contract of service but only on the understanding that their position will not be &ldquo;worsened&rdquo; when a contract is produced.</P>
    <P>What does that mean to an individual teacher?  Worsened is a subjective kind of word.  In whose perspective or in whose opinion will the teacher's position not be worsened?  Will it be in the opinion of the Minister or in the opinion of a teacher who under a particular scheme has a certain protection in the employment, particularly those at present under the vocational education scheme?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Again an active and open consultation from the beginning on these issues would have prevented the kind of polarisation which is emerging.  The motion necessarily ties me to emphasising this aspect of consultation and relating it to consultation with the teachers' unions.  I do not for one moment want to be thought to eliminate consultation with the other interests involved.  I must hope that the technicality of an Adjournment motion protects me from being thought only to emphasise consultation with the teachers' unions.  There are very many extremely serious issues involved in the whole proposal relating to community schools.  When I put the emphasis on consultation it was really because this illustrates another area of education policy which goes on behind closed doors; where documents are produced and nobody is quite sure who is involved in the drafting of them.</P>
    <P>Even when there is a generally held view that a decision is to be taken in a few weeks, it is very hard to find the source of that decision.  It is very hard to find very hard evidence at all.  There is a lack of clarity and openness in the approach.  Yet the issues involved are important not only for the teachers who will work in the community schools, but for the parents of children and for the children themselves who will go to the community schools and for the religious orders who will participate in the community schools.  There are overriding issues of Church-State relations, of the involvement of Church and the role of the State in relation to our education.  These issues should not be submerged but should be fully discussed.  They should not be distorted by lack of sufficient information and clarity from the Department and from the Minister concerned.  It is appropriate on an Adjournment debate to draw attention to what appears to have been a very serious lack of adequate consultation since 1971 which has aggravated and polarised the dispute so that there is a sense of the different sides now desperately trying at a late stage to protect their own interests and their <Col N="99" /> own priorities in relation to these schools.  The danger is that the schools themselves may suffer if they begin to get an image of being places where there is controversy, disputes and so on.  This would be bad both in the short- and in the long-term for the education of the children there.  I regret that neither the Minister nor any other Minister could be present to hear the points I wanted to make on this and I make way for Senator Murphy and any Government spokesmen to respond to those points.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Robinson for the opportunity of letting me support what she had to say.  Like her, I am sorry that the Minister is not here.  I have some sympathy with the Minister in the cleft stick in which he appears to find himself but that sympathy is modified by my belief in the old homely proverb about getting out of the kitchen if one is distressed by the excessive temperature.</P>
      <P>What is quite mysterious is that the Minister, above all people, should have fallen foul of the teachers' unions on this point, non-consultation.  He has had first-hand experience of very long standing frustrations of lay post-primary teachers and he knows how sensitive they are, and with good reason, about the lack of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his days as a teacher and in my days as a post-primary teacher, in addition to the whips and scorns of time and the certain knowledge that you were never going to make it to the top in a religious-controlled school there was the further ignominy of not being consulted.  This psychology about consultation goes very deep indeed with teachers.  Therefore it strikes me as mysterious why the Minister should <Col N="100" /> have omitted this very diplomatic and essential piece of policy.  Perhaps it is poetic justice that it is this Minister who is now in this situation, a former president of the ASTI who in his own day courageously upheld the rights of his fellow lay teachers against not only clerical control but against clerical hyprocisy as well.  He must know that the teachers unions, the ASTI, the TUI, are no longer the diffident and gentlemanly bodies they were in his time and mine.  He must know now that they have considerable clout and it is quite clear from their statements and the statements of their executive officers that they will have no inhibitions about putting that clout to good effect.</P>
    <P>I should have thought it would have been basic survival strategy for the Minister to observe the need for consulation. I do not want to wander into the issues behind the dispute.  Quite clearly the Minister is in, the perhaps, unenviable position of having to face a confrontation that has been building up for a long time, one that is made all the more ironic in that in some areas religious are closing down schools while in others they are claiming a special and privileged guarantee on staffs.</P>
    <P>Again, I am sorry the Minister is not here because I would have liked to have made this personal appeal to him through the Chair and to say that unless he is poacher-turned-game-keeper, or as he might appreciate himself, unless he is <i>quantum mutatus ab illo Hectore</i>, he has the opportunity now of reconciling conflicting interests. As one of his former colleagues in a teachers' union, I urge him at least to postpone the signature of these deeds of trust until full consultation has taken place with teacher unions. That course is demanded of him by not only past loyalty to his erstwhile colleagues but by considerations of prudence and basic survival strategy.</P>

      <P>In summary I would like to say again that the Minister was unable to be here to listen to this debate and to reply to it for the simple reason that at that time he was in consultation with one of the bodies concerned very much with these deeds.  He asked me to stand in for him and to reply to the debate as follows.</P>

      <P>The essence of Senator Robinson's argument was that the Minister had not had consultation with anybody.  The speech I have put before the House on his behalf clearly demonstrates that the Minister has had consultations with the various bodies who are basically concerned with the signing of the deeds of these schools and that the Minister in fact is ensuring <Col N="104" /> that no deeds will be signed without there being full consultation with lay and clerical organisations. That is demonstrably clear from what I have read and put to the House on behalf of the Minister</P>
      <P>I would submit that it is unfair to make the charge that is implicit in this motion, that is, that the Minister is avoiding his duty by not having consultations with the bodies concerned. The Minister is taking every care to ensure that the proper consultations will be held and that no deed will be signed until all parties are satisfied and the rights of all concerned are ensured.</P>
      <P>Cad eile a bhfuil sibh ag súil leis? Cad eile atá uaibh?  Fiafraím é sin den Teach.  Céard atá uaibh ach amháin an dearbhú atá ins an script sin ón Aire nach síneoidh sé aon ionstraim iontaobhais ar son an Rialtais nó ar son na tíre idir aon phobalscoil nó go mbeidh sé sásta go bhfuil na heagraíochtaí éagsúla múinteoirí sásta agus go bhfuil siad i gcomhpháirt leis an rud a shíneoidh sé nuair a shíneos sé é, agus síneoidh agus beidh toradh air agus beidh sé sásúil de réir dlí agus de réir na Críostaíochta.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 May 1978.</P>
