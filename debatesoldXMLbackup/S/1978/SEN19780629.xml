    <Title>International Development Association (Special Action Account) Bill, 1978: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to participate in the Special Action Programme agreed to by the developed country participants at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation at its closing session in Paris in June 1977.</P>
      <P>The Conference on International Economic Co-operation &mdash; CIEC or the North/South Dialogue &mdash; was established in Paris in 1975, to discuss matters of mutual interest to industrial and developing countries.  The conference established four commissions covering the fields of energy, raw materials, development and finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the areas of development and finance a major theme was the effect the increase in energy costs in 1973-74 and the recession in developed countries had on the economies of the poorest developing countries.  Particular attention was paid to the deterioration in the balance of payments and the rapidly increasing debt burden of these countries.  Against <Col N="1160" /> this background the developing countries participating at the conference argued for a scheme of immediate and generalised debt relief &mdash; in effect, the cancellation of official debt and the consolidation and re-scheduling of commercial debt for interested countries.</P>
    <P>The industrial and developed countries could accept that international economic conditions in 1973-74 had aggravated the already difficult situation facing many of the poorest countries. However, it was felt that generalised debt relief was not the best way to tackle these difficulties.  Some of the more advanced of the developing countries felt that the concept of generalised debt relief could affect their credit standing and access to additional finance on commercials terms.  In the case of some of the poorest countries the debt repayment problem was not the most important issue: it was rather a case of how to increase new flows of external finance.</P>
    <P>The European Community felt that a partial solution lay in the provision of additional financial assistance, and it consequently proposed at the final session in June 1977 a $1 billion &ldquo;special action&rdquo; programme designed to meet the needs of the low income countries facing special difficulties.  This was agreed to by the other developed countries, and it was decided that the $1 billion programme be shared as follows: the EEC $385 million; the United States $375 million; Japan $114 million; Canada $51 million; the balance to be provided by Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Australia.  Of the EEC share, Ireland agreed to contribute $1.04 million or 0.27 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>While the original Community proposal had envisaged a multilateral action administered by the International Development Association to which both industrialised and OPEC countries would contribute, other contributors have, in fact, chosen different types of contribution varying from debt relief to bilateral measures.  Both the United States and Japan indicated that their contributions to the programme would be in bilateral form.  The Community have, however, maintained their commitment to a multilateral action in the form of aid channelled through the association. <Col N="1161" /> In this regard, an agreement was concluded between the EEC and member states on the one hand, and the association on the other hand, which sets out the conditions under which the EEC contributions will be administered by the association.</P>
    <P>This agreement, establishing the Special Action Account with the association, is the subject of the present Bill.  It gives the association the responsibility of administering the EEC's contribution of $385 million, subject to the following general provisions: loans from the account shall be concentrated on the poorest developing countries, that is, those countries with a GNP <i>per capita</i> of $280 or less in 1976; the association will take into account the relative poverty of the developing country and its long-term growth potential, the degree of need for official development assistance for external capital, the extent to which international economic developments have contributed to the problems of the country, its prospective balance of payments, the composition and direction of its debt service commitments, and the extent to which its problems are likely to be met by contributions from other sources.  Each special action credit will be made for the purpose of financing a clearly-identifiable, quick-disbursing programme or project and will be made available interest-free, repayments being made over 50 years, this term to include a ten-year grace period &mdash; that is the usual highly concessionary IDA terms.</P>
    <P>Contributions to the Special Action Account can be made in cash or demand notes.  The use of demand notes has the advantage from the donor's point of view that cash is not drawn down until projects being financed are sufficiently advanced to require it.  The agreement envisages that contributions be made in two instalments, the first amounting to 45 per cent of the contribution immediately after the EEC notify the association that all their members have ratified the agreement, the second on 1 January 1979.  The contribution counts as part of our official Development Assistance Programme and provision has been made for it in this year's allocation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> The approval of this Bill will, therefore, enable Ireland to play its role in putting the Special Action Programme into effect.  This programme is specifically designed to help those of the poorest countries, whose problems have been caused to some extent by inernational developments outside their own control.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My party welcome this Bill and will support it as initiated.  An encouraging feature which appears from the Minister's speech is that the EEC contribution in this aid scheme is being made on a multilateral basis throughout the Community.  This is desirable.  It identifies the EEC as, perhaps, a separate political unit, or an identifiable political unit in its own right.  It is proper that aid being provided should be provided in this way.  The total amount being provided is, of course, a matter which has been negotiated separately for individual countries.  Our amount of the total is small, as it would have to be having regard to our relative position among the other contributors.</P>
      <P>From time to time we read expressions of disappointment from people that the Irish contribution generally in this area is not larger than is provided for from time to time.  It is important that we recognise that there are constraints which make us perhaps act less generously than our inclination would lead us to do.  It is unfortunate that commitments were given in opposition in this are which have not been possible to fulfil in Government.  However, be that as it may, there is a general earnest on the part of all sides in the Oireachtas to ensure that the country to the best of its ability and resources will contribute to the needs of the less well-off parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, apart from Government assistance a considerable amount is given through private agencies for relief in the under-developed countries.  It is important, however, that in picking the agency they want to use, people should be quite clear what the objectives of the agency in question are.  Some agencies are specifically designed to assist in the <Col N="1163" /> relief of hunger, such as Gorta, and have no involvement in the politics or quasipolitics of the Third World.  There are other agencies about whom there may be some misunderstanding.  Initially it was understood that their contributions would be in the same area as Gorta, for the direct relief of hunger, either by contributing immediately to famines or by the origination of schemes which would assist in the long term easing or removal of food problems in some of these developing countries.</P>
    <P>There are other agencies, such as the agency of the Catholic Church &mdash; Trocaire &mdash; which as far as one can see involve a mixture of aid.  It is not entirely aid for the relief of hunger because that organisation have now made it clear through a statement by their director that they feel they have an obligation to be involved in politics in a quasi-political way in the Third World.  Many people contributing to that organisation might not realise that their contributions are not going exclusively for the relief of hunger.  It is important not only that the private agencies should be supported but that the people supporting them should know exactly how their contributions are being spent.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is the second international aid Bill which has come to the House in this session. It is a very necessary and practical measure.  It is also an area in which it is very nice to see Ireland playing a role. We have a great deal to contribute to the developing countries and the association between the developing countries and the developed countries.  This has already been seen to some extent in the North-South dialogue in which we and I must refer particularly to the role played by the far side of the House &mdash; played a very useful part.  Indeed, it is excellent to see that this is a matter on which the European Economic Community are working together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People do not quite realise just how much the energy crisis affected the poorer countries of the world.  In discussing the Finance Bill yesterday, from time to time we touched on the effect it had on our economy.  It had a severe effect <Col N="1164" /> on our economy but nowhere near as severe as on the developing if they did not have the natural resource.  For many of them it meant their entire foreign exchange had to be devoted just to obtain basic energy requirements.  Indeed, the effect has been to throw several of them back into an even worse poverty than existed in the sixties.  One is very glad to see this practical measure being taken to give some aid to the poorer countries.</P>
    <P>One of the most crucial general world political issues at the moment, apart from the east-west confrontation, is that the poorer nations are not catching up with the richer nations.  Although we may not fully realise it, we are one of the richer nations, if you look at the list of nations who are contributing: the United States, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Australia and our partners in the EEC.  They are together as the wealthy countries, a very few and limited number of countries from the entire world.  There is this sad and very dangerous situation developing in which the poorer nations are not in any sense catching up on the wealthier nations.  They have fallen very much further behind and, as things are going at present, this looks like getting worse, rather than improving.  One is very glad to see that in this agreement it is intended that very practical, clearly identifiable projects will be the ones which will be supported.</P>
    <P>I would not under-estimate our contribution of over one million dollars.  It compares very favourably in relation to our resources with the amount being provided by the United States.  Certainly, one would like it to be more and I hope as our own economic and financial position improves on both ides of the House we will gladly agree to give further funds.  One aspect which is very important is that, however distasteful it may be, the expenditure of these funds should be closely monitored.  There is, unfortunately, no doubt that some funds have not gone to the projects and the intentions for which they were intended.  Obviously any independent State has its own prerogative as to what it decides to do.  It is important and, indeed, may well make it easier for certain of the States concerned if it is made very clear that the donating countries will be monitoring <Col N="1165" /> the actual distribution and effect of the funds contributed.  The Bill is a very essential and very welcome Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this Bill. I am gratified that the Government are taking positive action in relation to the poorer countries.  Ireland was a poor country for a very long time and, while we may not be exactly wallowing in wealth, at least we are in a better position than many of our brothers throughout the world.  I must express some disquiet at the way some aid is administered throughout the world, especially to the poorer countries, and more especially at times of famine and disasters.  I am sure many Senators here read the very disquieting article in one of the more reputable Sunday papers in the past couple of weeks which clearly showed that the massive amounts being granted in aid to those poorer countries were not finding their way ultimately to the people who most deserved them. Like Senator Conroy I feel we should monitor very closely how this money is spent.</P>
      <P>It is a pointless exercise to allocate funds from the taxpayers' contributions if they are used to keep some dictator in power, or ensure that he can buy more arms and become more militant in the upholding of a police State.  This is the type of concern I would like to allay in the minds of many people who contribute towards these worth-while projects.</P>
      <P>Certainly, the principle of aiding less well-off countries is beyond reproach, but I wonder how much of the one million dollars we are allocating from Irish funds will eventually reach the source we would like it to reach.  I hope the agencies through which we operate, operate more efficiently then many other agencies we have all heard about.  Indeed, it would be tragic if aid were prevented from going to poorer countries because of maladministration or misadministration. Like the other Senators I believe the principle is exactly right, but let us make sure the money gets to the proper source eventually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I want to join in welcoming this Bill.  I am very glad that Ireland is playing its part in <Col N="1166" /> making a contribution to this multilateral EEC attempt to do something to relieve conditions in the poorest countries of the world.  They are those within the GNP <i>per capita</i> of 280 dollars or less.  That is the limit, but there are hundreds of millions of people within that limit whose average <i>per capita</i> income is very much lower, only of the order of £1.50 to £2 a week.  That gives us some idea of the poverty, squalor and hopelessness in which their lives are cast. This deprivation was accentuated greatly by the sudden rise in the cost of energy and by the general recession in world demand which that provoked.  It is hard for us in one of the 25 richest countries in the world, to understand the meaning of the poverty in which the hundreds of millions of our fellowmen live.  The one point that came home most forcibly to me is that millions of children in these countries, through protein deficiency, suffer an irreversible permanent stunting of their mental as well as physical development.  This, to me, is one of the most horrifying facts of the poverty which prevails among such a large proportion of the population of the world.</P>
      <P>While I note that this contribution comes out of the total aid allocation we have assigned for this year, I want to express the hope that that total aid allocation will be expanding greatly as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the uses or the sources to which this money will be going, I would endorse the remarks about the need for monitoring.  In particular, we should be trying to move our aid away from just responding to immediate disaster and famine, although it is important that we should make such contributions towards doing something of a more permanent kind to remedy the conditions from which the countries permanently suffer.  I mean by applying the resources more to permanent development solutions, through irrigation and improvement of agriculture, and so on, than just coming in after the disaster has happened and trying to remedy it.  In those very disorganised conditions there is always the greater risk of money going astray and not going to those for whom it was intended.  With those brief <Col N="1167" /> remarks, I should like to welcome the Bill very strongly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill. I take the opportunity to point out the way countries like Ireland can help poorer countries whose conditions have been described in statistical terms by Senators and by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the four areas mentioned: the fields of energy, raw materials, development, and finance. There is a fair amount of emphasis on recycling debts in the case of these countries, and so there is a fair amount of emphasis on the finance side.  I should like to address myself to the development idea.  It is important that these countries should learn how to help themselves.  Ireland has a great deal to offer in that area, particularly our knowledge in the agricultural field and, more recently, our knowledge of how to build an industrial nation from an agricultural one.  Because of the fact that over the years Ireland has never been associated with the exploitation of poorer countries, Irish people might be more acceptable in a development role than some of the other countries who have benefited to an undue extent from contact with them.</P>
      <P>I would hope Irish people would become involved in this development process.  I will mention one example.  The Irish Management Institute for quite some time have been visiting various developing countries and poorer countries and giving aid in the area of management development.  These people have to learn how to manage their own affairs more effectively.  This not only makes a positive contribution to the poorer countries but as always the teacher learns as well.  It is very good for our people.  They go abroad and come back with a wider perspective and are all the better for it.  I hope there will be a big Irish involvement in the development side through this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has a spin-off effect for us too in providing employment at a high level, in jobs involving professional training.  For many years Ireland has had a missionary dimension which can now be expanded into economic development.  The <Col N="1168" /> development of satellite and world telecommunications will enable us to see what is going on in these countries. When we see photographs or films there seems to be some time dimension which removes us from the reality of what is going on.  With satellite communication this will disappear and there could very well be quite a shake-up in the world situation.  It is possible that having highly developed countries with a GNP <i>per capita</i> of five figures in dollars and other countries on single figures will not last.</P>
    <P>A final point is the fact Irish officials and Ministers making contact with visitors from abroad should try to influence the development process and recognise some of the principles of development advocated for instance by people like Paulo Freire who brings out the point that development aid cannot be brought in and laid on people, that developers have to go in and join those people at their level of understanding. Senator Whitaker spoke about mental deprivation affecting the mass pyschology of poorer countries.  It is important that developers do not go in with all the answers but that they join them at their level of understanding of their problems and work out from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for the welcome they have given this Bill and for the general points made.  I do not think it is necessary for me to reply in detail to all the points made, but I think it important that I should reply to points made by Senators Conroy and Crowley about the monitoring of the expenditure of such aid.  It is internationally recognised that the development association is the most effective way of giving aid and Senators can be assured that that expenditure is for the purpose intended originally.  The agreement in the Schedule to this Bill provides for full consultation between parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Whitaker of moving aid away from disaster relief is a good one.  I would like to point out that in our expenditure last year of £7.2 million approximately £100,000 only was for this disaster-type relief.  So we <Col N="1169" /> have already moved away from what has become known as disaster relief and moved into the area of what might be described as more concrete development aid for developing countries.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators again for their welcome of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this short measure arises from the fact that the limit of £60 million on the creation and issue of land bonds, imposed by the Land Bond Act, 1975, has now been reached.  Legislative authority for the creation of additional bonds is needed, so that there may be no hold-up in the current acquisition work of the Land Commission.  The proposal is to raise the limit by £20 million to £80 million.</P>
      <P>Senators may like to know that land bonds are created from time to time by the Minister for Finance under land bond orders, which also fix the rate of interest in respect of each particular series.  The current series bear interest at 12½ per cent and are redeemable in 32 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have made it clear that they are not committed to continuing present land policy indefinitely. Indeed, they have announced their intention to amend that policy and to establish a land development authority which will be responsible for structural reform.  My Department are at present engaged in a full examination of the whole position, taking account of the final report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Land Structure Reform, which was recently presented to the Government.  The report is now being <Col N="1170" /> printed and is expected to be published within the next week or so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that he will be putting to his colleagues in the Government, before the end of this year, a comprehensive set of proposals designed to up-date policy in the light of present-day requirements.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, the existing system must continue to operate and additional land bonds are needed for this; hence this short enabling Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection to this Bill on this side of the House, but it gives us an opportunity to say a few words on the Land Commission and their policies and what we would recommend to the new land development authority which it is proposed to set up in the near future.</P>
      <P>Is the increase from £60 million to £80 million just for a period of time, say 12 months, to carry us over until the new authority is set up?  When the new authority is set up, will the Minister be back to us again asking for an increased monetary bank?  In my opinion £80 million is not sufficient to do what is necessary to create a new land structure.  It is an increase of £20 million only and this sum will buy very little land now.  As we know, the price of land is reaching over £2,000 an acre and £20 million will have little effect.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Land Commission have never paid the price that land has been valued at.  They have purchased land at very much reduced prices. Whether that was fair or not is a matter of opinion.  If we read the 1976 annual report of the Irish Land Commission we will see there that land had been purchased at about £670 an acre while land was making well over £1,000 an acre at that time on the open market.  It is my opinion that the Land Commission were getting cheap land.  Perhaps the land was not of the same quality as that then making £2,000 or £1,500 an acre, but I would like the Minister to assure me that the Land Commission paid the full value for the land acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the term of 32 years is much too long because of the type of inflation we have had during the past <Col N="1171" /> number of years and the inflation we will have in the future.  There is no doubt that there will be inflation, whether it be 5 per cent, 6 per cent or 10 per cent; we are going to have continuing inflation over a number of years.  For that reason I would suggest that the term of years be reduced from 32 years to, say, 20 years. This would give people some value when the term of their land bonds is up and the money is paid.</P>
    <P>The interest recommended is 12½ per cent, but if we look back we see that there has been interest of 15 per cent and 16 per cent paid on land bonds.  In the orders made on 30 January 1976 and on 19 October 1976 land bonds were created at 15 per cent.  A further order on 19 October 1976 created 16 per cent land bonds.  I cannot understand why there is now a reduction in percentage from 16 or 15 per cent to 12½ per cent.  I believe that if 15 per cent or 16 per cent was the correct percentage paid at that time, a reduction to 12½ per cent under the circumstances is not right.  It should be increased to 15 per cent or 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the structure of agriculture and the picture that we get from the report.  Since the 1923 Land Act, three million acres have been bought from landlords by the Land Commission.  That would be an average of 60,000 acres a year.  There seems to be a reduction in the amount of land purchased by the Land Commission in latter years.  I think the reason for that is that when the British left the country there was so much derelict land around that it was necessary for the Land Commission to take over that land and redistribute it amongst the Irish farmers. It seems now that the land bank is reducing every year and it will probably reduce further because farmers are better educated now to work their land. There will be very little land available to the Land Commission, unless there are compulsory orders made so that the Land Commission can take over land that is not being used properly.  Whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of opinion.  We have a good agricultural advisory service and we could in the future have better agricultural education.  There <Col N="1172" /> would be more interest in the land.  For that reason the land bank available to the Land Commission would be very much reduced.</P>
    <P>Some people say that there should be a limit of 200 acres or so on the size of land holdings, and the Minister believes that is so.  In my opinion it is something that should be considered but it is not something that should be rushed into. Freedom is very important.  Any interference with freedom can create many great difficulties, so I would give the question of limiting landholdings more thought before we rush into the idea.  It is a very important subject.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are the holders of thousands and thousands of acres of land for long periods of time and I would suggest that they would look into their holdings and divide them more quickly.  I would suggest that the Land Commission should not have any land longer than three or four years without having it divided.  There may be an occassion where the title may not be clear and that might take a longer time.  The amount of land that would be in doubt would be small.  The Land Commission would have land in their possession to which there is clear title, but still the division of that land takes so long.  I am not condemning the Land Commission for this because I know there are problems, even in congested areas.  At the same time the opinion is that the Land Commission are too slow in dividing this land and that they let the land to get back the moneys they paid for it.  If that is the case it is wrong.  The land should be divided as quickly as possible amongst the farmers.</P>
    <P>There are also a few matters in this annual report to which I should like to refer.  First, I would like to congratulate the holders of land given by the Land Commission on the payment of their annuities. I see that only .07 per cent of the annuities due last year were not paid. This is a credit to those people who have got land from the Land Commission and who realise that the onus is on them to pay back the rent.  I do not think any great improvement can be made on that. Great credit is due to those people who have obtained land for the Land Commission in that they are paying back their rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Land bonds are not as good as Government stock.  I believe they should be, because the financial institutions are not interested in purchasing them.  That is proof that the land bonds must not be as good as Government stock.  At one time they were and there was a great demand for the purchase of those land bonds.  Recently there seems to be no interest among financial institutions in the purchase of them and I would like to know why this is so.  There must be a reason, for it.</P>
    <P>Page 24 of the 1976 annual report deals with the farmers' voluntary retirement scheme.  It is a topic close to all our hearts.  Only 805 applicants have been adjudged eligible out of 1,624 applications from farmers.  That is only 50 per cent; and 314 have been refused or have withdrawn their applications.  We would like to get some idea why that is so.  I believe that the pension paid for the married person is only £15 a week.  Are those people entitled to the old age pension on top of that, if they qualify for the old age pension?  If they are not, then £15 per week is a very small amount to give to any married couple who have retired from farming and given over their land to be put to better use.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to increase the amount paid to farmers in the voluntary retirement scheme.  Farmers should be encouraged by advice, if the monetary fee payable to them is also a sufficient encouragement, to hand over their land.  It has been suggested that socio-economic advisers should be trained to advise people on how they would benefit by handing over their land to the Land Commission.  That is necessary because there are parcels of land throughout the country which are being put to very bad use and producing very little.</P>
    <P>About 31,000 acres were acquired in 1976 and about the same amount was distributed among the farming community during the year.  It seems the Land Commission try to hold on to the land banks they have from year to year for distribution.  That is not good business.  The Land Commission would like to have 60,000 acres &mdash; I do not know how much the land bank is.  Land <Col N="1174" /> should be divided amongst the farmers as soon as possible, and three of four years is the maximum time the Land Commission should have any holding, unless there is a difficulty in title.  The Land Commission rent land on the 11 month system and we all decry that system because it is a system whereby farmers, the big combines, go in and take the value out of the land and put back very little into it; the land is all the poorer for it.  Management of land is all important in this country.  The land Commission must mangage their business properly, and I believe they do, but I cannot understand the reason for the delay in dividing this land amongst the farmers.</P>
    <P>I see here that 92 acres were given to four ex-employees on that land.  This is a good thing.  The number of ex-employees who got land seems to be very small. The division of 92 acres by four would give 23 acres per employee, which is an uneconomic holding.  The Land Commission are not in favour of giving anybody uneconomic holdings but, if that is the case, the division of 92 acres between four ex-employees created four uneconomic holdings.  At the same time I believe that something should be done for people who have given service to the landlord or the owner of the land which has been taken over by the Land Commission. They are giving a service to agriculture and they should be entitled to a division of the spoils.</P>
    <P>I also see that 295 acres have been provided as 149 accommodation and amenity plots.  This is very good and it is something of which the Land Commission should be proud.  Amenity plots are very important, not alone to create an atmosphere in towns and villages but also to create a greater interest in visitors to this country when they enjoy these areas.</P>
    <P>I see that 42 acres were used for 8 sports fields and school playgrounds. The more interest the Land Commission have in the distribution of land in that way the better for everybody concerned. There is an example in my own area in Cahir where the Land Commission gave a holding to the people of the town for a golf course.  That is a credit to the Land Commission, a credit to the Minister of <Col N="1175" /> the time.  On behalf of the people of Cahir I would like to thank all those concerned for that amenity.  It is an excellent one and there are hundreds of people playing golf and getting exercise because of it.  It is a good thing for the town of Cahir, and other parts of the country have the same thing.  An area of 1,299 acres was provided for forestry purposes.  I am sure the land for forestry purposes was either close to a forest or land that was not good enough for the growing of crops or grass but was ideal for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Land Commission on their interest in all those fields and on their interest in respect of buildings and construction and the renovation of dwellinghouses. Land is very little good to people unless they have the comfort of living on that land.  I have seen the houses built by the Land Commission. They are ideal for the set up in farming.  I could not find fault with them and I congratulate the Land Commission in that respect.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  I would like to hear why the interest rate is 12½ per cent, why the terms of years is as long as 32 years and why only an extra £20 million is asked for here.  The annuities bring in about £3½ million a year, but the expenses amount to £1½ million so therefore there is very little left, about £2 million, to help in the purchase of land.  I welcome the Bill and I do not think anybody will have any objection to passing it today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one or two points I would like to raise in welcoming this Bill.  The whole question of the value of land is central to our society and our economic and social development.  The Second Stage of this Bill gives me a chance to mention one or two points.  I wonder has it struck people that land may be very under-valued.  While we worry about the price of land going up, we should get things into perspective. There are 40,000 square feet in an acre and if one works it out at £2,000 per acre, as has been mentioned already, that is worth 5p for a square foot.  Think about how much it costs for a piece of carpet to cover a square foot.  When <Col N="1176" /> God made land he only made a certain amount of it.  I wonder if there is something about this underlying growth in the price of land.  I would just make that point to the House.</P>
      <P>Of course, when one looks at the value of land developed for building purposes we are getting up to the figure of £30,000 and now one is getting close to a £1 a square foot so maybe it is all part of the economic development of a country that this natural resource is coming towards reaching its real value. It is possible that tomorrow all land will be valued at £2 a square foot.  A bit of perspective might be brought into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of land being sold for £30,000 an acre, this is a very difficult point, and agricultural land is being bought out by some people in the hope that at some stage it will reach that value and of course this affects the market for land and the value of land.  It really frightens me to see that in an area like the inner city of Dublin where unemployment is so high the value of land has been inhibiting the development of industry because people were trying to get industries going and cannot get the finance and this is obviously a source of great concern to me because I operate in that area.  I welcome, therefore, the fact that the Minister is telling us that he will be putting to his colleagues in the Government before the end of this year a comprehensive set of proposals designed to up-date policy.  I would point out that there are suggestions being made by various people which might make it possible to get land released more quickly from the coils of planning permissions and servicing delays.  I am sure &mdash; and I have discussed this with some people in the construction business &mdash; that developers of housing would be quite happy to provide the money for servicing land in order to increase its availability.  Governments were always short of money for servicing land and as a result of that the amount of land in the market was insufficient and therefore cost more.  It might be possible to persuade the bigger developers in the urban areas to finance an effective servicing of land and that would make more land available.  If more land is available then <Col N="1177" /> it would help to keep down the price of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The question of the use of agricultural land has been raised.  If people are sitting on a natural resource and not using it and not getting it up to the productive level as measured by comparison with other countries' use of land then something will have to be done about it. Some policies have got to be put into action which will move it into a productive mode.  I recognise in this Bill that what the Minister wants to do is to increase the limit and get on with the job, and we are not going to stop him doing that.  We encouraged him to go ahead, but the real encouragement is to see that this new comprehensive set of proposals that he mentions here is implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on the Second Stage of the Land Bond Bill 1978. I am interested in the Minister's speech. He pointed out to us that the purpose of the Bill is to create an extra £20 million worth of land bonds.  He stated that the Government are not committed to continuing the present land policy indefinitely. He referred to the decision by the Government to set up a land development authority.  He spoke out on the structural reforms that are necessary in farm land and he said that he will be putting certain proposals before the Government by the end of the year and that the purpose of the £20 million is to tide over the Land Commission between now and the time when the proposals that the Minister will be putting before the Government will become effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the Minister's speech for another reason, and that is that it is shorter than the speech that was made by him on the Second Stage in the other House and it is not quite as thought-provoking.  For example, there is no reference, as there was in the speech in the other House, to handicaps, to the necessity of having agricultural qualifications on the part of the people who are buying land or to the question of giving priority to developing farms. But nevertheless the speech is interesting because of the points that I mentioned.  I recognise that the application to obtain <Col N="1178" /> an extra £20 million worth of land bonds is an attempt to expand the land pool that is available to the Land Commission. I have been trying to estimate the amount of land that this figure of £20 million is likely to provide.  If my estimation is correct, the maximum is about 10,000 acres.  If one measures that again in relation to the question of what is a viable farm, and we take it that a viable farm today is not less than 100 acres, we are talking about accommodating 100 farmers, creating 100 new viable units.  I know that it is very likely that that is not how the land acquired will be distributed. It is very likely that most of it will be distributed by way of addition to existing farms.  When that 10,000 acres is tied in with the 76,000 acres that I understand is in the Land Commission pool at the moment, we are saying that, were all this to be divided and used for the purpose of creating viable farm units, we are talking in terms of about 700 of these.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the land structure report of the inter-departmental committee is available to the Government and will be available to the public in a week or two.  I regret that it is not available to us today as it would be useful and could assist us in putting our views on this matter.  I know that there has been criticism of the policy and the work of the Land Commission, particularly in regard to their obtaining land and their distribution of it.</P>
    <P>There is also the criticism in regard to the enormous length of time it takes, from the time the land is acquired until it is distributed, and in regard to the people who eventually obtain it.  While I accept that a lot of that criticism is justified, as indeed is the criticism of the activities of the Land Commission as being outdated and not entirely relevant to the conditions prevailing today and likely to prevail in the future, nevertheless, it would be unfair to let this occasion pass without putting it on record that the Land Commission, over the years, have made a valuable contribution to assisting many people who today are obtaining a satisfactory standard of living from their land and who could not do so were it not for the work and assistance of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> I recognise that times are changing and that new structures are required for today and for the conditions that will obtain in the future.  For that reason I am glad to hear the proposal that a development authority is to be created.  I am sure that when that proposal arrives before us we will have an opportunity of discussing in detail how it can most effectively assist land structure reform here.</P>
    <P>A viable farm today is at least 200 adjusted acres.  I know that in the Minister's constituency, in my own constituency and in a number of other constituencies a man could have 100 acres and still be eligible to draw the dole. When we talk in terms of 100 adjusted acres we must realise that the man who is below that level and who is attempting to reach it requires assistance from the Land Commission or from some similar agency to get up to that point because the competition is very intense for any land that becomes available.  Without the assistance of some agency such as the Land Commission it will be impossible for people who are below that desirable level to attain it.</P>
    <P>When we talk of land structure reform it is necessary to look at the sources from which additional land may become available.  I was interested in a few points that Senator Mulcahy raised.  He said that the current value of land was 5p a square foot.  He felt it was under-valued. Perhaps it is, but it all depends on how one measures it.  There is only one satisfactory way in which the value of land can be measured and that is the return per acre that one can obtain from it and that is to be related to the price that one pays for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to what I would describe as the dormant acres.  He referred to land in the hands of people who are not making a genuine attempt to bring it up to a reasonable standard of productivity.  While I do not entirely agree with his suggestion as to what should be done, nevertheless the time is fast approaching when those who are responsible for land reform here will have to look at these dormant acres and see what steps are necessary to ensure that this land is brought into full and <Col N="1180" /> satisfactory productivity.  It can be a very depressing sight in any part of the country, as one drives along, when one sees a farm of limited acreage very effectively worked by the owner and by its side a stretch of land of perhaps even greater acreage almost dormant.</P>
    <P>The question of land bonds has been referred to earlier today.  In relation to this, the experience over the years has shown clearly that land bonds have been, to a very great degree, unacceptable to the sellers of land.  They have been a problem for the Land Commission in obtaining additional land and they do not appeal to land owners who are on the market to sell their properties. I have never understood why the Land Commission were not enabled to pay cash for land rather than land bonds. Had they been enabled to pay cash rather than land bonds, I am satisfied that the difficulties they have encountered in obtaining additional land would not have existed to the same degree.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to suggestions made by the Minister in the other House, to the question of the handicap, the agricultural qualifications, future owners, the priority of developing farms. There could be merit in all of this but I would prefer to see them spelled out in greater detail, certainly in relation to priority for developing farms.  That idea is deserving of very thorough consideration in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is in relation to the leasing of land.  For farmers who are keen to expand and develop their enterprise and to obtain for themselves a better standard of living, the long-term leasing of land is a system that has tremendous potential but for some reason we never succeeded in getting it to work here.  I believe our failure to get it to work has been due largely to the fact that there existed in the minds of the owners of the land a fear that they would lose their rights to recover that land.  That fact has been the main reason why long-term leasing has never succeeded. The 11 months' letting system has a disadvantage for everybody involved and also for the land in question.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler complimented the Land Commission on the manner in <Col N="1181" /> which they had made land adjacent to rural villages and rural parishes available for use as football or hurling pitches and for community activity of one kind or another.  It took a long time for that to materialise but it was a most welcome development.  I hope that it will continue and that in the future when the administration of land allocation and land structure and development is changed, that that is something that provision will be made for, because I am aware of certain communities and parishes who have no facilities.  They could not, without the assistance of the Land Commission, provide these from their own resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides additional money and additional acres.  I welcome it and will assist its passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  The scope of the debate was far greater than I had intended or expected.  As I said at the outset, this is an enabling Bill, to provide £20 million extra for the Land Commission to enable them to carry on their programme of acquisition over the next few years.  Last year the Land Commission paid £6.7 million, approximately, for land purchased under this scheme. The provision made here today should enable the Land Commission to carry on their programme for another 2½ to three years.  There are approximately 60,000 acres at present in the pipeline, at various stages of negotiation, and hopefully this money will enable them to purchase this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years there has been severe criticism of land bonds and this is probably justified in many respects but, nevertheless, it is a very necessary part of the whole land purchase deal the Land Commission have to undertake and last year, under this scheme, they purchased something in the region of 15,000 acres which were paid for in land bonds.  Possibly if they did not have the land bonds available to them they would not have this pool of 15,000 acres which they have at present and which they <Col N="1182" /> bought last year under the land bonds system.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler raised the question of the Land Commission paying the market value of the land.  The Land Commission have to pay the market value of the land because this is fixed by the Land Act of 1950.  If the owner is not satisfied with the price he is getting from the Land Commission he can appeal to the appeal tribunal.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler was also critical of the Land Commission holding on to land for a long time.  There are various reasons for this and some of them have been mentioned by Senator Howard in his contribution.  Very often the Land Commission hold on to land in the hope that other land might become available in the area and, by getting that additional land, they would be able to prepare a better scheme.  This is very desirable because, particularly in the west, farms are very fragmented and if the Land Commission get a good pool of land in one area it helps them to eliminate that fragmentation and give farmers the greater portion of their land in one piece.  This is desirable because it makes it easier to work, less expensive for fencing and travelling to and from and so on.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that the land bonds are not as good as Government stock.  In fixing the interest rate of bonds the Minister for Finance must have regard to the prices at which the latest issue of national loan and previous issue of land bonds are quoted on the stock exchange so that the new issue will be at or near par and the interest rate of a new issue of land bonds is invariably pitched at a point or two above the current rate of national loan.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised the question of the value of land and made certain comparisons.  We all realise that the price of land has increased in recent years and there are various reasons for this.  One of the reasons is that credit is more readily available to farmers now to buy land and we have a position where there are lending institutions, such as the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation and all the other people who are prepared to lend money, competing with one another.  They realise that farmers are good clients and are <Col N="1183" /> prepared to lend them this money but, in the long term, what really fixes the price of land are the prices obtaining for the farmer in the market place.  If the farmer is able to get a good price for what he produces then he is prepared to go out and invest, whether it be in the purchase of land or in reclaiming land that he already has.  It is very important before any farmer goes out into the market to buy land that he should first look at the land that he has and ensure that it is up to its full productive capacity.  It is essential that every acre should be utilised and the best value got out of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill has taken on a new dimension here today and I am sure that Senators will get a full opportunity of discussing the problems that they have raised later on in the year when we hope that legislation will be brought in to set up a new land authority.  The fact that the Minister has given an undertaking that this legislation will be brought in is an indication of the Government's concern over the present position and, hopefully, this legislation will be before both Houses before the end of the year and Senators will have an opportunity at that stage of debating the many issues that have been raised here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say something pleasant.  I want to thank the Minister for the very helpful statement at the opening of the debate which has made the task of understanding what we were to debate very <Col N="1184" /> much easier.  It goes beyond the explanatory memorandum and taken in conjunction with it makes it easier and, I hope, the debate shorter.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the unpleasant part. First of all I want publicly to protest at the delay in the publication of the Bill.  It took 10 weeks to publish it.  There is nothing too extraordinary about the measure.  I suggest that in future years if we have a section or so giving trouble to the Revenue Commissioners in sorting out what way they want to put it, let the Bill be published in so far as it is settled and let the troublesome matter be dealt with by subsequent amendment.  This would enable people to get down to a study of the Bill much earlier and, presumably, let the Dáil process of debating it get going.  There is nothing sacrosanct in the format of the parts which would necessarily administratively prevent that being done; these could always be changed around at the end.</P>
      <P>My second protest relates partly to the first.  I cannot remember when we in this House last debated a Finance measure when it mattered what we said, because of the time it reaches this House as distinct from anything else.  This can be an excuse for indolence.  We are always ready to take such an excuse when we get it and it may be an explanation for inadequacy.  The Constitution provides that we have a role.  Whichever administration it has been, it has been preventing us effectively from performing that role.  If any one in this House were to disclose that persons of a certain category were to be flogged publicly every Tuesday from now until the first day of October under some misinterpretation of a section of this Bill, there is nothing that will get the Minister to bring this measure back to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I most sincerely press this on the Minister and on his advisers.  It is unfair to the House and bad for the House to be in a position of having a debate which means that if you &mdash; I do not have anything startling to say &mdash; had any point to make that would be of any significance it could only be taken care of in a subsequent Bill, which is bad.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I will not be out of order in thanking you for your kindness.  With regard to section 1, there is one point for clarification. The allowance of £95 contained in section 142 of the 1967 Income Tax Act still remains the same.  It is not one of the allowances which has been increased, or has that been taken care of in the Table? It does not seem to have been taken care of in the Table of increased allowances in section 6.  It is one of the allowances, but is it the dependent relative allowance which is not being increased?  It is only the threshold at which it operates that is being changed.  That is unfortunate. Would the Minister think of taking a recommendation to include that in the Table in section 6?  The Dáil is not breaking up until 10.30 p.m. and I am sure we can get this through in time to make the suitable adjustment in the dependent relative allowance.  The Minister might think about that.</P>
      <P>The format of the section is changed in that it is the section which is being amended.  Now we are having the text for &ldquo;the contributory old age pension&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;the old age contributory pension&rdquo;.  In doing it in this way it seems that we are putting ourselves in the position that every time a Government increase the old age pension they will have to make an amendment of that section which would not be otherwise requisite if we retain it in its present form, amending only the reference to non-contributory as distinct from contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>First of all, with regard to the length of time taken to publish the Finance Bill, I am very conscious of the importance not only to Members of both Houses but to people outside the House that they have an adequate opportunity to study the contents of any Finance Bill.  I regret that it takes as long as it does to produce the Finance Bill.  That period varies, of <Col N="1186" /> course, from year to year.  This year the interval between budget day and the date of circulation of the Finance Bill was 70 days.

The Senator will be aware that the only reason the Bill is before this House now is because a guillotine had to be applied to it in the other House after quite a lengthy debate.  I accept that it is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of this House that the House finds itself regularly in the position that in practice it cannot make recommendations in relation to the Finance Bill, but the fact that Senator FitzGerald, who is a long-time Member of this House, says that he cannot remember an occasion when there was a Finance Bill when this was not the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I can contribute to that I will do so, but I cannot give any firm guarantee to the House in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Senator was correct in what he said in regard to the figure provided in section 142.  There is no change in that. The change is only in the threshold.  The question of providing a formula in the section which would make an automatic adjustment is one that I am considering, but it is a little more complex than it might appear on the face of it.</P>

      <P>This relief was introduced in the Income Tax Act, 1920, which means that it was a consolidating Act when it was initiated.  But we are having life insurance companies singled out for special treatment in relation to the accumulation of savings, and that has considerable social consequences.  I wonder whether the historical circumstances under which the relief was given might not be looked at for the Minister to see if changes had taken place which would justify its continuance at all, or its <Col N="1188" /> limitation to insurance companies.  For example, there is one type of case which is not catered for in any way, where you have a person who is turned down by an insurance company and he has to accumulate without any tax relief some provision for those who are to follow him, and there is no institution he can covenant with to maintain an annual flow of savings, that might be equivalent to an annual flow of premiums, which would mean he would get relief on what he was paying to the institution.  I am talking about a case where a man could not get life cover because of his health situation.</P>

      <P>I take the point made by the Senator.  On the general principle that expenditures or the foregoing of income by the Exchequer ought to be examined periodically to see whether the original reasons for such provisions still prevail, I would certainly say that the Senator was justified in raising the point, and we will have a look at it. Nevertheless, without having examined it my initial reaction is that for various reasons I would still think that the nature of life insurance, from the social point of view as well as from an economic point of view, is such that the relief is still justified.  That is an initial reaction without examining it.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by the Senator in regard to a person who cannot, say for health reasons, get life assurance, such a person is at a disadvantage.  I am not sure we can find a solution to that but I will certainly have it examined.  It is a valid point.</P>

      <P>I have a little bit of information here in regard to this which might be of some interest to the House.  I have said in regard to this section that I felt many married women were not aware of their rights under the existing law to have separate assessment from their husbands, that is, married women who have incomes of their own.  This section is providing that where separate assessment is sought, then the ordinary basic personal allowances are divided equally between the husband and the wife.  It has been proved for quite a long time that where there is separate assessment the husband and the wife are treated quite separately for income tax purposes so that the husband is not liable for the wife's tax or <i>vice versa,</i> and if there is a refund due it is paid to whichever of the spouses has overpaid the tax.  If it is not a separate assessment it is paid to the husband.</P>
      <P>The information I have got relates to the form that was sent out.  The House will recall that I indicated that because I felt there were quite a number of married women in this position who were not aware of their rights, I had arranged with the Revenue Commissioners to send out a circular explaining their rights and enclosing a fairly simple form to enable them to apply for separate assessment if they wanted to.  The information I have is that following the issue of the forms to married women with incomes, there have been in the Dublin area 4,000 applications for separate assessment and that they are still coming in at the rate of 150 per day.  If we assume a similar response throughout the country it is clear that a substantial number of married women are anxious to take advantage of this section.</P>

      <P>Apropos a remark made by Senator Donnelly last evening as to the niggardly and mean approach of the Minister's predecessor to all matters of tax, I think the Minister would be the first to point out that his predecessor in fact raised this figure from £1,500 which it had stood at for a considerable period to £2,000.  He had made some move.  I gather that the Minister has gone further in the same direction.  I think the point should be made in the context of Senator Donnelly's remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that what Senator FitzGerald has said is correct. The limits were increased in the Finance Act of 1977 but the general approach I have to this is that by having only percentage limitations one is applying the same approach as applies in the case of employees.  There are, of course, employees with very high salaries so that one is treating them apparently on the same basis.  In practice the self-employed may be worse off because they frequently can find themselves in a position in certain years when they would not be able to pay the full premium and in other years, in order to make up, they might be able to pay more.  To that extent they are somewhat worse off than employees. At least by applying the same percentage limitations we are keeping a little more equality between the employed and the self-employed.</P>

There are self-employed and self-employed, and there are situations where <Col N="1191" /> this kind of provision is just only right and other situations where there is in fact the lying-behind of the self-employed as a result of his endeavours and activities to create a growing and valuable business which is there for his own pension in any case.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have made a rather fatuous statement yesterday &mdash; indeed I made a lot of fatuous statements yesterday, but the only one that I have since clearly thought about is my remark that these allowances are necessarily regressive.  I would be interested to know what is the background to them, when do they come in, what is their object?  Is one of the advantages that it pulls a lot of people out of the net of taxation altogether because with the increased allowance they get to a zero tax position?  I take it that that is the general effect.  With such a state of fuss I did not have a chance to check what the Minister had said about the cost of this operation for the year.  I had made the point that I was more interested in the shifting of the bands &mdash; I thought that to be more important than anything in terms of economic effectiveness if one has to and thinks one can afford to give this kind of allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the cost, it is estimated this year to be £63.4 million and £97.6 million in a full year.  Having regard to that very heavy cost it will be clear why I have been unable to accede to requests for additional reliefs or allowances under different heads, in this year at any rate.  It is a very substantial sum and they are of course very substantial increases, as I indicated last night, far bigger than any that have ever been given before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of giving such substantial reliefs is in the first instance because <Col N="1192" /> income tax was becoming such a heavy burden on many people and over the years has not been adjusted in line with inflation, so that automatically there has been an increase in the incidence of income tax where there had not been such an adjustment.  In addition it had a major economic purpose in so far as the amount of the allowances, taken in conjunction with projected increases in incomes under the national pay agreement, would result in a fairly substantial increase in real incomes for workers generally.</P>
    <P>The purpose is to raise the standard of living, and economically thereby to ensure greater activity through a greater purchasing power and ability to save.  In addition, the figures envisaged here ensure that every single payer of income tax will get substantial relief, and as part of the overall economic programme it was designed to ensure that people would get increases in real terms in their incomes without adding unduly to the cost of Irish produced goods.  Putting it in simple terms, this means that the Exchequer is taking part of the burden that would otherwise fall on employers in the sense that they would have had to pay higher wage increases.  The Exchequer is taking on that burden, which means the taxpayer is taking it on, and ultimately it has to be discharged.</P>
    <P>In the economic circumstances in which we found ourselves this section represents a basic part of the our economic strategy for tackling the economic situation.  It would be inappropriate to elaborate unduly on the overall economic strategy involved, but there is a basic part of it involved in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not like to go back to a Second Reading debate again, would we?  On what the Minister has just said, these allowances are to be available to everybody, whether they are employees or not and enabling characters who do not have to get up in the morning at all to be in receipt of these reliefs.  I do not see that as making the economy more competitive. Serious questions arise if the limited resources available to the State are to be availed of for some sort of subsidy <Col N="1193" /> to be given to employers.  If the reality is that workers are demanding increases beyond what the economy can afford that is that, but that it should impact first on the employer, I should like to express myself as not believing it to be a wise use of our resources to have that burden put on the Treasury.  That is my view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I just use this section which, of course, is entirely welcome, to ask the Minister to have one aspect of the whole income tax code examined in the light of one observation I made on Second Stage with regard to the relief of suffering and the encouragement of valuable expenditure to see what can be done.  As I said, the dumb and the deaf are excluded from the benefits available to the blind.  I cannot see why. Some may think one situation is worse than the other.  Generally with regard to these covenants, an old UK code encouraged charitable activities when only people with a lot of money could provide sums for charity.</P>
      <P>We are now in a new economic situation where people may be generating large incomes.  They should be encouraged to devote to charity in an unselfish way as much of those large incomes as they possibly can.  The reasons why these covenants were cut down years ago may no longer apply.  It would be a worth-while exercise in the State's interest to have the code looked at to see could we construct a system whereby this would not be used for avoidance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Senator is aware particularly from what he has just said, the reason why it was necessary to cut down very substantially on the use of covenants was precisely that they were being used for avoidance on a very large scale and a great deal of <Col N="1194" /> revenue was being lost for purposes which would not receive general approval. There are still objects for which covenants may be entered into and tax relief obtained.  They are limited in number and scope.  The difficulty about any extension of them is that any one case which may be made, and may be worth while, would always be met with quite a number of other worth-while purposes, and it is very difficult then to draw the line anywhere, unless one adopts a very strict attitude to them.</P>
      <P>The past experience of the manner in which this provision was abused would make any Minister for Finance wary of extending it further.  I am not saying that in no circumstances would any extension be contemplated.  All I am saying is that there are difficulties involved in an extension and the past history of this provision would ensure that any proposals for extension have to be viewed very strictly, and with one eye all the time on the possibility of further requests, and further extension of exemption, with consequential substantial loss to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect, I caused a question to be asked in Dáil Éireann some while ago as to what was the total loss of revenue involved when there were unrestricted charitable covenants available.  My recollection is that £82,000 a year was the sum mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was so low that I was astonished at the assiduity of the Minister for Finance in relation to sums of this kind at the time.  I must say that I wish the same assiduity had been maintained after that time.  Even assuming it was costly, I suggest very strongly to the Minister that an old principle which was always sound, is coming back into vogue, the principle of subsidiarity: anything that can be done by a lesser body should be done by that lesser body and not by a larger body.  There may be voluntary bodies who are prepared to provide services, and are working in the provision of services, who can relieve a <Col N="1195" /> situation.  As the Minister indicated, it may not be possible to afford even desirable reforms.  It may be much cheaper to have these services provided by voluntary bodies out of charitable tax relief subscriptions than out of tax collected from a reluctant and annoyed taxpayer.</P>
      <P>This is well worth serious reconsideration by the Minister, particularly in the context of the general approach outlined to us with regard to socially desirable expenditures. Otherwise we will have an ugly society, a society in which people appear to be selfish and simply in pursuit of gain, in which the Government do not bother to provide a stimulus to make society do good with the money they are making.  I would very strongly urge this on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, an aspect of this which should not be overlooked, that is, that there is nothing to prevent people with sufficient wealth or income at the moment donating money to various good causes.  What is being sought here is to enable them to do so and get tax relief at the same time, which means that what is being sought is that the Exchequer should also contribute to these good causes.  The effect is that the direction and amount of assistance is determined not by the State but by the individual concerned.  Obviously the assistance from the Exchequer arises only when the individual concerned decides to make the contribution to a particular good cause, if I might call it such.</P>
      <P>Questions arise here.  If one allowed this to grow to a very large scale one would find, in effect, substantial assistance being given by the Exchequer to various causes of this kind, determined not by the Government or the Oireachtas, but by the individual taxpayer who was getting the benefit of the tax relief.  This is a factor which has to be borne in mind too in considering the general question of covenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is a free society and it seems desirable that people should enjoy their freedom to the extent that they can.  The State will be playing a role in providing an incentive <Col N="1196" /> to them to do these things which, being done in this way and cutting out the cost of collecting and the cost of redistributing what is collected, will be done more cheaply.  The costs of administration of these voluntary bodies are very low in general and this is something I would have thought the Minister could try to introduce on the basis on which we have had reliefs for depreciation, stock relief, and reliefs in this Bill with regard to constructional contracts.  The thing could be done within a period of operation and let us see what it is costing and let us see what is generated.  For example the Government give money to the political parties on this side of the House to organise themselves to put the Government out of office in due course.  This is sensible and one of the best things the Government do, perhaps inadequately, but it might be better for the country if, instead of having to collect the tax from the taxpayer which is then administered through some Department and given to the parties, people were allowed to deduct their covenanted subscriptions to political parties.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points on this.  It all relates to the sections of the Finance Act, 1974, which introduced the curbs and restrictions on interest.  The effect of these sections was to amend section 496 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I think a mistake was made which needs to be repaired in so far as the restriction on the refund of <Col N="1197" /> interest under section 496 to the figure of £2,000 did not apply to interest on money borrowed to pay death duties. There still may be some death duties to be paid here and there, but there are other duties which arise on death which will give rise to the borrowing of money where, for example, a probate cannot be extracted because the evidence is not before the registrar.  The capital acquisitions tax has to be paid and the personal representative will have to find the money from a bank.  It may be a very large sum.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Legislature in its original enactment of this section &mdash; this was in the 1974 Act &mdash; intended that that type of situation should not be caught by the restriction. It arises from the mere business of organising money to be given to the Revenue and therefore I think subsection (4) of section 496 should be amended to include &mdash; whatever about gift tax &mdash; inheritance tax or any tax exigible in the event of a death.  That is just one short point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not bothered about section 8 generally.  It has been improved by ministerial amendment proposed in Dáil Éireann but, for the life of me, I cannot see why this is limited to people who are substantially involved in the company. Surely this is the kind of thing where we should be encouraging employees to borrow money for the purposes of financing the enterprise which employs them.  Why should it be restricted to people having a significant interest?  Is this not the type of section we need to encourage profit sharing schemes and worker participation?  I should like to profess my profound conviction that this society will not solve its problems unless the two sides to industry are brought together in this kind of way by an involvement in the profit over the competitive cost.  If the employee is to be asked to keep it competitive, schemes will have to be worked out under which he will be given a share in the surplus which results from his competitiveness, his hard work and his productivity.  This is one of the things which do not appear in the Green Paper.  At least I did not find it in my rapid perusal of the document. <Col N="1198" /> Something like that has to be worked out.  Why should this section be limited in the way it is as I read it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly have the first point raised by Senator FitzGerald examined in regard to subsection (4) relating in particular to inheritance tax.  I am not quite sure if Senator FitzGerald and I are on the one wavelength in regard to the second point he made. Perhaps I misunderstood him.  Up to now there was a restriction as regards having a material interest in the company which was defined as holding 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital and working for the greater part of the time in the actual management or conduct of the business of the company. That is removed certainly in some cases. We have relaxed it to provide unrestricted relief to employees and directors, whether they are full-time or parttime in private trading companies, for interest on borrowing to acquire shares in the company.  We have provided additional relief of up to £2,000 interest to full-time employees and full-time directors of public companies who borrow to acquire shares in their companies.  We have also covered the problem arising in regard to holding companies.  I do not think I need to go into it as I am sure Senator FitzGerald is fully familiar with the problem which arises there.  Maybe I missed the point Senator FitzGerald was making.</P>

Under the new system, these emoluments are now within the scope of British PAYE and, but for the proposed remission here, the employees concerned would have to pay one-and-a-half years' tax in one year.  It will be recalled that remission of a half year's tax was given in 1960-61 when PAYE was introduced here and a similar remission was given in 1976 when public servants and certain other employees were brought within the scope of PAYE.  These people who are being brought within the scope of British PAYE would have to pay one-and-a-half years' tax in one year, so we are giving a remission of a half year's tax.</P>

      <P>I should like to know a little about the background to this.  Do I understand that they will remain taxable on profits which are derived where they are in competition with other traders or other people and only their agricultural operations are exempt so far as they create profit?  I thought that was clearly what the Minister was doing.  It was not clear to me on a rather speedy reading of the section how the appointment of the profit is made if the society ends up with a profit of £1 million or whatever.  What is the basis?  Is it the proportion of the turnover in the different transactions which determines the apportionment of the profit which is analogous to the procedure under the export tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is done in proportion to turnover on exempted and non-exempted items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this concept been examined?  It is quite clearly a fair and efficient method of operating a distribution of profit of a company engaged in manufacturing and selling goods on the home market and manufacturing and selling on the export market.  It is the easy way of doing it and there are no particular difficulties about it, but you can have activities of an entirely different kind where the turnover may not be a fair test in determining what the profit is.  What type of activities in general are these societies engaging in?  Is it possible that the agricultural turnover relative to the trading turnover might mean they were paying more tax <Col N="1201" /> than the profit generated by the other activities because of the lower proportion the non-agricultural trading bore to the agricultural trading?  I just wondered to what degree this has been examined in relation to the societies who will get the benefit of these exemptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively, subject to certain modifications in the list of exemptions, it is reverting to the position as it was prior to 1976, I think, and the method of apportioning turnover of exempted and non-exempted items is the same as it has been in the past.  I accept that it is somewhat crude.  It does not give an entirely accurate measure, but the method used is the one used in the past, that is to assume a uniform rate of net profit on exempted and non-exempted transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good idea which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1977, but Revenue did their usual thing on new and good ideas. They did the same to the export tax relief when they first got at it in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956. They put such restrictions on it as to make it a non-runner.  Gradually these restrictions got torn off the relief so as to make it effective and to incite the economy to do the things it was intended to incite the economy to do.  I think this is another section which the Minister amended in the Dáil.  Am I wrong in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They were only minor amendments.  I am not quite sure what the Senator has in mind.  The House is aware, as Senator FitzGerald has indicated, that this special rate of corporation tax, 25 per cent, was introduced last year to be available for certain manufacturing companies if they met two tests: one, that they increased their employment by at least 3 per cent; two, that they increased their sales by at least 5 per cent.  What we are doing here is removing the sales test altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that gone?  I thought is was gone until I saw it appearing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concern.  It has to be retained for companies who would be claiming it for 1977.  There has to be a formula for dealing with that.  As from this year, the only test will be the employment test. There are two basic reasons for that. One is that the thing we are really concerned with is the increase in employment. It is better to concentrate the whole effort in that area.  The other reason is subsidiary to that and was mentioned by Senator FitzGerald's party spokesman in the Dáil when he said, quite rightly, that if you have an increase in employment, it would be very unusual to have it without an increase in sales.  In other words, it is only when you generate increased sales that you look for increased staff.  So the sales test to some extent is irrelevant.  I think it only makes the operation of this provision more complicated.  For that reason I am taking out the sales test altogether, except for the purpose of applying it to those who would be operating under the previous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely right.  Am I correct in thinking the Minister is still retaining the restriction that the income is not less than 95 per cent of the total amount of this income from the manufacturing activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is being retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a high figure.  I suggest that the Minister might well consider an extension of this <Col N="1203" /> beyond manufacturing companies to services. The fatality of being unemployed is so beastly that to be under-employed must be better, even if people are under-employed in running around an hotel interrupting you at every third bite of your dinner.  It seems we must get a bit more away from the idea that manufacturing is all.  The generation of other economic activity may be something we have been tending to neglect.  This is probably why it is manufacturing companies because the whole export tax code was based on the fact that one was a company, if I remember correctly.  I do not think that the export tax relief is available to any one of us if we want to export ourselves. We would have to incorporate to get the benefit of the relief.  An extension to individuals and partnerships and a further range would be desirable if they take extra people into employment, pay their stamps and do all the things required to prove that it is all for real and true, that they are not their blood brother's children or something.  One might have to put some restriction of that kind on it. A certain amount of looseness about that even might be no harm in our situation.</P>
      <P>I make the point, for example, about the profession that the Minister practises when he is not Minister, in common with myself.  If we took on in our several offices extra people, that would be taking people into employment every bit as much as if they were filling peas into a can and they might be learning something as well.  It would take people out of the unemployed status.  It would have to be costed and maybe a different type of relief would have to be given to prevent this being too costly.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I would like to ask a question to which, indeed, I should know the answer myself but I do not.  The export tax relief which a company gets it can pass on, I know, by distributions to the investors; they get the benefit of the relief in their dividend: the tax deducted or the tax credited arrangements.  Does this particular relief pass on as well?  It seemed to me that it did not but perhaps I was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the last point <Col N="1204" /> raised by the Senator, there is a tax credit based on the 30 per cent rate, although the actual rate of tax is only 25 per cent.  So to that extent there is a passing on of benefit, if you like, to the shareholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under the proposed change to 30 per cent.  The figure of 30 per cent is what is proposed when one comes to the distributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, therefore, the 35 per cent has been the credit.  In other words, it is not passed on in the same way as an export tax.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is in exactly the same position as depreciation allowance or one of these things that might effectively reduce the amount of tax that a company would pay to nil or to 10 per cent.  Therefore, the company get the benefit of it but not the owners of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Senator in regard to the possibilities of greater employment in service industries and in distribution.  Neveretheless, the cost would be very substantial.  It is estimated that the full-year cost of this provision is about £10 million.  If one were to extend this to distribution and services obviously it would be very much more substantial.  It is also true, at least it is generally accepted, that each new job in manufacturing creates at least one job, probably more than one, in other areas of the economy.  So, if you have to limit the benefit, it is obviously best to limit it to manufacturing.  You get a better return in terms of jobs than if you confine it to any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would increase the linkage.  It would tend to increase <Col N="1205" /> the number of service jobs that manufacturing jobs generate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think that is true. In principle I think the Senator is quite right in what he says but I have to have regard to the practicalities of cost and if I do I think we get the best return in terms of jobs in confining it to manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>If there were not a fairly easy way out of the difficulty I would be more sympathetic to the problem adverted to by the Senator when he talked about the 95 per cent requirement.  I know there are cases where more than 5 per cent of the income may be derived, say, from the investment income or something other than manufacturing.  This presents problems, but there is a relatively easy way out of this difficulty, that is, the creation of a subsidiary company through which the non-manufacturing income can be channelled in order to qualify under the section.  It is a bit unfortunate, perhaps, that people have to go to that trouble, but I think for the considerably reduced rate of tax it would be worth their while and it is not an insuperable difficulty for people who find they are losing the benefit of the reduced rate of tax because of something in excess of 5 per cent of income derived from a source other than manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing the Minister said is absolutely fascinating &mdash; that the estimated cost of this section is £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is to say what precisely in terms of employment?  Assuming we are talking in general of cutting the 45 per cent rate to 20 per cent which is equal to £10 million, we are talking about an overall profit generation of £50 million which has created employment in excess of 3 per cent.  It would be very interesting to see what is the cost to the State per job of providing this relief.  If it is that costly, maybe we should be doing something other than this.  On the other hand, <Col N="1206" /> maybe we are getting jobs created at a very much cheaper rate than they are being found to cost through direct grants to industries for adaptation or extension or for new industries.  It seems to me if you have an estimate of a relief of £10 million on a full year you must have before you some notion of the amount of extra employment that that relief is procuring.  It seems to be a way of testing the value of the relief and then, testing it in that way, it seems worth seeing how this compares with the kind of grant you have to give to get industry established or extended.  The question is of great interest to me and I feel would be of great interest to the House and people who are concerned with public affairs generally.  If the Minister would like to give me the information at a later stage in the debate, I would be grateful if he could do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that I can understand the Senator's interest in this but I am afraid I have to disappoint him, because the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to calculate how many firms, earning how much profit, will increase their employment by 3 per cent at least.  They can do no more than make a guess.  The figure I gave of £10 million is based on the reduction in tax from the companies concerned based on a guess on what the increased employment would be.  Until we see now this works, and it will take some time, we will not be able to judge this accurately, but I would agree fully with the Senator that if it operates effectively it certainly could provide a very useful line of approach and might well justify even a fairly fundamental change, which, I think, is the point the Senator was making, in regard to the provision of employment.  We are certainly not in a position to assess that yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is a relief to everybody to be exempt from tax and delightful news it is for people who are in these ranges of profit.  The Minister in these proposals is moving along the direction taken by his predecessor last year.  This is one which applies to all small companies, if I understand the situation, whether they are engaging in backing horses &mdash; you could, perhaps, back a horse with a company but I do not think you could take a bet &mdash; or investment or doing anything you like.  The investment companies are caught on distributed surcharge provisions, but this has been in existence a long time because it is incorporated in the Corporation Tax Act of 1976 at £5,000 and it was an earlier figure many years ago.  We must have some idea of the range of companies that get this benefit.  What does it cost us to give it to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of raising the threshold for small companies to £25,000 with a marginal relief up to <Col N="1208" /> £35,000 is estimated at £400,000 in 1978 and £1.2 million in 1979.  I should point out that the relief embodied in this section will not be available to manufacturing companies getting the benefit of the 25 per cent special rate of corporation tax.  They cannot avail of both.  I believe that small companies in the main are Irish-owned and controlled companies. I believe also that in general they have a very considerable potential for expansion, particularly in relation to employment.  Of course, I am generalising when I say this.  I would think that the kind of expansion we would hope to see from Irish companies would, in general, come from small companies who are dynamic and can be encouraged to grow.  For that reason I believe that the relief proposed in this section is worth while and it should operate as an incentive to business generally, and particularly to small business, to expand their activities, which is part of our overall economic strategy.</P>

    <P>If we are to encourage any serious expansion of the shipping industry, particularly in the difficult time occurring at present in view of the very special effects of inflation on the shipping industry and the very nature of the industry itself, it may well be necessary at some stage to consider very specific taxation provisions in relation to shipping.

Free depreciation is now available and continues to be available. If it should transpire that special additional relief would be justified in the case of shipping, then obviously I would be prepared to consider that.  At the moment it seems that the free depreciation available is sufficient to meet the requirements.

I am not quite sure off hand how substantial the extension suggested by Senator FitzGerald would be.  I would think probably not enormously substantial, but it could not stop there.  Clearly, in effect it would have to apply to all of distribution and, indeed, it might not even stop there.  The cost could be very substantial and that is the primary constraint &mdash; maybe not the only one.  There are other points that might have to be considered but I think that would have to be the primary one to consider in relation to any extension of this.

      <P>One of the lessons a Minister for Finance learns is that whenever he gives some kind of relief he is creating a problem for himself.  This particular relief was not, as the Senator knows, given by me originally.  It was given by my predecessor.  It would now appear that it is said to be operating as a hindrance to firms in obtaining credit. That could be said to be true.  I can see the point of the argument, but it seems very strange that to give relief in this way can operate to prevent companies getting credit.  Putting it in blunt, broad terms, it seems strange.  I am afraid that, certainly for this year, I do not contemplate any further change than is provided for in the section.  The whole question of the continuation of stock relief obviously has to be related to the question of inflation, and not just domestic inflation but the fluctuations in costs of raw materials, particularly imported raw materials.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, in the not too distant future, we will reach a stage where this kind of relief could be dispensed with.  If we do, any outstanding matters of that kind will, of course, have to be dealth with.  Obviously I am not in a position to say, at this stage, when the necessity for such relief will come to an end but the sooner the better and if it happens quickly, I would hope that at that time we could have definitive provisions to deal with outstanding claims of this kind.</P>

      <P>This is a departure from solid practice not merely over the period of the operation of the corporation tax but a departure from the recommended structure of the corporation tax as contained in a document <Col N="1212" /> which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in November 1972 entitled &ldquo;Company Taxation in Ireland&rdquo;.  In paragraph 532 <i>(b)</i> the shareholders will be given a tax credit to put them in the same position in relation to company distributions as under the present system.  Accordingly net dividends paid by companies would be grossed up.  The grossed up dividend would present a shareholder's income for income tax purposes and domestic shareholders would be given credit for the tax so added back.  On the basis of the standard rate, then operable, of 35 per cent, the credit to be given would be seven-thirteents of the net dividend which is the position which was incorporated in the code.  The effect of this is to make the investment, particularly by exempted funds in Irish companies, less attractive. The case has been made to the Minister that the effect is to reduce the gross income of these exempt pension funds that are there to look after the provision for the future of all the employees benefiting from the funds and of charities.  In so far as they are invested in Irish companies, they will be reduced by 7 per cent and the argument that the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 50 per cent to 45 per cent, effected last year, increases the dividend-paying capacity of the companies is not borne out by an examination of the published accounts of the main industrial companies where the reduction from 50 to 45 per cent does not affect them because the effective rate of tax ranged from 8 to 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>The dividend-paying capacity of the company, which is effectively only paying 10 per cent, is not increased by the reduction of the actual rate of corporation tax from 50 to 45 per cent and therefore does not seem to justify a variation of the revised distribution taxation proposal contained in this section.</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of misconception about this section, some of which I hope I have dispelled in response to the various representations I have received.  Although one can get into fairly esoteric arguments in relation to this section and, indeed, into some very complex mathematical computations, the principle involved is fairly straightforward. <Col N="1213" /> It must be conceded that where there is a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 50 to 45 per cent there is a reduction in the amount of tax which the company is required to pay, even if the effective rate of tax is 10 per cent in some cases.  There is still a reduced amount of tax payable by the company because the corporation tax is reduced from 50 to 45 per cent.  What we have sought to do here in so far as it is mathematically possible, is to maintain the same proportion of tax credit in relation to the reduced corporation tax.  In so far as a company is liable to pay less tax under the reduction in the rate of the corporation tax, it has more money to invest or to distribute or both if it decides to divide up the additional money available.  If it maintains the same proportion in distribution as it has had in the past the shareholder will not lose.  He may marginally gain.  But if the company decides not to maintain that proportion but to retain for investment purposes all of the additional money available to it because of the law, the first thing to observe is that that is a decision made by the company in which the shareholder can have some say but, whoever has a say in it, it is a decision within the company and it is not a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the point I am making is that it is not a matter for the Revenue.  It is not the Revenue who decide how much of the additional money available is to be reinvested or distributed by way of dividends.  This is a matter for the company and its internal workings.  As far as the Revenue are concerned, the right thing to do is to maintain the same proportion as applied when the rate was 50 per cent.  If a company decides, through its own internal machinery, to invest all the additional money available to it by reason of a reduction in the corporation tax rate, it may be that the shareholder will get a <Col N="1214" /> proportionately smaller dividend than he got before but normally, because of the additional money being invested, the capital value of the share is going up so that, either way, he is not losing.  In any event, whatever decision is taken, it is not one that should or can be taken by the Revenue but only by the company itself.  How the situation eventuates for the shareholder depends on that decision within the company.  It does not depend on the Revenue.</P>

      <P>What is in this Bill depends on the Revenue and depends on the Minister.  We already have an initial rate of tax of 20 per cent, a reduced rate of tax of 25 per cent, something called the standard rate of tax of 35 per cent and the higher rates.  Here we are having another rate, a 30 per cent rate.  Why should we depart from the general concept of the standard rate of 35 per cent?  Is it not an attempt to deprive the investor of sharing in the tax benefit which is given to the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the rate of 50 per cent the tax credit was 35/65ths.  The change we are making is as close mathematically as we can get it to maintaining that same ratio, having regard to the corporation tax rate now being 45 per cent instead of 50 per cent.  Therefore, as far as the Revenue are concerned, subject to a very minor mathematical change that is unavoidable, in substance we are maintaining the same proportionate tax credit.  Any change in the position that arises will arise because of internal decisions in companies in relation to the additional money becoming available to them because of the reduced corporation tax rate but as far as the Revenue are concerned we are maintaining the same proportion of tax credit as existed before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily because there was a doubt raised as to whether its inclusion would change the character of the Bill as a money Bill, but that doubt has been resolved and when it was resolved the section was introduced.  The section applies customs law to EEC levies and charges on agricultural produce, whether payable at importation or exportation, and it places such levies and charges under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners. This provision is necessary to give effect to the transfer from the Department of Agriculture to the Revenue Commissioners of responsibility for the collection of EEC levies payable on agricultural produce at export.  Up to now, the commissioners have been responsible for the collection of these levies payable on importation and the Department of Agriculture was responsible for levies on exports of agricultural produce.  The decision was made to place both under the care of the Revenue Commissioners and this section does this.</P>

Would the collection of any such charges as may remain as well as the levies be included in the transfer?  I do not know whether the definition of &ldquo;export levy&rdquo; or &ldquo;import levy&rdquo; should take in any other charges arising on import or export.</P>

This increased rate was in substitution for the original rate of 10 per cent which covered not alone the amount of the original contract but any variation thereof, up or down.  Through an oversight, the Finance Act, 1973 applied the 15 per cent rate to subsection (2) only of section 50 of the Finance Act, 1969.

      <P>The first thing I would say about it is that clearly, when one looks at it, it was an oversight at the time.  There is no logical reason why we should increase the rate on the original contract and not on the variations when in fact the rate applied to both.  The difficulty that arises is that this does not just cover the question of an increased charge.  There are a number of cases where there can be a refund.  I gave considerable thought to this and I have discussed it at some length with the Revenue Commissioners because, like the Senator, I was unwilling to contemplate a retrospective imposition of a higher rate of tax, which is what it looks like doing, and I must admit that.  Having regard to all the circumstances involved, what is being done here by correcting the original oversight is the course of least detriment to the taxpayer, not just to the Revenue Commissioners. Whatever one does in dealing with this, and obviously there are different possibilities as to how it might be approached, if one wants to correct the position, it is going to present some problems.  The course provided for in subsection (2) is the one that presents the least problems.</P>

      <P>Cases can vary.  There may be situations where there have been men actually intelligent enough to observe that there was a mistake being made by the legislators and that they had not effectively covered the alterations and have organised their affairs on the basis that they will only be paying 10 per cent on alterations and 15 per cent on the original.  Are these people, who acted in accordance with their skill in studying legislation, now to find that they will have to pay tax which they had not budgeted for?  Five per cent on £1 million is a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any transactions which may be involved, but we could be talking about a considerable sum of money that nobody had budgeted for.  In principle, it seems a very dangerous <Col N="1220" /> thing retroactively at the expense of the taxpayer, even if there be, as I understand there could be, refund situations in other cases, to penalise that particular case by exacting tax which was not applicable when he made his deal.  There is a very important distinction to be drawn between an amendment of income tax where one has got one's prior year in many cases operative and people are taking their chances that things will not operate against them by way of changes made in the bases of assessment and so on.  This is a very different type of thing. I do not know of any case of retroactive stamp duty being imposed.  I managed to buy my house by persuading the freeholder to take a surrender of the lease.  I do not want to find that the Minister is going to introduce a Bill now requiring me to pay a sum of money which, by law, I was not liable for at that time.  In principle, particularly if we are talking about substantial operations where companies have let out accounts and certified them as correct and people have invested in them and so on, the thing is dangerous.</P>

      <P>As far as it goes, it is very welcome indeed.  I do not wish to sound churlish on it, but you can have cases where no property other than investments is available to provide for the payment of the duty.  You can have the house, and the house has to be sold in that situation.  There may be a private company the shares of which are unrealisable. I am aware of a rather unfortunate case where the deceased had made a gift to his spouse within five years of his death, there was a liability for duty quite similar to the liability which would have arisen if he had made a will leaving it to her, which he would have done and which was the content of his will anyhow.  In that case it was not to be a relief although precisely similar circumstances exist as here in that the duty was determined by the value of the investments.  I think at the time of the gift, the law applicable to that and the realisation to pay the duty took place in that bleak period when you could not get very much for securities &mdash; now at this time of the day and year we will not be able to do much about that, but it is something the Minister might be able to take care of at some other time.</P>

I was quoting an actual case that I know of where there was an actual transfer of investments or gift of money to take over the investments made within five years which gave rise to duty owing to his premature death, and this was not part of his estate on his death and therefore this section does not take care of it.  Duty did arise, duty that was payable by her and the securities were sold in exactly the same circumstances as relief is being properly provided for in this section.  If he had never given them to her, this section would now be coming in her relief, but because he gave them to her it does not.</P>

      <P>The Senator knows better than most that any kind of provision one makes, particularly relieving provisions, will always produce hard cases which are just outside, and in this section I imagine the Senator knows that when in Opposition I argued very strongly that some provision ought to be made for cases of this kind where in some cases there has been considerable hardship arising.  Inevitably when making that provision one has to frame it in very narrow terms or relief will be given to people who do not deserve it.  So it has been very carefully and narrowly drawn.  I will give consideration to the kind of case the Senator raised, but in doing so I have to approach it on the basis of a very narrow and limited relief for a very special kind of case.  Subject to that I will give consideration to the kind of case the Senator raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this on Second Stage when I said that what I had said about the wealth tax at the time of its introduction I withdrew.  I do not think that the actual wealth tax imposed was such as would produce the benefits which theory attaches to a wealth tax. The nature of the exemptions given, which had to be given if it was to have been borne at all, took the economic good out of the tax.  Now I am faced with its repeal.  In the course of the operation of the wealth tax code I formed the view that when one was professionally concerned with seeing what one could do to aid someone in his financial affairs, the wealth tax seemed to block you at every twist and turn from doing things that would otherwise have been quite open to you to do and which would have reduced other taxation.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that measuring the fiscal benefit by looking at the £8 million, or whatever it was that came in from the wealth tax, it cannot at all be seen as a full long-term benefit in terms of the general picture which the Revenue were able to form of the taxpayer.  There are two things about it.  One, I should have thought there was an advantage.  I could see people deriving a benefit from facing into the business of making out what they were worth and what their assets were in&mdash;that was some benefit for them and it was not too expensive an operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they abolished the income and value duty that was introduced in the Finance Act of 1909 and 1910, they did not, as the Minister will know, abolish the &ldquo;particulars delivered&rdquo; form which was found to provide very useful information for the Valuation Office with regard to the values of transactions in the property field, and this aided the Valuation Office in making its assessment <Col N="1224" /> of values.  The income and value duty was one of the first of the brave attempts to see if there was any way we could get a proper community share of values on land simply by population growth and growth of economic prosperity.  That attempt failed, but though it failed, as the Minister may say, the wealth tax failed in its proposition. Wealth tax was on another page in the income tax code which would not apply unless you were away up in the regions of the figures that arise in relation to the code.  This would be very useful information, and I cannot see how any taxpayers had any reason to complain about it&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners' confidentiality is undoubted, they administer the tax fairly, they understand the full picture and have a grasp of how they should be administering their tax policies.</P>
    <P>Senator Donnelly yesterday was a little captious with regard to efforts that were made, and I think they were genuine efforts, to equalise conditions as between taxpayers.  Maybe in some cases they went too far, maybe they were not altogether successful, but the general idea was that people in like condition should be paying like taxation. That is a good idea and I should not like to see the Minister turning his mind away too much from that as a proper ambition for him as Minister for Finance who must deal, with all the emphasis you like to place on it, with economic efficiency and wealth creation, and I agree with the priority of that emphasis. Wealth creation will not be much good to those for whom it is being created if they are not going to be able to enjoy it because of an unhappy social situation, and an unhappy social situation is in itself a danger.  I think it is a proper object of public policy to be concerned about the justice of taxation as well as about its efficient operation.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a gentleman had told me he was leaving Ireland because of the wealth tax.  He could not carry his mansion on his back or his agricultural land in his pocket.  He had told me that he was going to Portugal.  Later he rang me up one Saturday morning and I said to him, &ldquo;There are worse things than wealth tax and that, such as soldiers <Col N="1225" /> with red buttons and with red carnations in their button holes&rdquo;, because at that stage the comfortable stability of the dictatorship in Portugal had collapsed and I was suggesting to him that maybe we would have to think of things such as the wealth tax as necessary preservatives of the free society that we have.  At any rate my general observation with regard to that tax is that schematically it should be maintained.  I think if it was to be maintained at all it would have required to have been reformed.  I do not think that it is timely, when your budget is hopelessly out of balance, to give away any revenues.  It provides too great an argument against the Government in relation to negotiations of one kind or another.  I think even if it is only symbolic there ought to be a contribution made by the owners of the estate greater than I believe is being made.</P>
    <P>I thought the old estate duty code was not half bad and could itself have been reformed.  It needed a gift tax to give it bite.  It needed an artificially favourable system of valuing land, an artificially favourable system of valuing shares in private businesses and different treatment than it had for life policies, for people who were providing genuinely for their families.  With these changes I think the old estate duty code could have been OK.  The old code provided in the last year £14 million odd, and that is in 1974 money &mdash; I do not know what that is in 1978 money but it is a great deal more than that.  The Minister can be asked to tell us, with his revisions in the capital gains tax which will not be effective this year as I understand it, what will be the total estimated receipts from such surviving capital taxes as we have got.  I think that people who are building up the estates are simply being unwise, even if it is only in terms of selfishness, if they have no real concern in not making a proper contribution to the maintenance of society.  They get a lot of services from society.  Security to enjoy their possessions is one of them, and parliamentary democracy is another, a free press &mdash; there are all sorts of good things here and they should be making a contribution by virtue merely of their estates.</P>
    <P>I would make, as the Minister is proposing to make, a worth-while <Col N="1226" /> change in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  I would have a special treatment for historic buildings and that type of situation. That should apply in any system of capital taxation where the maintenance of the thing is of value to the public as well as to the person who has special enjoyment of it.  That is my say on wealth tax, anyhow.</P>

      <P>I would agree with the Senator that a properly reformed death duty system plus a gift tax would have been the best way to approach the problem that was faced some years ago. However, that was not done, it is water under the bridge and we cannot do anything about it now.  I am faced with the situation I found when we came back into office.  It is true to say that the net effect has been a reduction in revenue on capital taxation.  The estimate for 1978 from capital taxation other than the old death duties is £6.3 million and from the old death duties this year £4 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, money that is still outstanding to be collected.  On the general issue, I might not disagree with Senator FitzGerald on his general approach <Col N="1227" /> to how capital taxation might have been made more effective, but that is water under the bridge.  I was faced with a situation when I came back into office.  Senator FitzGerald, if I am not misquoting him, used a phrase &ldquo;an unhappy social situation&rdquo;.  I believe that the most unhappy social situation we can have is one of widespread unemployment. Therefore the first priority is to tackle that problem.  When we have done so I believe that will be the time to look at the desirability or otherwise of a wealth tax.  In the meantime I have no doubt at all where my priority lies, not in some cosmetic exercise which is held to be creating equity in taxation, or held to be causing a redistribution of wealth when in fact neither of those two things was true in relation to the wealth tax as we had it.  It was merely a cosmetic exercise. It was, on the other hand, causing, I believe, very considerable damage from the point of view of creation of employment. Given those two things to balance one against the other, I have no hesitation in coming down in favour of removing the inhibitions to the creation of employment.  That is our first priority.  I had no great difficulty in deciding on the right policy to be followed here, which I believe is what we have in this section, the abolition of wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator FitzGerald with regard to the possibility of returns assisting the Revenue Commissioners. He referred to the old increment value duty.  Although that was abolished he favoured the retention of the necessity to furnish the particulars on a particular delivered form.  He will appreciate, of course, that there was a built-in compulsion in it: one had to do this in order to get the deeds stamped.  I am not quite sure what compulsion one could build into the furnishing of returns for wealth tax, even though there would not be any wealth tax levies.  I have considered that situation to see if any enforceable system could be developed which would also be worth while from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, but in general I feel that the important thing to be borne in mind in regard to the wealth tax as we have had <Col N="1228" /> it operating in this country, the important thing to weigh up, is to what extent did it help or hinder the creation of employment.  On that test I have no doubt at all that we are doing the right thing in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make any subscription in this field beyond what I have said, but I should endeavour, at least, to articulate my position on the point that the Minister has made a little better than I have done. My point with regard to the abolition is that it is untimely.  I did not say as clearly as I now must that it is untimely because of the financial pressures and constraints under which the Government have got to conduct the business before them in the next few years.  It is untimely if it creates a feeling among people that a lot of people are getting away with things.</P>
      <P>How can you successfully appeal for restraint in incomes, moderation in demands for efforts that are made, if at the same time certain people are being relieved of tax?  I am not aware of any detached or objective study of the impact of the actual wealth tax we had, so I am quite unable to say one thing or another about its effect on the flows of capital, for example, but my own judgment was that there was a considerable amount of fear of wealth tax by people who were not paying it but who were afraid they would get into the bracket in which they would be paying it.  In certain cases it impinged very severely and most unhappily, but in very few cases did it lead to steps which caused unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If unemployment is to be a test of whether you maintain a tax we should abolish all taxation because all taxation has some effect on employment.  For example, the ordinary social security stamp is a direct tax on employment.  It does not coercively follow that if it is capable of being defined as a tax on employment you necessarily abolish the employer's contribution.  I do not see any connection anyway close between the payers of income tax and the generation of employment.  Indeed if that were the problem the existing wealth tax could easily have been amended to grant <Col N="1229" /> widespread exemption in so far as assets were put not into unproductive resources like splendid mansions packed with Rubens's but into employing people in industry. Give all the reliefs in the world but maintain it in so far as people are engaged in other activities.  That is simply on the employment point.</P>
    <P>My general view is that I do not think it is timely.  If the wealth tax itself was not satisfactory for all the reasons that have been suggested, was resented and if something that created less resentment and induced less fear was thought to have made any cloud in the investment climate, right, but a substitute for it should have been sought.  It might have been some revision of the capital acquisitions tax, an extension of its provisions, some revival of the old estate duty code or whatever.  I merely feel that I could not let that section go by without making these few comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the points that I took up on Second Stage.  I do not want to speak at length on it but I feel entitled to say a few words on the implications of wealth tax for employment creation.  As I see it, not being an expert on the tax side, there is a big difference between putting a tax on wealth which has been accumulated and the process of funding of that wealth, having been already taxed at earlier stages.  It is a kind of double taxation.  I do not think you can say that you will remove all taxation.  It just means that this form of taxation in itself inhibits the entrepreneur, and we need entrepreneurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue this unduly, but there are one or two things I think I should say.  First, I referred in some detail in the other House to the evidence in regard to capital flows and I do not want to go back over it again.  Neither do I want it to be allowed to pass in this House &mdash; if I do not make any reference to it it might be taken that I was acknowledging by my silence that there was not evidence of capital flows outwards arising from wealth tax.  That would not be my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Secondly, Senator FitzGerald touched on an important aspect of this, that is, the psychological effect.  I do not think it matters terribly much whether this was misguided if, in fact, the effect was to inhibit investment and the creation of jobs.  Whether or not that was due to a misapprehension as to the effect of the tax, if it operated that way, then that was an important consideration to be borne in mind in considering the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I adverted last night to the fact that the wealth tax operated in a discriminitory way in favour of foreigners and against Irish people, and I do think that that can be justified.  A reference by Senator FitzGerald reminds me that I should say that one of the consequences of the wealth tax was for wealthy people to stuff their houses with antiques, valuable paintings, and so on, and put their money into more and more unproductive assets.  That could not be thought of as a desirable consequence.</P>
    <P>Almost by definition it is impossible to measure the consequence of the wealth tax in contributing to the creation of jobs or in inhibiting the creation of jobs.  One could measure relatively easily the number of jobs directly lost as a result of the introduction of the wealth tax.  It would not be enormous but there certainly were some.  A number of us have personal knowledge of some of them.  It certainly would be theoretically possible to measure this.  What is not possible to measure is the number of jobs which would have been created, and were not created because of people's fears in regard to wealth tax, either real or imagined, but genuine fears.</P>
    <P>In addition, the other aspect of that is the kind of people I referred to last night who were not subject to wealth tax but who did not expand their businesses because they felt it would bring them into the wealth tax net and they were personally quite comfortable as they were and did not see why they should work day and night, and take on the trouble and worry involved, to expand their businesses in order to bring themselves into the wealth tax situation. All of these factors operated and one cannot measure scientifically what the result is.  All I can say is that my own experience <Col N="1231" /> and the experience of many people I know who are involved directly or indirectly with the kind of people on whom we depend to a great extent for the creation of jobs, people such as bank managers, solicitors and accountants, suggest very strongly that the wealth tax operated very much to our detriment in the context of job creation.  I believe the results of its abolition will show in so far as one can isolate them &mdash; and it will be impossible to isolate them fully &mdash; that the decision was justified.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator FitzGerald in regard to what could be alleged to be the apparent inequity involved, but in practice I find that you seldom if ever meet somebody unemployed who is worried about either the imposition or the abolition of the wealth tax.  That is not what he is worried about.  Most of the people who express strong views either way are very comfortably ensconced in employment. In so far as there is an argument about equity, it tends to be between people who have jobs, not between those who have jobs and those who have not.</P>
    <P>I come back to my original point.  Our first priority in our present circumstances has to be the creation of jobs.  I suggest that any argument in regard to the equity or inequity of our taxation system must take second place to that, and is something that can be pursued when we have tackled the basic inequity of our society where so many people, particularly our young people, have no prospect of a job in the future.  That to me is the greatest and basic inequity in our society which we have got to tackle. When we have got that one under control, we can afford the luxury of the more doctrinal arguments which arise in relation to wealth tax and other forms of capital taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to start all this.  I do not think tuppence of an entrepreneur who stops working because he is afraid he will build up such an estate that he will be paying a bit of tax on it.  It is conceivable that there are such people.  Is it the argument that we are abolishing wealth tax to free the way for people who will not work hard <Col N="1232" /> enough, will not take risks, for fear that they would make so much money they would be paying wealth tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that that is the position.  The Minister very properly said it would be difficult to see what the effect of abolishing wealth tax would be.  It is equally difficult to see what was the result of introducing it.  The connections are very difficult.  There are so many different factors operating at any moment in an economy that to isolate one and say this is the cause of the other is extremely difficult.  I come back to the employment point.  The Minister is misdirecting himself very seriously, and misdirection by somebody in his position is a serious matter.  The question of justice is not dismissed by saying that those who are out of jobs do not care whether they are paying wealth tax.  It is not those who are out of jobs whose decisions and co-operation we want to solve unemployment.  It is those who are in jobs whose co-operation we want.  We want the co-operation of the employed to moderate income demands.  Their view about the justice of the matter is important, and we cannot be simply unconcerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think cosmetics is quite the right word.  There is a symbolism in this, and maybe it could be made a little more than a symbol properly operated.  At a time when the Green Paper is contemplating little operations which will save £2 million, £5 million, £6 million, £8 million, or whatever number of millions, to cut out one tax which impacts, or is seen to impact, or is felt to impact on people who are well off on any count is unwise.  I do not see that the response from them in terms of employment-creating decisions can equal the damage that may result from the lack of co-operation from people who will not feel this to be just at the moment.  I am speaking as one who opposed the introduction of the wealth tax, who did not particularly like it as a tax, but still is of this view.  It is important that I should say that.</P>

      <P>One person must have misunderstood what the section is doing, because a professional body represented to me that this has the effect of abolishing the exemption afforded to non-domiciled and non-resident individuals in respect of gifts of Government securities.  As far as I can understand the change &mdash; I was not able to look at it very closely &mdash; it seems to extend the period of holding from one year to three years, then adds language which is obscure to me:</P>
      <P>...any period immediately before the date of disposition during which the securities or units were continuously in the beneficial ownership of the disponer shall be deemed ... to be a period or part of a period immediately before the date...</P>
      <P>If they were not immediately before the date, what is the point here?  Is the period they are held by the donor taken into account as well as the period of time during which the donee holds them in determining the exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the portion to which the Senator is referring is an item we introduced to avoid an element of retrospection.  In order to avoid this element of retrospection, it is provided that the holding of the securities from 14 April 1978 &mdash; that is the date of publication &mdash; to the date of the gift or inheritance suffices where the securities are held for less than three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to both the old law and this, surely the exemption <Col N="1234" /> which attaches to Government securities whose prospectuses provided that persons who held them were non-domiciled and non-resident here, continues to free the holders.  Surely the old section of the capital acquisitions tax, and this section, as amended, would make a holder, whether he got them by way of gift or originally by way of investment, liable for capital acquisitions tax.  It is the donee who is liable.  Any legislation of that kind must be in some way a departure from the terms of issue of the Government stock in question in which it would have been said that, being held by somebody non-resident and non-domiciled in this country, they will be free from all Irish taxation.</P>
      <P>How are they free from all Irish taxation if, instead of buying them, people get a gift of them from their uncle in Dublin or Cork?  They are still non-domiciled and non-resident and the condition of the original prospectus would seem still to entitle them to be free from tax.  It is not as if this particular tax were levied on the donor.  The capital acquisitions tax could have provided that, in a case where there was a gift of securities which, being held by a non-domiciled person or a non-resident would give rise to a liability, that liability would shift to the donor, so that we would not go back on what we said when we told the world we were issuing these Government securities on the basis that the person being non-domiciled and non-resident they would never be liable to Irish tax.  It is a very important market matter if I am right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator would be right if his basic premise were right, but I am not quite sure we are on the same wavelength here.  The position has been that where the donor &mdash; I am using broad terms now &mdash; was Irish and the donee was non-Irish, in order to get the exemption the security had to be held by the donor for at least one year.  Where the donor was Irish or ordinarily resident in the State the donee, under the existing law, had to hold it for a year. What we are doing here is extending that period of one year to three years, but we are not affecting in any way the position where both the donor and the donee are <Col N="1235" /> non-Irish.  I am using the terms non-Irish in a non-technical sense.  We are not affecting that type of transaction at all. The only transaction we are affecting is where the donor is Irish and the donee is foreign.  Up to now the requirement was one year and we are making that three years.</P>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge we are not interfering with the terms of issue of the securities, because any terms in connection with those securities would relate to the securities themselves, whereas this relates to the liability to capital acquisition tax of somebody who is ordinarily resident in the State.  No liability arises, as I have said, where both the donor and the donee are not ordinarily resident in the State, and we are not changing the position in regard to them.  Maybe the Senator has some information in regard to the terms on which some of these securities might have been issued which would suggest that what I have said is not accurate but, at the moment, I have not got information which would suggest that we are altering the terms of issue by virtue of this section.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that I am surrounded by paper I am not surrounded by prospectuses of Government borrowings for the past 50 years.  Any I have looked at for a long time have had this provision, which is of considerable interest to the investor, who is the person normally dealing with it.  If there is any such security &mdash; and there will certainly be some securities which will lie behind any unit trust of the kind referred to here &mdash; there will be some of these securities within that description. The conditions of issue of those securities will be breached even if it be a case of a gift by a donor resident and domiciled in Ireland to someone domiciled and resident abroad.  The security itself has and should have the characteristic in all circumstances that no Irish tax would be payable if the holder for the time being, however he came to hold it, was non-domiciled and non-resident in Ireland.</P>

    <P>This is a very important matter which I am certain neither the previous Minister nor the present Minister would <Col N="1236" /> wish to have affected.  It is the very important question of our adhering to the conditions of issue of all these Government securities.  It may be that the old section will have to be scrubbed instead of extending the one year to leave the gift exempt.  If you want to catch what might develop into a broad highway of avoidance you might have to transfer the liability &mdash; as the English have under their capital transfer tax &mdash; to the transferor where he was transferring what would be exempt because of the conditions of issue of the security being transferred.</P>

      <P>In this section all we are doing is changing the one-year exemption to three years.  Clearly what we are doing in this section is not, of itself, interfering with the terms of issue of these securities.  If there is any interference with the terms of issue then I am afraid it must have arisen in the earlier section which we are amending.</P>

      <P>I have no information which suggests that was done by the earlier section but I will have this examined. If we were interfering with it we would then have to consider what the consequences were because I think the terms of issue may well be dependent on other statutory provision and we might have a conflict between the two.  The first thing that has to be established is whether, in fact, there is any breach in the terms.  I will have that examined and, if it is so, I will have the consequences examined.  As of now, I have no information which suggests that the original section 57 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, did in fact breach those terms.</P>

      <P>One point on this.  Are we not supposed to be encouraging redistribution or at least voluntary redistribution?  There might be <Col N="1237" /> disagreement among us as to the extent to which there should be a redistribution policy at State level.  Here we have the highest rates applicable to acts of the utmost generosity where perfect strangers are concerned.  That is in Table IV.  I cannot see why this should necessarily be so.  In particular I would have thought the relationship of service which might exist between the donor and the donee should apply.  Some devil of a daughter who never gave a hoot about her father could collect £150,000 without any tax, and some poor woman who spent her life looking after him and keeping house, and so on, to whom he left a substantial legacy would be caught for duty because of his decency.  I know a man who wants to actually give away shares in a substantial company and who is blocked by capital gains tax on the one hand and capital acquisitions tax on the other.  It seems to be only mad that we should have actual fiscal provisions to prevent him doing this desirable thing of making partners in his venture of people who worked with him to build it up.</P>

      <P>I have a query.  This is a recognition of the severity of the interest charged.  I did not know what section 14 of the Finance Act, 1962, was, and I did not have time to look it up.  In the case of some employer who has deducted tax from his employees under PAYE, has held on to the money and not given it to Revenue, are we now saying he will be in as favourable an interest position as an ordinary taxpayer who is overdue with his own tax as distinct from his employees' tax?  A couple of these sections deal with fraud and neglect provisions both of individuals and corporations.  They might be treated differently in relation to interest. I would not have had the same treatment for one as for the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of fraud or neglect there are other rather stringent provisions which apply in addition to the interest rate.  One could say they are distinguished in that way.  In regard to the question of an employer who deducts tax from his employees and then fails to pay it over, in practice the Revenue Commissioners are much less lenient in dealing with cases of this kind, and similarly in the case of VAT&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where in effect money has been taken from the customer but it is not the property of the shopkeeper.  Those two are treated somewhat differently in practice.  The problem of a differential rate of tax is administrative. There is another problem.  I do not say it is a major one in practice, but I would be afraid it might so develop.  It is an inherent problem in setting the interest rate here too high.  If a taxpayer overpays his tax, he is entitled to a refund of tax at the same level and, if the rate of interest is very high, he could be tempted to deliberately overpay it and get a refund of interest at, say, 18 per cent.</P>

      <P>That is an area that would worry me slightly.  Having regard to the necessity on the one hand to have a substantial inducement, and some degree of penal rate involved, and on the other hand to have some regard to current interest rates which are changing frequently, and still to have regard to the other difficulty I mentioned, this level is probably about as good as we can get.</P>
