    <Title>Wood Quay Site: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make an order to preserve indefinitely the Viking site at Wood Quay, already designated a National Monument, in view of the many other sites in Dublin available for civic offices.&mdash;(Senator Martin.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is worth reminding the House that, while there are deficiencies in the national monuments code which should long since have been repaired and which it is to our discredit that they have not been repaired, the code as drafted and crafted in 1930 provided for coping with and dealing with the very issue that is facing us today in this motion, because the Act contemplates, as well as the preservation of national monuments, their destruction also.  It provides an orderly and lawful procedure whereby, with the consent of those given the duty of preservation, a national monument as defined in the Act can be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a story which is so very well known that it need not be told again here by anyone but it is a story of high drama and extraordinary irony.  Senator Dowling made a very sincere and feeling contribution <Col N="636" /> last evening on the position of Dublin Corporation.  I do not think we can look at this issue unless we approach it from the standpoint of those whose work and efforts were directed in one direction, as that work and these efforts must have been&mdash;the direction of creating a proper, efficient set of buildings in which to administer the services to the citizens of Dublin which it is the duty of Dublin Corporation to administer. That work and effort over many years led to the bringing together, an extremely difficult task, of this four-acre site.  Here are the corporation, concerned as it was their duty to be, with creating a proper centre for the administration of their services: here they find themselves, having done their work of creating such a site, in fact unfolding in doing so the site, as it has been described, of Dublin's birthplace.  What an extraordinary, dramatic situation. Concerned with creating a monument now, they discover a great monument of the past.</P>
    <P>Therefore, anyone who reaches the conclusion which I have reached that this national monument, this site of Dublin's birthplace, must be preserved would be lacking in all feeling, I think&mdash;and some have shown at least that they have not fully understood the situation of the corporation, not fully shared the feeling that I have for those officials and those people who have done the work they have done in bringing about and creating this site&mdash;if he did not appreciate what the corporation have done.  They have found what has been described on oath in the High Court by an undisputed authority as a treasure beyond price; what another authority, now alas deceased, described as a national monument as Tara is a national monument; described by another as the first major city of the Vikings outside Scandinavia built on virgin soil.  The corporation, concerned to erect a building to serve the citizens of today, have discovered what another has described as the most important excavation in northern Europe; what another authority, quoted yesterday in this House&mdash;and I have looked at his <i>curriculum vitae</i> and his authority is undisputed&mdash;described as of greater international <Col N="637" /> significance than the famous Russian excavations at Novgorod; what yet another, again cited in this House yesterday, and again whose <i>curriculum vitae</i> establishes his authority, referred to as a key site for the history of western Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>This is the nature of the find.  This is the nature of the national monument. This is no archaeologically expendable monument.  This, in archaeological terms, is of inestimable, immeasurable value.</P>
    <P>It was contemplated, as I said, by the Act that a national monument might be destroyed with the consent of the commissioners and in this case the joint consent of the commissioners and Dublin Corporation.  Therefore, a balance must be found.  There can be nothing absolute in relation to this matter: there can be no question, for example, of some archaeological discovery not of such importance being allowed to be an obstacle to the solution of some current urgent problem of this city or of this nation. There can be nothing absolute about that.  It is obvious that it would be unthinkable, for example, if some fine existing building should not exist where it does, simply because at some stage before it was created something of some archaeological significance was discovered. Therefore it is a matter of balance.  There is nothing absolute either about economic or financial consideration. Someone in the course of this controversy has said that if we destroy the national monument for the economic elements involved, in principle we might as well sell the Book of Kells.  In principle, if we give an absolute priority to economic, financial and, I dare say, even social considerations, I would say to this House that there is no justification for the continued expenditure of public money on a whole host of matters which are justifiable only in terms which are non-economic, non-financial.  How do you justify any expenditure on the National Museum?  How do you justify any expenditure on the National Gallery? How do you justify any expenditure on the universities or on any other institute of learning, any of which are engaged in the operations of pure research, the advancement of knowledge <Col N="638" /> itself?  You cannot do so if economic considerations, financial considerations, even social considerations in their crudest terms and forms are totally to determine this fact.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the solution to this site.  I do not profess to know what the Corporation's full needs are.  I do not profess to know what can be done on the site which is not part of the national monument.  I do not think it is relevant for this House to hear what my view is as to how that area shall be planned.  I do not think it is relevant for this House to engage in town planning.  It is not our duty: it is not our function.  But it is our duty and it is our function to speak to the executive as legislators, where the power is in the executive, and to draw their attention to the choices they have to make and the purity of mind that they must bring to this problem, the total <i>bona fides</i> involved and required.  I do not suggest that anyone to date, at any level&mdash;it is not necessary for my thesis and I do not know it; I do not believe it&mdash;has been acting in other than the most total <i>bona fides.</i>  It is not necessary that anyone should feel that he is defeated in this matter, whatever the solution.  What I do argue most strongly is that if it is economic, if it is financial, then it is for the Government to provide the funds to ensure that the national monument element of that site which includes the environs as defined in the Act, the approaches to it, is not damaged.</P>
    <P>Whether after due time and after a great deal more knowledge than anyone has at the moment, whether at the end of the excavation which should be permitted, which should not be interfered with, whether at the end of that work, whether that monument should be preserved on the site is a matter for another day. What is for today is to preserve the possibility and the opportunity of that and for that, and if this involves the pain to the corporation or any officials in the corporation of the loss and the sacrifice, if it involves them in a sense that they have wasted much of their lives, a great deal of their energies&mdash;this happens in life many times and hard decisions have to be made and pain has to be inflicted and pain has to be borne and if it is the right thing to do for us to preserve this <Col N="639" /> treasure beyond price&mdash;not to spend it like we spend pages of the <i>Book of Kells</i>&mdash;then we must see that the cost of that is borne by the community.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me tenable that there is no other place in Dublin which can be found for use for the purposes for which this site has been created and brought together.  I find this impossible to believe.  I also find it impossible to believe that anyone in this House does not realise that if I argue, as I do, for the preservation of this monument I am not doing so as some antiquarian solely concerned with the national monument.  I believe that reason should govern this matter as all matters, but reason here will be failing in its duty if it does not have regard to the passions involved, if it does not have regard to the significance for the present of the preservation of what is valuable in the past; if it does not realise that this community cannot be made to do the work that is its duty to do, that it cannot fully realise its highest potential, if it can be seen anywhere to have faltered in the preservation of such a valuable record of the past of this country and of this city.</P>

      <P>I am neither an architect nor an archaeologist.  As a lay person I feel there are only three ways in which we can deal with this very difficult predicament.  One is to forget all about it and build the corporation offices there; the second way is to remove the most precious of the archaeological ships and objects that are there and bring them into our National Museum, perhaps leaving a little bit of the ground free and with a glass-protected place where one could see the remains of the rest of the ships.  The third way is somewhat radical inasmuch as for over 50 years we have not built a museum or an art gallery in this country.  I am sure we do not have the money, but is it not feasible that we should build a new museum?  We are very short of space in this House; we could move the museum from where it is to the new place.  The Government could use for offices the Museum adjoining this House, terrace rather beautifully the Wood Quay site and keep our heritage and let the Corporation build their offices <Col N="640" /> outside the city&mdash;not too far. Already, we are jammed with traffic. The Corporation have always said that they wished to have offices near to dwelling houses.  This would be one of the ways if we could find a proper site.  I am not saying in which of the three ways I think it should be done because I am not in a position and have not the knowledge to do so but these are three different possibilities I should like to put before the House.</P>

      <P>The background to the Wood Quay issue has the utmost significance for Ireland today and for this Government.  Wood Quay raises four distinct kinds of issues, and in the limited time available to me I would like to mention and deal with these four distinct issues.  Wood Quay raises very important cultural issues: it raises institutional and therefore political issues: it raises planning issues of a most fundamental nature and it raises social issues.</P>
      <P>Dealing first with the cultural issues, what is Wood Quay?  We know that it is the proposed site of the new civic offices, that it has been in the ownership of Dublin Corporation for a very considerable time and that it was discovered to be the site of early Viking Dublin.  It was discovered to have untold riches of an archaeological nature, of a historical nature, of a cultural nature, of an architectural nature.  It was discovered to be the site of early working-class Dublin where townspeople lived, where they had early earthen fortifications which have revealed an extraordinary complexity of design and a uniqueness in Western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just over a year ago, on the last Sunday of November 1977, I was brought into the Wood Quay issue in a very dramatic way and was involved in a long and difficult court case which resulted in a judgment in the High Court in July last by Mr. Justice Hamilton deciding that this site at Wood Quay is a national monument.  That judicial finding was made on the basis of expert evidence offered by archaeologists and historians and architects from this country and of archaeologists from Britain and from Denmark.  That was the evidence offered <Col N="641" /> in court which Mr. Justice Hamilton found coercive.  There can be no doubt that Wood Quay has an extraordinary cultural richness for us and one of the great advantages of being involved as a lawyer in that case was the privilege of visiting the site on a number of occasions. I think I should speak a little about this.  It is stunning to be able to walk along a Viking streetplan and see the wattle houses&mdash;the actual demarcation of the walls&mdash;to see where the hearth is, to see the instruments, ordinary household instruments.  It is stunning to stand beside the archaeologists on the site as they describe the intricacy of the post and wattle work, as they show the design of the earthen fortifications and to learn that there is no counterpart in Western Europe and to hear this from Danish archaeologists, from German archaeologists, from those who regard this not as an Irish cultural treasure but as a European cultural treasure.  We have to face this fully&mdash; there is no doubt about the European and indeed international significance of the site at Wood Quay.  As a people who gained their independence comparatively recently, who are now in charge of our own country, the buck stops with us and as far as Wood Quay is concerned the buck at the moment stops with the Government.</P>
    <P>Wood Quay also raises very important institutional and political issues because, as Senator FitzGerald has reminded us, despite the fact that Wood Quay has been determined in the High Court to be a national monument and despite the fact that the evidence of that was found to be coercive, there is provision in our national monuments code for the destruction of a national monument and this can be done in the case of a national monument which is in the possession of a local authority by the joint consent of that local authority and the Commissioners for Public Works.  The Commissioners for Public Works act in this matter clearly on the advice if not under the thumb of the Government. They do not appear to have an independent function in the matter and this can be understood because of the monetary implications for this country of deciding <Col N="642" /> to treasure a national monument as opposed to authorising its destruction.  The Commissioners for Public Works do not appear to act in an independent capacity in relation to the decision and for that reason I think we have to regard it in reality as a Government decision.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the Commissioners of Public Works to receive advice from the National Monuments Advisory Council, a body with a statutory function to advise the Commissioners. That body from the very beginning, certainly at the court proceedings, has consistently advised the Commissioners and therefore indirectly advised the Government&mdash;and indeed directly to my knowledge&mdash;that the national monument at Wood Quay is of such immense cultural importance to us that it should be preserved and be fully excavated, should not be under threat and should be treasured for the nation.  That is the advice of the statutory body established to advise the Commissioners.  Since the advice forthcoming is so strongly and unequivocally in favour of the preservation of the national monument at Wood Quay and the decision is being taken not on cultural grounds, not on the grounds of the importance of Wood Quay to us as a nation but on other grounds and for other reasons, this raises an issue of how far the decision can be taken in the way it is being taken by the Commissioners of Public Works on issues which are not related to the national monument itself and to its significance for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>For that reason I believe one of the lessons we have to learn from the Wood Quay issue is the importance of examining and strengthening our national monuments code so that we do not have the risk to our cultural heritage which is evident in the present circumstances.  We also need to ensure that the National Monuments Advisory Council has a stronger and clearer role in relation to the advice it can give and the influence that it can exert.  If we are saying that the Commissioners of Public Works are going to be the deciding body, there should be more evidence of the independence of their decision and of the separation of their function from the direct controlling voice of the Government.  These issues <Col N="643" /> are not clear at the moment.</P>
    <P>The third set of issues which are central to Wood Quay are the planning issues.  These were highlighted very strongly in the Labour Party's statement on Wood Quay.  At the time the statement was published certain people said that in some way it was a compromise on the basics.  I believe that if this statement is understood it is the strongest and most rounded contribution that has been made on the issue of Wood Quay and I am glad that the Labour Party was prepared to take the time to examine the issue and to come to the agreement.</P>
    <P>The statement has four major considerations: first of all, that the national monument at Wood Quay must be conserved, and the word &ldquo;conserved&rdquo; was chosen deliberately because conserved means that the parts that can be preserved should be preserved so that the parts that are not capable of being preserved should be kept in the context of either being displayed on the site or reconstituted, as we have reconstituted so many other vital national monuments, like, for example, the Hill of Hostages in Tara.  People who go to Tara&mdash;probably the most basic national monument of our instinctive culture as a people&mdash;and look at the mound of hostages and walk around it&mdash;are very moved by it.  That was entirely reconstituted by the late Professor Ruairí de Valera in his capacity as a distinguished archaeologist.  Therefore, we should be prepared to reconstitute these earthern banks, the subject of the present controversy on the Wood Quay site.  What is happening is a despicable attempt to put pressure on the archaeologists on the site to speed up their work at excavating these earthen works so that there may be nothing there, so that the corporation and the Government may, in an underhand way, be able to say: &ldquo;Well, there is nothing left to preserve, so there is no decision necessary in regard to preservation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe these earthen fortifications are of immense significance in understanding the evolution of Dublin itself, that we do not know nearly enough about the complex structure of them and <Col N="644" /> that when there has been further time for continued excavation they should be reconstituted as a unique structure in western Europe, as uniquely poised on the bend of the river there, and as part of the national monument of Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>We are talking about an area of south inner Dublin which is vital to the texture of the city itself.  We must be concerned not only with preserving the national monument of Wood Quay but also with revitalising that Liberty of Wood Quay, as it was christened during that march of thousands of people expressing not only the archaeological and aesthetic values but also the social values of the desire for a living city, the desire to have a revitalising of housing and of the facility of a monument on or adjacent to the Wood Quay site which would allow for display of the very valuable materials which have been found and many of which are in the National Museum.  It is very important not to narrow the subject of Wood Quay.  We are talking about the revitalisation of the south inner city.  We are talking about people living there.  We are talking about the need for a community to have a life, and a community involvement in that area.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party statement then deals with the other issue, the question of the civic offices.  Here I must comment on the terms of the motion.  The motion before us today reads:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make an order to preserve indefinitely the Viking site at Wood Quay, already designated a National Monument, in view of the many other sites in Dublin available for civic offices.</P>
    <P>In the best of all possible worlds and indeed, if possible at all, I&mdash;and I know that many people in the Labour Party&mdash;would like to see the civic offices built on an alternative site.  We explored every possibility of that.  We tried, in consultation with the city manager, we tried looking ourselves at alternatives; we tried by examining the city.  Deputy Ruairí Quinn, our spokesman on the Environment, did a great deal of work trying to see what were the alternative sites. It is not easy to see a total alternative site.  I believe we came up with a very constructive solution, that is, that there <Col N="645" /> would be on the part of that area&mdash;and we must distinguish this&mdash;which at one time did have very valuable archaeological material, which was at one time a site that could be designated a national monument but which was excavated to bedrock so that there is now nothing there, and that is more than half the site, could be the site of a scaled-down civic office.  It could be scaled-down so as to respect and be much more in tune with the profile up to Christchurch, much more in tune with the profile along the river, which is a profile of low buildings.  The scaling down of the civic offices would have other values.  It would mean the devolution to other parts of the city of some of the amenities which do not have to be centralised there right in the middle of the city forcing people who want to use the offices to travel large distances.  We must have some centralisation; it should be scaled down; it should be compatible with that enormously beautiful visual impact of Christchurch from across the river.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are four different strands to this.  The first is no compromise at all on preserving the national monument at Wood Quay, the possibility of having a very exciting museum of Dublin adjacent to it so that you can look at this Viking street, so that you can look at the earthen fortifications there on the ground.  You would have the museum to display the treasures which have been found on the site, the scaled-down civic offices being a public function and an amenity in that area, a very important amenity for a city; also housing in that area and a plan for the other ports of medieval Dublin which have been so well displayed in the map produced by the Friends of Medieval Dublin.</P>
    <P>In my last half minute I might pay enormous tribute to Father F.X. Martin and to the Friends of Medieval Dublin who have fought such a consistent, brave and valiant battle, and who may have to go on fighting that battle in order to preserve our national heritage. They are right and we in this House should recognise it.  We should join with them in fighting to save this immensely <Col N="646" /> important part of our cultural heritage and of the social, living Dublin for which we must fight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak with the background of a Dublin family of at least four generations.  Throughout my life one of my dreams has been the landscaping of the area between the Liffey and Christchurch Cathedral, to provide a vista of historical elegance.  For years I have patiently watched the growth of the dilapidated houses along the Liffey and emotionally suffered this ugliness in the belief that there was a worth-while purpose ahead and that ultimate clearance would give way to one of the finest sights in Europe.  I thought corporation members were thinking along the same line.  I live in Rathfarnham and, in order to reach Dublin airport, I have to drive across Dublin reluctantly adding to the traffic chaos which chokes and pollutes the city centre.  It takes longer and longer to get to the airport with more and more waste of time, petrol and patience.  As one becomes captive in the congestion the follies of our cityscape impinge on one's consciousness.</P>
      <P>I make a plea that there will not be another folly added to some there already.  I inevitably choose the route via Christchurch Cathedral because of the pleasurable feeling of driving up by St. Patrick's particularly since the corporation wisely made the clearance for the spanning out of roads which elevates one's spirit and makes one proud of the city of Dublin.  I had this vision of the vista long before I knew anything about the Viking discoveries.  Of course, this adds a new national dimension, as has been said by many Senators.  I want to add my plea, on behalf of future generations, to re-design the whole site in order to provide this glorious perspective from the Liffey which will so enhance the character of our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we should be mindful of the generous gesture of the Archbishop of Dublin in foregoing the plan for a cathedral in Merrion Square.  Archbishop Ryan has shown that pride need not stand in the way of changing one's mind.  Those Senators who joined Senator Goulding's track around the square will have got a new sensitivity to <Col N="647" /> the glories of our city.  Those who destroy the soul of a city destroy the soul of some of its citizens and the intrusion of the type of office blocks which are planned will be monuments to the cultural ignorance of this generation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed decision to go ahead with the original office block design on this site indicates the very low standard of visual taste in this country. The reasons for this lack of visual appreciation are difficult to understand when one thinks of the incredible beauty of our island related to the national affinity for the other art forms in drama, literature and music.  No one can dispute the beauty of Christchurch Cathedral where many ecumenical services, including that for Citizenship Sunday, have taken place.  I would like to see it become the first European church in a very wide sense.  Only yesterday in Merrion Square the Presbyterians, the Church of Ireland and the Irish Methodists were meeting to continue a tripartite consulation to formulate proposals for the organic union of these three Churches.  I would hope that the broader use of Christchurch could be a starting point in the unification of the Protestant Churches and an example to Europe as one positive step towards ecumenism.  Let us show our fellow Irishmen in Northern Ireland that we treasure all the historical influences which have made Dublin a truly capital city.  We owe it to all our citizens in this island.  Indeed, we owe it to Europe, as other Senators have said.  We have to preserve all the contributory elements which make Wood Quay such a unique site&mdash;the cathedral, the national monument and the potential vista from Anna Livia.  I sympathise with the staff who need improved office facilities but there are still a number of speculative buildings available for the short term. After all, three to five years for an alternative site is short in the time scale of eternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parties should ask their corporation members to review the visual potential of this whole perspective and encourage <Col N="648" /> their members to work towards and vote for redesign of the whole area for posterity and not just for expediency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement on the whole position regarding Wood Quay. Unfortunately, certain information is being sent out to the public and causing quite a lot of confusion in people's minds.  I hope today to give some information to everybody from the very beginning of the whole matter.  I want everyone to keep in mind that&mdash;what I say I hope will be of help to other Senators who wish to make a contribution&mdash;what I am giving are the facts.  We have read articles, we have read letters to the editor and so on, but everybody seems to be misinterpreting what everyone else is saying.  I decided, therefore, that in agreeing to take this motion here, I would prepare something giving the history of this whole complex problem of Wood Quay.  What I state are facts and dates.  I hope that Senators who will make a contribution after me will keep those facts in mind.  The extraordinary thing about what Senator Martin was saying last evening is that it was something that was being done; they were part of the plans he was talking about.  I want Senators also to keep in mind that excavation has been going on for the past 11 years&mdash;not since I or anybody else in recent years came into office.</P>
      <P>I hope to distinguish between some things that are being confused by everybody&mdash;excavation and preservation. I speak with all honesty when I say I am somewhat disappointed with professional people in the field of archaeology who have not come forward and explained this very important matter to the people of Dublin.  I say&mdash;because everyone seems to be becoming emotional about the whole matter&mdash;that I do not blame this or that. It is an emotional problem.  But I stand holding responsibility for the site.  I am not allowed the luxury of becoming emotional in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed with a lot of what Senator Robinson said but I am glad she mentioned the court order.  To clarify the <Col N="649" /> court order I will make a statement, first of all, on this very important point of Wood Quay and the court order issued. Nobody would deny nor would I wish to do so the importance of the High Court decision in respect of Wood Quay.  That was the first occasion, of which I am aware, on which a declaration was sought, through our courts, on the initiative of private citizens, that a certain structure or structures continue a national monument as defined in the National Monuments Act of 1930.  The unprecedented nature of this action and the decision which emanated tended to cloud certain factors bearing on the judgment which must be placed on record at the outset.  In delivering his judgment on Friday, 30 June 1978 Mr. Justice Hamilton said:</P>
    <P>I could not but have been impressed by the evidence with regard to the efforts by Dublin Corporation and its officials to reconcile the conflicting interests with which they were faced with regard to the development of this site.  It is quite clear that they were under considerable pressure because of the demands, and the justifiable demands, for the erection of civic offices for the staff.  It is also quite clear that they had regard to the importance of this site from its cultural, historical, archaeological, traditional and artistic interests, having spent considerable sums on the acquisition of the site, they made the site available for the National Museum for excavation and examination so that this part of our heritage should not be completely lost. I think they were placed in an impossible position in attempting to reconcile these conflicting interests and that they have acted responsibly throughout.  This is a view I think not only shared by me but by all the witnesses in this case and I think it is only right that, at the beginning and independent of this judgment, I express this view.</P>
    <P>People should keep that statement by the judge concerned in their minds.  I would ask this House and all who have interested themselves in the case to bear the judge's remarks in mind and weigh <Col N="650" /> them against the bitter criticism which has been levelled at Dublin Corporation from many quarters and from some of whom we had a right to expect a fairer and more balanced assessment of this very complex case.  As to the judgment itself, having carefully considered the evidence, Mr. Justice Hamilton said that he was satisfied that the area between the City Wall, Fishamble Street, John's Lane and Winetavern Street was a national monument within the definition of the National Monuments Act, 1930. He went on to state:</P>
    <P>In so saying I am not expressing any view one way or the other whether other interests, commercial or economic may not require this site. In my opinion it is not a matter for this court to express any view one way or the other on this matter.  This is a responsibility which has been placed on the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland by the National Monuments Act of 1930.</P>
    <P>The judge was referring to section 14 of the Act under which the commissioners may, in certain circumstances, consent to the removal of or interference with a national monument.  In the case of a national monument owned by a local authority&mdash;this was mentioned by Senator Robinson this morning&mdash;as, in this case, the consent must be joint consent in writing of the Commissioners and the local authority concerned.  Many people may have thought and indeed some may still think that once the court has declared the site to be a national monument that is the end of the matter. There is quite a lot of confusion on this point.  I hope this morning to broaden this matter so that people will get a clearer picture.</P>
    <P>If the Oireachtas had intended that the courts should have the final say, the Act would have been framed accordingly. But the Houses of the Oireachtas in enacting this legislation clearly recognised that there could be other considerations apart from historical, archaeological, and so on, in the importance of a monument which might require, in the national interest, that a monument should not be preserved and they made provisions accordingly in this <Col N="651" /> Act.  I hope that clarifies the whole position regarding the court proceedings at the time.</P>
    <P>I should also say here that the judge concerned never mentioned preservation. He has been misquoted in the press on a number of occasions about this particular point.  The records of the court proceedings are there for everyone to examine. I will be very careful in saying&mdash;lest I confuse the whole issue again&mdash;at no time did the judge mention the word &ldquo;preservation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the High Court, the Dublin City Manager asked the Commissioners to join, with the corporation, in consenting to the removal of the national monument to enable the corporation to proceed with their contract for the erection of civic offices.  The Commissioners had to decide whether there were good and sufficient reasons to accede to this request and, if so, subject to what conditions, if any.  In other words, the Commissioners had to review all the other factors or considerations which had a bearing on the case but which Mr. Justice Hamilton had ruled were outside the jurisdiction of the court.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the factors involved and which we, as Commissioners, had to take into consideration.  There are four major factors to be considered by the Commissioners in their approach to this issue.  I hope that everyone will appreciate our position, the position of the corporation and everyone involved, but most certainly where my Department are concerned.  First, there is the urgent need for offices for the staff of Dublin Corporation who are at present widely dispersed in substandard accommodation throughout the city; secondly, there is the money which has already been invested by the corporation in the proposed building scheme for Wood Quay; thirdly, there is the problem of deciding what exactly do people want preserved at Wood Quay and how can this be done?  Lastly, what portion of the site has been completely excavated? Would a court hold that it still constituted part of a national monument? Everyone should bear in mind that excavation has been going on for a long number of years.  I hope that everybody <Col N="652" /> who speaks here this morning will have visited the site, which might help when discussing it and when a final decision will have to be made.</P>
    <P>Let me first deal with the need for new offices and review the efforts which Dublin Corporation have made over a long period to meet this need.  I hope what I say will enlighten Senator Martin further on the question of sites.  The necessity to provide centralised offices for their staff first became apparent to Dublin Corporation in or around the year 1901.  Various attempts were made over the following 50 years to provide such offices.  In 1951 the corporation set up a special committee to examine the problem.  In 1955 this committee, having satisfied itself that central offices were necessary to meet the needs of both the general public and the staff, came to the conclusion that, of the various sites they had investigated, the site at Wood Quay&mdash;which we are at present discussing&mdash;was the only one that satisfied all the requirements.  The committee's report was adopted by the corporation who then took steps to acquire the site.</P>
    <P>Last evening somebody seemed to misinterpret the position, that the corporation had just picked Wood Quay site and that was that.  That is totally wrong.  I hope later in my speech to give further information about this.  This is on record for anybody who wants to see it. That committee searched Dublin for a convenient site for the building and let no one say otherwise, as I think was stated here last evening.  The site was acquired on a compulsory purchase order which was the subject of a public inquiry at which persons objecting to the proposals were offered an opportunity to make their views known.  It is worth noting that no objections on archaeological grounds were received to the making of the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The acquisition of all the property covered by the order was completed in 1967.  A public competition was held in 1967 seeking proposals for the development of the site for offices.  In the brief prepared for the competition by the corporation reference was made to the possibility of archaeological finds on this site.  The plans and models submitted under the competition were put on public display at the City Hall for a period of six months.  The winning entry was selected by the board of assessors, which included experts of international repute, as the most suitable for its treatment of the archaeological, environmental and functional qualities demanded by the project.  Certain objections were lodged to the granting of planning permission for the selected scheme.  But, after an oral hearing held on 6 May 1971, the then Minister for Local Government granted planning permission for the scheme.  In 1973, however, the Department of Local Government intervened and asked Dublin Corporation to review the scheme, as a result of which it was decided to relocate the office blocks on the eastern side of the site so that the view of Christchurch Cathedral would be preserved.  It was clear from my investigations into this matter that the fullest publicity was given by Dublin Corporation at all times to the proposal to develop new civic offices on the site. They gave the National Museum every facility to carry out archaeological investigations at the site.  It was not until after the museum had vacated the site in 1976 and informed the corporation that they were finished, that the corporation decided to go ahead with the building scheme.  This is also on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation gave public notice of the invitation of tenders in May 1977 and a contract was placed in October 1977 for the construction of blocks 1 <Col N="654" /> and 2 of what would eventually be a four-block complex.  It was after&mdash;I must emphasise this&mdash;the placing of the contract, in November 1977, to be exact, that the Commissioners of Public Works were approached by Fr. Martin, acting on behalf of the Friends of Medieval Dublin, with a request for the making of a preservation order.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these facts any fair-minded person must agree with His Lordship, Mr. Justice Hamilton, that Dublin Corporation had acted most responsibly throughout this whole affair in trying to reconcile the conflicting interests with which they were faced.  They were, indeed, placed in an impossible position, as His Lordship said.  Since very few people who are now campaigning for the preservation of the site have recognised this, I personally want to pay a very special tribute to the City Manager, to his officials and to the members of the City Council for the cooperation afforded to me and members of my staff during this whole discussion on Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>The question then about which many people are talking is that of alternative sites.  I would like to talk about that for a little while.  The motion before the House calls on the Government to make an order to preserve indefinitely the Viking Site at Wood Quay in view of the many other sites in Dublin available for civic offices.  This statement that suitable alternative sites are readily available has been promoted by various people since this controversy developed but no one has yet satisfied me that there is a viable alternative to the Wood Quay site as a means of providing the much needed accommodation for corporation employees within a reasonable time.  One suggestion was that the Irish Life Assurance Company would be willing and able to provide accommodation.  My information is that Irish Life has no suitable site available for such a scheme and have themselves made no such suggestion. Even if they had, it would take years to plan and contract for the erection of the offices and, of course, the Irish Life Company is no fairy godmother.  Their first responsibility is to their own investors. It is the ratepayers and taxpayers who would have to meet the high <Col N="655" /> rents which would inevitably be charged.</P>
    <P>A second suggestion was that an approach be made to CIE to rent the offices which they are hoping to build as part of a central transportation complex near the Halfpenny Bridge.  Considering that CIE own only a fraction of the site for the proposed complex, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that they will be able to acquire the remainder within a reasonable time, if at all, this suggestion can only be misleading to the general public.</P>
    <P>The second factor to which the Commissioners must have regard is the money which Dublin Corporation has already invested in the site.  To date, the corporation has invested over £3 million in the site, covering site acquisition, demolition works, site clearance, fees and payments to the building contractor. Abandonment of the project at this stage could involve them in expenditure of over £3 million involving the acquisition of a new site, fees for redesigning the building on the new site and compensation to the contractor in respect of the contract for the Wood Quay site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>They could recover that money by having it a national monument, and the Hotels Federation established that in their study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator I will deal with that too before I finish. Some people may feel that this is a small price to pay for the preservation of a national monument.  It is easy to say that a value cannot be put on our cultural heritage but, for better or for worse, a value has to be put on such items from time to time when hard decisions have to be made.  Unlike those whose functions it is to tender advice, those of us who are charged with accounting for public funds are constantly faced with responsibility for evaluating the many choices which come before us for financial support. The Commissioners of Public Works have to settle priorities in relation to the preservation and protection of national monuments throughout the country and the costs which would be involved in preserving this one monument at Wood Quay, even allowing this was possible, would be equivalent to <Col N="656" /> three or four times their annual budget for national monuments which is currently around £1 million.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed that Wood Quay is unique.  Is it?  I do not want to be misinterpreted about this but I am trying to place before Senators the position that I am in in making the decision and what I have to take into consideration before a final decision is made on this.  Wood Quay is now part of a much wider area which formed the original Viking and later medieval settlement.  Are we then to preserve the entire area encompassed by the walls of the old city?  Can we stop at the city walls?  What about the settlements which grew up outside the walls and which would also qualify as a national monument?  What about other Viking settlements around the coast such as Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick?  Is Wood Quay to be preserved at the expense of these?  These are the hard facts with which I and the Government must gamble in deciding on the issue.  That must be kept in mind because it is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>There was evidence on oath that the earthen fortifications are unique at that point.  They are not reproduced elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with the question of preservation versus excavation. Here, again, I will give the facts, the dates, so that if anyone wishes to contradict me later, I will be able to give them the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the vexed question of preservation versus excavation which has been the subject of much debate among archaeologists and the public at large.  As I have indicated already, the staff of the National Museum have been carrying out archaeological excavations at Wood Quay and adjoining sites since 1962.  But it is only within the past 12 months or so that the idea of preserving any part of the area, apart from the old stone city wall, on a permanent basis has been seriously promoted.  That is worth remembering.  Since 1962 excavations have gone on and now, at this stage, we are talking about preservation.  I will have to deal with that, too, of course. Neither the National Monuments Advisory <Col N="657" /> Council nor any other party requested the Commissioners of Public Works to take such action until 27 November 1977&mdash;in other words, after the contract for blocks one and two had been placed&mdash;when Fr. Martin wrote to the Commissioners on behalf of the Friends of Medieval Dublin asking them to designate the first Viking fortification, sometimes described as the Viking bank at Wood Quay, as a national monument. On the following day the Honorary Secretary of the National Monuments Advisory Council wrote to the Commissioners stating that the standing committee&mdash;and I emphasise the standing committee and not the full council&mdash;had decided to recommend to the Commissioners that a temporary preservation order be placed on the area surrounded by the city wall, Fishamble Street and John's Lane.  The letter stated that the purpose of such an order would be to enable excavation and examination to continue of the stone city wall of the Viking period, the earthen banks and palisades and the presumed site of St. Olaf's church and to prevent damage occurring to it, or destruction of part of the Viking medieval defences of the town already exposed.  On the 27 January&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator Robinson, although I was tempted on many occasions because she was talking about something which was really happening and planned.  I am afraid Senator Robinson must not have studied the matter or had any contact with the local <Col N="658" /> authority, or the people responsible.  I am afraid the Senator has not.  I am not going to make this a political issue. Every effort has been made to bring me into the field of making this a political issue but I have no intention of doing so.  I have resisted it so far and I make no comment about the documents issued by the Labour Party and the views that the Senator held before the document was issued.  I am not going to get involved in a political field.  This is a very serious matter and I am very careful as to what I say or do in this context.  The Honorary Secretary again wrote to the Commissioners stating: &ldquo;The Council consider that further archaeological excavation was needed and recommended that no mechanical excavation or development works take place until the archaeological excavation of the whole of the area referred to as area 2 in the court proceedings and the site of block 2 of the proposed civic offices has been satisfactorily completed&rdquo;. The House will note the strain&mdash;until archaeological excavation has been satisfactorily completed.  This was my job and this was the advice coming to me.  Therefore, I had to ensure that a site would be properly excavated on the advice of people appointed by the National Museum to advise me.  At this stage the council were still concerned in the main that archaeological excavation be undertaken before the building of the civic offices proceeded.  The council also recommended that the Commissioners have an expert examination conducted as to the feasibility of having the earthen banks preserved in or under buildings planned by the Dublin Corporation.  Up to this point the advice of the council was unambiguous.  They were pressing for a thorough archaeological investigation of the site and there was the reference to the feasibility of preserving the earthen banks in or under the proposed offices examined.  They were not opposing the erection of the civic offices as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the High Court declaration, however, an element of doubt began to appear in the advice emanating from the National Monuments Council.  In a letter dated 18 July 1978 the Honorary Secretary again wrote to the Commissioners at the behest of the Standing <Col N="659" /> Committee recommending (1) that cognisance should be given under section 15 subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the National Monuments Act, 1930, for any actions which would lead to the demolition of any part of the monument or the destruction of archaeological evidence; (2) that there should be a phased archaeological excavation of the site designed to recover the fullest information; and (3) that consideration be given to the permanent conservation of the monument and its environment.  These recommendations were reported in a further letter dated the 8 September 1978.  Again at the behest of the Standing Committee of the Council. How were the Commissioners to interpret these recommendations?  How could they reconcile the apparently conflicting recommendation?  If a phased archaeological excavation was to be undertaken, it must be authorised by way of a joint consent under section 14 of the Act.  If the monument was to be preserved how could it be simultaneously excavated to recover the fullest information? An attempt has been made in recent days to explain that excavation does not necessarily mean destruction, and cases at Newgrange have been cited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Newgrange was mentioned. I would suggest that people who want to know anything about Newgrange would consult with a very eminent person in the field of archaeology, one who has the admiration of his fellow archaeologists in this country, Professor O'Kelly, a person who is responsible for Newgrange, and I would suggest that they discuss Newgrange with him.  He will be only to delighted to give all the information that is now being sought by people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly are we being asked to preserve at Wood Quay?  A monument is defined in the National Monuments Act as including any artificial or partly artifical building structure, or erection whether above or below the surface of the ground and whether affixed or not affixed to the ground stone and any cave, or other natural product whether <Col N="660" /> forming part of or attached to the ground which has been artificially carved, sculptured, or worked upon, or which appears to have been purposely put or arranged in position and any prehistoric or ancient tomb, grave or burial deposit.  Mr. Justice Hamilton declared a certain area at Wood Quay to be a national monument.  What structures were present on the Wood Quay site which qualify it for designation as a national monument?  First, there were the old stone city walls.  These were very important.  This wall is being preserved by the corporation, and provision was made for this in the building plans long before the Friends of Medieval Dublin interested themselves in the site.  We must be very fair in this whole matter. Long before anybody intervened, or made suggestions, Dublin Corporation had this very important aspect of the monument in mind and had plans for its preservation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the earthen banks. The Commissioners were advised that it would be extremely difficult, if not altogether impossible, to preserve these in the Wood Quay situation once they had been fully exposed.  Even, however, if it were practical to preserve them, how could one recover the fullest information about the construction of a bank without having fully and thoroughly excavated it, and this would inevitably lead to its removal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Large cuttings had been made by the Museum right through these banks in the course of their investigations and no one raised any objection to it.  Why did it suddenly become so important to preserve them after the Museum had left the site and the corporation had placed a contract for the civic offices?  The remaining structures which have created the most interest were the remains of the post and wattle houses of different periods.  The <Col N="661" /> foundations are stratified one above the other and, to get at the lower ones, the upper ones must be completely removed. To talk of preserving these structures and, at the same time, excavating them to acquire the fullest information about them is to my mind a contradiction, if not an impossibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator consider rock bottom to be a national monument?  Furthermore, there would be difficulty in trying to preserve timber structures which began to deteriorate as soon as they were exposed to the air. The preservation of such timbers can, in some instances, be effected in laboratory conditions but, even there it is a time consuming and expensive process.  With regard to preservation <i>in situ</i>, however attractive a proposition, the fact is that the museum staff have removed any timbers which they think are worth preserving for such treatment as they can manage to afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about the timber structures, and anybody who has seen Wood Quay will know what I am talking about.  I have information&mdash;here, again, from someone who is very eminent in the field of archaeology&mdash;that we can remove the timber structures and have them put through chemical processing, a very costly operation, and then, I understand&mdash;and I am waiting for confirmation of this&mdash;the timber structures could only be preserved for about ten years. <Col N="662" /> Here again, and I can quote the person concerned and anybody in the field of archaeology who wants to contradict this, can take the matter up with Professor O'Kelly who is an eminent archaeologist of international standing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator can take it up with the gentleman in question.  He has lectured and read papers to a number of meetings and conferences abroad attended by the most eminent of European archaeologists.  He has explained and defended his findings in relation to Newgrange and many other monuments and has been most successful.  Even the members of the National Monuments Advisory Council have the highest regard for his views on these matters.</P>
      <P>The first ever destruction of a national monument has been mentioned.  What about High Street and the remainder of the Wood Quay site?  Many monuments are of national importance because of the knowledge of archaeology which would be expected to be obtained from them by excavation.  In such cases the monuments would be destroyed or abandoned following excavation, as was done in High Street, and has already been done on the major part of the Wood Quay site.  This is why, no doubt, the Friends of Medieval Dublin did not seek a declaration from the courts that the area of Wood Quay already excavated is a national monument.  It no longer is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not all excavated. It was destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>It had to be by excavation. References have been made to other archaeological sites as an example of what should be done at Wood Quay. Places such as York in England, Aarhus in Denmark, Trondheim in Norway have been mentioned.  The fame of York rests mainly on a Gothic cathedral, bigger than any church in Ireland, many miles of city walls and medieval houses which are in continuous use at present. The Viking site in York at Coppergate is a relatively minor feature of the city <Col N="663" /> similar to the site at Wood Quay, which is being excavated by the York Archaeologist Trust to a fixed deadline and will be built on at the end of that time for a shopping centre.</P>
      <P>In the case of Aarhus, full excavation of the site was also the policy followed. A model of the site will be exhibited in an on-site museum, as is planned for Wood Quay, except that the museum at Aarhus is much smaller.</P>
      <P>I shall avail of this opportunity now because very little publicity has been given to the museum&mdash;I think it was Senator Dowling who mentioned it&mdash;to say that I have been amazed by the number of people I have met and asked if they had seen Dublin Corporation's plans regarding the building of a museum.  I have seen the blueprint and have been very impressed.  Framed within that blueprint is a stone city wall preserved, all the information found properly compiled to be shown in the museum for the people of Dublin to come in read and view the artifacts. What more, and I say this without talking about the decision that will eventually be made on this, can one expect from Dublin Corporation?</P>

I anticipated that certain things would be said and so I tried to prepare myself for them.  Criticism of the manner in which excavation has been carried out has received a lot of publicity and I want to clarify the position.  There have been calls for sufficient time to allow a long-term, unhurried excavation of the site and it has been suggested that, since the National Museum first commenced their excavation at Wood Quay and adjoining sites, they have been working under the threat of the bulldozers. <Col N="664" /> If this were the case, why did we not hear of it before now?

      <P>I will comment on this.  I had occasion to discuss this point with members of the National Monuments Advisory Council a week ago and this claim was emphatically denied by the former director of the National Museum who was intimately connected with the excavations over a long period.  When the museum decided to terminate their investigations in 1976 the corporation offered further time, if they desired it. Does that sound as though the bulldozers were waiting to move in?  Why should the members of Dublin Corporation offer further time again to the National Museum for excavation?  Surely I have to nail this lie here and now.</P>
      <P>I visited that site recently.  I saw no bulldozer in there.  I discussed the matter with the two people appointed by the National Museum as to how things were going.  They were quite satisfied.  They were under no pressure from anybody. They were not aware of a final decision to be made.  I informed them there and then that if more time was needed that this would be forthcoming, certainly from us and from Dublin Corporation.  I have to nail this lie.  There is no question whatsoever of a bulldozer on the heels of the people who are excavating the site at Wood Quay.  This is utterly wrong, and I want to contradict this now and I fear no contradiction of what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the time of the present controversy, the National Museum attracted high praise and commendation from archaeological interests in Ireland and abroad for the fine work they were doing in the Wood Quay area.  I have the fullest confidence in the professional competence of the staff who are engaged in the present investigations and in the manner in which they are undertaking <Col N="665" /> their task.  As a result of my recent meeting with the National Monuments Advisory Council, I am satisfied that my confidence is shared by members of the council.  Many archaeological digs are undertaken but I will not deal with that matter because I do not want to take up much of the House's time.</P>
    <P>Another very important point is the extent of the site.  Senator Robinson was talking about this this morning.  To clear up any doubts about the extent of the area which has been the subject of much controversy I will explain the exact position as of now.  First, the area which was declared by Mr. Justice Hamilton to be a national monument covers less than half the site owned by Dublin Corporation at Wood Quay.  Second, less than half of the national monument itself is affected by the plans for the civic office. Therefore, the proposed building, that is blocks 1 and 2, would occupy less than one-quarter of the entire Wood Quay site.  The remaining half of the monument area would be available either for preservation as it stands, or for excavation and preservation as an archaeological park, if somebody can formulate a viable proposition along these lines which would be acceptable to Dublin Corporation who, I am sure, would be sympathetic to the idea.  I hope I have clarified the position.  This is very important and has also been misinterpreted.</P>

      <P>In regard to the area directly affected by the scheme for the civic offices, the greater portion has already been carefully and scientifically excavated by the staff of the National Museum with due regard for all archaeological factors.  As I said in the Dáil last week, and again in the course of a radio interview the following day, I will do my best to ensure that the remainder of the building site is thoroughly and scientifically investigated to the satisfaction of the museum staff who, because of their intimate knowledge of the site, are the best qualified to advise in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have invited the National Monuments Advisory Council to meet me on Friday, 8 December 1978 so that I can consult with them and get their further opinions before I make my final recommendations to the Government, which I hope to do in the next week.  Whatever decision is made is unlikely to satisfy everybody, but I hope all reasonable minded people will accept it as a fair and sensible solution to a very complex and controversial problem.  I have given the House the facts.  It is very important, especially for the general public, to know exactly what is being done at Wood Quay.  Those who are making up their minds as to what should be done should have a very balanced account of the whole question.  I hope that Senators will keep this important fact in mind.  I came into the Office of Public Works only one-and-a-half years ago.  I had to study the whole position with regard to Wood Quay.  I have gone to everyone who would be able to offer me professional advice.  I am satisfied with what is going on at Wood Quay at the moment.  I have the highest praise for and confidence in the archaeologist, appointed by the National Museum, who is working on the site.  I know he will not fail the people of Dublin in providing the necessary artifacts <Col N="667" /> or any information that would be required from him.  So once again I say here that I have avoided making this a political issue.  I have read statements I could have very easily gone back over and contradicted but I hope that after this three hour debate once and for all both sides of the picture will be given to the people of Dublin, to the Senators and to the Members of the Dáil so that everybody will have a very practical approach to this very complex question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister intervened just before I spoke but much of what he said did throw badly needed light on the situation. I voted last week for Senator Martin's motion that the item be discussed there and then because in my view the sooner it was discussed the better and because in principle I would vote for any move to get Private Motions discussed. Unfortunately I was not able to accede to Senator Martin's request to me earlier on that I put my name to the motion because, as the motion is phrased, I could not accept it on those terms and because I do not see the issue as a clear-cut one, as clear-cut, for example, as the very dramatic kind of alternatives posed to us by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I must say that Senator Martin put his case very reasonably.  It was, as I understood it, an argument for compromise and above all it was marked by a moderate tone which is very badly needed in this discussion.  Perhaps the one thing that I disagree with was his suggestion that if the Government take a certain decision then academics are prepared literally to flatten themselves before the bulldozers.  If we are to have law and order, then if Governments decide, ultimately citizens must obey, and it does not matter whether the people who will not obey are subversives or academics or whatever.  So, that suggestion has undertones of anarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us here is an archaeologist. We all speak, as St. Paul says, &ldquo;as one less wise&rdquo;.  My own discipline, however, is closely related to archaeology, and in UCC history and archaeology are cognate departments.  We have joint students at postgraduate level and I myself <Col N="668" /> have edited for some 14 years a journal of history and archaeology.  I have, then, some considerable contact with archaeologists and I say this not to claim an expertise in this field because modern archaeology is a very arcane discipline indeed, but I mention these facts in order to establish my own good faith and my own concern for our heritage.  In this regard I share Senator FitzGerald's and Senator Robinson's concern that our national monuments code be suitably revised.  I also want to make it quite clear that those of us who do not see eye to eye with the Wood Quay lobby have no intention of letting ourselves be branded as mindless vandals bent on the destruction of the national heritage.  I deprecate the simplistic alignment that we have seen in this discussion, in the correspondence columns of our national newspapers and latterly in the abusive rantings of a prominent political columnist.</P>
    <P>The controversy over Wood Quay is not a black and white issue.  It is not simply the classic conflict between environment and progress or even the needs of the citizens <i>versus</i> the desirability of preservation, but it is as well a conflict among experts.  As the Minister has just now confirmed, the National Monuments Advisory Council is by no means unanimous on Wood Quay.  The opinions of various foreign archaeologists have been cited here.  I must say, without wishing to sound insular, that I am not impressed all that much by what foreign archaeologists have to say.  If our own learned classes cannot decide what is and what is not to be preserved I do not think we should have any great regard for what European experts have to say.  We had some evidence in the last couple of days how dearly Europeans love us.  It is very easy for foreign archaeologists to tell us to preserve this and to preserve that, since they do not have to worry about our financial problems.  They are not concerned with our municipal needs.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, there is, then, much confusion, much conflict, much ambivalence about what should be preserved and what could be conserved. There is a certain element of vagueness in Senator Martin's motion in this <Col N="669" /> regard.  The vagueness stems originally from the High Court judgment which defines an &ldquo;area&rdquo; to be a national monument. Much can be said for the view that that judgment if not bad law is certainly bad archaeological sense.  It is very difficult to see how an &ldquo;area&rdquo; can be a national monument, in contradistinction, say, to a solid entity like the Rock of Cashel, or Newgrange which is in the nature of a single monument.  The Wood Quay site is an area of ground within which lie a series of fragmentary pieces of individual structures.  Any one of these structures&mdash;arguably, all of them collectively&mdash;could be national monuments, but if you excavate them, if the archaeology is extracted from them, then how is the area of ground remaining to be regarded as a national monument?  It is in this sense that the area was described as &ldquo;a hole in the ground&rdquo;, a blunt statement, perhaps even an offensive statement of a very forthright man&mdash;and a man whom I am very pleased to have as friend and colleague, Professor M.J. O'Kelly of UCC, an archaeologist with a distinguished international reputation and not least, by the way, in Scandinavia, the home of the Vikings.  I was very glad to hear the Minister defending and praising Professor O'Kelly.</P>
    <P>The conflicting demands of excavation and preservation <i>in situ</i> present an inescapable dilemma.  Only the stone wall can be preserved <i>in situ</i> and that has already been agreed upon.  The other structures present formidable problems. In regard to the earthen works or mud banks, once you excavate the archaeology in order to find out what is in them and establish their relationship one to the other, then what you are left with is what the archaeologists call &ldquo;spoil&rdquo;.  Putting them back is nonsense from the archaeological point of view.</P>
    <P>What has been done at Newgrange has been cited as a precedent but in fact Newgrange is 95 per cent stone, both tombs and mounds.  What was excavated at Newgrange was the collapse of stone from the mound on to the ground and that was put back where it belonged originally.  There is no problem there of preservation.  What was done in <Col N="670" /> Newgrange or in places like Holy Cross is no guide for low mud banks at Wood Quay.  You are going to run into difficulties no matter what you do with these mud banks.  If you build over them, they are going to dry up and crumble.  If they remain exposed, they will wash away.  If they are covered with earth, they become invisible.</P>
    <P>The timber structures also present formidable problems about preservation <i>in situ.</i>  Timber is there for a thousand years, waterlogged in an environment where there is no air and oxygen and you take it up, you extract the archaeology, and suddenly it is exposed to what is called aerobic environment&mdash;exposed to decay in various forms, and what are you going to do about that?  You can, it is argued, impregnate the timber with chemicals.  Suppose you try to reconstruct timber posts <i>in situ</i> with half of them sticking up from the ground and half of them under ground, you are going to have enormous difficulties&mdash;problems of expensive preservative chemicals, apparatus to inject them with&mdash;constant skilled supervision, and in the end a life of perhaps five to ten years.  As the Minister has said, the same problem arises with stratified layers of material.  Which of them do you preserve?  You can, of course, preserve timber&mdash;sections of timber, examples of timber, in carbo-wax, effectively substituting the wax element for the water element in the timber, but this can only be done in a museum context, so to speak for demonstration purposes.  It cannot be done as a form of reconstruction.  You can also usefully show cross-sections of timber to illustrate carpentry details and so on&mdash;this has been done in the National Museum and in the Cork Museum. Beyond that it is very difficult to see how you can preserve such structures <i>in situ.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister has reminded us that Wood Quay is only part of medieval Dublin.  In fact, stretching in both areas&mdash;east and west&mdash;we have cleared areas where there are no financial commitments already made and where, arguably, you could experiment further at reasonable cost to the taxpayer.  I must say, however, I have my doubts about whether archaeological grants are <Col N="671" /> wisely expended on endless experiment, endless repetition.  If you dig up 100 bone combs in Viking Dublin, what do you want another 100 for?</P>
    <P>The sensible solution will have to be a compromise and I think Senator Martin has seen this already.  Of course, preserve sections of timber but beyond that if you really want to explain Wood Quay to the people of Ireland and to the tourist&mdash;I do not accept that you can project tourist numbers or revenue&mdash;if you want to make it attractive and if you want to make it educational and instructive, then you make large scale models of different dating horizons, using modern materials, using a site museum, photographs, reconstructed drawings and all the rest.  There are examples of this all over the Continent: in a place called Biskupin in Poland there were roughly comparable problems of preservation of perishable materials and this is the kind of solution they came up with. It can be far more instructive for your native or your tourist to look at this kind of mixed presentation&mdash;the phrase of Senator Martin&mdash;rather than gazing vacantly at bits of timber on the ground or in the ground.  All this should be compatible with a low scale building on the site which provides visual access to Christchurch.  This would mean that £3½ million of ratepayers' money would not be poured down the Liffey.  If further money is injected into Wood Quay in terms of archaeological grants, it is going to deprive sites outside Dublin of their proper funding.  How much did the rest of the country get last year in comparison with what was expended on Wood Quay?  In terms of archaeological objectives, at least as important as Wood Quay is the job of building up for ourselves an archaeological bird's eye view of medieval Ireland, which can only be done by a widespread system of digs all over the country for which money is badly needed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to conclude by drawing attention to some unpleasant features of this Wood Quay campaign. Of course, one can understand the citizen's disquiet at what has been happening in Dublin over the last five to ten years, the destruction and decay of <Col N="672" /> Dublin.  One can understand that the citizen's disquiet has come to focus on Wood Quay, so it is a symbol.  It is a <i>ne plus ultra</i> attitude.  So you have the march and that type of thing.  I would not make too much of the march.  Its significance has been exaggerated.  On a fine autumn day going on a march is a very pleasant thing to do.  One can exaggerate the significance of the seriousness of commitment of marching citizens.  If the peace marches had had any permanent significance we would have a very different situation now in Northern Ireland.  But where are the peace marches now?  <i>Cá bhfuil an sneachta geal a bhí ann aruraidh?</i>  Wood Quay has come to symbolise and to focus the discontent of the citizens over what has happened in Dublin, but that is no excuse for the extravagant gestures that preceded the autumn march, the extravagent, if not the hysterical denunciation, of all who question the Wood Quay lobby as vandals and clodhoppers.</P>
    <P>The people who are most voluble about Wood Quay are not people who will have to be concerned about going to 29 different offices to pay their rates and so on.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what has been said about the constructive role of the Dublin Corporation. Indeed, if Dublin Corporation did not have the site in the first place, the significance of Wood Quay would never have come to light.  Last but not least I must mention the officials of the National Museum who have been placed in the most invidious position, caught between two fires.  Aspersions have been cast on them which have been scandalous. The circumstances in which they found themselves in the last few weeks and months is the last straw for loyal public servants who have worked for far too long in very difficult conditions.</P>

      <P>As an elected Senator to this House on the Labour panel I have a responsibility to the people and to my trade union&mdash;Irish Local Government and Public Services Union.  People who staff local government buildings have the same right and are entitled to the same dignity as is afforded to people in similar private employment who are protected by the Office Premises Act, 1968. Members of the Local Government and Public Services Union naturally feel dissatisfied when they are obliged to work in conditions which are not satisfactory. Those people do their very best in carrying out their duties under very difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>Dublin city is the capital of Ireland, with the largest problems in relation to housing, roads, water and so on.  We have seen, over the past number of years, dormitory towns rising up like Tallaght, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown, Donaghmede.  People have come in from those areas to make representations.  The corporation built offices scattered throughout the length and breadth of this city and were put under extreme hardship in doing so.</P>
      <P>There is a necessity for one central municipal building in the city.  Cork city took the lead in this.  The people of Cork city have profited well by their foresight in having a proper civic building built.  It is incumbent on all citizens to abide by the decisions of the lawfully and democratically elected Government. While I accept the right to protest, protestors also have the duty to respect the rights of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fair and reasonable compromise <Col N="674" /> has been reached between Dublin Corporation and all interested parties.  It should be understood that Dublin Corporation is paying out £50,000 a week approximately while this is being delayed.  In view of the safeguards being undertaken for the site, the building of civic offices should now be proceeded with without any further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the first rural contributor to this debate.  One would think that it was a problem confined to academics on one hand or to the people of Dublin on the other.  The Minister, for whom I have a certain admiration in a very difficult position, was most unimpressive today in so far as the history relating to Wood Quay is concerned.  In my experience of politics, from what I have heard so far, were it not for the High Court decision we would have a different outlook on Wood Quay altogether.  Indeed, the mind shudders at what was likely to have happened by now were it not for the much quoted Justice Hamilton.  Terrible things could have happened were it not for that High Court decision.</P>
      <P>All people would agree that it is a very important link in the history of this nation. The importance of our national heritage is at stake, but it is not alone for the people of Dublin to have a say in what happens.  This country is not that big, and a find of this kind in Dublin is of interest to people in the provinces.  Up to 12 months ago it could be stated that outside of Dublin there may not have been much interest in Wood Quay, but it became a very lively issue around the country in the past couple of months. Lots of people who have not got an axe to grind with anybody would be very slow to allow a situation to develop where any of the past might be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that since 1901 Dublin Corporation are in the market for new offices.  With the tremendous number of new buildings that have been built in Dublin, particularly in the last 20 years, it is remarkable that an office block capable of housing the officials of Dublin Corporation could not be found.  That does not make sense to me.  I understand that Wood Quay in itself would be a reasonable place to <Col N="675" /> build an office block, but it cannot be the only site in Dublin, and certainly from the point of view of money one could say that if it had been built 20 years ago, it would not be as costly as today.  If somebody does not find a suitable site for it now it will be twice as costly in 10 years time.</P>
    <P>The question of who pays is very important. I believe it will become known as the great blunder if it happens that this Viking site is not preserved for all future generations of Irish people to see and so understand the way the country formed over the centuries.  I am not sure how the tourist value of the site might be regarded.  If it is built up to the type of Wood Quay that I would expect, I would say there would be thousands of people who would want to see it over a certain number of years.</P>
    <P>In reference to what Senator Murphy said about the march, one could say it was a nice fine day for marching, but people do not march around Dublin city for no reason.  I have no doubt that public opinion was such that they were definitely afraid the bulldozers would come in and would flatten the site and leave us in the position that we would be much worse off from a national heritage point of view.  The Minister finds himself in a peculiar position; as he said himself, it is very difficult to please everybody.  It is very important to realise that in this type of business once you destroy something you cannot take it back. Buildings can be costly, but they can be built and sites can be found.  I am sure we could never say that we had arrived at a situation in Dublin where there are no more building sites for offices.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take particular notice of what the ordinary people are beginning to say.  Until now academics got involved in this very heated debate and indeed there were occasions when good sense seemed to be out the window. If the argument is that there is no other place in Dublin to build office blocks, I cannot see how that could possibly be correct: I am sure it is not correct; there must be other places where offices can be built.</P>
    <P>There is anxiety in the country that a proper decision be taken on this so that <Col N="676" /> future generations of Irish men and women will be given the chance to study and acknowledge our heritage and our beginnings.  I hope this or any Government will not become known as the plunderers of our time.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Senator West's decision.  We are all rightly concerned with the preservation of the past.  It is something in which we all take pride, and which traditionally&mdash;perhaps since we have such a vast heritage from the past&mdash;we have taken it a little too much for granted.  It is clear, however from today's debate and the Minister's contribution that we are all concerned about this matter.  It is a question of reaching a sensible balance in the situation&mdash;the needs of our people, balancing the correct cultural need to preserve our traditions and at the same time also the factual position of the living conditions of today, the practical needs and necessities of day-to-day life&mdash;where do we strike a balance between these two conflicting needs? Perhaps the controversy about this matter has helped us to realise the diversity and the depths of our cultural heritage. Nearly the whole country could be designated as a national monument, so rich is it in artefacts and treasures from past ages.</P>
      <P>It is ironic in a sense that we are concerned today with the role of the Vikings in our past.  The word Viking actually means a pirate, and that is the Scandinavian decision on the matter.  It is not an Irish corruption of the word.  Perhaps no other invader in our history was so destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure my colleagues are familiar with Otway-Ruthven's many works on our medieval past and in particular, her history of medieval Ireland and her view <Col N="677" /> that, on balance, the Vikings were a destructive force.  It is ironic that we are today preserving some part of their past.</P>
    <P>I appreciated the very detailed and factual account of the situation which the Minister gave of the matter.  I would like to join in the tributes to Dublin Corporation. They have been very responsible in this matter, and they have not got half the credit they deserve.  Equally, I would like to join with Senator Herbert in regard to the workers who are involved in this and who have been under severe hardship for many years and whose union has always supported activities relating to the preservation of our cultural heritage.  The very responsible attitude of the Local Government and Public Services Union has been at times a little overlooked in all this controversy. It is not only a question of the culture people on one side and the bulldozers on the other.  This is far too simplistic a view of the matter.  We must try to reach a balanced view.  I think the Minister is doing this and I am delighted to hear that he is having further consultations. The suggestions that have been put forward to-date, such as this idea for a museum which&mdash;again I would agree with the Minister&mdash;have not received the attention they should have got.  The idea of a museum is a most imaginative and excellent project and should be a great addition to our cultural heritage here in Dublin.  There are many other things that I would like to say but I do not want to go beyond my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has gone to a great deal of trouble in presenting all the facts and figures as he sees them.  Despite what he has said and despite what Senator Martin has said, it appears to me to be clear and beyond all doubt that our people for one reason or another&mdash;and not only the people of Dublin&mdash;believe that Wood Quay should be preserved in the national interest.  Therefore, we are talking here about the will of the people.  It seems equally clear that some people in Dublin and especially the staff and employees of the Dublin Corporation feel that the time has long since passed for the provision of adequate office accommodation to enable them to carry out properly their <Col N="678" /> duties and functions for the citizens of Dublin.  Personally, I fully appreciate and sympathise with the employees' point of view as expressed in a letter from the Local Government and Public Services Union sent to all Senators and TDs.  As the mover of this motion said, I think we can have it both ways.  There is no conflict in my opinion between these two very desirable objectives.  This is a very happy state of affairs and a rather unique situation for the Government and the corporation to find themselves in. Not always can we have it both ways: we cannot go into the EMS and at the same time stay out of it: we cannot have a national agreement and not have a national agreement at the same time.  In this case we preserve Wood Quay and we can, I think, find an alternative site for the office premises.</P>
      <P>It is not for me, or any Senator, to suggest where the new offices should be built.  I do recollect&mdash;and perhaps some other Senators might bring this to mind also&mdash;that many many years ago when the great mass of the people of Dublin were living in slums, the worst slums on this side of the Suez Canal, a suggestion was made that dwellinghouses should be erected in the Phoenix Park.  Nobody would support this suggestion and the people of Dublin were left to live and die in their slums, in their hovels.  I am not going into the merits or demerits of that decision at the time and I am certainly not suggesting that the new office complex should be erected in the Phoenix Park, but personally if I had a choice between preserving Wood Quay and putting the new offices in the Phoenix Park, I would opt for the Phoenix Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my time is limited, I will not go on for too long.  It seems to me that the real basis of the opposition to this motion is money.  Many references have been made to the possible cost&mdash;personally, I think it is an over-estimate&mdash;of £3½ million for preservation.  I would like to remind Senators that in this House yesterday afternoon in the course of ten minutes, without any opposition from any Senator we voted money running into tens of millions of pounds to Aer Lingus and the Industrial Development Authority.  There was absolutely no opposition to this, and quite rightly so, <Col N="679" /> although we all still realise that these moneys constitute speculation to a high degree in the sense that we may not get a return from these funds that we expect and hope for.  There is a certain amount of risk in that kind of operation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I disagree entirely with Senator Murphy.  We must rely on Europe and what is being done in Europe and in other countries to guide us to some extent in our deliberations. I am reminded of the fact that after the last war Europe lay in ruins and the plight of the people was desperate, yet nevertheless in most European countries one of the first tasks they tackled, despite the terrible situation that everybody was in, was the preservation and reconstruction of old parts of most cities that had been destroyed, including Prague and Warsaw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Wood Quay I can lay claim to some measure of objectivity.  My harrowing experience in relation to the Central Bank building in Dame Street disposes me to sympathy with a public authority urgently in need of new centralised office accommodation and increasingly frustrated by delays, difficulties, controversy and apparently nugatory expenditure.  I confess to a very strong feeling of relief that no Viking remains were uncovered in Dame Street or if they were that they were covered up quietly.</P>
      <P>I have antipathies as well as sympathies arising out of that experience. One should, however, pay a tribute to the tremendous patience and consideration shown by the corporation over the years.  Like most people who have spoken, I am neither an architect nor an archaeologist but I have a layman's interest in archaeology.  I was impressed by the evidence given by so many experts at the High Court hearing which resulted in the &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; designation.  There are many reputable archaeologists and medieval scholars amongst those who are urging preservation or conservation of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view, carefully expressed, is this: if what we have at Wood Quay is not only of national but international significance, as is claimed, it would do irreparable <Col N="680" /> harm to the Government's and Ireland's reputation if we were to destroy rather than conserve whatever experts consider to be the significant elements at Wood Quay relating to Norse and medieval Dublin.  I am not clear as to what exactly these significant elements are.  It would have helped if we had had a model or a large photograph during this debate.  I have been over the site and have been most courteously conducted around it and I confess that I am disturbed by the information that the Minister gave in his very helpful speech that there would be a need to build on somewhat less than half of what has been designated as a national monument. I confess I would be appalled if that meant that the evidence on the ground there, which is most impressive, of habitation and trade 1,000 years ago were obliterated.  While it is important that there should be a museum on the site to house artefacts and models and so on, this may not do what is necessary in the minds of most people to make permanently accessible to the public what is significant there in relation to the past. Much of this is embedded in the ground or consists of earth works.  Not being an expert I am confused as to how far it is possible to preserve that sort of remains. I would be happy to accept the advice of a combination of national and external experts on what we should do.  At one stage I thought that perhaps one could revise the building plans to build over or partly build over these significant remains but my preference is that some way might be found of moving to a new site.  It would greatly add to the beauty as well as interest of Dublin if this slope from the Liffey to Christchurch had more of the aspect of a public park and contained only buildings which housed and exhibited evidence of the long and varied story of the city from the earliest times to our own day.</P>
    <P>I made representations privately to the Government in mid-September on these lines.  My visit to the site reinforces my interest in conservation.  I must say that, while I commend the moderate way in which Senator Martin introduced the motion, I would be entirely out of sympathy with any means of advancing the conservationist view which ran counter <Col N="681" /> to good public order and involved disrespect for the law.  I hope that what the Minister said about the Government and the authorities being ready to consider sympathetically means of preserving the significant elements at the site will, in fact, take place, and that the Government, having considered the report of this debate, will be open to reasonable persuasion in the matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Connaughton said that he was one of the rural speakers speaking on this subject.  I cannot say I am rural but, from outside Dublin looking in and listening to what has been said today, it appears that there is a consensus on certain things which are required. Already part of the site has been designated as a national monument.  I presume that will be preserved.  In an archaeological dig such as this the purpose appears to be to keep digging until you bring all the artefacts out.</P>
      <P>I tend to agree with Senator Murphy that there are certain things which you cannot put back no matter how you try. Therefore, the opinion appears to be that there should be a proper museum to house and display all the artefacts that have been taken out, and that there should be proper models of all that cannot be preserved but of which we want to keep a record.  What can be preserved, such as stone work, should be preserved. Also, the view of Christchurch Cathedral should be maintained where possible.  If those points can be dealt with, then the building of the City Hall in that context should be allowed to go ahead, taking into account the time that the corporation have waited, the necessity for moving quickly and their responsibility to the corporation staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay Senator West more than two minutes. All decisions that have to be taken of this kind come under the influence of certain factors of a particular point in time.  There are two factors here: the human values involved and the archaeological values involved.  I am not an archaeologist and I do not fully understand archaeology.  I just have a feeling for it as any other ordinary, average <Col N="682" /> Irishman and Dubliner would have.  The human values have been debated already.  There are employees who are miserable all over Dublin working in conditions in which we would prefer them not to be working.  They must be put into offices where they can do their jobs effectively.  At the same time we want to preserve or conserve the archaeological values.  So, we are looking for a compromise.</P>
      <P>For me, if the experts and the corporation could prepare and present what is there so that the total impression can be mentally reconstructed with the help of portion of the structures and the artefacts and good models, it would seem to me that the balance of human values and archaeological values would dictate that we should go ahead and build on the site.  That is my view.  As long as the total impression of what it was can be mentally reconstructed by visitors or Irish people through keeping some portion of the structures and displaying the artefacts in the museum and having good models.  I believe that is the best solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>On both sides of the House there has been a considerable emphasis on and feeling for the conservation of our Viking heritage.  This was also expressed by the Minister and it is clear that the corporation officials worry about this.  Really, the question is how we can deal with this site&mdash;what is going to be done?  There is conflict of evidence on how best to preserve the particular artefacts.  I would like to see as much as possible preserved <i>in situ.</i>  That is my first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is that one of the crucial points in the Minister for State's speech was that half of the area currently designated a national monument would be built on.  That is not acceptable to me. There was a conflict of evidence.  The evidence from both sides was presented in a court.  Mr. Justice Hamilton, to whom the Minister of State has referred, had to decide on this conflict and he came down by designating the site, which has already been described, as a national monument.  He had to take a balanced view.  He took that view.  There <Col N="683" /> should be no building on the area designated a national monument.  I hope that the Minister of State can, in his discussions, put forward this view and see if it can be upheld.</P>
    <P>I would go further than this: I would like to see the whole site preserved, more or less as Senator Lambert has outlined. Senator Whitaker also made the point that if there is to be a building it should be a museum and that should be all there would be on the site.  That would be my view.  I do not think that anything more should be done there.  If the decision is otherwise, then no part of the national monument should be built on.  Some low-rise building could be done on the north side of the site, that is the northern edge of the site.  A low-rise building could be erected there without greatly affecting the vista.  It would not be my ideal but some building could be done on the north side.  This would mean resiting the present plans and it would mean a redesign.  I am not an architectural expert but the present plan appears to me to be hideous.  I really think that tower blocks on that site would be a desecration. If there is to be a building, it should be a low-rise, a four-storey or three-storey building on the north side of the site.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some compromise could be effected along these lines.  But it did worry me very much when the Minister said that half the site which is now designated a national monument should be built on.  That should all be preserved and more opinion is needed.  There is a conflict of evidence.  In John Robb's <Col N="684" /> phrase, there are some problems that are too important to be left to the experts. As both Senator Kennedy and Senator Connaughton, who comes from the rural part of the country said, the people have pointed out that there is a great deal of concern.  It would be wrong for the Government to disregard this concern for this national monument.  Governments are here to govern but they are to put into pratice the will of the people and I think the will of the people has been expressed very widely and succintly and has come through fairly clearly in this debate.  There is real fear that a maximum effort on conservation is not going to be made.  The Seanad has given a very broad feeling in favour of conservation. Further compromises are needed.  I hope the Minister of State can go further than the position he has outlined in his speech.  I thought his speech was very helpful because he gave many details which we may not all have been aware of.  But I would feel that the proposal to build on half the site designated a national monument is not an acceptable one to many people.  If there is to be a building there, there should be re-siting and re-design.  That will cost some money but that is inevitable.  Support throughout the House shows that the general feeling is for a move in this direction.</P>
    <P>The debate has been a good one because it has given those many views.  I hope, when the Government come to make their decision they will take this very broad spectrum of view right across the Seanad into full consideration.</P>

    <Title>Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1978    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes several important reforms in the capital gains tax code.  Its main aim is to change that code into a form which, while reinforcing the tax on speculative gains, will take account of the effects of inflation and will not penalise the individual who has spent time and effort in building up a business.</P>
      <P>In his budget statement last February the Minister stated that this Government have never opposed the principle of a tax on capital gains.  The Government, however, do believe that such a tax should not be a global instrument penalising hard work and inhibiting enterprise.  We favour instead a more refined system.  The chief fault in the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, is that it does not make a distinction between gains which are the returns of investment and hard work over the years, and speculation which looks for quick profit and is not concerned with economic input. A second major fault with the 1975 Act is that it does not distinguish between real gain and paper gains resulting from inflation, which means that a person could be taxed on a purely nominal gain when disposing of an asset whereas in real terms he had made a loss on the disposal.  Another deficiency in the 1975 Act is that, where there is a compulsory acquisition of a person's property by a local authority or other body and where that person reinvested the proceeds in comparable assets, he would not only be obliged to give up his property but could also find himself liable for capital gains tax on that involuntary sale, even though payment of the tax could be postponed under the roll-over relief arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before the House, as well as remedying these faults in the existing capital gains tax code, also changes the arrangements governing property passing on a death and the arrangements relating to disposals within the family by persons over 55 years of age.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the individual provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the interpretation section and is self-explanatory.  Section 2 increases the basic rate of capital gains tax from 26 per cent to 30 per cent.  This increased rate will apply in the case of gains arising from disposals of land with development value or mineral assets and, consequentially, to gains from disposals of unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from such land or assets.  In the case of other assets, this 30 per cent will appply to all disposals by companies and to disposals by other taxable persons within three years of the acquisition of the assets in question.  For other disposals, rates less than 30 per cent are provided for in section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 proposes a fundamental reform in the capital gains tax system.  It provides that, in calculating the gain on the disposal of an asset, the allowable expenditure&mdash;such as the cost of the asset <Col N="687" /> and certain enhancement expenditure&mdash;may be adjusted in line with changes in the all items consumer price index between acquisition and disposal. The Minister pointed out in the Dáil three years ago, during the debates on the Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1975, that the lack of any such provision was a basic flaw in that legislation.  The Government do not regard it as either satisfactory or equitable that a capital gains tax charge should arise simply because of an increase in the monetary value of an asset between one given date and another.  In the circumstances of recent years one could easily be in the position of being taxed on a paper gain which was, in fact, a loss.</P>
    <P>This section rectifies this basic fault by providing that any increase in the value of an asset due to inflation as measured by the consumer price index should be taken into account in deciding the real gains consequent on the disposal of that asset.  It is not proposed that the new indexation arrangements will operate in such a fashion as to charge an amount in excess of the monetary gain or to transform a monetary loss into a gain.  Also, the new procedures will not operate so as to increase a monetary loss or transform a monetary gain into an allowable loss.</P>
    <P>In the case of assets held on 6 April 1974, the market value on that date will be the base cost for indexation purposes and for determining any gain arising on a disposal.  Because only the gain since 6 April 1974 will be liable for taxation in the case of disposals of such assets, and since it will be necessary for indexation purposes to obtain a valuation of those assets at that date, in any event, the time apportionment method of determining the gain, which applied hitherto in the case of certain disposals of assets held on that date, is no longer appropriate, and is being abolished.</P>
    <P>A fundamental change in the rate structure of capital gains tax is proposed in Section 4.  The new structure is based on the principle that the rate of tax should be related to the length of time for which an asset is held between acquisition and disposal.</P>
    <P>The Government are firmly of the <Col N="688" /> belief that any capital gains tax should distinguish clearly between the speculator and the genuine entrepreneur or businessman or farmer.  A man who invests his time, effort and money in a business or farm for perhaps 15 or 20 years should not be taxed on the same basis as an individual who simply buys and sells an asset within a short time, relying solely on market forces to produce an increase in the value of the assets involved.</P>
    <P>An appropriate way of discriminating between the two categories in the capital gains tax system is to have the rate of tax depend on the length of the period of ownership.  I think that Senators would agree that the length of ownership of an asset can be regarded, in general, as indicating whether the owner acquired the asset for genuine non-speculative reasons or whether he acquired it in the hope of selling it for a short-term gain as soon as market forces were favourable. Section 4 of this Bill proposes a sliding scale of tax based on this general principle. It provides that there will be a reduction in the rate at which tax will be charged for every period of three years during which an asset has been held prior to the disposal, leading to total exemption after 21 years.  The period of 21 years will run from the date of acquisition of the asset, irrespective of when it was acquired.  This tapering relief will not apply to disposals by companies or to gains arising from disposals of development land or of mineral assets or to gains from disposals of unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from such land or assets.</P>
    <P>A special provision is made in subsection (8) of section 4 which will have the effect of extending the period of ownership of a surviving spouse on the disposal by that spouse of assets which were acquired on the death of the deceased spouse, and of which the deceased spouse was competent to dispose. Thus a widow or widower in such circumstances will be able to take account of the deceased spouse's period of ownership of the assets for the purposes of the tapering relief where such relief applies.</P>
    <P>Section 5 remedies another major deficiency in the 1975 Act by providing <Col N="689" /> a special relief in the case of compulsory acquisition of property if the compensation proceeds received are reinvested in similar or comparable assets.  This relief is introduced for equity reasons and to provide an incentive for reinvestment. The Government believe that a man should not be penalised on the occasion of a compulsory disposal of an asset provided he reinvests the compensation in a similar or comparable asset.  Since he has been forced to sell the asset to a public body it is clearly inequitable to tax him on the basis of a normal sale. The reinvestment condition caters for the situation where a man chooses to use the occasion of the compulsory purchase proceedings to realise his assets in order to achieve a gain.  Such a case will be treated as a normal disposal.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for situations where a sum which is more or less than the amount of the compensation proceeds received is reinvested.  Thus if an amount exceeding the compensation received is invested in the replacement asset, the extra amount will be treated, for the purposes of indexation and tapering relief, as having been invested in the purchase of a new asset.  If, on the other hand, a part of the compensation proceeds is not reinvested there will be a part disposal of the original assets for the purposes of capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends the provisions concerning the transfer of assets on death. Under the 1975 Act, where assets which were acquired on a death are disposed of, the base cost for calculating the chargeable gains was the cost incurred by the deceased owner in acquiring the asset and not the value of the asset at the time of the deceased's death.  This valuation arrangement is open to criticism on a number of grounds.  First, it seems inequitable that a successor should be made liable for capital gains tax on gains arising during a time when he did not own the asset.  Secondly, as a result of this inherited liability, successors who might not have the capacity to use inherited business or farming assets to their best economic advantage could be discouraged from disposing of the assets, thus preventing their acquisition by more active hands.  Thirdly, if the inherited property had to be sold in order <Col N="690" /> to pay debts incurred by the deceased or for other reasons, the imposition of a charge to capital gains tax could cause a financial burden in certain cases.  The new arrangements which are being introduced in section 6 will remove these deficiencies by providing that assets acquired on a death are to be valued by reference to the market value at the date of the death.  Death will continue not to be an occasion of charge to capital gains tax in respect of all assets of which the deceased person was competent to dispose. The special provision I mentioned earlier, which will allow a surviving spouse the benefit of the deceased spouse's period of ownership for tapering rate purposes, will not prevent the surviving spouse from getting the benefit of these new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 7 applies provisions similar to those in section 6 to certain settled property passing on a death.  It provides that, where a person becomes absolutely entitled to assets under a settlement on the death of a life tenant, the assets are deemed to pass at their market value at the date of the life tenant's death and not, as hitherto, at their cost to the trustees of the settlement.</P>
    <P>Section 8 removes a number of restrictions on the availability of the relief provided under section 27 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  Section 27 gave total relief from capital gains tax in the case of disposals of certain business assets on retirement by a parent to a child or, in certain cases, to a niece or nephew, subject to the fulfilment of various conditions.  If the value of the assets transferred exceeded £150,000 the relief was not granted.  It is considered that the existence of this qualifying limit could inhibit some parents from transferring farm or business property to their children during the parents' lifetime. This £150,000 limit is now being abolished and the early transfer of family property into younger and more active hands, which is desirable on both economic and social grounds, is thereby encouraged.</P>
    <P>Another restriction being removed in relation to the section 27 relief is the condition that the parent had to transfer the entire farm or business property to the child.  This condition discouraged <Col N="691" /> transfers where a father wished to hold on to a small portion of his farm for himself while transferring the remainder to his son, or where a father wanted to divide his farm between his children by way of transfers at different dates, say when each child reached a certain age.  It is proposed that the relief may now be given if either the whole, or only part, of the asset is disposed of to the child.</P>
    <P>The third restriction which is being abolished relates to the relief provided by section 26 of the 1975 Act.  Section 26 grants relief in the case of disposals outside the family where the consideration does not exceed £50,000, and prior to this, a person could not avail of it if he was being granted section 27 relief.  This means that up to now the situation where a father wished to sell part of his business or farm for cash outside the family, say to provide for his old age, while transferring the remainder of the property to his children, was not catered for.  Under the provisions of section 8 of this Bill the two reliefs can now apply in any particular case if the other conditions governing their availability are met.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is concerned with the interaction of the new reliefs provided in sections 3 and 4 with the operation of the roll-over relief arrangements contained in section 28 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  Section 9 ensures that the deferment of the charge under roll-over relief will not qualify the owner for indexation and tapering rates based on a period of ownership longer than the period during which he owned the old assets on the disposal of which the original chargeable gains arose.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends the anti-avoidance provisions in section 39 of the 1975 Act concerning disposals to and by charities and certain other bodies in order to bring those provisions into line with the indexation and tapering reliefs.  The exemption given to genuine charities under section 22 of the 1975 Act is not being interfered with.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 provide for amendments of the company tax legislation in the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, to take account of the new basic rate of 30 per cent for capital gains tax provided for in section 2 of this Bill.  Sections <Col N="692" /> 13 and 14 make further technical amendments to the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, to take account of the indexation relief contained in section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 15 extends from 21 days to 31 days the time limit for lodging a notice of appeal against a capital gains tax assessment. This is a technical amendment to bring capital gains tax into line with income tax and corporation tax as respects time limits for giving notice of appeal against assessment.</P>
    <P>Section 16 and Schedule 1 are concerned with the technical details of the operation of the indexation and tapering reliefs contained in sections 3 and 4. Paragraph 6 of the Schedule is an anti-avoidance provision aimed at counteracting the manipulation of the tapering relief by certain shareholders in close companies.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and Schedule 2 provide for the necessary repeals in the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975 and in other legislation as a consequence of the measures proposed in this Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>When the estate duty code was terminated from April 1974 a new set of capital tax measures designed to provide a more just and efficient method in substitution for the old estate duty code was introduced and I would remind the House that no amendments of these substituted measures, including this Bill, should be considered save in the context of the capital taxation which was levied up to April 1974 and which yielded significant revenue to the Exchequer.  Now, though I am left to say it myself&mdash;I cannot, I am afraid, rely on anybody else to say it for me&mdash;in relation to these measures I come with particularly clean hands because I very trenchantly criticised the wealth tax in this House and the wealth tax is now abolised, and I regret it.  I regret its abolition.  I regret the timing of its abolition.  It was capable of reform.  It was not reformed.</P>

    <P>I had very little to say on the Capital (Acquisitions) Tax Bill, now an Act, but I did criticise certain elements of the Capital Gains Tax Bill and there are four substantial amendments effected to that code, or proposed to be effected to <Col N="693" /> that code, in this Bill, which I welcome. If anybody wants to look up the record, he will find I proposed two of them myself in this House when the Capital Gains Tax Bill was going through.  I thought the original provision with regard to capital taxation on death was wrong and would have the effect eventually&mdash;though it did not have the effect in fact to date&mdash;if it were left unreformed, of being a heavier wealth tax than the wealth tax Act itself.  I therefore welcome that change.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the acceptance of what I also proposed in this House&mdash;the indexation of the cost of acquisition in the assessment of what was the taxable gain tax and, in so far as that is there, I welcome it though with some reservation. In so far as I can discern a policy in this Bill, it is a policy to discourage, in the words of the Minister, speculative gains.  To index the costs of the speculator is not to discourage speculative gains.  The only extent to which this Bill, in fact, seeks to discourage speculative gains is by the exclusion of development land from the benefit of tapering relief, but it is included for the purposes of indexation. Now, if it is desired to discourage speculation in development land by depriving the speculator of the benefit of tapering relief in respect of the speculation, I cannot see why we give him a chunk of benefit by indexing his cost.  So, in so far as I welcome indexation as the second of the four items I welcome, I do not welcome its extension to development land.</P>
    <P>I also welcome&mdash;a point I do not think I made when the Bill was originally introduced&mdash;the provision with regard to compulsory acquisition and I note, if I understand the section correctly, that the benefits here do not extend to investment in development land.  The compulsory acquisition provision, if it does not, ought to exclude the investment in development land.  I take it to do so, but closer examination on Committee Stage will tell me whether I am right or wrong on that.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the removal of the limit, though to ordinary urban dwellers striving to earn their daily bread £150,000 sounds a hell of a lot of <Col N="694" /> money.  Still if it be merely a valuation of something which lies at the structure of the whole family earning, to wit, a farm, then I think it is not meaningful in our kind of terms and, therefore, if that is correct, I welcome the lifting of that relief because its limitation does, I agree with the Minister, discourage the gift on from an older person to his children. These are the matters I welcome.</P>
    <P>What I have to say after this is not likely to please the kind of people out of whom I make my income, the kind of people who can see about as far as my nose and back, who are very glad to get any kind of tax relief irrespective of its justice.  I know one cannot get perfection ever in this matter of a just system of taxation.  I know it is immensely difficult to balance the thing out so that at once you have a stimulus which makes the economy more efficient, makes people go about their work and business with energy and, at the same time, does not mean that people in like conditions are treated differently.  The effects of this Bill in so far as it contains changes other than those I welcome will not be to reform&mdash;the word of the Minister&mdash;the capital tax.</P>
    <P>Why do we have capital gains tax? Why did the most successful capitalist economy in the world, however you may criticise the social ambience created by its economic success, America, why did the Americans when they introduced federal income tax in 1915 at the same time introduce capital gains tax?  It was no afterthought by the Americans.  It was a recognition of the extreme difficulty of drawing a line between income and capital, between income in cash and capital gain in cash, both equally spendable, both equally capable of financing some worthwhile investment, some saving, some pleasurable expense.  They introduced capital gains tax at the same time as they introduced income tax because in the free society, and let every Senator know it, there are countless means, as the Revenue Commissioners know, whereby if you have access to capital&mdash;and we are administering a tax code which affects people who have no access to capital of any significance&mdash;which can generate income, there are countless means whereby you <Col N="695" /> can convert that income into capital.  In so far as capital gains tax is being lifted, as assuredly it is being lifted from a whole host, a whole magnitude of capital in this society, we are leaving free from taxation sources of financial expenditure while, at the same time, imposing taxes on people in no similar positions.  One single sentence establishes this.  When this Bill becomes law, as assuredly it will become law, no asset in 1957 by any person resident, or ordinarily resident, in Ireland, other than development land, and let us add mines and minerals and exploitation rights thrown in to stir us, will be subject any longer during the lifetime of the holder of that capital to any capital gains, real or monetary.  That is a change in the law of a very significant kind.</P>
    <P>Now I know that accountants and people of my own profession are only delighted with all of this.  Are we not only delighted, like happy little poodles, to go along and lick our master's toes and hands?  Of course, the possessors of these assets are very pleased.  They can go on and live for another three months, three years, 30 years and pass them on to their children and, on their death, a fresh period of tapering relief will run for their children.  Or have I got all of that wrong?  Is that right?  If I am wrong, will the Minister tell me?  Is it just?  Is the following just?  We have in this country a tax relief, and I had some part, and I am prepared to boast about it, in its being part of our fiscal system, called the export tax relief.</P>
    <P>Take someone who is benefiting from export tax relief&mdash;say all his turnover is export&mdash;that is very good for the economy and long may that relief continue. But it has created a certain anomaly between people and businesses who are engaged in other kinds of activities and people who are engaged in exporting, but it is the kind of anomaly one can live with.  It is reasonably just if we want to reward very heavily those who are engaging in such an important task from the economy's point of view. But, at this moment, before this Bill becomes law, the shareholders in these concerns were at least subject to capital <Col N="696" /> gains tax.  Now their investment will not merely be indexed but there will be tapering relief and the time they have spent since their original investment will count in determining that tapering so that, if they held it for 21 years, they are free of the burden of capital gains tax. Take the very rich man or the modestly rich man.  These matters are all relevant. We know the story of the American who said at breakfast he felt absolutely wretched&mdash;he felt like a millionaire. These are relative matters.  People who can organise their affairs so that they have portfolio investments held in companies, the corporation tax does something to provide for tax in such cases but, unless the income generated brings the company beyond the small company limited&mdash;I have forgotten what it is but it is something of the order of £25,000 or £30,000 a year&mdash;it will still benefit the holder of that portfolio to leave it locked up in a company and the surcharge, if his other income is ample enough and he liquidates the company in due course, will still leave him with a margin over the 60 per cent he would have had to pay if he were enjoying the income himself.  The man who works as an executive and so on will have to pay the 60 per cent.  I do not see the justice in that.  I do not see the benefit to the economy in it.  It is dead money.  I know, the Minister and his advisers know and Senators know that one of the factors we have to take into account in relation to this kind of taxation is in the words of Lord Keynes&mdash;he may not have been a lord at the time&mdash;to Mrs. Roosevelt: &ldquo;Tell your husband money is timid&rdquo;.  It is.  But really it was not all that timid.  It would have been satisfied with indexation which is fair, which arguably should be extended to cover bands and allowances.</P>
    <P>I do not think it was a happy thing&mdash;I do not know whether it was not in some way significant&mdash;that the Bill which contains these changes and these reliefs and improvements for the very well off should take away the one section in the Capital Gains Tax Act which applied to those who were not well off.  There was one section specifically designed in the 1975 Act to help the man with the modest income and the happy <Col N="697" /> beneficiary of a windfall gain.  It was section 6&mdash;the half income group.  The authors of that section being the designers of the UK Finance Act, 1965, decided this year just about the time the Minister was preparing his budget proposals that this was not well understood and, therefore, the original authors decided to destroy their creation and we, who hopped along and imitated them when we introduced the provision, hopped along again, to imitate them in destroying their creation.  I would ask the House to take note of the fact that, if the British took away that exemption in this year, they did it in the context of a very considerable increase in the exemptions. Here we have an exemption of £500 of gains.  If I remember the UK provision correctly, it was a different position before.  It was a £1,000 realisation figure, not a gain as such before. Now a gain in the UK can stretch up to £9,500 and get marginal relief so, if they took away the half income rule, they substituted something better for it.  We are taking it away and not substituting anything for it.  I find it hard to see great justice in that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he is against speculative gains and in favour of long-term investments.  I said the only evidence I can find for that in this Bill is the non-application of tapering relief to development land, minerals, exploration and exploitation, and, of course, companies representing these.  Has nobody been speculating in property in Dublin in the last 12 months?  Nobody?  Have people not gone into that market with their money?</P>
    <P>Tapering relief is to be extended to every other interest in land.  I should have thought that in the modern world, where so much confidence has been lost in Government money, paper money, where all the people who are able to make free investment decisions&mdash;that is to say, those who are not hard pressed&mdash;who can only think about how they are going to pay their bills during the next month are opting for artefacts, constructions, land.  Is this a disposal of resources that it is thought should be encouraged? Take, for example, the case of someone who wants to buy a property in Dublin and turn it into flats.  The income <Col N="698" /> tax code provides he can borrow without limit for that operation, get relieved the full interest charged on his borrowing in determining what is his taxable income irrespective of his £2,000 relief chargeable against the income from these flats.  Now we are going to treat him as if he were engaging in a disposal of resources improving the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I have to be convinced that there is such a remarkable distinction between speculation in development land and speculation of the kind to which I refer.  What I say every Senator knows.  The inevitable exclusion of residences from capital gains tax has been one of the contributory factors to the increase in the prices of property in Dublin.  That is combined with other tax reliefs such as rates relief.  I have to be convinced that there is justification for this, that it is either equitable or makes for greater efficiency in the economy.  If we have indexation so widespread as to benefit those who borrow up to the hilt which, in general, indicates already a pretty good position, what of the people who are helping the whole economy by providing the resources of the banking system, who hold their money and have maintained their faith in money?  If inflation is to be provided for in relation to particular types of investment, why is there no provision for it?  Will I be told it is administratively impossible?  Maybe it is a difficulty.  We in the public sphere, who have committed ourselves to the welfare of this society, ought to seek to educate those who have or are getting the necessity for them to think of the social fabric.  There is not a great deal of value in having a lot of individual wealth amid social disturbances or having an insufficient sense that you are a member of a just society or a citizen of a just society with solidarity between all the citizens.</P>
    <P>When the wealth tax code was introduced a few years ago, a gentleman complained bitterly to me about it and told me he was going to Portugal.  He rang me up one Saturday morning.  I had been reading about the soldiers on the streets of Lisbon with red carnations in their button holes.  I said to him, addressing <Col N="699" /> him by his Christian name, there were some things worse than wealth tax. There could be some things worse than paying capital taxes of one kind or another for those who are well off.  Have we a society knitted together so strongly with a sense of solidarity that we are happy about it?  Are we wise in not maintaining as a top priority the design, re-design and re-shaping of a tax system, adjusting it all the time to the realities and experiences of the people, so that they feel equal treatment is being given to them?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the men who will not be able to take the benefit of tapering, that is to say, of continuing to hold the assets through a long period of years so that the tax lessens and lessens, will be the smaller men, or have I got it all wrong?  I would like to think that I had it all wrong.  The people who can organise their affairs so that they do not have to sell things until they have got outside the range of capital gains tax, and those who will not sell things until they have got outside that range, are those with a lot.  I have nothing at all against people having a lot.  I wish everybody had a lot and they could all give it away to each other.  I am not concerned about that, but we know we have a society where the resources of the Exchequer are stretched and people brought within the net of taxation do not feel justly treated.  We cannot ignore needs that are felt to be oppressive.  We must see that as an important duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>Another thing that is wrong is the failure to maintain the option for time disposal in the case of companies.  Companies get no tapering relief.  I would have thought that it was companies that ought to get the tapering relief, not individuals. I am not talking about portfolio companies or investment holding companies.  I am talking about enterprising companies&mdash;companies engaged in business and trade.</P>
    <P>It may well be that there will not be many cases where the tax will impact more heavily than the existing code, but if there are any such cases the option should be given to the company.  I will be proposing a recommendation in relation <Col N="700" /> to that.</P>
    <P>This seems a good point at which to raise what I have long thought about raising and that is the treatment of illegitimates under the tax code.  This Bill contains a section, which I have welcomed, with regard to gift disposals to children.  It is right that Senators, when they are considering section 8, should appreciate that the child who can get the benefit, or in respect of a gift, through whom the benefit accrues to the parent, does not include an illegitimate child.  If Senators have any difficulty in relation to that, I would draw their attention to section 36 of the Finance Act, 1977, which proivdes that:</P>
    <P>for the purposes of the Tax Act and the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975 unless the contrary intention appears, the child includes stepchild, adopted child.</P>
    <P>It does not include an illegitimate child. You might say they are out.  That would make some sort of sense even though it is monstrous.  If you look at the income tax code where you want to get relief in respect of settlements, for example, made on other people, that is, people other than your children, the contrary intention appears there.  So for the purpose of depriving you of the relief, an illegitimate child is included.  I find little sense in that.  I do not know how many cases there are.  We all know that the number of cases, according to the law of this land, is increasing.  We all know that there are nullification proceedings in the Roman Catholic Church, giving rise to the creation of a status for children which, according to the law of this land, is a status of illegitimacy.  There are an increasing number of such persons.  If there is to be an encouragement to give to children, such as I welcome in this Bill, I invite the House to consider a recommendation that that relief should be extended to include illegitimate children as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is amending a situation of taxation which is not for the common good.  Taxation can be used in a penal manner just to take money from people.  It also can be used in other ways, such as a redistribution <Col N="701" /> of wealth to give equity among the people of the community.  It can be used to direct people's actions in a way that is good for the community and it can deter actions which are bad for the community. Up to now, I do not think that has been the situation.  This Bill tends to amend that situation in that it gives incentives. It gives incentives to the man who works for a wage to save money.  If a man works for £1, and puts in the equivalent in work of that £1, and invests it, when the time comes for him to use that investment he wants to get back the working equivalent of that £1. Therefore, indexation has been brought in.  It also, by the scaling taxation, encourages investment for a period.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a practical demonstration of recent legislation that has been brought in, how it affects the worker who wishes to look to his old age and how this legislation has improved the situation.  Generally, the aim of a man is to get married.  So today he will get £1,000 grant to build his house.  As he proceeds, the next thing he will want to do, looking to his old age, is to buy his ground rent, and he can do that.  Then, as he proceeds he may wish to buy a car and he probably does that.  Now he has got to the stage where he can invest money.</P>
      <P>The day comes to retire and he has a reduced income.  He, at least, has a house, he has no rates or ground rent to pay, he has probably got the car and he has only £5 tax to pay.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about insurance. He has the petrol cost on, probably, the small use he gets out of the car.  Then, say he finds his income is not adequate and has to draw on the money that he saved: he can draw on that money and be sure that he is not being taxed on it.  He would have been taxed on it without this Bill because, as Senator FitzGerald has said, over the period taxation has gone.  I just wished to illustrate the benefit of this Bill to the ordinary working man.  I was very surprised to see that it was suggested in Dáil Éireann that this Bill may create a division in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill helps to direct people to do things which is good for the economy. <Col N="702" /> The small business and the farm have been valuable to our economy and will still be valuable.  One of the things we wish to do is to get the best production that we can from those sources.  There are two things that they require, money and labour.  We do not wish to starve them of money.  We wish to keep the labour to an adequate level so that management and output is at a viable level and are still valuable to the community as a whole.  I wish to stress this because they also are of benefit to the worker who is earning a wage in industry and otherwise.  We had a position where if the value went over £150,000, it was out for relief.</P>
    <P>You also have the position where a farm had to be handed over in one lot. Now if a person is over 55 years of age and does not wish to hand over the whole lot he does not have to do so.  He can hand over part of it.  At a later stage, a second member of the family could hand it over to the next member of the family.  Not alone that, but if the person who is over 55 years wishes to hand over to the younger person but still wishes to have an income he can still sell part to get that income.</P>
    <P>All these are forms of taxation which try to keep the small business and the small farm viable, not just for the farmer but for the community as a whole in order to keep up output and help the economy.  This Bill is definitely doing that but it does other things as well, for example, a compulsory purchase order under which land can be bought for the same value.  Against that, it deters the person who is trying to make an income by appreciation of capital and not making an input into it in the way a worker services the community.  Therefore, development land is exempt from the sliding tax scale as is mineral land.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald suggested that indexation should not be allowed in the case of developing land but one has to be just.  Indexation is to keep money at the same value as it was when invested.  No developer or speculator trying to make money will make it on inflation alone. The person who wishes to make an income by capital appreciation over a short period is caught.  Any investment will have to be for a minimum of three <Col N="703" /> years before the sliding scale of taxation comes in.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It has made some matters fairer for the community and is not a Bill, as some people have suggested, which benefits only the well-off. It is a Bill that benefits all sectors of the community and, if properly presented, should not in any way divide the community as has been suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides a lot of points for discussion.  It is essentially bringing reform and common sense which, to be non-controversial about it, experience of the last Bill showed to be badly needed.  There are some essential reforms which have already been debated.  Before touching on them, there are a few essential basics which should be pointed out.</P>
      <P>This Bill increases the rate of capital gains tax.  The suggestion that the Bill is being brought in to provide for a small wealthy group of people hardly stands up when examined on that basic point alone.  Gains within a three-year period from acquisition will be taxed at 30 per cent, an increase of 4 per cent on what had existed.  Our attitude to capital gains and the essential distinction that should be made between long and short-term gains, was very well known before the last election.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance when debating the 1975 Bill repeatedly insisted that a distinction should be made.  It was well known at the time.  I suggest that the results of the election and the extraordinarily huge majority would not indicate that the middle or lower income people in any way felt that our proposals for capital gains tax reform, which we now have in this Bill, were in any way detrimental to their income.  That may be a predictable type of debating point from a political point of view, but it certainly does not stand up to critical analysis of the opinion apparently of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We indicated that there was a great deal of reform needed in the capital taxes and in taxation generally.  It should also be borne in mind that most of the reforms have already been effected in the Finance Act, 1978.  The greatest increases that were ever given in personal <Col N="704" /> allowances for income tax were given in the last Finance Act.  In the general debate on this Bill, it was alleged that, while we are giving preference to a small number of people who would benefit, no relief is being given to the income taxpayer. That point is based on the yields which are being received from income tax generally.  That argument would not stand up to critical analysis.  The facts remain.  The personal reliefs were dramatically increased.  If we have an increase in yields on income taxes we have it because there are more people earning more money which, of course, was one of the basic economic points behind our whole approach to reform of taxation, apart altogether from the question of equity, that if we could bring into our system of taxation a level of competence by both the workers and the entrepreneurs, we would raise the level of economic activity, we would expand the economy and we would provide more jobs.  That is how we would get an increase in yield in a year in which we give greater tax allowances.  That vindicates our economic strategy as far as taxation is concerned.  This Bill is the final phase in the initial steps to breathe some sense and equity into our system of taxation in this case in the area of capital taxes.</P>
    <P>The two points which have come up for most discussion are the questions of tapering relief and indexation.  Just what is the case for suggesting that tapering relief should not apply?  Should we disregard the length of time in which an asset is held?  Should we make no distinction between an asset and a gain made in 12 months and a gain made over ten, 20 or 30 years?  Does anyone seriously suggest that those situations are identical and should be classed in an identical manner?  If they do, let us hear the case for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take some of the points that were made in support of that point of view.  For example, the suggestion was made&mdash;and I think this indicates a great deal of confusion and perhaps political confusion about the <Col N="705" /> matter&mdash;that an investment in property which is let in flats in no way contributes to the economy.  Frankly, the logic of that escapes me.  We must decide what type of economy we are going to have.  If that type of investment does not take place, people are still going to look for accommodation.  That service and that facility are essential and in great demand. If people who provide that service, decide against providing it, then somebody else&mdash;presumably the State&mdash;must step in and make that provision.  We are talking about the essential type of economic system we are going to have.  If individuals who provide that service are not contributing to the economy and should be taxed accordingly, who is going to provide the service? The simple answer is that the only agency left is the State.  Is that really what is intended?  Is that what we are driving at?</P>
      <P>I repeat the basic point on tapering relief: individuals or people who have contributed over a large number of years to the development of an asset, perhaps towards the provision of employment&mdash;in many cases we hope in fact to the provision of employment&mdash;who have sunk their lives and their endeavours in the building up of that asset, are clearly in a totally different position from someone who makes a quick gain overnight or over a small period of years.  It is absolutely fair, absolutely just and I have no doubt that it will meet with the approval of the public that that essential distinction should be made and relief granted accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indexation is also a relief which to me is self-explanatory.  How in equity it can be suggested that people pay tax on paper gains which reflect nothing more than the fall in the value of money escapes me, if that point is made from a viewpoint of equity which apparently it is.  When you bear in mind the type of inflation we have had, is it correct that, people, as all of us have, suffered over the last four or five years from inflation rates of 15, 18, 20 per cent and more, should not only struggle through that, but should then, if they are fortunate enough to realise a gain, pay tax in that situation?  Clearly this is an inequitable <Col N="706" /> situation and one which has to be remedied and one which is remedied in the Bill.  I find the debate on those two reliefs to be argumentative and somewhat unconvincing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I was, in addition to the Senator's remarks, referring to criticisms generally that have been made on the Bill.  In relation to tapering relief, why should there be this distinction, and why 21 years? Twenty-one years is an extremely long time in terms of finance, in terms of the economy, and assets, family business, and the circumstances of families may differ greatly over that period of time.  I would suggest that the continuation of a system of gains tax beyond some time within that range of years is something which is inappropriate having regard to the basic reliefs which are sought both by the tapering relief and indexation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated at the beginning that I wished to keep my remarks short because I feel the Bill speaks for itself. Indeed&mdash;and with reference to the Senator's remarks while I was speaking, I think his comments and his criticisms are very courageous and show very commendable loyalty.  It was quite remarkable that for much of the debate so far today he has been alone on the Opposition benches.  It is particularly remarkable that on this occasion so far, and I think I am right in saying when we were discussing the Finance Bill with particular reference to the wealth tax, for most of the time, if not all the time, the Senator had to stand and fight alone.  It shows the commendable loyalty to the Coalition that existed but it was quite <Col N="707" /> remarkable that there appeared to be so little support, if any, from his former colleagues and members of the Labour Party.</P>

I feel that we have delivered on the final phase of reform in both the income tax and the capital tax systems.

    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in this is the continuing problem of balancing justice in society on the one hand and the need for an entrepreneurial development on the other and instruments of this kind are fairly blunt in attempting to achieve a redistribution of wealth and at the same time to encourage entrepreneurial activity. Where legislation is introduced which will bring about a greater measure of justice and an acceptable sharing of wealth in society, people who will sometimes benefit are not putting in the effort and are not really making a great contribution to the development of the country.  As I see it, the approach here is, through the instrument of capital gains tax, to attempt to provide a <Col N="708" /> measure of fairness.  While at the same time encouraging the entrepreneurial behaviour which this country requires if we are to provide the business activity and that means the jobs that are required for an expanding population.</P>
    <P>We must not inhibit our businessmen or make it more difficult for them to compete with others, particularly in the European market situation.  We are balancing the need to provide employment with the need for a just redistribution. It seems to me that Ireland in trying to provide this employment must put that first and then go step by step with the larger grouping, the EEC for instance&mdash;let them develop the initiative, let them develop the new instruments which might go for a more harmonious social partnership and let us go step by step with them, but we cannot get out of step because we must provide the employment.</P>
    <P>The facts are that under the previous administration where you had a combination of Labour on the one hand and Fine Gael on the other, one nominally Left and the other nominally Right, one would have hoped for the type of compromise formula which would have produced the environment which would accept the notion of just redistribution and at the same time encourage the entrepreneurial activity.  In the event we all know what happened.  There was some redistribution&mdash;I will grant that&mdash; but the motivation for the entrepreneur was removed and we had an atmosphere which did not in any way encourage people who are motivated by money, who are motivated by the accrual of wealth.  They were inhibited, lost interest and felt that it was not worth the candle. I think that the measures that are in this Bill help to restore the balance.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald said that he bravely&mdash;those are my own words&mdash; took a position on wealth tax at one particular stage; he has mentioned this in the House before: we talked about it last year; but now he feels it should have been reformed and not thrown out.  I think there is a fundamental difference between the case of what I would call what you have and what you realise.  It is one thing to realise a capital gain and then have it taxed under certain rules <Col N="709" /> and regulations as applied in this Bill: it is another thing to have wealth and to have it depleted incrementally on the basis of a wealth tax.  The example I gave before is on record and here I am influenced again by comparable competitiveness. We have situations where on the same Irish market you have businesses owned by Irishmen trading in competition with businesses owned by companies outside Ireland where the Irishman would have to put aside an amount to cover his wealth position and provide that from the gains of his business whereas the people he was competing with did not have to do that. That puts people at a disadvantage; it puts Irish wealth-holders at a disadvantage and, as such, was again a contribution to inhibiting the entrepreneurial behaviour I am talking about.  We are not talking about wealth tax in the Bill but it came up in debate and we, in fact, have thrown it out and I think there was good reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>I would not feel very happy about the position where wealth is obtained through the manipulation of artificial mechanisms, like the stock exchange, where the value of a share is based on earnings per share multiplied by some notional figure which is a function of market speculation.  People used that mechanism in the last decade to &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo; Irish businesses and to take over.  That is an example for me of the artificial manipulation of capital market and in fact the market punished many of the people who were involved.  I was in favour at the time of not inhibiting the motivation of the individual but obviously some method like appropriate capital gains measures could be used to cover that issue.  I just want to make myself clear on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome particularly what it is doing to encourage passing farm land and farms into the hands of the younger farmers who might be more inclined to practise modern husbandry.  We all know that the productivity of the agricultural sector is going to depend on husbandry and the management of the land and to the extent that the Bill helps in that direction, it is very welcome.  I also see an advantage <Col N="710" /> in the way that the Bill deals with compulsory purchase orders and the gains derived therefrom.  Unless I am misinterpreting it&mdash;and here I bow to experts&mdash;it seems to me that this measure, which means that people must transfer their gains into similar holdings, might get rid of some of the eyesores and the empty tooth sockets that I have to put up with in the inner city of Dublin where people are sitting on property in the hope that they will be pushed into that position.  It seems to me that this measure should help.</P>
    <P>In summary&mdash;I am speaking in general&mdash;I see that this Bill does go towards providing that partnership between the need for just redistribution and entrepreneurial activity and it is, in fact, showing the way where the Coalition, who were a Coalition of Left and Right interests, failed.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to any further discussions that take place on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill. When we are discussing this Bill we cannot overlook the fact that it has, as the Minister said, two main functions: first, to rectify the serious errors that existed in the Capital Gains Act of 1975 and, secondly, it is a beginning by the Government of reforming the Irish system in such a way that, hopefully, in the not-too-distant future we will have a more progressive form of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1975 the capital gains tax introduced by the previous Government was modelled completely on the United Kingdom taxation system which dated back to 1965.  No effort at all was made to draft a Bill that suited the circumstances of the Irish economy.  The two main faults in the Act were pointed out earlier.  First, no regard was taken of inflation in the calculation of the gain that was chargeable to tax and in a period, obviously of very high inflation that we had over the past number of years, the gains were obviously illusionary but the tax charged was very real indeed.  The secondary fault was that no distinction was made between short-term and long-term gains.  Thus, as we heard earlier, the speculator who got in fast and made a quick profit, was charged the same <Col N="711" /> amount of tax as the entrepreneur who had spent years building up his business. Obviously, these were very serious defects and ones that no Government could stand over.</P>
    <P>The amendment Bill introduced here today takes account of these faults.  It ensures that all gains will be inflation-proof by indexing the cost of the assets to the consumer price index.  In section 4 rates of tax will be charged on a sliding scale for assets held for more than three years and there will be a further reduction on every three years the asset is held thereafter until eventually no tax is charged after 21 years.</P>
    <P>In section 6 assets inherited on death will be considered acquired at the market value by their successors.  Obviously, it was very unfair that the person who received an asset or inherited an asset was liable for capital gains tax on gains arising during the time when he did not hold that asset.  For that reason, I am happy that the Government have brought in these necessary amendments and have rectified the major faults.  I hope that it is a beginning by the Government in tidying up the ludricrously regressive taxation system that exists in this country.  I believe that tax on income should be charged at the same rate from whatever source that income is received.  If you have a progressive form of taxation, taxing all incomes fairly, there is no need for a wealth tax or anything like that.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Senators for their contributions and their welcome of the Bill.  One can fairly say that it was generally completely accepted and welcomed with the exception of the two major points made by Senator FitzGerald, the fact that companies did not qualify for tapering rates and his argument against the repeal of section 6 of the 1975 Act.  In general&mdash;I do not want to misquote anybody&mdash;there was acceptance and welcome for all the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my original remarks I answered some of the points that have been made <Col N="712" /> by Senators but there are just a few other detailed points that I would like to mention.  I am glad that Senator FitzGerald said that in the debates on the original Bill he had mentioned two of the major items in this Bill&mdash;namely capital gains tax on death, and indexation&mdash;and said that he would have favoured what is being done now.  He also went on to say, in reply to what I said about discouraging speculation, that he felt that indexation would encourage speculation, I do not think that that can be so.  First of all&mdash;it is difficult to define speculation&mdash;to qualify for indexation the asset must be held for at least 12 months and the real distinction between the speculator and the ordinary citizen is in the tapering rates where the tax rate is lower the longer he holds the asset.  Of course the rate of 30 per cent is charged if the asset is held for less than three years.</P>
    <P>The question of reinvestment of the proceeds arising from compulsory acquisition was raised also by Senator FitzGerald.  If the proceeds were reinvested in development land tapering rates would not apply on the disposal of that land.  He was making a point about that.</P>
    <P>There was also a point raised about accrued gains being taxed.  The gain that has accrued on an asset up to the owner's death is not taxed.  The beneficiary who inherits the asset obtains it at market value at date of death and begins a new period of ownership for tapering rates, so that if he disposes of it in the first three years after death he pays at the 30 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>On the question of the repeal of section 6 of the 1975 Act, the effect of indexation is to eliminate from the charge to tax gains due to inflation.  It could then be argued that the gains left in charge should be assimilated to income for tax purposes.  Having decided in principle not to apply the income tax rates it would be inconsistent to retain section 6, which in effect charges half the gain at income tax rates.  The provision of tapering rates of charge based on the period of ownership of the asset is considered to be fairer to the taxpayer, especially as it applies equally to all individuals and not merely to an individual whose income <Col N="713" /> for a given year of assessment happens, often fortuitously, to be pitched at a level enabling him to derive some benefit from the relief.</P>
    <P>The Senator gave the example of the British situation.  The half income rule is gone here and in the UK but the UK compensated by increasing the exemption to £1,000 and giving marginal relief up to £9,500 gains.  The simple answer to that is that the UK do not have indexation or tapering rates and our £500 exemption is reasonable in view of the indexation of the gains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not afford to give them.  They are very poor over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of argument, who is poor and who is not. The question of tapering rates being applied to companies was raised.  Companies are excluded from the tapering rates because a company has a separate existence apart from its members and enjoys perpetual succession.  Accordingly, unlike an individual whose death involves the commencement of a new period of ownership by a successor, a company generally speaking, has no life span and the giving of tapering relief would therefore be inappropriate.  Indexation which will apply across the board will remove most gains from the tax net. A combination of indexation, tapering and roll-over relief, under which a diverged gain in the hands of a company in effect escapes tax in perpetuity, would probably result in a &ldquo;nil&rdquo; tax yield from companies.  Therefore, it is necessary to exclude companies from the tapering rates.</P>
      <P>The final question that was raised by Senator FitzGerald was that of illegitimate children.  We are obliged, in tax law, to maintain the situation as it exists in general law.  That has been the position in all tax law so far.  This is a matter of concern to many people no doubt, as it is to Senator FitzGerald, but I think the matter has already gone for consideration to the Law Reform Commission. The matter is by no means closed at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill now before the House has two objectives which I will outline briefly before giving the background to them. The main objective is to make the necessary changes in our VAT law in order to bring that law into harmony with the Sixth VAT Directive which was adopted by the Council of Ministers of the European Communities on 17 May 1977. This was the sole objective of the Bill as initiated in Dáil Éireann last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, the Bill has been amended by Dáil Éireann to meet a further objective, namely, the implementation of the two VAT proposals in the 1978 budget. These two proposals were an increase of about 50 per cent in the turnover thresholds above which traders must register for VAT, and the restoration of the 1 per cent VAT recoupment to VAT-registered customers of unregistered farmers.  In the first case, it was necessary only to make appropriate amendments <Col N="715" /> to section 6 of the Bill.  In the second case, however, implementation required the addition of four new sections to the Bill as initiated.  These new sections are sections 11, 17, 18 and 22 of the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>I might conclude the brief outline of the purpose of the Bill by referring to the remaining two new sections which were inserted in the Bill by Dáil Éireann. These are sections 20 and 31 of the present text of the Bill and both are essentially technical provisions.  Section 20 adjusted the time limits for VAT assessments, and so on, following the death of a taxable person, to take account of the introduction of capital acquisitions tax and the lodgment of documents for the purpose of that tax.  The 1978 Finance Act made a similar change for income tax assessments and so on.  Section 31 is designed to ensure that, despite the nature and extent of the amendments to our existing VAT law being made by the Bill, there will no breach in the continuity of VAT.</P>
    <P>I will now proceed to some background information.  It is now more than a decade since the Commission of the European Communities initiated moves towards the harmonisation of VAT systems in member states, as part of a general programme designed to end tax barriers between member states. Ever since the Commission has been concerned, in increasing detail, with securing greater uniformity in the scope and base of application of VAT.  It has also the intention that, ultimately, differences in VAT rates between member states would be harmonised.  With such a complex tax as VAT, clearly, full harmonisation must necessarily be a very lengthy process.  This has been borne out by events.</P>
    <P>The broad structure and general principles of the common EEC VAT system were set down by the First and Second VAT Directives which were adopted by the Council in April 1967.  Those directives have applied to Ireland since 1 January 1974 and our existing law reflects them.</P>
    <P>Further impetus to EEC VAT harmmonisation was given by the Council Decision of 21 April 1970 which <Col N="716" /> stipulated that an integral element of the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; basis of the Community's budget should be the yield from a charge, of not more than 1 per cent, on the VAT basis of assessment in each member state determined in a uniform manner according to Community rules.</P>
    <P>The Sixth VAT Directive which was adopted in 1977, goes a long way to providing those common VAT rules. Member states which implement that directive will pay over to the Communities, out of their national tax revenues, VAT &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; thus calculated on the uniform VAT assessment basis, in lieu of financial contributions based on relative shares of the EEC gross national product.  Member states do not have to levy a special VAT for &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; purposes and no increase in the national VAT rates is thereby called for.</P>
    <P>Given the very wide scope of the directive, immediate and full harmonisation of the basis of assessment for VAT would give rise to severe practical and political problems for member states. Without some give and take on all sides, the directive could not have been adopted.  While Council adoption of the directive signified member state's agreement to eventually adopting the harmonised VAT base set out in the directive, the directive specifically provided for transitional periods of at least five years for alignment by member states in particular areas, notably in the case of VAT zero rates and certain VAT exemptions.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for some new zero-ratings required by the Sixth Directive.  I might also mention that until tax barriers are removed within the Community, each member state can retain in force the zero ratings which it had in force on 31 December 1975 and which fulfil specified conditions, These zero-ratings will be reviewed every five years.  The first such review will not arise until 1982.  A unanimous Council decision would be required before Ireland would be obliged to end its VAT zero-ratings for food, personal clothing and footwear, electricity and so on.  Zero-rated turnover is of course part of the harmonised VAT basis of assessment for calculation of the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; VAT <Col N="717" /> element and member states will be paying over to the Communities the appropriate calculated sum in respect of zero-rated and other turnover.</P>
    <P>A unanimous Council decision would also be required before Ireland would be obliged to end its VAT exemption for telecommunication services supplied by the public postal services; the services of solicitors, barristers, accountants and actuaries; the services of travel agents; the services supplied by undertakers; the supply of greyhounds and horses; passenger transport within the State; and admissions to sporting events.  These exemptions benefit from an initial derogation of five years and also fall for review in 1982.  Since VAT taxation, and not VAT exemption, is the agreed ultimate Community aim in these cases member states continuing to exempt those activities during whatever transitional period is decided must make appropriate compensation to the Communities &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The overall approach to implementation of the directive, as provided for in the Bill now before the House, is to keep the necessary changes to the minimum. Every effort has been made to avail of provisions of the directive which would allow favourable arrangements to those traders whose activities have to be brought within Irish VAT for the first time.  The substantial increase in all VAT registration thresholds which is also being made at the same time will reduce somewhat the impact of the required EEC changes.  This approach seems to have been duly recognised by traders affected.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the changes required in the context of the Sixth Directive.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that much of the Bill is taken up with a revision of terminology and phraseology in our existing VAT law in order to comply with the directive.</P>
    <P>As regards matters of substance, the principal change is the termination of some Irish VAT exemptions because these are not permitted by the directive, even for a transitional period.  As I said, the directive, is the product of compromise. Accordingly, the present VAT exemption must end for the following, to name the main areas affected: certain <Col N="718" /> services of auctioneers and house agents; non-academic teaching such as driving schools; valuation services of chartered surveyors; certain agency services but excluding agency services in relation to banking, insurance and finance which will continue to be VAT exempt; admissions to certain shows, fairs and exhibitions, but excluding, for example, annual agricultural shows run by non-profit making bodies.  The traders who are engaged in those activities which now become VAT taxable will be entitled to claim, from the Revenue, the general credit for input VAT&mdash;borne on business purchases&mdash;which at present they have to bear, without recovery from the Revenue.</P>
    <P>Another change required by the directive is the replacement of our present two-tier VAT rates for cars, motorcycles, radios, TV sets, gramophones and records.  The two-tier arrangement involves a &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; VAT of 25 per cent or 30 per cent respectively at the manufacturer/import level only and 10 per cent VAT at all stages of distribution. EEC VAT law only allows for a straight VAT rate applicable at all stages of distribution.  In future, therefore, only a single 10 per cent VAT rate will apply at all stages of distribution.  The VAT revenue thus foregone will be made good by appropriate changes in excise duties. Consideration is being given at present in consultation with trade interests to the details of the new excises required.  It will be appreciated, of course, that any question of changes in the overall level of taxation on the goods in question would be a matter for consideration in the budgetary context.</P>
    <P>A third change required by the directive is the formal charging of VAT on imports.  This will have two important results.  First, it will mean that in future the same penalties as apply to false declarations in relation to sales and VAT due to Revenue will apply to false declarations in regard to imports.  Second, it will permit the collection of VAT at importation from certain persons.  The directive permits deferment of accounting for the VAT on imports for their business by VAT-registered persons until those persons make the <Col N="719" /> VAT return for the period in which the importation took place.  Such deferment will be allowed only to persons who are trading in the State from a fixed place of business.  It is intended that such persons would lose their right to deferment if they fail to account for VAT satisfactorily. Thus, all mobile traders coming into the State with goods will be required to pay VAT on those goods at the point of importation and, on making their next VAT return in relation to sales within the State, would be allowed a credit for the VAT paid at the point of importation.</P>
    <P>There are some other minor changes required by the Sixth Directive which I propose to mention on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Sixth VAT Directive requires a new definition of &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; for Irish VAT purposes but does not affect the right of farmers, as so defined, to remain outside the VAT system should they so wish.  Most farmers in fact have stayed outside the VAT system.  Broadly the new definition will only exclude persons who are not engaged fulltime in farming as generally understood, involving occupation of land and ownership of livestock and so on.</P>
    <P>The directive allows member states to have special arrangements to compensate those farmers who do not opt into the VAT system for VAT borne by them on purchases of farming inputs.  VAT-registered customers can obtain a special flat-rate VAT credit in respect of their purchases from unregistered farmers.  As I have already mentioned, section 11 of the Bill and related sections restore the 1 per cent flat-rate VAT credit which obtained here until 1976.  The bringing of marts into the VAT system at the same time as the 1 per cent flat rate credit is being restored will involve the marts in the preparation and handling of documentation showing the 1 per cent addition.  This should help to ensure that the benefit will reach the farmers for whom it is intended.</P>
    <P>The Bill on enactment will come into operation on a date to be specified by order by the Minister for Finance, except for section 29, which will come into effect on enactment of the Bill in order to <Col N="720" /> allow the Government to make at the appropriate time the necessary excises order under the Imposition of Duties Act.</P>
    <P>As Senators will appreciate, this is a rather technical Bill.  I have tried to make clear the broad purposes involved without going into too much technical detail.  Having regard to the need to change our VAT law to meet EEC obligations and to fulfil the VAT changes announced in the 1978 Budget in regard to farmers and small traders, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  As the Minister pointed out in the last words of his speech, this is a very technical Bill.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the very useful background given in his script.  This Bill can be seen only in the light of the Sixth Directive and development within the Community of harmonisation on many things and, in this instance, in relation to value-added tax.  The Minister has said the purpose of the Bill is to fulfil our obligations under the Sixth Directive, that directive having the objective of bringing about greater harmony in relation to value-added tax.</P>
      <P>I think everyone would agree that the Bill, which is extremely technical, can be dealt with only on Committee Stage.  It provides for, basically, a uniform method of assessment throughout the EEC countries.  It provides for common definitions of taxable persons, transactions and the like.  It provides also for the admission of new persons, new businesses and business transactions into the area of liability to value-added tax.  It provides for the continued, albeit temporary continued exemption for some other people and groups.</P>
      <P>The directive also serves the purpose of enabling the Community's budget to be financed by what is described as the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; rather than the individual financial contributions made by member states as is at present the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill must go a long way towards bringing about harmony in method of assessment of value-added tax in the Community.  It is an important aspect of Community development, for those people who believe in the whole concept of Europe, that there would be harmony in <Col N="721" /> relation to taxation.  Something that always strikes me when we talk about a subject like value-added tax is that value-added tax was not designed by Irishmen for the Irish situation.  A lot of people would agree that it is a type of taxation system alien to the Irish nature, for better or for worse.  It is a fair and sensible system so far as it is a broadly-based tax on consumer expenditure on goods and services.  It is a tax described in taxation circles as a neutral tax in that it is widely spread and does not affect competitors either within a member state or internationally where the rate of VAT charged on imports for any goods is the same as the rate of VAT charged within the country for the home-produced goods of a similar type.  It is a fair system.  It encourages and helps free trade and ensures that there is not any discrimination as far as competition is concerned between member states.  The outstanding disadvantage of the system is that it requires a lot of administration from the revenue point of view and requires a great amount of book-keeping and analysis from the business person's point of view.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on the increase he made in the turnover before one's liability to be registered for VAT arises.  Even still, the present threshold is a low threshold in relation to certain businesses.  There are very many small businessses around the country which because of their nature have a fairly high turnover with perhaps a small profit element.  Agricultural contractors, for example, will become liable to be registered for value-added tax under this measure.  They are people who have not, as I have said, a proper administrative side to their business.  Their turnover is high because of the machinery involved and because of the nature of their business.  Their profits are frequently low.  It is important to remember always when bringing people into the tax net that one should be as reasonable and as human, if I can use the expression, as one can.  Somebody like the agricultural contractor, who will come into this system for the first time, will be very badly hit by this.  I know there are very many small shopkeepers around the country who have previously come <Col N="722" /> within the value-added tax net and who have been scared to death because they had not been in a position to maintain the bookkeeping system that they should to have to make proper returns for value-added tax purposes.  It is a very important feature of the system and it is something over which because we are members of the EEC, we do not have full control.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that a system like this would better suit bigger or more industrialised countries than ours.  It is also a fact that it is part of the deal that we have to live with being in the EEC.  I do not know what the answer is or where the answer would lie but more consideration should be given to the anguish and difficulty caused people who are relatively small in business but who are brought into the tax net under this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>The directive also serves the purpose of enabling the European Economic Community to have its own autonomous resources so far as its budget is concerned. That is something to be welcomed.  Obviously, if one believes in some form of a united Europe it is something that is to be welcomed.  The point has been made in the past in relation to this that there is a question of accountability in relation to Community funds.  When we talk about the Community here so far as disposal of funds is concerned, or allocation of resources, that they are going to spend what money they have, we are talking basically about the Council itself.  If, for example, in Ireland we go to spend some of our tax revenue or our central funds on one thing or another it is the Oireachtas, in the final analysis, who decide whether that money should be spent; given that they are a Government with a 20-seat majority in the House, it is still the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas must consider and must discuss it and know exactly what is going on.  In this instance, and over the next few years, we are going to be providing 1 per cent of the VAT collected in this country to the European Community. The Council of Ministers will decide how that money is to be spent.  It has constantly been argued since the whole idea of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; came up some years <Col N="723" /> ago that there ought to be&mdash;while we were developing the concept of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;&mdash;a development in line with that giving greater powers to the European Parliament in relation to the budget.  We all know that the European Parliament's powers in relation to the budget at present are quite insignificant. They have powers in relation to about 4 per cent of the overall budget.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity&mdash;with the European elections in the offing and with this development taking place under the Sixth Directive&mdash;that this opportunity was not used to give the European Parliament greater power so that, at least, the European Parliament could discuss where that money was going to go&mdash;the 1 per cent coming from Ireland. We do not know how that money is going to be spent.  God knows, after the happenings of the past few days in Brussels, we know the difficulties and confusion that can be caused by meetings like that, whether they be Summit Meetings of the leaders of the Nine or Council of Ministers meetings.  It is of great importance if we are to keep a level of reality in the eyes of the public so far as the European Community is concerned, if it is to be a part of their lives that they have a regard for, that it is seen that what money they get through an independent source like this is under the watchful eye of some assembly.  It cannot be the National Assembly, so it should be the European Parliament.  It is an appropriate time for this development to take place.  I am sorry it has not taken place.</P>
    <P>In making these comments I am very much aware of the fact that there is very little our Minister can do about this.  As he said himself, this is a matter of compromise. It is a matter of the Nine Ministers meeting together.  It took them four years to come up with a final agreement on the Sixth Directive.  This development is going on a long time.  I am very conscious of the fact that there is nothing our Minister can do except to push his argument, as it were, when he is at Council level.  It comes back to the whole problem of our involvement in a Community in which we are but one small country, a country which God <Col N="724" /> knows&mdash;again after the past few weeks&mdash;seems to have little enough influence when it comes down to money and when the big powers are concerned about their future, which I suppose is fair enough.  The only way out is to ensure that an institution like the European Parliament can have a voice.  It is more likely when discussions are opened up rather than discussions taking place behind closed doors, when an Irish Minister can make his points of view very strongly.  Of course they can be rejected and afterwards the public are not aware of precisely what went on.  Even though we may only be a minority if we had the power in the European Parliament we would be more likely to win the support of the peoples of Europe, as opposed to trying to win the support of nationally-interested members at the level of Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill, one better left to Committee Stage.  Indeed, it would be better left to people who are competent in this area of taxation, which is a highly technical one.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question as a matter of curiosity.  I understand in relation to those people who are exempted, that where in our Bill we exclude certain people we will have a liability to compensate the common European fund, so to speak, for those exemptions.  I wonder whether the Minister could indicate how the level of compensation could be made up.  For example, if we leave out the services of accountants, how can we value the loss of revenue through value-added tax that is not being imposed?  Will the Community itself arrive at a figure and say: &ldquo;You have excluded accountants' and solicitors' services from this; you owe us X hundreds of thousands of £s&rdquo;, or is it that the State will try to measure it in some way?  I cannot see how it could be measured, and I wonder if the Minister has any ideas on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very technical Bill in relation to the putting into effect of the Sixth Directive.  Therefore, there is not a whole lot to be said about it.  One of the changes incorporated in the Bill is the reappearance of the 1 per cent to farmers on their sales.  Whereas, when it <Col N="725" /> was brought in originally it was said that farmers were not getting the benefit of it, now that the marts are involved and the onus is on them, farmers should benefit from this 1 per cent and the 1 per cent increase on the value of the sale of their goods in future.</P>
      <P>There are other changes also, such as the 10 per cent on radios, on each transaction, and the substitution of excise on that to make up the difference.  There is also the difference of tax on importation where there was no tax before.  Senator Molony was worried about the small trader, but the small trader can still pay tax on cash turnover which to a certain extent is simpler.  There is an arrangement for the transfer of goods and tax payable from a trader who is registered to pay on sale to the person who is doing it on cash turnover.  Originally, prior to the introduction of turnover tax was brought a great many leaflets and instructions were issued so that people were aware of it.  Again, when we transferred to value-added tax there was a great deal of information given out so that people understood it.  In some of the changes I can see cases where people will not see how it should be operated and, therefore, I would ask the Minister if he could arrange before the order is made for the Revenue Commissioners to do the best they can to inform people who have to cope with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the reports on the Special Committee and other reports on this Bill.  There seems to be quite an amount of confusion and misunderstanding of how the administration of the whole VAT system works and I would appeal to the Minister to produce a simple booklet for the man in the street to enable him to understand in due course what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, it was in May, 1977, 19 months ago, that the European Council adopted the Sixth Directive on a Community-wide basis for a common system of value-added tax, for a uniform basis of assessment and for a common method of operating.  This directive was to come into operation on 1 January this year and the legislation needed to implement it is only being debated in the Seanad now.  Although technical, it is <Col N="726" /> probably one of the most important Bills which the Council of Ministers have agreed from the point of view not only of the Irish consumer but of the Irish manufacturer.  Although it has been through a Special Committee it is still bewildering and many are under the impression that food is exempt.  Specified food has a rating at present of zero.  That could be changed in the future, as indicated in the Minister's introduction.</P>
    <P>While this Bill may harmonise the laws of member states relating to VAT it does not harmonise the rates applied to the various countries.  Therefore, we are faced with a great number of anomalies and considerable hardship with competing industries which are subject to a high level of VAT in one country and to zero rating in another.  Since the implementation of this Bill was due on 1 January this year I am not sure how we stand regarding our contribution to the Community budget even this year. Perhaps the Minister can explain what our contribution has been, how it has been arrived at, and whether the Community objective to complete the only resources arrangement will be applicable on 1 January next year, when at least we will have passed this Bill which will enable us to administer the system in this country.</P>
    <P>Following a vote the proposals were rejected by the French Government and I am wondering how this affects again the collection of VAT for the Community budget.  Following a vote against the Government over the introduction of the EEC Sixth Directive France now seems certain to be the second member state which will be unable to introduce this Community legislation as required by 1 January 1979.  This will have a direct impact on the Community's 1979 budget, since the French Government's contributions are now expected to be calculated on the basis of the present GNP key rather than on a percentage of receipts from value-added tax which is one of the three elements of the Community's own financial resources, the others being customs duties and agricultural levies.</P>
    <P>The only member state to have indicated officially it will be unable to meet the January 1st deadline is Germany. <Col N="727" /> Only three member states have so far adopted the Sixth Directive into national law and those are the UK, Belgium and Denmark.  Observers expect that other countries will also inform the Commission that they are unable to take the necessary measures.  We are taking the measure today but it is all extremely confusing from the point of view of how it affects the Community budget for 1979.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill 1 per cent will be due to the European fund repayable out of the revenue of all VAT collected.  In other words, Ireland will pay over to the Community the required sum in respect of VAT own resources at the rate of 1 per cent from retail expenditure subjected to VAT whether or not it is subjected to VAT in this country.  Here we have, in a Community sense, a very unfair situation with regard to certain products.  The ones with which I am acquainted in particular are cakes, biscuits, ice cream and newspapers.  One questions why foods and newspapers in Ireland have to pay their share of 1 per cent of Ireland's own resources whilst those foods and newspapers in our neighbouring country, for instance, are not subjected to this obligation because they are zero rated.  Britain, for example, will have to provide compensation equivalent to the loss of VAT if they do not charge it on these products where they are zero rated.  This means, therefore, that there is a hidden subsidy for certain industries which compete with Irish industries.</P>
    <P>Like so many anomalies in the EEC unity, the Minister has inferred that the movement to the harmonisation of the rates of VAT will be very slow but I hope the Minister will press for an urgent review of this unfair and irregular situation.  Perhaps competing imports from our major competitors from the UK should be examined to see what advantage they have under the VAT system.  For instance, I know the UK have a great opportunity to increase the volume on the home market with the cheaper food policy right across their larger population with so many subsidies, both indirect and direct, that we have not investigated.  Therefore, there is <Col N="728" /> need for a comprehensive analysis of such imports into this country which will include an in-depth research into the disparities. There appears to be no question of Britain phasing out the much discussed temporary employment scheme and this is not only enjoyed by the textile industries in Britain but also by many of the food industries in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Whilst the EEC are making up their mind about the harmonisation in the true sense, including harmonisation of the rates of VAT, I have suggested we examine how we can safeguard our enterprises, providing them with parity of opportunity, as guaranteed by the Treaty of Rome, and those enterprises operating in our neighbouring country which enjoy advantages of one kind or another.  Furthermore, I suggest the kind of products being imported here which are not manufactured in Ireland could be subjected to the maximum rate of VAT in order to ensure that such imports are paying their way in the context of our national economic plan.  I suggest this could be an effective way of either reducing imports of this nature or at least adding to our total tax collected. We have, of course, the problem of differing rates of VAT in Northern Ireland which, when one looks at television, looks as if food and other items are much cheaper than here when, in fact, they are not subjected to VAT.  I know the Minister for Finance is reluctant that the Irish Government should simply follow what the British Government does, but this whole directive is about harmonisation and in this instance, there is every reason why the British Government should be encouraged to follow the Irish Government in the application of our rates of VAT on purchases, products and services which are now zero rated in the UK.  After all, taxation in any form is an important factor in manufacturing costs and member states must adapt their taxation system towards a common pattern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of VAT is really a technical matter and to some extent we are up against this when the Bill hits us at a stage like this.  I would like to take the opportunity on this Second Stage to refer forward a little <Col N="729" /> bit rather than to the Bill as it stands at the moment.  For instance, the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC recently issued a report on the application of VAT to works of art, collectors' items, antiques and used goods.  I would like to take this opportunity of putting it into the record that there is a great deal of concern about that particular seventh directive which will deal with this item and we would hope that, when a Bill is introduced to deal with it, the Minister and his Department will ensure that they have a look at this report and take the recommendations of the committee into account.</P>
      <P>The used goods provision could affect the VAT chargeable on antiques and works of art in that VAT would be chargeable on 30 per cent of the dealer's selling price.  The Irish Antique Dealers Association are quite concerned about VAT and would feel that they should have the option of dealing with the present system which taxes used goods at a straight 10 per cent.  The other area that has come up for concern is that of used cars.  At the moment it operates on the cash transaction involving the price of the car and the amount allowed on a traded-in car.  There could be dangers there that the price of cars would go up as a result of the introduction of a new form of VAT which would try to do it on the two-stage basis.  I just make the point at this stage in a Bill which is dealing with fairly technical matters in regard to VAT.  The things which are in the pipeline should receive some attention as well and I draw the Minister's attention to that report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC, November 1978, covering these matters.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank the Senators who contributed.  Everybody has agreed that this is a very technical Bill and it is one that will only lead to further clarification, if such is required, on a question and answer basis on Committee Stage.  I will just refer to a few points made about agricultural contractors. Senator Molony was concerned here.  He talked about these now coming into the <Col N="730" /> net.  Most of them should qualify for relief as farmers.  I think most of them will.  That is the position.</P>
      <P>Senator Lambert talked about a more simplified booklet on VAT.  There is a guide to valued-added tax available, which is fairly simple and fairly precise, and covers most of the points that would require clarification.  On the point of how calculations will be made in calculating own resources, I understand the base will be the sum of the actual tax base for goods liable at different positive tax rates, plus the base for zero rated goods, plus the estimated base for exempt services, such as passenger transport, telecommunications, and so on, plus the turnover of certain traders below registration limit.  The second and third elements I have mentioned will require the facilities of the Central Statistics Office to supply the figures for addition to the data available in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>It is very complicated. There is no simple answer.  I do not suppose there are any simple answers to many of the problems that emanate from Brussels.  There are complicated answers and it is necessary to clarify the complications in order to get a clearer understanding.</P>
      <P>On the question of a contribution to the EEC budget, only member states which implement the EEC Sixth VAT Directive are obliged to contribute to the EEC budget on the VAT own resources system.  Otherwise, they remain on the GNP payments.  That is the way we are at present.  The contribution to VAT own resources is to be calculated on the VAT taxable turnover in member states&mdash;that is the turnover subject to all VAT rates including the zero rate.  There is no question of charging an additional national VAT rate to meet the own resources contribution which will come out of Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point made by Senator Mulcahy was one that could not really be taken into account at this stage.  It does not arise on the Bill.  As I said many more points were raised and we <Col N="731" /> hope to clarify them on Committee Stage.</P>
