      <P>Sul a scoramar an óiche faoi dheireadh bhí cúpla sampla tugtha agam den mhoill mhór, narbh inleithscéil dar liom, a bhain le freagraí a fháil ón Roinn Oideachais ar mholtaí an bhoird.  Ní ró-shásta i gcoitinne a bhí an bord leis an gcaoi ar chaith an Roinn Oideachais leofa.  Ach is chun cothrom na Féinne a fháil don bhord agus ní amháin chun an neamhshuim seo a chasadh leis an Roinn Oideachais adeirim an méid sin.  Ba mhinic an bord sáinithe idir an dá thine Bealtaine, iad féin ag iarraidh rudaí áirithe a áitiú ar an Rialtas agus ag coinneáil srian lena mífhoighid an uair nach raibh a mhacsamhail de smacht ar lucht a <Col N="785" /> gcáinte&mdash;clocha ceangailte agus madaí scaoilte, mar adeir an seanfhocal.</P>
      <P>Chun cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt don Roinn Oideachais féin, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuair mé dea-scéal ar na mallaibh ón Aire Oideachais, scéal a chuir lúcháir orm.  Is fada a bhí an bord ag iarraidh go mbúnófai comhchoiste a mbéadh ionadaithe sinnsearacha ón bhord agus ón Roinn air le comhoibriú a chinntiú agus a bhrostú.  Anois tá an comhchoiste sin ar tí a bhunaithe.  Más maith is mithid.  Acht molaim an tAire Oideachais dá bharr.</P>
      <P>An Tuarascáil sin faoi Dhearcadh an Phobail i leith na Gaeilge, leag sí an mhéar ar roinnt de na laigí is mó a bhaineas le staid na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais, laigí atá an-chontúirteach don teanga agus a d'féadfadh a bheith marfach.</P>
      <P>Ar na rudaí a luadh bhí (1) an tuitim thubaisteach i líon na ndaltaí a dhéanann freastal ar scoileanna lánGhaelacha nó dhátheangacha; (2) an tuitim i gcaighdeán cumais sa Ghaeilge i measc múinteoirí Gaeilge; (3) an géarghá le cumas labhartha sa Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn; (4) an géar-ghá le húsáid na Gaeilge sna scoileanna a fhorbairt lasmuigh de na ranganna; agus (5) modhanna spreagtha ar mhaithe le múineadh na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní liosta iomlán é sin, ar ndóigh, ach is ag dul in olcas atá an scéal de réir chosúlachta.  In alt leis in eagrán Earrach na bliana seo de &ldquo;Teangeolas&rdquo; scríobh Stiúrthóir na hInstitiúide Teangeolaíochta, Tomás Ó Domhnalláin, an méid seo faoin &ldquo;Ghaeilge san Oideachas&rdquo;: gurab eagal leis nach ábhar dóchais ach a mhalairt a bhí le nochtú aige, nach fás ach meath atá léirithe san eolas is déanaí atá ar fáil. Deir sé gur léir gur tháinig laghdú mór ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais ó thús na seachtóidí agus gur laghdú leanúnach nó carnach atá ann.  Deir sé: &ldquo;Na micléinn a fhoghlaimíonn tríd an nGaeilge ar scoil is iad sin na daoine fásta is fearr a mbíonn an Ghaeilge acu ar ball; b'iad freisin bo mhó a sholáthríodh múinteoirí náisiúnta agus múinteoirí Gaeilge le haghaidh scoileanna iar-bhunoideachas...&rdquo; Lena chois sin, má leanann na laghdaithe atá le tabhairt faoi deara ar líon na ndaltaí a <Col N="786" /> thugann faoin Gaeilge nó a ghlacann leagan Gaeilge de pháipéir in ábhair eile san meanteistiméireacht agus san árdteistiméireacht, 'sé barúil an Stiúrthóra gur laghdú a bhéas ag teacht feasta ar an gcéatadán de phobal na hÉireann, 30 faoin gcéad de réir an daonáirimh is deireannaí, a bhfuil cumas éigin sa Ghaeilge acu.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún don mhéad atá tagtha le goirid i lion na ndaltaí a dteipeann ortha i nGaeilge sna scrúdaithe sin, fiú nuair a thugann siad faoin phaipéar Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Creidim gur leor a bhfuil luaite agam chun béim a chur ar na gá atá le comhoibriú cumasach, leanúnach idir Bhord na Gaeilge agus an Roinn Oideachais. Aithním an brú atá ar an Roinn Oideachas le blianta.  Aithním gur féidir nach raibh ar a n-acmhainn riar mar ba mhian leo ar chúrsaí Gaeilge.  Ach dá leanfadh an scéal mar sin ní bheadh Bord na Gaeilge ach ar leath-chois cheal tacaíocht íomlán na Roinne is mó d'féadfadh cabhrú le cumas sa Ghaeilge a bhunú agus a leathnú.  Is mór agam, da bhrí sin, an cinneadh atá déanta le goirid ag an Aire Oideachais coiste Gaeilge a bhunú sa Roinn sin chun cúram speisialta a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais.  Mar fheictear domhsa é, nuair a cuireadh deireadh leis an éigeantas roinnt blianta o shin, fágadh nach raibh aon pholasaí dearbhtha ina áit agus beidh ar an gcoiste seo an bhearna sin a líonadh.</P>
    <P>'Sé fograíodh an chéad lá faoi Bhord na Gaeilge gur &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; a bheadh ann&mdash;an chéad áisínteacht Stáit ariamh a bunaíodh d'aonturas chun leas na Gaeilge a dhéanamh.  Ach ní fíor ar fad an teideal sin.  Tá réimsí ann, ar ndóigh, ina dtig leis an mbord a bheartais féin a chur i gcrích ach tá réimsí móra tábhachtacha ann, fearacht cúrsaí oideachais, nach dtig leis an mbord ach iarracht a dhéanamh ar dhul i gcion ar ná húdaráis a bhfuil na cúramaí seo orthu go bunúsach.  Mura bhfaghann an bord lán-chomhar agus cuidiú uathusan tá thiar ar an gcuid sin dá n-iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Cuid de Chomhaltaí na Dála, mheas siad go mba cheart go mbeadh smacht éigin ag Bord na Gaeilge ar Ranna Stáit, go háirithe ar an Roinn Oideachais, ó <Col N="787" /> thaobh na Gaeilge dhe.  Ní réitím féin leis an tuairim sin.  Caithfidh gach Aire a bheith freagrach as gach gné de pholasaí a Roinne féin.  Ach más mar sin atá, is móide dá bharr an gá atá le comhoibriú fial leanúnach idir Bhord na Gaeilge agus na Ranna Stáit uilig.  Is ar an ábhar sin, agus ar iarratas speisialta an bhoird, faoi mar d'admhaigh an tAire féin, atá an t-alt sa Bhille seo a dhearbhaíos nach ar an mbord amháin atá cúram na Gaeilge ach go leanfaidh an cúram sin do na lán údarás eile, idir Ranna Stáit, boird Stáit agus Radio Telefís Éireann, mar shampla.  Níl aon mhaolú ar a ndualgaisí siúd i leith na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Molaim an laghdú atáthar a dhéanamh ar líon an bhoird ach bhí mé ag dréim le go dtabharfaí údarás don bhord nua sa Bhille seo coistí comhairleacha a bhunú ionas go bhféadaidís teacht ar chomhairle ó shaineolaithe agus ó dhaoine eile a mbeadh taithí nó suim ar leith acu i ngnéithe áirithe a bhaineas le forbairt na Gaeilge.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé le tuiscint go bhfuil an chumhacht seo ag an mBord ach b'fhearr liom féin go n-abrófaí amach go soiléir é, faoi mar a dhéantar i nAchtanna eile.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras orm ná go bhfuil an tAire Oideachais agus, ar ndóigh, Aire na Gaeltachta agus an Rialtas tré chéile, an-bháiúil leis an nGaeilge agus gur mhaith leo leas na Gaeilge a dhéanamh, ach ní ceart a bheith ag brath ar fad ar an deá-thoil.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach go ndéanfaí socraithe deimhne ar nós an chomhchoiste sin idir Bhord na Gaeilge agus an Roinn Oideachais a luaigh mé cheana.</P>
    <P>Mura ndéanfaí sin is baol go ndéanfaí neamart san obair ar fad.  Mar sin, agraim an Rialtas féachaint chuige go mbeidh iomlán chumas agus díogras na Ranna Stáit uilig taobh thiar den Ghaeilge is go dtabharfaidh siad lántacaíocht do Bhord na Gaeilge.  Mura ndéantar é seo tá mé cinnte nach mbeidh rath ar shaothar Bhord na Gaeilge, agus rud i bhfad níos measa is níos truamhéalaí fós, nach mbeidh slánú i ndán don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Thagair mé, nuair a labhair mé an chéad uair, do na deacrachtaí a bhain le <Col N="788" /> earcú foirne faoi rialacha Choimisinéirí na Státseirbhíse.  Ba ghnáthach go dtógfadh sé beagnach bliain orainn duine foirne a fháil agus mar bharr ar an mi-ádh ní túisce a bheadh an duine sin fostaithe ná bhíodh orainn dúl i mbun na n-oibre arís siocair duine eile a bheith ag imeacht uainn&mdash;ag casadh ar a sheanphost nó ag dul ar aghaidh go dtí post eile i ngeall ar é bheith mí-shásta nó faiteach faoi stadas nó faoi chumas gníomha an bhoird.  Is maith an rud é go gcuirtear deireadh leis an éigcinnteacht maidir le stadas agus cuspóir an bhoird sa Bhille seo, agus go scaoiltear saor ó laincisí Choimisinéirí na Státseirbhíse é. Is mór an dul chun cinn é seo agus is ceart a bheith an-bhuíoch dá bharr.</P>
    <P>Os ag trácht ar chúrsaí foirne mé, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an bord a bhí ann go dtí seo, agus pobal na hÉireann i gcoitinne, d'fhéadfainn a rá, faoi chomaoin mhór ag Seán de Fréine, a bhí mar phríomhoifigeach againn ó thús, agus ag a lucht tacaíochta, as ucht ar chaith siad de dhíogras le gnaithí an Bhoird, d'ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí uilig a bhain dúinn.  Má tá bláth ag teacht anois ar réamhobair an Bhoird, is dóibh siúd is mó atá an chreidiúint ag dul. Agus os ag trácht ar dhaoine mé b'olo an mhaise dhom gan comhaltaí an bhoird a mholadh as a ndearna siad go fonnmhar, gan chúiteamh, chun an bhunchloch a leagan agus structúr fónta a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Ní hé amháin go bhfuil an bhunchloch leagtha anois ach, mar is léir ón chlár a foilsíodh i Mí Feabhra, tá tionscnaimh fhónta faoi lán tseol d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar chumas sa Ghaeilge i measc daoine fásta agus pásti miona, d'fhonn úsáid na Gaeilge i bpobail éagsúla a leathnú, agus d'fhonn tuiscint an phobail i gcoitinne do thábhacht na Gaeilge agus méid a meas uirthí a neartú.  Tá an síol curtha ag an chéad Bhord neamhreachtúil.  Sé an Bord nua reachtúil a bhainfeas an barr, agus tá súil agam barr torrthúil, trom a bhéas ann.</P>
    <P>As our objective is a bilingual society it would be wrong, in my view, to have the whole of this debate in Irish as if it were a matter only for those already competent or interested in the language. 'Sé pobal na hÉireann ar fad, agus ní <Col N="789" /> pobal na Gaeilge amháin, pobal Bhord na Gaeilge.  I do not wish to repeat what I have said in Irish about problems which have beset the board so far but for which this Bill now provides a welcome remedy.  I hope in particular that from now on the board will be assured of the full co-operation of the Department of Education and other bodies with major responsibilities for the advancement of the Irish language.  Thinking in particular of that 70 per cent of the population who do not claim any competence in Irish I should like to put in a few words why the efforts of Bord na Gaeilge deserve the full and active support not just of Departments and RTE and other official bodies but of every Irish man, woman and child.</P>
    <P>The board, like Comhairle na Gaeilge before them, have given much thought to the philosophy which should underline their approach to the public.  It is recognised that in Ireland there is a very special linguistic problem.  In other countries the active study of two or three languages may be needed to ensure full national communicability and solidarity, or to promote trade, tourism and converse with one's neighbours, or to give access to educational and literary advantages.  The case for bilingualism in Ireland, however, does not rest on any practical necessity.  Ninety-eight per cent of the population speak English as their mother tongue and the remainder speak English as a second language.  So the Irish people already have a high proficiency in a world language, and there is no necessity for purposes of communication or wider access to learning to provide a <i>lingua franca,</i> or to promote bilingualism.</P>
    <P>The case for bilingualism here rests rather an a recognition that the Irish language is a most precious heritage, the thing that most signifies and maintains our continuity as a distinctive people, the key to a treasure-house of poetry and prose epics, folklore and song, which has expressed the imagination and feeling, the wisdom and humour, all the varied responses of generations of Irish people to life and its vicissitudes from the early centuries down, indeed, to our own day. If Ireland is to become bilingual it will be <Col N="790" /> through the influence of love and esteem for Irish rather than through any linguistic or economic necessity.</P>
    <P>Our interaction with other influences, especially the English language, has also enriched us, but English does not carry all our traditions, all the emotions and aspirations we have experienced as a people.  The roots of Irish go deeper in our history and culture.  Putting it negatively for a moment, if as a result of indifference, the Irish language were allowed to die, the loss would be irreparable.  We would have lost one of the most important elements of our identity.  We would have cut ourselves off from an invaluable heritage and made ourselves even more vulnerable than we are already to absorption in an amorphous, Anglo-American culture. This, if rarely articulated, is the instinct we have about Irish.  It is this that leads the majority of the population, including many with very limited knowledge of and competence in Irish, to support a policy of ensuring the future of the language.  It is this sentiment that Bord na Gaeilge need to sharpen and strengthen into a will to act, to channel it into practical expression to an ever-increasing extent.  The foundations have been laid and the programme announced by the board for 1978 shows the variety of well-considered means by which the board, with the help of continuing research, will be trying to promote competence in and use of the Irish language and also understanding of its value and importance to us as a community.</P>
    <P>Whatever degree of appreciation and love may be generated in the public at large, a policy of bilingualism would, I fear, be doomed to sterility if the living source of the language, the Gaeltacht, were to contract further and continue to weaken.  The last few generations have seen the everyday use of Irish ebb so fast that there now remain only scattered pools of varying size, mainly along the western seaboard.  The smaller Gaeltacht communities are particularly vulnerable to extinction.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Seoirse Ó Colla, did much to help sustain the Gaeltacht and its morale when he set up Radio na Gaeltachta, which has since had a rather <Col N="791" /> chequered career, but the need for a whole range of supportive measures and for the development of local self-reliance and initiative remains vital.  The life-line of continuity with the past has worn dangerously thin.  I suppose that, in my own life-time, the genuine Gaeltacht has shrunk by 60 per cent.  I have had the sad experience of visiting and talking to the last native Irish-speakers in Omeath and on the edge of the Burren, and I am familiar, as the Minister is, with areas in north-west Mayo where the only fluent speakers of Irish left are people of our own age or older.  What a tragedy it would be to see presented on our television screens the last native Irish-speaker from Carna or Ranafast.</P>
    <P>Bord na Gaeilge have a most difficult but also a most important task&mdash;the task of keeping Irish alive and ensuring that it will be a strong and active element in a bilingual situation.  I must confess I would not have thought it necessary to propose the addition of the words in the Bill &ldquo;gnáthmheán cumarsáide&rdquo;. There is a lot to be done on the way towards any such objective.  The board need and deserve as much freedom and flexibility and as relatively generous access to resources as are conceded to any of our State bodies.  I have pressed for this as chairman of the board.  I am glad to recognise the greatly increased provision which the Minister was able to make this year and the general improvements made in this Bill.  As regards resources, I should like to urge strongly that these be enlarged soon to enable the board to finance a well thought-out professional publicity programme aimed at promoting understanding throughout the community of the importance of the Irish language and at having it more widely spoken.  This is no less necessary in relation to Irish than in relation to health, road safety and similar matters.</P>
    <P>Ag casadh ar an nGaeilge dom, agus mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom a mheabhrú arís gurab é cuspóir Bhord na Gaeilge pobal na hÉireann uilig a spreagadh chun comhoibriú dá ndeoin agus dá dtoil féin chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo.  Ar eagla go gceapfaí go raibh cuid dá ndúírt <Col N="792" /> mé pas beag gruama, ní miste dhom a bhfuil d'ábhar dóchais againn a lua sul a scoraim.</P>
    <P>Tá cumas leathan Gaeilge ann nach bhfuil feidhm á bhaint as.  Tá lucht labhartha na Gaeilge le fáil i ngach réim de shaol na tíre.  Tá cumas léimh sa Ghaeilge níos leithne ná mar a bhí sé riamh roimhe.  Tá forbairt agus caighdeánú déanta ar an teanga.  Tá litríocht bheo dá cumadh sa Ghaeilge. Tá lucht éisteachta agus féachana, nach beag, do chláracha i nGaeilge ar an raidio agus ar an teilifís.  Tá modhanna múinte teanga ar fáil anois atá níos tarrantaí agus níos éifeachtaí ná mar a bhíodh.  Tá tuiscint níos fearr ar fhadhbanna teanga, a bhuíochas sin don Tuarascáil ar Dhearcadh an Phobail.  Tá báídh mhórchuid an phobail leis an nGaeilge.  'Sé tá le déanamh againn féachaint chuige go mbainfear leas as na buntáistí seo agus nach gceilfear cabhair nó airgead nó achmhainn gníomha ar Bhord na Gaeilge san saothar neamhghnáthach ach fíor-thábhachtach a dhaingnítear orthu sa Bhille seo.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille agus comhgháirdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht an Bille a thabhairt isteach. Tá súil agam go n-eireoidh leis Bord na Gaeilge a chur ag feidhmiú i gceart agus go gcuirfidh sé an Ghaeilge chun cinn i measc an phobail.  Ba mhaith liom freisin cuidiú leis na focail mholta a dúirt sé faoin Seanadóir Whitaker, an Seanadóir Mulcahy agus an Seanadóir Brugha a bhí mar chomhalta de Chomhairle na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Luaigh chuid mhaith de na Seanadóirí cúrsaí oideachais agus staid na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais.  Ba mhaith liom tagairt ar an bhfadhb a fheicimse sna scoileanna, sé sin, easpa téacsleabhar do na daltaí scoile.  Níl fhios agam faoin chaighdeán atá sna scoileanna.  Bhí a lán le rá ag na Seanadóirí faoin chaighdeán sna coláistí oiliúna agus an caighdeán atá ag na habhar-mhuinteoirí atá ag teacht amach as na coláistí oiliúna.  Táim cinnte go bhfuil easpa téacsleabhar agus ba mhaith liom go ndéanfaidh an Roinn iarracht eile na téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táim sásta go mbeidh an bord nua ag <Col N="793" /> déanamh caidreamh le Radio Telefis Eireann i dtaobh níos mó suime a chur sa Ghaeilge agus ba mhaith liomsa go mbeadh béim ar chláracha Gaeilge ar RTE 2 nuair a chuirtear ar bun é, agus go mbeidh cláracha speisialta i gcomhair páistí óga nuair a chuirtear RTE 2 ar siúl.  Tá cláracha cosúil le &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; an-shuimiúil mar go bhfuil ceol, damhsa, filíocht agus scéalta ann, agus mar go bhfuil na cláracha sin i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. Ba mhaith an rud é go mbeadh cláracha mar sin ar siúl ar an dteilifís, mar shampla, &ldquo;Tráth na gCeist&rdquo; agus go mbeidh ceisteanna san dá theanga ann.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán le déanamh freisin ag an mbord le Cumann Lúthchleas Ghael, agus is maith an rud é go bhfuil comórtais cosúil le Scór na nÓg ar siúl.  Tá i bhfad níos mó le déanamh, sílim, ag Cumann Lúthchleas Ghael i saol na ndaoine chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Ba mhaith liom go gcoinneoidh Bord na Gaeilge an caidreamh sin ar siúl leis an eagras sin.</P>
    <P>Tá sé soiléir ón méid a dúirt an Aire go bhfuil tacaíocht an phobail ag dul don Ghaeilge.  Luaigh an Aire dhá bhaile, Caisleán an Bharraigh agus Rath Cúil, áiteanna a raibh feachtas speisialta ar siúl.  Feicimid in áiteanna eile ar fud na tíre go bhfuil seachtain Ghaelach ar siúl. Ba mhaith liomsa go mbeadh seachtain Ghaelach nó rud speisialta mar sin ar siúl ar fud na tíre agus go mbeadh seans ag na daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus Gaeilge a bheith ann mar gnáthmheán cumarsáide.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil suim i gceol agus i gcluichí agus i damhsaí Ghaelacha agus tá an teanga fite-fuaite istigh leis na rudaí sin go léir. Níl a dhóthain ar an dteilifís chun an traidisiún sin a fheiceáil.  Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfímís na cláracha sin ar siúl.</P>
    <P>I gcontae cosúil le Gaillimh, áit a bhfuil Radio na Gaeltachta, tá seans againn cláracha speisialta a chloisteáil, agus ba mhaith liomsa go mbeadh oifígeach oideachais i ngach contae, go háirithe i gcontae ina bhfuil Gaeltacht ann agus contae ina bhfuil Radio na Gaeltachta le cloisteáil.  Sa chaoi sin bheadh seans againn, b'fhéidir, cúrsaí oideachais a chur ar siúl ar Radio na <Col N="794" /> Gaeltachta.  'Sé atá i gceist agam ná adult education officer nó education officer a bheadh ag plé le cúrsaí oideachais agus a thabharfadh seans do dhaoine cúrsa oideachais a leanúint ar raidio.  Tá sé sin ana-thábhachtacht in áiteanna ina bhfuil Radio na Gaeltachta le cloisteáil.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom aris fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an mbord gach a bhfuil ceaptha acu a dhéanamh a chur chun críche agus tá súil agam freisin go mbeidh tacaíocht an phobail ag dul don Ghaeilge leis na mílte bliana eile.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús is mian liom a rá go bhfuil áthas orm gurb é Bord na Gaeilge teideal don Bhille seo agus nach &ldquo;Bord na Gaeltachta&rdquo; an teideal.  Is iomaí uair a cheap mé go raibh an teideal mí-cheart ag an Aire. Ceapaim féin go mba chóir &ldquo;Aire na Gaeilge&rdquo; a bheith mar theideal aige os rud é go bhfuil an Ghaeilge níos tábhachtachtaí sa Ghalltacht ná sa Ghaeltacht.  Más mian linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil, ceapaim féin gur san nGalltacht a dhéanfaimid an obair sin.  Tá an obair níos deacra sa Ghalltacht ná sa Ghaeltacht.  Is iomadh uair freisin a cheap mé go bhfuil sé riachtanach deontas £10 a thabhairt do pháistí sa Ghaeltacht as an Ghaeilge a labhairt sna tithe agus go mba cheart freisin an deontas céanna a thabhairt do pháistí na Galltachta a bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa acu.  Ceart go leor, b'fhéidir nach mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu sa bhaile ó mhaidin go hoíche; ceapaim féin más féidir leo an Ghaeilge a labhairt go líofa go mba chóir don Aire an deontas céanna a thabhairt dos na páistí seo.</P>
      <P>Freisin, tá deontas tithe £2,000 ar fáil do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht os rud é go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt sna tithe agus os rud é go bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa acu.  Ceapaim féin go dtabharfadh sé misneach do dhaoine sa Ghalltacht dá mbeadh na deontais céanna le fáil san Ghalltacht.  Arís, b'fhéidir nach mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu gach lá ach más féidir leo an Ghaeilge a labhairt go líofa sílimse go mba cheart an deontas céanna a thabhairt dóibh leis na tithe a chur suas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> B'fhéidir go ndéartar go bhfuilfimid ag cailleadh na Gaeilge má dheinimid sin, ach ceapaim má tá sé ceart é a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil sé ceart freisin é a dhéanamh sa Ghalltacht. Má dhéantar sin sílimse féin go dtabharfaidh sé misneach don aos óg agus dos na daoine fásta níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt sa Ghalltacht agus sin é an dóigh amháin inar féidir linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil, 'sé sin, níos mó oibre a dhéanamh i ngach áit sa tír.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an bord seo á chur ar bun arís agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leo ina gcuspóir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focail a rá ar dtús.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus fáilte freisin roimh an Aire, agus táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall ar son na Gaeilge.  I speak not as one of the Gaelgeoirí who have spoken previously and for whom I have the greatest admiration and respect, but as one of those to whom An Bord Gaeilge will be devoting its attention.  In other words, I do not belong to the minority of Gaelic speakers which unfortunately is so small but to the large majority who are very much in favour of the language, who have some Irish, who wish to use it, increase their knowledge of it, and who wish to see Irish playing an increasing part in our everyday life as well as in national affairs.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see the wide powers which in effect have been given to the board under this Bill.  Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  Déanfaidh an Bord an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a húsáid mar theanga bheo, a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>(2)  Chun a fheidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh féadfaidh an Bord aon ní is iomchuí leis a dhéanamh ag teacht leis an mbeartas ginearálta,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are very wide powers indeed which will be needed because to restore the usage of a language is one of the most massive tasks that any nation can attempt.  I do not say to revive it because we have made a success of the revival of Irish.  Irish is once again a living language which is a major factor in this country's life.  The question now is of extending its use on an everyday basis.  It is only appropriate that we do so, not only <Col N="796" /> because, as other speakers have commented, it forms an important part of our heritage, but perhaps because we do not fully realise just what a magnificent part it plays.  It is one of the great languages of civilisation.  It is, together with Greek and Latin, one of the three oldest vernacular languages in Europe and it also has many unique features which are rarely found in other western European languages.</P>
    <P>If one uses an expression such as &ldquo;Tá sé ina mhúinteoir&rdquo;, one has to go to Russian or Finnish to find a corresponding expression or way of speaking.  There are many other unique features of the language, including perhaps one of the most interesting aspects which is its exactness for a translator.  Words which are in common usage in English, in common usage in the Oireachtas and in Government documents, such as &ldquo;development&rdquo; in fact are very inexact words in English and were one putting these words into Irish, as our translators have to do for a Bill such as this and for many other Bills, one would find oneself translating what is a vague concept in English into a very exact concept in Irish.  We often think of the many English importations into Irish.  We do not realise quite so often how many importations there are into English from Irish.  For example, in English one of the most difficult phrases for a Frenchman or a German to learn to differentiate between is &ldquo;I go&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am going&rdquo;. This, although such an essential and distinctive part of the English language today, is a relatively recent development in English whereas in Gaelic it is a conception which has been going for over 1,000 years and imported from the Gaelic into the English.</P>
    <P>If we are reviving a language we have to be extremely positive about it.  We also have to be extremely understanding. I recommend the very excellent report which was prepared by An Coiste um Thaighde ar Dhearcadh an Phobail i dTaobh na Gaeilge, i 1975 for the Minister.  It is an excellent report by any standards, scientific or otherwise, thoroughly researched, carefully documented and an extremely vital report for any serious effort to extend the use of Irish.  It is quite a long report, <Col N="797" /> but among the points mentioned in it are the serious problems which affect the notice speaker of Gaelic.  If one goes to France or Germany people will accept that one's knowledge of their language is perhaps inadequate, but one is quite happy about using it.  It is not always the case here.  There is somewhat of a gap between the Gaelgeoir speaking the Irish language and those of us whose knowledge is much more limited.  If Irish is to spread and to be widely used it is absolutely vital that this gap be narrowed. The only way it will be a living language is if the people as a whole, or substantial numbers of them, are willing to speak the language even if their knowledge is not perfect and then to gradually improve their knowledge.  One of the very interesting things about this report is where it comes across this aspect at page 336 and was obviously somewhat surprised by it.  It states:</P>
    <P>To conclude, the establishment of Irish usage in an existing relationship, or the building of new relationships through Irish, faces individuals who want to speak and expand their use of Irish with very serious problems&mdash; more serious than we had anticipated.</P>
    <P>Most Gaelgeoirí are extremely helpful and understanding.  Even so it is very difficult to appreciate the problems facing someone who has a little Irish and wishes to speak more of it.  One finds, for example, that almost immediately the fluent Irish speaker, perhaps in order to save one embarrassment, will switch into English and continue to speak in English where certainly one would be very glad if, they did switch entirely into English and continue in English but gave a little support.  It is essential for Gaelgeoirí to do this whenever they find someone using a little Irish.  The Cathaoirleach is most helpful in this respect.  It must be realised that there is an enormous gap for somebody able to read Irish, perhaps slowly, and able to speak a few or quite a few words, but who is lost very quickly if someone is speaking fluently and repidly in Irish.  Fluent Irish speakers should place themselves in the position of the novice, or the person without an enormous usage, where it becomes a very different matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> Page 356 of this report reads:</P>
    <P>In the past, Irish language policies were based on a misunderstanding of the potentialities of the existing educational system.  Although that system was not designed to produce communicative competence in second languages, it was taken for granted that the task of producing Irish speakers could be left mainly to the schools.</P>
    <P>There is a slight danger here, with the trend of some of the communications I have heard in regard to Bord na Gaeilge It is no use now thinking that perhaps we have emphasised the writing of Irish too much in the past, and not empasised oral Irish sufficiently.  It would also be totally inadequate to assume that we can now, by putting an emphasis on oral Irish, totally correct the position.  I am not saying that the emphasis should not be more on oral Irish&mdash;it is absolutely essential that it should&mdash;but let us not assume that it can all be done by the schools.  It cannot.  A little further down it makes the very correct point:</P>
    <P>Given the complexity of the problems involved it is, therefore, our very strong conviction that unless future policy developments are based on solidly researched foundations&mdash; particularly in sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics&mdash;and unless the consequences of policy alternatives are being continuously monitored we could very easily end up with a cumulative decline in Irish over the next 50 years.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential for Bord na Gaeilge to have some form of monitoring system of the effects of the various proposals, projects, and plans they are putting forward.  If they do not do so they will be working very much in the dark, and the benefit of the many excellent plans which I understand they will be carrying out will be largely lost.</P>
    <P>Another point in the same paragraph is that:</P>
    <P>The policies adopted up to now have failed to arrest the decline of Irish in the Gaeltacht&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker commented on this <Col N="799" />&mdash;&mdash;but have built up levels of ability and usage in non-Gaeltacht areas which numerically offset the losses in the Gaeltacht.  This apparent equilibrium conceals the fact that the use of Irish as a community language is still diminishing.</P>
    <P>Here again we come back to the essential point of the spread of the usage of Irish.  The Gaeltacht areas are absolutely vital and should get far more support than we have been able to give them in the past, but that is not enough in itself. Then they give a number of points on page 317 which are very important. These are that the critical areas appear to be</P>
    <P>(i)  Improving or renewing competence and preventing slippage.</P>
    <P>On leaving school at present one has a fairly good knowledge of written Irish, and I hope a knowledge of oral Irish, but given 18 months or two years that knowledge has sadly slipped.  This is one of the areas which we will have to look at very carefully.  How can opportunities be given, encouragement be given, to the usage of Irish during that critical two- to three-year period.  After that period to get people to start relearning the language over again in their twenties, thirties or forties is a very difficult if not an impossible task.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Building up competence through school curricula.</P>
    <P>This is an obvious thing which I am sure Bord na Gaeilge will be looking at.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Improving ability levels in adults.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Translating current and any future build up of ability into usage.</P>
    <P>(v)  The use of Irish on the broadcasting media&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which we suggest.</P>
    <P>(vi)  The capacity of the public service to respond to the use of Irish and particularly to serve the Gaeltacht areas through Irish.</P>
    <P>(vii)  The correction of population decline and language shift in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Provision of educational <Col N="800" /> facilities through Irish at every level for Gaeltacht students and an adequate supply of appropriate textbooks in Irish.</P>
    <P>Here there seems to be in practical terms a great lack.  If one wishes to read in French, for instance, one finds many books available in which one has for example dual translations&mdash;on the left the French, on the right the English or whatever the other language may be.  If one is a modest reader of French, one is able to read on the French page and occasionally glance over, where necessary, to the English or German translation. Rapidly one's ability to read that language increases.  If on the other hand one takes up an Irish book and one has a modest knowledge of the language one finds constantly that the flow of one's reading is being interrupted by the necessity to go to a dictionary, perhaps to look at quite complex constructions.  In effect, this militates against reading Irish.  For all the support that has been mentioned of oral Irish it is essential also that the cultural heritage in reading Irish be increased.  Opportunities should be provided for people who wish to continue to read Irish and to develop their reading.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, one of the very few textbooks or books available in this respect is &ldquo;Tithe an Oireachtais, Tigh Laighin, Leinster House&rdquo;.  This talks about our own Seanad Chamber.  Gaelic is used on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side there is English.  So you can largely read through the Irish with only the occasional glance at the English.  It is a small practical point, not perhaps apparent to somebody whose Irish is already extremely fluent.  We should be interested in people whose Irish is not already fluent but who are anxious to increase their proficiency and we should be doing a lot more to help them.</P>
    <P>One of the other points which is extremely important and of which we should not lose sight is that, by and large, most people are in favour of the language.  It is a question of using persuasion rather than pressure.  If we do that, if we look at these small practical points, we may well look forward, quite rightly, to a considerable increase in the <Col N="801" /> use of Irish, this magnificent cultural heritage of which we all are so proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Táimid go léir buíoch den Aire as ucht an Bhille seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair inniu.  Dúirt an tAire gur beag daoine san tir seo nar fhoghlaim an Ghaeilge ar scoil ach gur chaill siad é nuair a fhág siad an scoil mar nach mbíonn cleachtadh ag na daoine sin san teanga.  Is oth liom a rá gur duine mise a chaill cleachtadh sa teanga, ach, pé scéal é, ba mhaith liom cúpla focail a rá inniu i dtaobh an Bhille.</P>
      <P>Tá sé go soiléir dúinn go bhfuil difríochtaí ann i dtaobh cad atá le déanamh chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú i measc na ndaoine.  Chuala mé daoine ag caint faoi Ghaeilgeoirí agus an Ghaeltacht agus cad a thuigeann na gnáth-dhaoine faoi Ghaelgeoirí, gur &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; é, duine nach bhfuil aon rud ina cheann ach an Ghaeilge, agus duine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge aige níl sé ina Ghael cheart.  Cad is ciall leis an bhfocal &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo;?  Do a lán daoine, ciallaionn an focal &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; áit ar a dtéann daoine ar scoil ón meán-aicme chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim san samhradh.  An bhfuil sé fíor gurb é sin an t-aon rud a chiallaíonn &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo;?  Nó an gciallaíonn sé áit ina mbíonn gach rud Gaelach ann i measc na ndaoine&mdash;teanga, spóirt, rince agus ceol?  An bhfuil siad sin le foghlaim san áit úd?</P>
      <P>Ag caint faoin mbord seo, an mbeidh sé ann chun an Ghaeilge a spreagadh i measc na ndaoine san Ghaeltacht nó an mbeidh sé ann chun grá don Ghaeilge a leathnú i measc na ndaoine sna háiteanna eile sa tír?  I gContae Chill Chainnigh tá Conradh na Gaeilge ag obair ar feadh mórán blianta chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú.  Tá rudaí íontacha déanta ann. Bíonn deacrachtaí ann ag daoine cosúil liom féin nach bhfuil a lán Gaeilge acu, ach tá an conradh anois dhá-theangach. Is féidir liomsa dul síos go dtí Conradh na Gaeilge agus bíonn Gaeilge á labhairt acu ach muna bhfuil focal Gaeilge ag duine, úsáideann siad an focal Béarla.  Is ceart é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dtaobh na teilifíse, tá an-obair á déanamh ag Liam Ó Murchú.  Suíonn daoine síos nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge acu agus bíonn áthas orthu nuair a <Col N="802" /> bhionn focal san chlár go bhfuil aithne acu air.  An tseachtain ina dhiaidh sin tuigeann siad focal eile.  Is é sin an modh chun an Ghaeilge a spreagadh.  Is oth liom a rá nach bhfuil am go leor ag an gclár sin.  Tá uair go leíth ag an &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  Bhí uair go leith ag &ldquo;Trom agus Edrom&rdquo; agus níl ach trí-cheathrú uaire aige anois.  Cad na thaobh?  Bhí an clár sin go hiontacht maith.  Cad na thaobh go bhfuil laghdú ar an am a ritheann sé?</P>
    <P>As I say, I am one of the people who lost their Irish through non-use.  The non-use of the language is a symptom of what happens to most of us when we leave school.  We do not get the opportunity to use the language.  There is no use in any Department, even the Department of Education, sending me out a letter starting with &ldquo;A chara&rdquo; and finishing with &ldquo;Is mise&rdquo;.  Regardless of which Department it is, it is an insult to a person's intelligence to send him out a letter starting with &ldquo;A chara&rdquo;, continuing in English, and finishing off with &ldquo;Is mise,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is mise le fíor mheas&rdquo;.  A number of organisations use the same type of address when sending out letters. They should either have the decency to send them out totally in Irish and, if the person cannot translate it himself, he can have it translated, or send it out totally in English if it is addressed to somebody who has no Irish.</P>
    <P>I was talking to somebody who did an honours paper in the intermediate certificate on Wednesday.  I asked him what it was like.  He said it was very simple. When I asked him what he meant he said it was less difficult than last year's paper.  I asked why this was so and I was told fewer people are learning the language in the secondary schools now and there is very little interest in the language and, if the papers set are easier, better results are obtained and more people will do Irish next year.  If that is the thinking in official quarters, it will do more harm than good.  People can see through things like that very easily.</P>
    <P>What does the Gaeltacht mean to people outside the Gaeltacht areas?  Is it an area which receives more than its fair share of Government funds in an attempt to keep people speaking Irish in an area where it had been dying?  Is it a <Col N="803" /> place where middle-class people can send their children for a year in an attempt to learn Irish or to get a better education than they were getting in their schools and then they can go back to the schools outside the Gaeltacht and forget all the Irish they learned?</P>
    <P>How successful has the Gaeltacht been in maintaining our native culture in sport, in drama, in play?  I wonder has it been successful?  I sincerely hope that this board will not confine their activities in the main to the Gaeltacht areas but be effective right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The work done in non-Gaeltacht areas by people who are very interested in the Irish language and Irish culture often can be forgotten.  We see Comhaltas Ceoltóiri and Conradh na Gaeilge working in places outside the Gaeltacht under difficult circumstances. The work they do may be forgotten, but they are doing a marvellous job for the Irish language and to foster a love of the Irish language.  These people are not doing it because they are getting extra grants.  They are not doing it because they are in what is classified as a Gaeltacht area.  They are doing it because they love the language and they would like many others to love it also.</P>
    <P>The Gaelic League has changed from the Gaelic League of 20 years ago when, if you spoke a word of English at a Gaelic League night you were thrown out and you were never let back in again.  They will now allow you to speak English if you do not know Irish.  They will try to speak Irish with you if you are not very good at it, and you can use English and Irish words mixed up.  That is as it should be.  You will never force a language down anybody's throat, and in the past this was attempted.</P>
    <P>One of the major items the board should have a look at is the provision of books in the Irish language.  The cost of buying Irish language books at present is totally prohibitive.  Books costing nothing were published by the Russian Embassy and they are the best children's books I have seen published in the Irish language.  It might be said this is propaganda, but it is a type of propaganda I should like to see extended.  The language in the books <Col N="804" /> is very simple and the beautiful illustrations are magnificent.  They are an example of what could be done to make the Irish language more attractive to children.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House any longer. I welcome the Bill and I hope the members of the board will take cognisance of the fact that there is a need to spread the Irish language amongst people who have not got it at all.  There is a need to spread it amongst those who have very little of it, and there is also a need to help the people who have a lot of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rá i mBearla.  I welcome the opportunity the Minister has given to people like me who might be reluctant to speak on the Bill in Gaeilge.  I admit that I have not got a good knowledge of the Gaelic language.  The fact that the Bill has been printed in English as well as Irish has widened the base on which discussion can take place.  This is a helpful approach.  It is a completely new approach, and I certainly welcome it.  I welcome the provision in the Bill to promote the Irish language.  The Minister said last week that he is relying on the co-operation of everyone.  This is the proper approach, and the only approach to get results.  I know how difficult it is to extend the use of the Irish language.  Part of the area I come from has non-Irish speakers and part of it has Gaelic speakers.</P>
      <P>In the past there was far too much of the fanatic on the part of those who believe very strongly in promoting the Irish language.  I have watched this.  Let me quote an example of how that attitude fails.  In my own county a ceili was being promoted and those who were promoting it believed so strongly that there should be ceili dancing only that they stopped the band from playing an old-time waltz.  To do that they had to switch off the power.  Regrettably ceilis are no longer being held where they used to be.  One should realise from that that being a fanatic about anything is the proper way to kill it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister.  It is in keeping with his broad approach to everything he is doing <Col N="805" /> to promote industry, the language and the whole development of the Gaeltacht.  It gives us an opportunity to talk about developments in the Gaeltacht and to look at what is happening there.  I have had occasion to meet the Minister and his secretary, Liam O Toibin.  His approach is one I have always welcomed.  When the Irish language is being spoken in company it is important to realise that somebody may not be very fluent in the language.  I want to say publicly that I have always appreciated how quickly the secretary of the Department could recognise how important it was to keep everybody involved in the discussion taking place. That is the way to encourage all of us to get involved and to have a more reasonable approach to promoting the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw my remarks.  I said that in good faith.  I am not looking for any favours and I hope the House will accept that.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Department and the Minister on the great work they are doing for those who speak the language and for those living in the Gaeltacht areas, especially in my county.  We have had tremendous industrial development in County Donegal.  If that industrial development had not taken place, a very large sum of the taxpayer's money would have to be used to pay dole and unemployment benefit.  The Department of the Gaeltacht deserve praise and support from all of us for the tremendous work they are doing in providing jobs in the Gaeltacht.  Before you will get people to talk the language, you must provide the bread and butter.  That is being done in a tremendous way.  I admire the energy of the Minister.  He spends time every week-end meeting the people and seeing how he can further the cause of those living in the Gaeltacht areas.  I am hopeful that this new board will extend the Gaeltacht to the Breac-Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will give everybody an opportunity <Col N="806" /> to look at the whole programme to help those who would like to speak the Irish language.  The BreacGhaeltacht is an area where we could make most progress and where we would be likely to get the quickest results.  I would ask the Minister to see if it is possible to extend the available activities and benefits to the BreacGhaeltacht, for schools and housing.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not forget the hand-knit industries which are so important and so much a part of our tradition, and that he will not allow the hand-knit industries to be taken over completely by industrialists from outside who see them purely as a commercial venture. That would kill the tradition, the culture and the native tongue in the area.  Unfortunately, many people come to the Gaeltacht to take advantage of the substantial grants available there and set up industries which could very easily kill the traditional hand-knit industries.  No substitute which looks like a hand-knit garment should be allowed to be marketed under the name of being hand-knit. The Minister should take great care to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by telling a short story. On St. Patrick's Night I went to Gweedore and I was invited to say a few words.  Gweedore is in the heart of the Gaeltacht.  I said a few words in Gaelic and I said them in Bearla again.  I just said I was glad to be in Gweedore and that I would like to assist every development taking place in Gweedore.  Later another speaker said in Gaelic&mdash;hoping I might not understand&mdash;he was glad to see a change of heart from Senator McGowan because in the past I had not always been helpful to Gweedore and that I had tried very hard to take an AnCO training industry out of it.  This was totally false.  In fact, I have been helpful to Gweedore.  It is my intention to go back to Gweedore and to be able to say mo chúpla focal i nGaeilge and to answer my friend in Gaelic in Gweedore.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Tá cuspóir agus aidhm an-thábhachtach san mBille chun Bord na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus chun an teanga Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn imease na ndaoine.  Tá brón <Col N="807" /> orm a rá freisin go gcaithfidh mise caint as Béarla tar éis cúpla nóiméad.</P>
      <P>Is deacair liom a thuiscint cén fáth nach mbaineann i bhfad níos mó daoine úsáid as an méid Gaeilge atá acu.  Is deacair dom a thuiscint cad 'na thaobh nach ndeineann mise é sin freisin.  Tá go leor Gaeilge ag daoine óga tar éis bheith ar scoil; tá cuid mhaith Gaeilge ag mórchuid de na daoine, san nGaeilge.  Ag an agam ach go bhfuil an shuim ag mórchuid de na daoine san nGaeilge.  Ag an am chéanna ní bhainimíd go léir úsáid aisti mar ba cheart.  Ní bhainimíd anseo san Seanad úsáid as Gaeilge mar ba cheart.  Is deacair é sin a thuiscint, mar tá an-ghrá ann agus tá an-shuim ann. B'fhéidir go bhfuil saghas psychological block ann.  Ag an am chéanna tá job an-thábhachtach le déanamh ag an mbord seo, atá ceapaithe san mBille, agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leo an job sin a dhéanamh i gceart.  Tá sé an-thábhachtach don tír agus dúinn uile sa tír.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I find it necessary to comment also in English simply because it is too slow and too difficult to carry on this type of debate in Irish.  That is something I really find hard to understand as I said because most people know enough Irish leaving school, and they retain enough, but lack of opportunity to use it, as Senator Lanigan suggested, is probably one of the reasons nach bhfuil sé ann go flúirseach.  Possibly there is also a type of hesitancy or maybe a type of psychological block which we all may have to some extent.  An cuspóir atá sa Bhille seo, the aim here, will help us all to get over this by speading an appreciation of Irish, by bringing to notice for public consideration and for action, areas where Irish can be used to very good effect to the benefit of those who wish to use it, and who have a genuine and undoubted basic desire to use it more, and to see it used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that the influence and the work of the board should spread throughout the whole country, throughout the area of public work and public service and influence the normal and everyday life of the people.  To do that, as envisaged in the Bill, a great deal of work obviously will have to be done in <Col N="808" /> harmony with other Government Departments. There may be many areas where, for example, the board may be in a position to suggest changes and developments in the approach in our schools. The attitude to teaching Irish has improved tremendously over the past generation.  A very definite and genuine love for Irish is indicated by the way it is taught.  Many schools have set a very fine example.  In my constituency, Scoil Bhride in Ranelagh has set an excellent example of co-operation between teachers and parents in promoting a genuine and a natural love of and attachment to the language for its own sake.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a point which has been raised on other occasions, and possibly in this debate before I arrived, that is, how the oral Irish examination in the leaving certificate ranks for marking. Our basic policy is to encourage the spoken language, to encourage bilingualism, and it seems to me perfectly natural and logical that far greater emphasis should be put on the scrúdú béil, the spoken word, in the examination at the end of the students' term.  I know the proportion of marks going to the oral examination has increased over the years but it should be as high as 50 per cent.  After all, our basic aim is to encourage the spoken word.  Surely we should pursue an educational course consistent with that and have an examination system based on the course which is logical to the basic policy.  That would encourage the use of the language and a facility with the language even better than we have been able to achieve. There has been a tremendous improvement in the past generation.  That is something which merits more consideration and more thought at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>There are many other Departments of State where Bord na Gaeilge can assist and co-operate.  Education is one of particular importance.  I would also like to refer to the media and communication. RTE have had some excellent programmes designed to promote Irish.  They have also, through Irish, succeeded in entertaining the public to a very high degree.  It is generally accepted that programmes like &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;<Col N="809" /> and &ldquo;Amuigh Faoin Spéir&rdquo;, particularly in their bilingual aspects, have been appropriate for promoting the use of Irish in an easy, relaxed and genuine manner.</P>
    <P>In one of the earlier programmes designed to teach Irish, Buntús Cainte, the format and approach adopted was the best I have seen on RTE.  Buntús Cainte hit the right note and in a relaxed, easy and genuine manner encouraged the use of Irish and did great good to the viewing public.</P>
    <P>In the field of drama it has often struck me that a number of countries advance the image, the culture and the language of their own countries through the cinema.  They promote the use of their language through the film industry. This is an industry which seems to have difficulty establishing a natural base in Ireland but some of the principles which apply to that also apply to radio and television.  The use of Irish in drama should be seen essentially as a means of entertainment but if at the right note and in the right pitch it can have a tremendously beneficial effect in spreading the use of Irish and increasing the public's facility in the use of Irish.  I would suggest that in the role of drama, where plays are presented as Gaeilge, it might be reasonable, and certainly not very revolutionary, to provide that type of drama with sub-titles in English.  It would induce people who feel they have no Irish whatever not to turn off and it would also make it that much easier for people whose Gaeilge is cosúil leis an Gaeilge atá agam.  It would fill in the gap so that the continuity is preserved.  The use of bilinguals in that way, the dialogue as Gaeilge and sub-titles in English where it is appropriate in that type of drama, may be something which RTE and Bord na Gaeilge could consider in the future.</P>
    <P>In areas such as health and justice it is absolutely essential that those for whom Irish is their first and natural spoken language should have available to them the services they are entitled to as citizens, in Irish as a principle, but also because of their right to treatment or access in the way which is most convenient to them.  Indeed, in the areas of health I <Col N="810" /> have no doubt there are many examples where people from the Gaeltacht find recovery, or involvement in treatment, much more difficult if they have to converse in English with the medical staff. That is obviously no fault of the medical staff but it is just one of these things which happens.  Elderly people, particularly, whose every day language is Irish and who find it necessary to go to hospital are treated through English and there may be psychological problems. They have not only a right as a principle but they have a basic need to be treated professionally and competently as Gaeilge.  The same principle should apply throughout many other areas of the public service but, in that area, the area of health, it is extremely important.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and also on his general attitude and the support he has given to the spread of Irish and the natural and aúthentic appreciation of Irish among the public.  The public have been waiting for a Minister such as we have to bring to them what they are essentially looking for, an outlet for the Irish they have and a capacity to expand on what they already have.  I welcome the Bill and I wish it every success.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Mar a dúirt an tAire nuair a oscail sé an díospóireacht, bhí baint agam féin le fada leis an smaoineamh go mba cheart Bord na Gaeilge a chur ar bun, ar dtús, mar bhall an bhoird le trí bliana anois leis an Seanadóir Whitaker, agus roimhe sin mar Chathaoirleach Chomhairle na Gaeilge.  I rith an ama nuair a bhí an chomhairle sin ag obair chun cabhair a thabhairt don Rialtas polasaí teanga a chur i bhfeidhm nó ar fáil, chuir mé amach cuid mhaith tuarascála ar ábhair éagsúla a bhain leis an teanga agus ba mhaith liom san díospóireacht seo cuid de na rudaí agus na smaointí a bhí sna tuarascála sin a phlé anseo.  Chuireamar ár dtuairimí ar aghaidh don chéad uair i gComhairle na Gaeilge timpeall 1970 nó 1971, agus ní mór le rá é anois go bhfuilim ag cur fáilte roimh an mBille i 1978, sin tar éis ocht mbliana.  Má thógann sé an méid sin ama chun nithe <Col N="811" /> bunúsacha a bhaineann leis an tir a chur ag obair, go bhfóiridh Dia orainn, ach nílim ag rá nach bhfuil áthas orm anois go bhfuil Bord na Gaeilge tagtha i gcrích agus go bhfuil an Bille tar éis dul tríd an Dáil agus go bhfuil sé san Seanad.</P>
      <P>San méid atá le rá agam tá mé chun cur síos ar bhun-aidhmeanna, polasaí agus stair na dtuarascála a tháinig ó Chomhairle na Gaeilge a bhí mar shaghas bunús i gcóir Bhord na Gaeilge. &lsquo;Sé an rud is mó a chuireann isteach orm ná go bhfuilimid ag caint ar pholasaí dátheangachais, agus le fada an lá ceapaim go bhfuilimid ag dul amú ag cur an pholasaí sin i bhfeidhm mar go bhfuil an béim ar theanga in ionad é a bheith ar iompar na ndaoine nuair a bhíonn siad ag baint úsáide as teanga, agus i rith an tréimhse a bhí Comhairle na Gaeilge ag obair thángamar suas leis an choincheap ar a dtugtar <i>diglossia,</i> ón teanga Gréigis, ceapaim, &ldquo;two tongues&rdquo;.  Chuireamar an choincheap sin ar fáil agus cuireadh fáilte roimhe ar dtús, ach ina dhiaidh sin tháinig na daoine a bhí ag obair ar son na Gaeilge le chéile agus ní rabhadar chomh sásta leis an choincheap. Ceapaim féin go dtí seo go bhfuil sé bunúsach mar choincheap agus go gcaithimid níos mó ama a thabhairt leis an gcóras atá taobh thiar den nós seo coincheap-<i>diglossia.</i> Sna tuarascáil &ldquo;Towards a Language Policy&rdquo; do coincheap-<i>diglossia.</i> Sa tuarascáil liom e a leigheamh ar dtús.  Léighfidh mé as Béarla é ionas go mbeidh gach éinne in ann an coincheap a thuiscint mar tá sé teicniúil go leor.  Ag baint úsáid as Béarla i lár an méid Gaeilge atá le rá agam ceapaim go bhfuilim ag tabhairt an saghas sampla go mba cheart a bheith á thabhairt ó thaobh fhorbairt dhá-theangachais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1. An Chomhairle's main task is to advise the Government on how the Irish language can be restored as the general medium of communication. The advice must describe a set of procedures, to be established under State guidance and with State support, which would bring about the desired aim.  Since this aim cannot be achieved except progressively over an extended period, consideration has to be given to the process through which <Col N="812" /> the Irish community will have to pass in going from the present situation to the desired one.  This process must include phases of bilingualism and, viewing the time schedule realistically, it is appropriate at this stage to direct all available efforts and resources towards a bilingual objective.  This approach will not limit the options between the various linguistic alternatives which may be available to future generations.</P>
    <P>2. Bilingualism is a complicated phenomenon.  An indication of its many aspects and of the various scientific disciplines involved in its analysis is to be found in the paper <i>Language and Community</i> by Máirtín Ó Murchú, Comhairle na Gaeilge, Occasional Paper No. 1.  This paper shows how a bilingual situation may be described and measured from time to time and how its development will depend on the degree to which the community accepts a social convention of language behaviour and on the extent to which social forces support this convention.</P>
    <P>3.  Widespread bilingualism within a community has in the past usually arisen from a complex interaction between groups using different languages.  A linguistic community of this kind may be in the process of a fairly rapid language shift, such as the shift from Irish to English in this country during the nineteenth century. Instead of developing towards a unilingual situation, however, the position of both languages may become stabilised as a result of the association of each with separate domains or functions, that is, with occasions on which one language is predominantly used rather than the other.  The situation of patterned language use is technically referred to as <i>diglossia.</i> A more detailed description of <i>diglossia</i> and of its relationship to bilingualism is to be found in Máirtín Ó Murchú's paper.</P>
    <P>Ceapaimse go bhfuil an rud seo an-thábhachtach. Is ionann sin is a rá ó thaobh polasaí de, go gcaithfidh Bord na Gaeilge a bheith ag obair ar dhá chois, cos amháin a bhaineann le teanga agus <Col N="813" /> cé chomh héifeachtacht agus atá duine ag baint úsáid as teanga, pé Gaeilge nó Béarla é, agus an chos eile ná an t-iompar.  Cad iad na hócaidí go mbainfear úsáid as Gaeilge níos mó ná Béarla nó Béarla níos mó ná Gaeilge? An bhféadaimis na hócáidí sin a aimsiú, fograíocht a dhéanamh orthu agus cabhair a thabhairt do dhaoine, an nós a chur ar fáil go mbeadh Gaeilge in úsáid ar ócáidí speisialta?  Cad iad na hócáidí sin?  D'fhéadfaí iad sin a fháil amach trí thaighde agus trí theisteáil.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh ócáidi áisiúla ann Gaeilge a úsáid ins an teach, idir an chlann, ag an mbord, ag tógáil bia, ag dul go dtí áiteacha faoi leith, dramaíocht faoi leith, ceol faoi leith, ócáidí ina bhéas ceol ar siúl, ócáidí a bhaineann le cúrsaí riaracháin phoiblí agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Is ionann sin is a rá go gcaithfeadh pé daoine a beadh ag obair ar pholasaí teanga an méid ama a thabhairt ag déanamh staidéir ar na hócáidí sin agus iompar daoine is a gcuirfí isteach ar staidéar ar an dteanga féin.  Ní hionann sin is a rá gur cheart stáidear an teanga nó &ldquo;quality&rdquo; an teanga a chur ar leataobh.  Caithfimid dul ar agaidh go tréan ar an dá chois&mdash;an theanga agus iompar.</P>
    <P>Tá cúrsaí faoi leith a thagann faoin teideal &ldquo;social liguistics&rdquo; i mBéarla agus tá daoine timpeall an domhain ag déanamh staidéir ar language behaviour, social linguistics, ach an rud a chuireann isteach ormsa nach bhfuil sa tír daoine atá cáilithe, ar an gcéad dul síos, mór go leor san ábhar sin nó má tá cúpla daoine ann, níl dothain acu ann.  Tá an tír seo ag iarraidh athrú teanga, ag iarraidh athrú iompar na ndaoine a bhaint amach sa tslí go mbeidh siad ag baint úsáid níos mó as an Ghaeilge ná mar atá siad anois ina ngnáth-chumarsáid gach lá.  Táimid ag déanamh é sin ó 1900 nó mar sin agus níl na daoine cailithe againn fós chun staidéar mar sin a dhéanamh.  How are we going to produce this massive shift in the fundamental behaviour of people in communicating without the technical and professional back-up of the social linguistic studies?</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the replacement policy for the language that we had over the earlier years failed.  It is <Col N="814" /> psychologically important for us to say that.  It was never possible for Irish to replace English as the medium of communication here as long as we were inundated with communications coming on the east side from the UK through the medium of English and on the west side from the Americas through the medium of American English.  Through television this was amplified in this century. It was never on and it is important that we recognise that because there are still some people here who would be considered as supporters of the Irish language who would want a replacement policy.  They may not say it openly but deep down that is what they want.  They have it tied relentlessly with patriotism and it causes problems and it will mean we will never succeed.  I could not get Comhairle na Gaeilge, when I was chairman of it, to agree with that.  I personally believe it to be true.  It would be a psychological rinse-out for the nation to accept it.  We have to find ways of bringing about a situation where two languages will be used in a stable fashion in situations which people recognise as being appropriate.  This appropriateness will be developed over time in the normal pattern of behaviour.  It will be reinforced and rewarded by the normal social interactions that go on between people when they communicate.</P>
    <P>The purpose is bilingualism.  If we organise the State's effort around that we may succeed.  If the effort is about the restoration of the Irish language with the emphasis on language as literature or language as spoken without thinking about the behaviours that go with the use of that language, the whole thing is dead.</P>
    <P>Chun na polasaí sin, polasaí a bhaineann le cúrsaí iompair agus cúrsaí úsáid teanga agus an teanga ina dhá thaobh, do cheapadh, ba cheart institiúdí faoi leith a bhunú chun é sin a mháirseáil, chun é a rialú, agus is as sin tháinig na moltaí i gcóir Bord na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom a chur os comhair an tSeanaid go raibh níos mó ná Bord na Gaeilge ag baint leis na moltaí seo.</P>
    <P>The summary of the introduction to &ldquo;Implementing a Language Policy&rdquo;, which I signed said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> The Key recommendations of the Report are</P>
    <P>that the general function of extending the use of Irish throughout the country should be assigned to a new statutory board, to be called Bord na Gaeilge; &mdash;that (as envisaged in the report of Gaeltarra-SFADCO working group <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht)</i> all the Gaeltacht development functions should be assigned to a separate statutory board to be called Udarás na Gaeltachta; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;that both of these boards should be the responsibility of a new Department to be called Roinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>The effective implementation of these arrangements will require a radical reorganisation of the administration structures at present dealing with the Irish language.  It will also require leadership from the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as a renewed commitment and a greater measure of support from the community as a whole.  I believe that, given the necessary administrative measures and public commitment, there is a good prospect of our achieving in the foreseeable future the objectives suggested in the Report.</P>
    <P>This is from &ldquo;Implementing a Language policy&rdquo;, April 1972.</P>
    <P>Is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil an polasaí seo bunaithe ar níos mó ná Bord na Gaeilge.  Tá sé bunaithe freisin ar údaras na Gaeltachta a bheith curtha ar bun.  Tá sé bunaithe freisin ar an dtuiscint go mbeadh cúrsaí riaracháin taobh thiar den rud a oibreoidh agus go gcuirfear dóthain achmhainí ar fáil chun an polasaí a chur ag obair.</P>
    <P>Go dtí seo, níl údarás na Gaeltachta againn chomh maith.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil sé geallta ag an Aire agus táimíd ag feithimh freisin i gcomhair an lae go mbéimíd ag díospóireacht anseo ar údarás na Gaeltachta, ach caithfimíd a thuiscint go dtéan Bord na Gaeilge agus údarás na Gaeltachta le chéile mar ní bhéimís in ann an teanga a chur ag obair i gceart muna mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ag forbairt sa tslí cheart ó thaobh teanga de.</P>
    <P>An rud is mó a fheicim ó thaobh na <Col N="816" /> haidhme atá ag Bord na Gaeilge seo ná, go bhfuil freagracht faoi leith ar Bhord na Gaeilge a chinntiú go mbeadh polasaí teanga, polasaí dhá-theangachais ag obair go sláintiúil i ngach réimse den tír go bhféadfadh Bord na Gaeilge dul i bhfeidhm air.  Ar an gcéad dul síos is féidir le Bord na Gaeilge dul i bhfeidhm ar na heagrais Stáit agus na hinstitúidí Stáit.  Bhí cur síos san Dáil sna díospóireachtaí go dtí seo go mb'fhéidir nach bhfuil fiacla a ndóthain ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Ceapaim go mbraitheann rud mar seo ar na daoine a bheadh ar an mbord agus ar an bpríomh-oifigeach a bheadh ar an mbord&mdash;feicim go bhfuil na príomh-oifigigh atá againn ag éisteacht anseo&mdash;agus go mbeadh na daoine sin láidir agus go rachaidís abhaile ar pé eagrais Stáit nó pé Roinn Stáit nach mbeadh ag cur polasaí ceart dhá-theangachais ag obair.</P>
    <P>San díospóireacht go dtí seo do labhair cúpla daoine mar gheall ar an áit is tanaí, is laige ón dtaodh sin de&mdash;do labhair an Seanadóir Whitaker air agus daoine eile&mdash;agus is í sin an Roinn Oideachais.  Le deich mblian anuas ó bhí aon bhaint agamsa le cúrsaí teanga tá an Roinn sin ag cur deacrachtaí os comhair na mbeartas éagsula a bhíonn ar siúl agus ní bhíonn siad ag comhoibriú.  Bhí mé in ann, mar chathaoirleach ar Chomhairle na Gaeilge, coiste faoi leith a chur ar fáil ar a raibh Rúnaí Cúnta don Roinn Oideachais ag obair agus chuir an chomhairle tuarascáil ar fáil ar cad ba cheart a dhéanamh san Roinn ó thaobh Gaeilge de.  Chun an coiste sin a chur ar fáil do bhí orm dul timpeall mar shaghas sagairt nach mór ag impí ar gach éinne teacht le chéile chun cur síos ar Ghaeilge.  An tuairim a bhí agam an uair sin ná gur cheap an Roinn Oideachais gur leo an teanga Gaeilge. Caithfimid a thuiscint go mbaineann an Roinn Oideachais le cúrsaí oideachais, ní le teanga.  Tá feidhm oideachais le comhlíonadh acu.  Sé sin le rá ranganna a chur ar fáil, instituidí oideachais a chur ar fáil agus mar sin de.  Ach anois tá Bord na Gaeilge ann agus níl freagracht ar Bhord na Gaeilge ach i leith teanga. Sin é an rud nua atá ann agus sin é an rud go gcuirimse fáilte mhór roimhe.</P>
    <P>Ag teacht thar nais go dti an Roinn Oideachais, cuireadh an tuarascáil sin <Col N="817" /> amach timpeall 1972-3 agus do bhí timpeall sé leathanacha d'athchoimre ar na moltaí a bhí san tuarascáil sin ó thaobh na Roinne&mdash;sé leathanacha&mdash;ag leagadh amach cad ba cheart a dhéanamh sna réamh-scoileanna, sna meán-scoileanna, sna scoileanna san tríú leibhéál, cad ba cheart a dhéanamh sa Roinn Oideachais féin, cad iad na saghas coistí agus mar sin de.  An chéad rud a dhein Bord na Gaeilge nuair a thángadar le chéile&mdash;an Bord atá ann anois&mdash;ná iarraidh ar an Roinn cad iad na tuairimí a bhí acu ar an tuarascáil sin a cuireadh amach i 1972 nó 1973 agus ní chualamar faic uathu.</P>
    <P>Sin é an saghas rud atá ar siúl, sin é an saghas rud a chuirfidh deireadh le dhá-theangachas agus deireadh leis an teanga muna ndeintear rud é igin mar gheall air.  Táimse ag rá anseo inniu go bhfuil freagracht ar Bhord na Gaeilge é sin a chur ag obair agus gan chur suas leis an saghas rud sin agus go gcaithfidis dul os comhair an phobail agus é a rá go hárd agus go soiléir.  Tá an fhreagracht ar Bhord na Gaeilge anois.  Ní feidir leo a rá go mbaineann sé sin le cúrsaí oideachais, go mbaineann sé sin leis an Roinn seo nó an Roinn siúd.  Ó thaobh an pholasaí ghinearálta tá an fhreagracht ar Bhord na Gaeilge.  Caithfidh siad í a chomhlíonadh agus ar aghaidh leo.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh polasaí mar seo a chur ag obair agus a bheith soiléir faoi na bunaidhmeanna a bhaineann leis, ceapaimse, mar speisialtóir ag bainistíocht, go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh na bunaidhmeanna leagtha síos go soiléir. Dheineamar iarracht na haidhmeannaí sin a leagadh síos ins an tuarascáil.</P>
    <P>Deireann sé ag leatheanach 1:</P>
    <P>... It explains that a behavioural system can exist in a bilingual community which not only maintains the speech pattern fairly stable but accords both languages acceptable status.  Such an equilibrium will be achieved in this country only after a long period and may vary according to the prevailing conditions, social and political, in future years.  We feel that the principle of a flexible and gradual approach to the problem would be acceptable to the whole Irish community.  Once Irish was established <Col N="818" /> as a widely spoken language it might happen that the then current community opinion would wish it to attain a stronger position.  In certain areas, of course, Irish would continue to be the principal language.  The challenge of the moment is to generate a trend towards a realistic equilibrium.</P>
    <P>That is accepting an equilibrium in a situation where Irish and English are used in a stable fashion within this diglossic framework.  In an attempt to put a figure on this, what are you moving towards?  What is the measure of this now and what measure would you like to see in the future?  We go on to paragraph 1.4 of that report:</P>
    <P>The Paper emphasises that the evolutionary process towards a situation in which Irish has an established place in the community's speech pattern will take place over a long period. The time-scope of socio-linguistic planning must be seen in terms of decades rather than years.  While keeping in mind that the goal is the restoration of the Irish language as a general medium of communication, it is important that intermediate aims for relevant periods ahead be defined and widely communicated.  We suggest that these might be expressed in terms of the proportion of conversation carried out in Irish by the average person each day.  At present this is probably less than 5%; it would be much higher for a typical Gaeltacht resident and lower for others.</P>
    <P>I notice the careful hedging which obviously indicates the effort to get the consensus in a comhairle of 30 people.</P>
    <P>If research supports it, a reasonable aim might be, say, 20% use of Irish, on average, by persons outside the Gaeltacht by the end of the century... .</P>
    <P>Ceapaimse go mba cheart bun-fheidhm mar sin a chur os comhair na ndaoine agus a bheith ag caint mar gheall air.  Dá bhféadaimís glacadh go mbeadh 30 faoin gcéad de na gnáth-dhaoine sa bhliain 2000 ag baint úsáid as Gaeilge ar feadh 20 faoin gcéad don am gach lá, ag deireadh na tréimhse sin bheadh polasaí na Gaeilge sroiste againn agus bheadh <Col N="819" /> an aidhm sroiste againn agus bheadh an Ghaeilge sábháilte.  Caithfimíd anois, ón lá seo an trend a athrú.  Dá bhféadfaimís an trend a athrú bheadh an bhua againn, ach nílimse sásta fós go bhfuil an trend sin ag athrú.</P>
    <P>When I speak about a 20 per cent objective by the year 2000AD, I mean that the average Irish person for 20 per cent of the speech events that he or she would engage in every day would use Irish in such a way that it would be developed over the years by this pattern of diglossia. That does not mean 20 per cent of the people; it means all the people and 20 per cent of the speech events.  That presupposes that everybody will know both languages, which in turn presupposes that we must aim towards having people proficient in both languages equally even if they do not use them for 50 per cent of the time.  The challenge is before the Department of Education and the people of Ireland to deliver on it, if we accept that objective.  If we do not accept that objective then I despair.</P>
    <P>Conas a thárla an rud seo.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht le Seanadóirí ag cur síos ar an stair a bhí taobh thiar den rud.  Is dóigh liom gur mhaith an rud é cuid des na rudaí a thit amach a lua arís ó thaobh an &ldquo;historic background&rdquo;.  Tá an &ldquo;historic background&rdquo; curtha le chéile go hanmhaith ag Máirtín Ó Murchú san tuarascáil &ldquo;Urlabhra agus Pobal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Language and Community&rdquo;.  Ag piocadh amach cuid de na rudaí a chuir sé isteach ann, taispeánann sé conas a tháinig an language shift ag cur Gaeilge amach agus Béarla isteach.  Sé an dúbhshlán atá againn anois ná saghas reverse process a chur ag obair ó thaobh Gaeilge, glacadh, ag an am seo ar aon chuma, nach bhfuilimid ach ag iarraidh 20 faoin gcéad, an bhun-aidhm, a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>There are something between 3,000 and 4,000 languages in the world and bilingualism and multi-lingualism are the rule and not the exception.  The monoglot is the exception.  It might give us hope to think in those terms.</P>
    <P>These are some of the items he draws attention to.  He started off in the 16th century to trace what happened.  He says on page 24:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> There were some English-speaking groups in some urban areas and in parts of Leinster at that time, but they were marginal rather than central to the cultural and social pattern of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people have the idea that Irish was something that rural dwellers indulged in and that Dubliners always spoke English or maybe Latin.  He continues:</P>
    <P>Thus, Irish was dominant in all socio-linguistic domains which might have been distinguished in the society of the time, extending from a domain which might be described as <i>public affairs</i> to the <i>household</i> domain.</P>
    <P>Again he is talking about the higher and lower forms of the use of the Irish language.  As in English, one gets the language as it is used in the news and as it is heard in the back of the pub.  What kind of language one gets will depend on where the pub is, then it will take on a dialectic of its own.  There are variations within one language.  Further on in the same paragraph he says:</P>
    <P>... The shared possession and use of this&mdash;set of registers, very probably with some local variation, or accent, at the colloquial end of the scale, united very probably with some of the speech communities of Ireland and Gaelic Scotland into a single socio-linguistic group.  It was for this reason that it was realistic to recommend to the English Government in 1604 that &ldquo;Ministers that can speak Irish ...be gotten out of Scotland for the purpose of teaching the Protestant religion in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Somebody in the higher levels knew and recognised the importance at that stage of knowing Irish if they were going to achieve a particular political policy in this country.  On page 25 he says:</P>
    <P>What eventually ensured a change in the socio-linguistic pattern was not the Government's feats nor the attempts to proscribe the native academy but the establishment of a new socio-economic order which followed the final conquest of Ireland during the reign of Elizabeth I.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> The Irish began to realise that if they wanted to get on in life they would have to learn English and they are not going to unlearn it in this day and age Therefore we must accept the bilingual policy.</P>
    <P>Another passage brings out the notion that there is a diglossic pattern of IrishEnglish usage in the country and there was more so in the past.  It says on page 27:</P>
    <P>... This diglossic pattern was so strong that lower class immigrants to rural Ireland such as the Palatines in Co. Limerick became Irish speaking.</P>
    <P>In other words they had to learn Irish.  It was not a case of somebody coming from another country and saying, &ldquo;We use English because we can make do on it&rdquo;.  They could not make do.  They had to learn Irish to live in County Limerick at that time.  At the end of the same page is the most shocking piece of all.  It refers to the shift in the value placed on the Irish language:</P>
    <P>Whatever beneficial effects this change in value position by members of the middle classes might have had in strengthening the position of Irish, they were more than off-set by the fact that the Catholic clergy were, by the same social processes, becoming increasingly middle class in status and, again as an inescapable consequence, in language as well.  Accordingly, when the Royal College of St. Patrick was established in Maynooth in 1795 for the training of Catholic priests, English predictably became its institutional language....</P>
    <P>Once again the institutions of our system helped to achieve the language shift away from Irish towards English, and it is my regret that even today the same thing exists.</P>
    <P>The generalisation that I would draw from that is that the institutes of State&mdash;Government, Government Departments and also the Church which is so dominant in matters that affect ordinary practices in Irish life&mdash;will have to co-operate in this policy if it is going to get anywhere.  It is high time to stop making excuses that people should know the Irish language before they are taken on in jobs of State.  That they are <Col N="822" /> technical in medicine, engineering or any other professional activity is not an excuse for not knowing Irish.  If they are going to work in institutes of State in this country they should know the Irish language, otherwise they will not be able to contribute to the objective of using Irish for 20 per cent of the time in the year 2000 AD and at intermediate stages between now and then.  It is as simple as that.  It is not about right wing or unreasonable attitudes; it is about recognising whether they are serious about the objective.  It makes me sick to hear people talking about whether Irish should be required for work in Irish State civil service activities.</P>
    <P>The strongest influence in language behaviour outside the schools is of course RTE.  It is important that an alternative to RTE be set up in this State because we need another approach to the promotion of the Irish language. RTE have done a reasonable job, but the lack of imagination in the promotion of the language over the first decade or 15 years of their activities is nothing short of appalling.  I was on the RTE authority for a few years before a certain authority had to leave and I believe that if there were an alternative station, whether it operated under the State or under some independent body, the healthy competition that would exist between the two might produce a reasonable programme for the promotion of bilingualism in the strongest media of all, television and radio.  I think of Riobárd Ó Faracháin and Séamus Kavanagh; I think of the work that Ciarán Mac Mathúna has done; he should have a &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; devoted to him in recognition of the work he has done for the recovery of folk music.  Excellent work is being done, but of the creative use of programming to promote bilingualism we saw nothing until Liam Ó Murchú came along with &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;.  I hope that that will not be the exception that proves the rule.  I hope that more creative programmes will come up that will not be built around one individual.  I remember discussing with a producer in RTE that it was strange that people would turn off television when they saw an uileann píopa player sitting playing, bouncing his foot off the ground with a white wall <Col N="823" /> behind him.  That type of thing represents creative use of programming which competition would encourage.  That is why I would like to see competition for RTE.</P>
    <P>I have been waiting a while to say some of these things and I will not regret saying them.  Bord na Gaeilge can make a tremendous contribution to the clarification and implementation of a policy along the lines that I have been talking about.  Máirtín Ó Murchú in the conclusion to his occasional paper has a few interesting thoughts which I would like to put on the record of the House. On page 32 he says:</P>
    <P>It needs, therefore, to be recognised that definitive and efficient planning by the State is as indispensable in this area of public concernment as in any other.  Such planning requires a sophisticated view of what is involved together with a thorough knowledge of the existing state of affairs.  It is necessary, therefore, to become more enlightened about socio-linguistic conditions in societies similar to our own and to carry out an exhaustive programme of research for the purpose of precisely determining the present socio-linguistic configurations of Irish society.  Research, however, does not determine the goals of policy; it merely suggests the best means by which they might be attained.  The goals themselves reflect a valueposition which leads a community's leadership to select one future objective rather than another.</P>
    <P>In other words to select a 20 per cent objective for the year 2000 AD and accept it as a normative intention.  The paper continues:</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland, the valueposition relevant to socio-linguistic planning involves the valid belief that it is essential to our authenticity and self-confidence as a nation that the Irish language be re-established in a central rather than a marginal position in the communicational matrix of our society.  This, in effect, means setting as our immediate goal the attainment of an Irish-English diglossia in which Irish would have a significant <Col N="824" /> part to play consistent with its function as the national language.  Such a diglossia is not really new in our country: an Irish-English diglossia exists in the traditionally Irish-speaking areas; an Irish-English diglossia, with, of course, a different domain configuration, exists in embryo in the rest of the country; and, historically, as we have seen, the distinctive speech pattern of Irish Society from the seventeenth century to the cataclysmic events of the last was an Irish-English diglossia.</P>
    <P>To develop it is Bord na Gaeilge's challenge. Deirim leis an bhfoireann a bheidh ag obair le bord na Gaeilge, &ldquo;Bail ó Dhia ar an obair&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ach tá rud amháin atá ag chur as dom.  Ins an alt atá ag cur síos ar na feidhmeanna san Bille, baintear úsáid as na focail &ldquo;beartas ginearálta&rdquo;.  San aistriúchán atá ag dul leis an mBille, siad na focail atá ann ná &ldquo;general policy&rdquo;.  Ní maith liom an focal &ldquo;beartas&rdquo; mar ceapaim go mb'fhéidir go dtiocfadh duine éigin ar aghaidh agus go ndéarfadh sé: &ldquo;It is only a beartas and that means you have to clear every project with the Minister before you can go ahead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would not like that interpretation to be taken from the Bill.  If the Minister cannot see his way to changing &ldquo;beartas&rdquo; to &ldquo;policy&rdquo;, I would like him to spell out in his reply that the intention behind it is that he will only be helping to lay down general policy for Bord na Gaeilge who will be allowed to operate freely within that without having to go back to clear every project that they think of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not let this occasion pass without at least making one small comment which may assist in the objective of the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and also the formation of Bord na Gaeilge.  It is 20 years since I made a speech in Irish and the wheels have become so rusty that they have seized up completely and I would not dare attempt to speak in Irish today.  I can think only of one occasion in the last 20 years on which I have been requested to speak in Irish and that was in Luxembourg when I was replying to a speech in French made by a French Minister.  I thought <Col N="825" /> that I should not let the side down, so I spoke partly in French, partly in Irish and with the majority of my speech in English.  I was very glad that the interpreter was able to interpret my Irish into French correctly.</P>
      <P>During that 20 years, it is understandable that a person living in an area like Cork city whose life is mainly concerned with industry, commerce and such like does not have occasion to speak in Irish and does not meet people who speak Irish.  There are plenty of people in my circumstances who would like to restore their Irish, but there does not appear to be any way of doing it or any organisation which caters for it.  If there is it has not been advertised.  There are German circles and French circles where people meet once a week or once a fortnight to speak in the language of their choice. Some consideration should be given to the formation of Irish circles, but it should be advertised because a number of people who speak very little Irish are now attracted to it.  This is borne out by the numbers who appreciate looking at the &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; programme. Therefore, if you want to increase the use of the Irish language there is a field here, but you will have to put it under the people's noses that there is a way and that there is an organisation available where they can achieve their objective, to restore their use of the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an tSeanad i ngeall ar chomh báúil agus a ghlac siad leis an mBille.  Tugann sé an-mhisneach domsa an díospóireacht bhreá a cuireadh ar fáil anseo dúinn agus tá anáthas orm go raibh an oiread sin Seanadóirí sásta páirt a ghlacadh san díospóireacht.</P>
      <P>Ní maith liom an iomarca moille a chur orthu mar ní bhéinn ach ag ath-rá cuid de na rudaí a dúirt mé sa Dáil nuair a bhí mé ag tabhairt freagra ar an Dara Céim den Bhille, ach mar sin féin, sílim nach mbeidh mé ach ag tabhairt cothrom na Féinne do chuile dhuine má luainn cuid de na príomh rudaí a bhí luaite so díospóireacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir A. O'Brien go <Col N="826" /> raibh spéis sa Ghaeilge ach go raibh deacrachtaí ann maidir leis an spéis sin a chur i bhfeidhm agus maidir le úsáid níos mó a bhaint as labhairt na Gaeilge. Sílim go dtig linn a rá gur luaigh cuid mhaith de na Seanadóirí an rud céanna. Tá daoine báúil le Gaeilge.  Tá an cruthúnas ann go bhfuil sé sin fíor.  Tá taighde déanta agus tá fhios againn go bhfuil daoine báúil le Gaeilge ach sé an deacracht atá ann ná nach bhfuil siad sásta úsáid a bhaint as an mbeagán Gaeilge atá acu.  Sin an fhadhb is mó a fheicimse i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé chomh maith ceist téacsleabhar sna scoileanna.  Caithfidh mé a admháil nach dtig le duine ar bith bheith sásta leis an chaoi ina bhfuil cúrsaí madir le téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil. Fiú amháin sna bunscoileanna, níl an cheist sásúil, agus nuair a thagann tú go dtí na meánscoileanna, nuair a théann tú ar aghadh níos faide le cúrsaí léinn, is ag dul i ndonacht atá an scéal. Níl fhios agam go baileach cén leigheas atá air.  Sílim go mbíonn deacrachtaí go leor faoi théacsleabhair, iad a aistriú agus mar sin; ní dóigh liom gur ceist airgid atá ann&mdash;nach bhfuil go leor airgid curtha ar fáil chun an cheist sin a fheabhsú.  Is dóigh gur rudaí mar seo a bhéas ag teacht faoí chúram an bhoird, go mbeidh siad, le caitheamh aimsire, in ann rudaí mar seo a scrúdú agus moltaí a chur os comhair an Rialtais nó na Roinne Oideachais, féachaint cén leigheas atá ar an scéal agus cén chaoi a dtig linn an rud a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Duirt an Seanadóir de Brún cuid mhaith ina theanga bhreá líofa Ghaeilge, agus caithim teacht le chuile rud a dúirt sé.  Bhí figiúirí aige, dar ndóigh, ar staid na teanga, an chaoi a bhfuil laghdú tagtha ar uimhir na scoileanna daraleibhéal atá ag caitheamh uathu an deis atá acu le Gaeilge a thabhairt do na scoláirí.  Tá laghdú mór tagtha ar uimhir na scoileanna sin ó tháinig an saoroideachas isteach.  Is deacair arís tuiscint conas a tharla sé sin.  B'fhéidir gur míniú amháin air i gcuid de na scoileanna, go raibh níos páistí a fuair oideachas trí Bhéarla ag teacht chuig na scoileanna ná páistí a bhí ag fáil oideachais trí Ghaeilge agus go raibh sé níos furasta ag na múinteoirí iompú ar an mBéarla agus cúl láimhe a thabhairt don <Col N="827" /> Ghaeilge.  Más mian linn an scéal a fheabhsú, caithfimid ar a laghad, mar thús an méid Gaeilge atá sna scoileanna A. mar a thugtar orthu, a choinneáil.</P>
    <P>Fiú amháin ag an bpointe seo, sílim go mbeidh dearcracht an-mhór ann an méid scoileanna atá ag múineadh na Gaeilge a choinneáil.  Na figiúirí a thug an Seanadóir de Brún maidir leis an méid páistí nár éirigh leofa ins na scrúdaithe Ard Teistiméireachta agus Meán Teistimeireachta.  ní cúis mhaoite de dhuine ar bith iad.  Más rud é go dtugann siad le fios go bhfuil meas na ndaoine ar an nGaeilge ag dul i laghad, tugann sé le tuiscint dúinn ar fad an obair mhór atá os comhair an bhoird agus an obair thábhachtach atá le déanamh acu leis an rud sin a chloí agus le Gaeilge a chur ar ais arís ar a bhonna mar is cóir.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Murphy caithim a rá go dtigim le cuid mhór de.  Luaigh sé chomh maith an pointe sin faoi cheist na Gaeilge ins na meánscoileanna, an rud a luaigh an Seanadóir de Brún, agus cúrsaí oideachais sna coláistí oiliúna, go raibh caighdeán Gaeilge a bhí ag bunmhúinteoirí ag laghdú agus nach raibh sé ró-shásúil i láthair na huaire.  Sílim go n-aontaíonn gach uile dhuine go bhfuil an scéal sin ag dul i ndonacht ó cuireadh deireadh leis na coláistí ullmhúcháin agus is mór an trua é gur cuireadh ar ceal ar fad iad, cé go raibh sé costasach iad a choinneáil ar siúl, i bhfad níos costasaí ná an gnáth mheánscoil a choinneáil ar siúl.  Sílim gur mór an trua é nar coinníodh ar a laghad ceann nó péire acu, ceann acu le haghaidh buachaillí agus ceann le haghaidh cáiliní. Sílim nach mbeadh an scéal chomh dona agus atá sé i láthair na huaire dó ndéanfaí sin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé chomh maith, rud atá tábhachtach, an gradam a bhéas ag príomh oifigeach Bhoird na Gaeilge.  Más maith linn na daoine is fiúntaí agus is fearr a fháil, caithfimid a bheith sásta íoc dá réir astu.  Thiocfainn leis gur cheart go mbeadh aitheantas faoi leith tugtha don phríomhoifigeach seo a bhéas ag teacht leis an aitheantas atá ag dul do priomhoifígí na mbord Stáit is <Col N="828" /> tábhachtaí atá againn.  Sílim ag an bpointe seo gur cheart domsa a rá imo thuairimse, gurb é Bord na Gaeilge an bord is tábhachtaí a bunaíodh go fóill sa Stát seo agus má táimíd i ndáiríre faoin rud sin caithfimid bheith cinnte go mbeimíd in ann na daoine is fearr a dtig linn a fháil le freastail ar an mbord agus le gnó an bhoird a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé an tUdarás chomh maith ach ní bhaineann sé go díreach leis an mBilie seo.  Ach ó tharla gur luaígh an Seanadóir Mulcahy é agus go bhfuil ar bealach dlúth-bhaint idir Bord na Gaeilge agus an tÚdarás tig liom a insint don Seanad go bhfuil an Bille á réiteach, go bhfuil sé le foilsiú agus gur féidir gur anseo a bheidh an chéad seans le díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar an mBille agus b'fhéidir le Dia go mbeidh sé sin againn roimh an tsaoire.</P>
    <P>Thug an Seanadóir Cranitch óráid shuimiúil ar stair na teanga agus cúrsaí oideachais agus luaigh sé RTE chomh maith.  Luaigh cuid mhaith de na Seanadóirí na ceisteanna céanna.  San óráid a thug an Seanadóir Mulcahy, thug sé léargas an-shuimiúl ar an gcaoi a tháinig an Bhearla chun cinn agus an chaoi ar brúdh sé amach an Ghaeilge. Tugann sé sin arís le tuiscint dúinn na deacrachtaí a bhéas le sárú ag an mbord seo agus an méid oibre a bhéas le déanamh acu nuair a bheidh siad faoi lánseol.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hoideachas, sílim go mbíonn daoine an-dhian ar an Roinn Oideachais. Rinne siad a ndícheall san am atá caite le cúrsaí a bheadh fábharach don Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna bunscoileanna. Bíonn ABC mar a thugamís air, le haghaidh na cúrsaí Gaeilge.  Bhí sé leagtha amach go han-mhaith agus áit ar bith a raibh múinteoir a bhí sásta tabhairt faoi i gceart agus leanúint leis an gclár mar a bhí sé leagtha amach, sílím gur éirigh go maith leis.  B'fhéidir go raibh béim an-mhór ar chúrsaí gramadaí agus ar chruinneas Gaeilge ach san am chéanna, bhí an prionsabal féin ceart agus sílim nach ar an Roinn Oideachais a bhí an locht mura raibh toradh níos fearr ar chúrsaí.  Ní raibh meon na ndaoine féin ag teacht leis an nGaeilge, ní raibh siad báúil don Ghaeilge.  Bhí daoine a bhí go síoraí ag caitheamh anuas air, ag caitheamh <Col N="829" /> drochmheas air agus chuaigh sé sin i gcionn níos mó ar an bpobal agus ar na páistí ná mar a chuaigh an obair a bhí ar siúl ag an Roinn Oideachais fhéin.</P>
    <P>Thug an Seanadóir Whitaker óráid an-bhreá dúinn agus thug sé cur síos dúinn ar imeachtaí an bhoird agus an méid a bhí déanta acu go dtí seo.  Tig linn uilig a theacht leis agus aontú leis nuair a dúirt sé go raibh an bhunchloch leagtha ag an mbord anois.  Bhí deacrachtaí acu.  Tá fhios againn uilig go raibh deacrachtaí foirne acu.  Bhí deacrachtaí acu le daoine a cheapadh agus ní raibh sé furasta an dul chun cinn a theastaigh uatha a dhéanamh a dhéanamh nuair nach raibh foireann sheasmhach acu agus nuair nár éirigh leofa daoine a fháil chomh réidh agus a theastaigh uatha iad a fháil.  Luaigh sé ceist coistí comhairleacha.  Sílim féin gur maith an tuairim é sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an bord in ann dul i gcomhairle le daoine eile, saineolaithe agus a leithéidí sin agus dá mba rud é nach raibh an cumhacht sin acu, sílim go mbeadh sé ag cur srian orthu chun bheith i n-ann comhairle den chineál sin a fháil.  Ní shílim go bhfuil rud ar bith sa Bhille a chuireann bac orthu dul i gcomhairle le daoine eile nó b'fhéidir coistí comhairleacha a bhunú.  Níor mhaith liom go mbeadh rud ar bith le bac a chur orthu agus dá bhrí sin, sílim gur smaoineamh maith é agus tuigim go bhfuil an bord féin sásta tuairimí den chineál sin a scrúdú agus féachaint le leas a bhaint astu.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé chomh maith an laghdú a bhí ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht.  Sílim gur luaigh an Seanadóir Murphy é sin chomh maith agus, ar ndóigh, tig linn uilig an t-eolas sin a fháil go bhfuil laghdú mór tagtha air.  Is dócha go bhfuil sé le feiceáil níos mó i mo chontae féin ná i gcontae ar bith eile, áit a raibh Gaeltachtaí laidir dhá scór bliain o shin. Is beag díobh atá le feiceáil inniu.  Is mór an trua é sin.  Acht, tá pointe amháin a bhaineas leis agus sílim féin gur áit é seo a gcaithfidh an bord a naigne a dhíriú air, an áit a bhfuil an Ghaeilge go fóill, an áit ina bhfuil daoine in ann Gaeilge a labhairt go tréan, mar a déarfá, an áit ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge go láidir ach nach bhfuil sí in úsáid.  Ba cheart díriú ar na háiteanna sin leis an méid Gaeilge atá <Col N="830" /> iontu a choinneáil slán agus a choinneáil beo agus an meas atá ag teacht uirthi ansin a choisaint.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh tá gá le poiblíocht agus go mór mhór sa saol atá inniu ann.  Is cuma cén obair atá ar siúl, caithfear úsáid a bhaint as poiblíocht lena cur chun cinn agus táimíd ag plé na cúrsaí sin agus beimíd ag súil go mbeidh airgead curtha ar fáil le cuidiú leis an bpoiblíocht a bhéas ag teastáil leis na feachtais a bhéas ar siúl ag an mbord a láidriú agus a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Kitt ceist faoi oifigeach oideachais, nó education officer, a bheith faoi threoir nó faoi stiúrú na gcoistí gairm oideachais&mdash;go mba cheart a leithéidí sin a cheapadh.  Arís is dóigh gurab shin rud go mbeidh an bord iad féin ann a scrúdú agus moltaí i ngeall air a chur ar aghaidh má shíleann siad go bhfuil fiúntas ar bith ag baint leis.</P>
    <P>Shíl an Seanadóir McGlinchey go mba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh na deontais £10 agus £20 le fáil ag Gaeilgeoirí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá rud amháin le rá agam faoin méid sin.  Mar atá siad i láthair na huaire, bíonn neart achrainn fúthu agus dá mbeadh an scéim á reachtáil taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí níl fhios agam faoí, 'sé díol an diabhail ar fad a bheadh ann é a láimhseáil.  Níl fhios agam, mar adéarfá, an ceart drocmheas a chaitheamh ar an moladh&mdash;b'fhéidir gur cheart cluas a thabhart dó.  Sin mar a fheicimse é, go mbeadh go leor deacrachtaí san ag iarraidh scéim a reachtáil taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí, ach arís b'fhéidir gur cúramaí iad seo a dtig leis an mbord iad féin a scrúdú.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Ó Conaire an chuid is mó i mBéarla, agus is maith liom go raibh cuid den díospóireacht i mBéarla mar beidh an bord féin ag díriú a n-aigne níos mó ar Bhéarlóirí ná muintir na Gaeltachta agus san díospóireacht seo&mdash;agus thárla sé seo sa Dáil chomh maith&mdash;tugadh le tuiscint dúinn na deacrachtaí atá ag daoine a d'fhoghlaim Gaeilge ach nach bhfuil sí anois a labhairt acu nó a bhfuil faillí déanta san Ghaeilge acu.  Thug an Seanadóir Ó Conaire le tuiscint dúinn na deacrachtaí atá aige féin.  Labhair an Seanadóir Jago ar an <Col N="831" /> gcuma chéanna.  Tá rud amháin atá á phlé againn i láthair na huaire maidir le daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus atá ag iarraidh í a fhoghlaim&mdash;sin Baill an Oireachtais atá mé a rá.  Bhí mé ag caint le&mdash;is dócha nach ceart dom a n-ainm a lua anseo&mdash;dream atá ag plé le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus tá siad sásta cúrsaí Gaeilge a chur ar bun anseo i dTeach Laighean do dhaoine atá fábharach don Ghaeilge nó atá ag iarraidh feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge, agus le cúnamh Dé beidh sé sin socraithe againn sa téarma atá le teacht, sé sin tar éis saoire an tsamhraidh. Daoine ar bith go dteastaíonn uathu feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge nó snas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge beidh fáilte rompu ag na ranganna sin. Cuirfear na ranganna ar aghaidh chomh maith ag am a bhéas áisiúil go gach duine agus tá mé ag súil go mbeidh cuid mhaith ag freastal orthu.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Lanigan faoi féin.  Dúirt sé go raibh an Ghaeilge caillte aige féin, ach ní aontaim ar fad leis. Thug sé an chuid is mó den méid adúirt sé as Gaeilge, agus arís sin deacracht amháin atá ann leis an nGaeilge. Deireann daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Bhí an Seanadóir Ó Lanigan ag rá nach raibh Gaeilge aige ach thug sé le tuiscint dúinn sa gcaoi ar labhair sé anseo go raibh neart Gaeilge aige agus níor cheart dó náire a bheith ar í a labhairt in áit ar bith.  Arís cruthaíonn sé rud amháin atá ráite ag cúpla duine anseo&mdash;nach bhfuilimid sásta tabhairt faoin nGaeilge agus an méid dí atá againn a labhairt chomh minic agus is féidir linn.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Seanadóir Donnelly na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha agus an obair atá ar siúl acu.  Arís tá an rud sin anshuimiúil agus is rud é a thugann misneach dúinn, mar go dtáinig gluaiseacht na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha ó na daoine iad féin gan brú ar bith ó dhuine ar bith.  Sin rud a theastaíonn uainn a fheiceáil, go mbeadh na daoine iad féin sásta scoil lán-Ghaelach a chur ar bun agus Gaeilge a thabhairt dá gcuid páistí gan brú ar bith a theacht orthu ón Stát nó ó áit ar bith eile.</P>
    <P>Bhí óráid an shuimiúil ón Seanadóir Mulcahy faoi pholasaí maidir le Gaeilge <Col N="832" /> a chur chun cinn agus faoi na rudaí is gá le teanga a bhrú ar aghaidh.  Níl fúm ag an bpointe seo mórán tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh ach amháin go dtuigimíd ar fad an méid oibre atá déanta aige leis na blianta maidir le cúrsaí teanga a chur ar aghaidh, agus sé an trua nach dtig leis féin agus an Seanadóir Whitaker leanúint ar aghaidh mar bhaill den bhord, ach taimid cinnte do rud amháin, go mbeidh siad linn le comhairle agus cuidiú a thabhairt don bhord agus is breá an rud é sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí rud amháin a luaigh an Seanadóir Mulcahy.  Luaigh sé liom cheana é agus bhí beagáinín cainte againn faoi.  Bhí sé ag caint faoin bhfocal &ldquo;beartas&rdquo; agus polasaí.  Is fíor nach bhfuil an focal &ldquo;beartas&rdquo; i bhFoclóir Uí Dhuinnín ach tá sé i bhFoclóir de Bhaldraithe.  Sé &ldquo;beartas&rdquo; an chéad fhocal Gaeilge a tugtar ar &ldquo;policy&rdquo; agus san leagan Gaeilge de na Conraithe Eorpacha tá an focal &ldquo;comhbheartas&rdquo; coitianta do &ldquo;common policy&rdquo;.  Tá an focal &ldquo;beartas&rdquo; bunaithe ar an bhfocal &ldquo;beart&rdquo; a bhfuil an chiall &ldquo;plan&rdquo; mar cheann de na mínithe air i bhFoclóir Uí Dhuinnín.  Tá focail ghaolmhara dó san bhfoclóir céanna, mar shampla, &ldquo;beartach&rdquo;, resourceful i mBéarla; &ldquo;beartaidhe&rdquo;, a planner, a thinker; &ldquo;beartúghadha&rdquo;, judging, thinking, planning i mBéarla. Tuigimíd mar sin gur focal fiúntach dúchasúil an focal sin agus nach bhfuil sé ina chramh spairn.  Níl fhios agam ar cheart dúinn a bheith ag troid faoi rudaí mar seo.  Is rud beag é agus sílim gur cheart dúinn é a fhágáil mar atá sé, nach cuireann sé isteach ar an mBille ar bhealach ar bith.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh le chuile dhuine a thóg páirt san díospóireacht seo agus tá fhios againn uilig go bhfuil obair mhór, thábhachtach le déanamh ag an mbord seo agus gur gá go mbeidh cuidiú le fáil acu ó na rannóga Stáit ar fad, agus go mór mhór ón ghnáphobal.  Mar is eol dúinn, mura mbeidhmid in ann gnáthphobal na tíre a mhealladh agus a thabhairt linn, ní bheidh sé ar ár gcumas mórán dul ar aghaidh a dhéanamh i dtaobh an Ghaeilge a neartú agus a chur chun cinn.  Sin an obair is mó a bheidh le déanamh ag an mbord&mdash;cur ina luí ar an bpobal gur fiú an Ghaeilge a shlánú <Col N="833" /> agus a chur chun cinn, agus guímid rath Dé ar an méid atá le déanamh acu.</P>

    <Title>Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Bill, 1978: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of efforts have been made in the last decade to establish a system of controls of mergers and take-overs by legislation but for various reasons these did not come to fruition.  The need for the introduction of such controls was first recognised at a time of very heavy merger activity and while this activity slackened off in the period of depression, there are indications that there will be a strengthening of this activity with the revival of the economy.  I feel it is desirable therefore to proceed with this legislation without further delay.</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish a scheme of control for mergers and take-overs should not be seen as an indication of an anti-merger bias by this Government. The contrary is, in fact, the case and this is evidenced by the enactment of the Industrial Development Act, 1977, which provides a positive form of assistance to enable Irish firms to engage in planned and orderly restructuring.  It is recognised that the trend to date in merger activity has been on balance beneficial to the economy.  Economies of scale needed to compete effectively both in the domestic and international markets have been and can be, achieved; under-utilised resources can be switched to sectors where optional use can be made of them; efficiency can be improved; sluggish management can be revitalised; rationalisation of production and marketing can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear therefore that merger activity can be, and indeed has been, beneficial to our economy.  I trust, therefore, that these proposals will not be viewed, as some commentators have suggested, as an inhibiting factor in the further strengthening of Irish industry but rather will they be seen as a necessary check against the type of merger activity which is motivated by considerations other than those which achieve the effects I have referred to.  As the House is aware the object of some <Col N="835" /> mergers can merely be the elimination of competition with possible adverse effects on productive efficiency and allocation of resources and, ultimately, restrictions in consumer choice and higher prices to the consumer.  Other undesirable objects could be the milking of profits from a business which has built up large reserves or even the run-down of a perfectly viable industry by asset-stripping. Mergers so motivated can do great harm not only to persons immediately affected but to our economy as a whole and for this reason Government controls as proposed are essential.</P>
    <P>Mergers, therefore, may be good or bad.  In our circumstances the great majority are likely to be beneficial, but the need remains to distinguish these from the minority of cases which would be positively harmful.  Because of the strong probability that a proposed merger will be beneficial, the mechanism of control will be based on a presumption in favour of proposals.  In recognition of this, the Minister has indicated his firm belief that only the very exceptional proposal will be referred by him for detailed investigations to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  For the greater part, it is expected that proposals notified will be cleared at most within a two or three week period and, in the majority of cases, the Minister expects that the green light will be given within a matter of days.  To facilitate early clearance, the Minister has stated that he would welcome informal consultation with promoters of mergers and takeovers before any announcements would be made and it would be his hope that informal reaction could be given to promoters at that stage.  It had been suggested that the reaction given by the Minister at that stage should be binding upon him when the proposed merger is formally notified.  While the Minister accepts that there is a certain merit attaching to this suggestion, he feels that the establishment of such a restriction would defeat the object of informal prior consultation for the reason that the Minister might not be willing to indicate his reaction to a proposal if he is to be bound by that reaction when a more developed proposal, which could differ <Col N="836" /> in some important way from that which was the subject of the informal consultation, is notified to him.</P>
    <P>Finally as regards the possibility of delays, I should like to draw the House's attention to an amendment effected to the Bill in the Dáil which provides for a maximum period of three months, with a possible extension of a small period when further information is sought, within which the Minister may consider a proposal and issue a decision thereon. This period compares very favourably with the period of nine months contained in the 1974 Bill and should go a long way towards easing concerns expressed about the possibility of delays.  I wish to emphasise, however, that this period will be relevant only where the Minister contemplates the possibility of prohibiting a proposal and, as I have already said, it is expected that such cases will be very few and far between.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern has been the level of the thresholds of application of the Bill.  It has been suggested that the levels proposed are much too low and compare very unfavourably with levels in similar pieces of legislation in other countries.  It has also been suggested that there should be a concept of market dominance associated with the thresholds.  As regards the thresholds I should like to point out that those proposed represent a substantial increase over those contained in the 1974 Bill, an increase which outstrips the 1974 levels adjusted for inflation.  Additionally, I wish to emphasise that the thresholds applies to both the companies involved, unlike the 1974 Bill where, in the case of a proposed merger, the Bill would have applied where only one of the companies involved had turnover or assets above the threshold.  The thresholds themselves are, of course, arbitrary, as any such limits must be.  They may also be considered low, but in a small market such as ours assets and turnover figures which might be regarded as modest in other countries might put the majority of mergers and takeovers here outside the scope of application of the Bill.  It is vital to ensure that all significant arrangements are caught and the limits must, therefore, be low.  The Bill, of course, does empower <Col N="837" /> the Minister to raise these limits and it is the intention that this power will be exercised as frequently as necessary to ensure that the levels are not outstripped by inflation.</P>
    <P>On the question of involving a concept of market share in the criteria for application of the Bill, I would like to point out that in a scheme of control concerned merely with the aspects of preserving competition such a concept would be desirable.  However, while this Bill is concerned with this area, it is only one of the matters to which the Minister will have regard when considering a proposal.  As will be noted in the schedule to the Bill, the Minister will also have regard to such questions as employment, regional matters, industrial reorganisation and the consumers' interest, each of which is equally important.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are summarised in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated and I do not therefore intend to go into any great detail at this stage except to say something about the EEC aspects. Senators are no doubt aware of the EEC Commission's vigorous line in defence of competition, the various methods already available to the Commission to facilitate effective implementation of this policy and the proposed regulation on the control of concentrations which will provide powers in relation to proposed mergers not unlike those which this Bill proposes.  Discussion on this proposed regulation, which was submitted to the EEC Council in 1973, has proved to be very protracted and, in fact, decisions have not yet been reached on matters basic to the proposal, such as the principle of pre-merger control, the field of application and the decision-making procedure.  However, in view of present trends in discussion relating to the scope, it appears that the regulation, when finally adopted, will affect only very large mergers, so large in fact that it is most unlikely that any proposed all-Irish merger will be affected.  It is, therefore, essential that we should, on the domestic front, supplement the measures to which we shall be party on the international front.</P>
    <P>My comments so far have been confined <Col N="838" /> to the merger/take-over aspects of the Bill and, as Senators are aware, the Bill applies also to monopolies.  The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 already provides for controls on undesirable practices of monopolistic concerns. Under that Act the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is empowered to regulate and prohibit practices that may be engaged in, but it is the general experience that statutory controls may be rendered at least partially ineffective where a particular market is dominated by one unitary concern or undertaking.  It is, therefore, as necessary to provide powers to restore competition by breaking up monopolies as it is to preserve competition by controlling mergers and take-overs.  I am not suggesting, however, that all monopolies are undesirable and should be broken up. On the contrary, in an economy the size of ours it is inevitable that there should be monopolies within the meaning of the Bill, that is to say which provide more than one-half of the goods or services of a particular kind in this country, but it does not follow that these monopolies are abusing their dominant positions. The fact is, however, that given the existence of monopolies the possibility exists for certain undesirable market behaviour.  It would be unwise not to recognise this and to provide for remedial action where necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill in relation to monopolies is to amend the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, to provide, by adding to the powers conferred by it, the power to break up a monopoly.  As with the other decision-making powers in this Bill, this power is conferred on the Minister but it is subject to control by the Houses of the Oireachtas in that any Order made by the Minister under this Bill relating to a monopoly will be subject to confirmation by Act of the Oireachtas before it has the force of law.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the definition of a monopoly which was amended by way of official amendment.  It had been suggested that the original definition would have applied to a large percentage of the types of industries which the IDA are actively encouraging to establish in this country and the realisation of this by potential investors <Col N="839" /> might have caused them to hesitate.  The Minister accepted that there could be a certain validity in the argument that industrial promotion efforts could be adversely affected accordingly, and he also acknowledged that any adverse effects of export-oriented monopolies would hardly be felt here.  In these circumstances, the Bill now provides for the exclusion from the definition of a monopoly of enterprise at least 90 per cent of whose output is exported or at least 90 per cent of whose output is supplied for incorporation in products which are exported.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to emphasise that the fact that an enterprise comes within the definition of a monopoly does not mean that its operations will be automatically investigated.  Investigations will only arise where there is good cause for believing that the monopoly enterprise in engaged in practices which are unfair or operate against the common good.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in this Bill can be seen as an effort to ensure that Irish business will operate in a healthy competitive environment to the betterment of the economy and not as measures designed to frustrate further business development.  I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell the House that I am extremely unhappy with this Bill, I would invite Senators very particularly to have regard to it in an entirely non-party way.  They are free to do so because this type of legislation has been hanging around the Department for longer than the Minister of State or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is one of the comforts of the two changes of Government we had that they delayed the introduction of this Bill for six years, or at least delayed its receipt by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see very little good that can be done by it, and such good as might be done by it is not spelled out.  The intended mischief, whatever it may be, and we may guess at it, which it presumably is designed to curb is not made clear to us. The damage it may do&mdash;and I do not <Col N="840" /> wish to be in any way alarmist&mdash;may be quite considerable.  For the comfort of Senators opposite I would tell the House that I expressed views on a worse Bill to the Minister then in charge of it when he introduced it.  My position on this is at least consistent.  If I am consistently wrong, maybe somebody will tell me why and how.  I hope I am being consistently right.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell the House what analysis of the structure of Irish industry has been carried out to justify the proposed very considerable interferences with the free decisions of businessmen with regard to one of the modes of growth open to them.  If such analysis was carried out, why has it not been published?  Why is it not available to us?  Was it carried out before the 1972 Bill?  Was it carried out before the 1974 Bill?  Has it been carried out before the 1978 Bill?  I cannot be put off by the cosy words of the Minister showing her Department's appreciation of the advantages of mergers when I see the possible effects of the prevention of desirable mergers which may result from this Bill. It is no comfort to me in looking at this Bill to be told that its predecessors were worse if it is still bad.</P>
    <P>As I see our country, viewing it economically, an economy of three million people in a free market of 260 million. 1 per cent approximately&mdash;and that is good enough for the purposes of anything one has to say of the market&mdash;there are various rules which we have got to comply with because we signed the Treaty.  But let nobody fool themselves.  If we were free within these rules to do things to encourage our own and to discourage others we should do them.  If an international trend of opinion is developing against mergers, and if an international trend is developing within the EEC in favour of a control of mergers, it does not logically follow that it is in our interest to go further than the EEC proposes to go in the interests of the freedom of the whole market.  It may well be in our interest to have some of our economic units strengthened to compete in that large market, to place no impediments before businessmen who have the charge of the capital in their hands in achieving the growth in size which may <Col N="841" /> be requisite for survival within that market.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are two ways by which an economic unit grows. One is by generation internally of its own growth by retained profits, by getting additional subscriptions from shareholders, by financing of one kind or another.  There is this other method, a method of merger.  I had a look at the 20 largest quoted companies and, from my own knowledge, I could work out that 14 of the 20 reached their present size by mergers.  Some of the six I did not know anything about may have done the same.</P>
    <P>There has been mention by the Minister of undesirable mergers.  Of course undesirable things happen in a free society.  Of course mistakes are made.  Of course there is asset stripping, but there has been in fact very little asset stripping in Irish circumstances.  But judgments are there to be made on those who make these mistakes and, in an endeavour to prevent one mistake, you may prevent the making of many good decisions, and this is my very particular concern.  It has been said&mdash;and said many times, and I suppose it is worth saying it again&mdash;that the size of even the largest company in Ireland is extremely modest on viewing it internationally.  As I looked at the figures given in <i>Fortune</i> I found that the company with the largest turnover published and quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange missed the first 500 of the United States companies, and was in the next 100 or so after that, I think the 600s.</P>
    <P>Here we are with our largest company not within reach of the top region of the American companies and we are creating obstacles to growth for that company and any other companies there may be.  Our market is wide open to competition from companies&mdash;not from America, we are not talking about the American market&mdash;but of Americanlike size in the UK, Germany, France, and so on.  People who talk about monopoly in the new situation are misusing the word.  I am not going into the finesse of it.  Of course a certain degree of monopoly is enjoyable in a street, in a village, in a town, or in a region, but the type of monopoly one is talking about <Col N="842" /> which involves the serious abuse of a dominant position which damages an economy's growth&mdash;how can such a monopoly grow here in the context of import penetration by these foreign competitors?</P>
    <P>We have got protection of a sort against dumping, but we are now talking about competition which will not be dumping, which will be production at a fair price and sale at a fair price in this market against our producers.  Are we to put impediments before the growth of these companies?  I think we are most unwise.  We are also unwise in the test we have chosen in this Bill and the previous Bill, the test of turnover.  Incidentally, it is not the alternative test in the UK.  The assets figure is £2½ million on both sides of the operation.  That is an improvement, and I accept it as being an improvement.  It is still a miserable figure.  I may have quoted the wrong figure&mdash;£1¼ million gross assets and a turnover of £2½ million.  In relation to turnover two companies each with the same capital, with the same number of people employed can have an entirely different turnover because of the point at which they are operating, whether they are manufacturing raw materials or taking in the goods at an advanced stage of production or perhaps selling them fully manufactured.</P>
    <P>In Britain the alternative test relates to the proportion of the market.  In the EEC where they have the turnover figure, what is the turnover figure they are proposing?  It is 500 million units of account.  That is approximately £275 million, and we are to control companies of one hundredth the size.  Even that would not bring them in the EEC into the position of being controlled because, in addition to that turnover, they have to have a market share of more than 20 per cent unless, in the alternative, whatever the turnover was, the market share exceeded 30 per cent.  That is what is proposed.  Under the proposal in the EEC notification is required, notification which does not prevent action, notification where the turnover is in excess of 50 million units of account, or ten times approximately what is here required, before the proposed merger can have effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> This point which seems to have been missed in Dáil Éireann&mdash;I suppose I am allowed to make a passing reference to the other House of the Oireachtas&mdash;and this is an important distinction between the law as it is in the United Kingdom, if I understand that law correctly&mdash;and, and as it is proposed to be here&mdash;is that in Britian there is no prohibition on the merger taking effect.  They go on with the merger.  They may be knocked down on reference to the Monopolies Commission, but the merger goes on, can go on, has legal effect and, as I understand the position, there is no obligation on the parties to refer the matter to the Department. The Department of Trade reads <i>The Financial Press</i> and, as a matter of practice of course are generally consulted by the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>In practice there will be an additional difficulty arising from the smallness of our society.  There is the trickiness, if you like, of this little city.  We are turning on another tap of information.  In relation to proposed mergers, particularly the public sphere, secrecy is everything. The walls in Dublin do not merely have ears.  They jabber.  I am aware that, in relation to particular proposals for mergers and take-overs, it has been found prudent to have the documents prepared outside of Dublin, because once the word reaches anybody, or anybody beyond the sacrosanct few deeply involved, the market gets the message before it ought to, to the damage of the innocent.</P>
    <P>There is another element in this and I am astonished at the imprudence of a political party as wise in the matter of politics as the Minister's Party.</P>

The Minister will be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a merger.  He has a big post at the moment.  What will his post be like once he is in this position? What take-overs and mergers will not rub against some sensitivities, managers or shareholders, employees or, most difficult <Col N="844" /> of all, local loyalty and interest?  If there is involved in a proposal rationalisation which may mean that some unit will be closed down somewhere in the country, will not political pull start?  Even if the Minister is totally free from having regard to such considerations, will he not be blamed for not having stopped it?  Is he not foolish to get into this position from a public point of view and from the economy's point of view?  In that position a weak Minister unfortunately may respond to it.</P>
      <P>This is particularly true if you look at the extraordinary criteria in the Schedule.  Under section 8 of the Bill the registrar has to state his opinion as to whether or not the proposed merger or take-over would operate against the common good in respect of any of the scheduled criteria.  There are nine of them.  There should be only one criterion for stopping a merger.  Does it or does it not endanger free competition?  Maybe the author of the Bill has some mischief in mind to cure.  If so, he should say it.  If it is newspapers, let us have a chunk of a Bill dealing with newspapers.  The British have not been a bit shy about it.  A new part of their Fair Trading Act, 1973, specifically provides for the merger of newspapers and newspaper assets.</P>
      <P>Maybe we are concerned about the buying power of distributive companies affecting the purchase of Irish manufactured goods.  Maybe we cannot say that specifically because of the EEC rules against discrimination between Irish and foreign goods, but there is nothing in the EEC rules which can prevent us from controlling mergers of units along the distributive line.  Anyhow the Government will not get away with that, if it is really to be used as a method of preferring Irish industry over EEC industries.  I would not have thought, at any rate, that they would get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the justification for controlling the expansion of Irish companies abroad?  Is it a simplistic idea that they should be investing their money at home even though every private individual is free to invest it abroad?  Are progressive companies, who are caught by the law to dedicate their profits for future development, <Col N="845" /> not allowed to take investment opportunities where they see these opportunities presenting themselves, particularly when we have a situation where one of our top companies is now generating more profits from activity abroad than from activity here?  Is that bad for the Irish economy?  It strengthens that company.  It makes it possible for it to invest more and create employment of a maintainable and sustainable character.</P>
    <P>We have the curious position now where companies that have up to this grown by their own generation of profit or by merger take-over, are free at this point to continue to grow beyond their present size.  The only risk they run is running into the monopoly restriction. Smaller companies can only grow by one way.  There is no justice or wisdom in that.  One of the things which has been frequently hoped for from foreign investment is what is called linkages with development.  Export oriented companies are free from the monopoly restriction but they are not free from the merger restriction.  Here is a linkage which they cannot now make without ministerial approval. With the greatest respect to public men and civil servants and lawyers, they do not know how businessmen reach their judgments.  The businessman very often does not know how to ariculate his position.  Perhaps he does not want to disclose a long term plan to anybody.</P>
    <P>It is a great mistake for us to cast this shadow over business development.  It is felt as such despite the protestations of the Minister.  Perhaps the protestations of the Minister indicates an awareness that it is felt as such but the protestations will not diminish that shadow on the development of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In this House private enterprise or free enterprise has been talked about. Let it be free to develop and let us control the abuses.  There are all sorts of controls already in existence, unlawful dismissals, redundancy provisions, provisions referring matters to courts and protection of minority interests, but let these mergers go on or at least let us have thresholds that make sense.  The fact that the patient&mdash;if I may use the <Col N="846" /> simile for the Bill&mdash;is slightly better than he was a few years ago does not make him less ill than he is at the moment.  I am not impressed by the movement of thresholds, because this is like somebody engaging in a market operation saying he will give £10 for something that is worth £100.  To bid up from whatever it was to whatever it now is is to be a mile away from the reality.  If one looks at the list of Irish companies which I have here, the turnover of the first 61 is in excess of the threshold so that if one bids for any one of these one has to go to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, convince the highly agreeable gentleman there that this is a good thing and get their permission to do it.  If one does not, acceptance of one's bid is of no effect. One cannot go ahead and say one will work it out afterwards.  It has no effect. What happens to the price of the share in the meantime?  What happens in the market place?</P>
    <P>The amendment which could transform this Bill and would take a lot of the damage out of it would be to delete the provision in section 3, &ldquo;that a merger shall not have effect until&rdquo;.  It would indicate to the world at large that we were looking more appropriately to the size we wish this economy to grow to if we had thresholds that were more realistic than we have in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some people who are not aware of what is going on may not realise how the British Stock Exchange manage when all these mergers and acquisitions take place when they have had legislation on this subject since 1948.  I should like to quote from the Guide to the Board of Trade Practice:</P>
    <P>In practice, under the legislation, only a small proportion of mergers considered by the Board of Trade have been referred to the Commission. This is because in only a few cases was there sufficient doubt about the implications of the mergers for the public interest.  In the great majority of the cases, as was always envisaged, the board has decided that, even though the mergers could not be classified as positively desirable in the national interest and should be such as to be actively encouraged, there <Col N="847" /> were not sufficient grounds to refer them to the Commission for full scale examination with all that that would entail.</P>
    <P>That is the guide issued by the Board of Trade.  We should have legislation which goes beyond the language of the Minister.  The Minister introducing the Bill should not have to justify any of its provisions.  The legislation should set out the position clearly to enable that type of communication to be issued by the Department.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever about the good intentions of the Department, but that has very little to do with it.  It will be many years before people will be satisfied that they need not worry about legislation which, on the face of it, they ought to be worrying about and which, in effect, would apply to their proposals. I have nothing more to say at this stage.</P>

      <P>I accept the Senator's explanation.  The Government accept that the vast majority of mergers are desirable and that the method of a company's growth by a merger is desirable, and of course the Government would encourage such desirable mergers.  The scheme of the Bill recognises this, and it is for this reason that the Minister is being enabled to clear desirable mergers fairly rapidly.  It is not agreed that companies who wish to expand by merger activity will be faced with what the Senator claims may be insurmountable difficulties and impediments. I have indicated that there will be <Col N="848" /> a presumption in favour of mergers, but promoters of mergers may approach the Minister on an informal basis.  It would be the intention that an indication of what his feelings towards the merger might be could be indicated to them at that stage but no firm indication could be given and nothing the Minister might say would be binding at such informal consultations.  I am satisfied that the majority of mergers will be cleared in a very expeditious manner so as to cause the least upset to Irish business.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the position in the United Kingdom where mergers may go ahead but may be broken up later. That is a most unsatisfactory situation because it can lead to uncertainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas under this Bill once approval is given the merger proceeds and cannot be broken up.  The Senator asked what was the reason for preventing Irish firms from expanding abroad.  I assume that the Senator is referring to the fact that Irish companies taking over a foreign company will have to notify and get clearance.  Since EEC firms taking over an Irish firm are caught by the Bill then, to avoid complaints of discrimination on the grounds of nationality, Irish firms should also be caught.  The Senator mentioned the prior notification in the United Kingdom.  I understand that there is now a very strong feeling in the United Kingdom that proposals should be notified and indeed, as the system operates there, it is the general experience that mergers are notified before they are effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator mentioned the size of Irish firms as against European companies. This is not a fair comparison because, in a small market and a small economy such as ours, thresholds which might be regarded as modest in the European context might, in fact, put the majority of Irish mergers outside the control of the Bill and would lessen its effect as a result.  In regard to the criteria, the Senator felt that only one criterion was sufficient, and that had to do with the level of competition.  There <Col N="849" /> are concerns which arise, for example, in the case of a merger which would involve the transfer of resources from an undeveloped area which would involve the loss of a substantial number of jobs, which could not be justified by any long term economies that might be gained as a result of the merger.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Government to appear to have a bias against mergers.  The Government are anxious to promote a healthy economy.  They are anxious that all mergers in this country would be beneficial to our economy. There must be legislation which curbs those that are undesirable, and the criteria laid down in the Bill will prevent such mergers taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy made an order last March amending the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973.  I will explain briefly why the 1973 order was made and what its object was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past ten to 12 years we have seen considerable changes in the methods of trading in grocery goods.  We had the multiple supermarkets which heightened competition at the retail level. The traditional wholesaler and retailer formed voluntary buying groups in an effort to compete with the multiples. New ideas such as cash and carry outlets were introduced to make the distribution <Col N="850" /> system more efficient. However, these traditional traders felt that certain unfair practices had arisen because of the importance of the buying power of the multiples.  They alleged that suppliers, in order to ensure that multiples would continue to buy their grocery goods supplied them on terms which descriminated unfairly against the rest of the trade.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission held a public inquiry into these complaints and reported to the Minister.  The main conclusion of the Commission was that many suppliers discriminated unfairly against wholesalers and the smaller retailer.  Suppliers also made small deliveries of goods at frequent intervals to individual branches of multiples, which did not encourage economies of distribution and did not take into account the real savings in making large deliveries.  The commission recommended that these abuses should be corrected in the public interest.  The Minister made an order under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 designed to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices is to monitor the operation of these orders.  In November 1974, he reported to the commission that the order was not succeeding in its aims.  He gave the following reasons. The order placed the onus on suppliers of deciding what weight to give to delivery costs, and wholesalers did not agree with their assessment because they felt there were considerable economies in large deliveries.  Furthermore the smaller wholesaler, who served sparsely populated areas, feared that he might not be able to handle large deliveries.  Suppliers agreed, and for many, these wholesalers were the only way of getting their goods to the small country retailer.  A number of supermarket chains and retailer buying groups reacted strongly to terms and conditions agreed to by suppliers and the Examiner.  The suppliers were told that their goods would no longer be stocked and they were forced to revert to their old terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission carried out a review into this part of the order.  The commission recognised that buyers could resort to importing <Col N="851" /> groceries and felt that Irish suppliers should be free to make the most of the advantage they had in being physically close to some of their important customers.  They also felt that suppliers should have flexibility in determining their terms.  Article 4 of the amending order gives suppliers increased freedom to take account of all the economies of supply and distribution to different buyers, having regard to their own interest, while still requiring them to operate equitable terms.</P>
    <P>The commission also recognised that some large buyers were obtaining concessions, not by coercing suppliers in into giving larger discounts, but by not paying their bills on time.  They felt that the taking of unfair or unreasonable excess credit should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>I agree that this is a problem.  It may be argued that suppliers have a remedy in the civil law to obtain payment of debts but I believe that many are reluctant to do so for fear of losing important outlets for their goods.  I accept that their fear is real and that their rights need to be reinforced by making these abuses of economic power offences.  The taking of excess credit must be seen for what it is&mdash;simply another way of getting goods on terms not available to the rest.</P>
    <P>Failure to pay on time arises only where the purchaser has real economic power which the supplier is understandably reluctant to challenge by pressing for payment.  This is reflected in the amending order.</P>
    <P>Some people may feel that this provision will make it less attractive for purchasers to deal with Irish suppliers and may encourage them to obtain more goods from abroad.  I do not believe, however, that the powerful Irish purchaser will be able to make some of the demands on foreign suppliers that are made of Irish suppliers.  It may well be that it would not be a profitable proposition for some large purchasers to import a large volume of grocery goods. I do not believe, therefore, that there will be a change to foreign suppliers, and I hope that the new regime will not lead to this.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn briefly to some of the less important changes <Col N="852" /> which the amending order brings about:</P>
    <P>(1)  Fresh and frozen meat: The commission felt that the arguments submitted to them by the trade justified excluding fresh and frozen meat from the scope of the order.  Fresh and frozen meat&mdash;a commodity derived from animals of varying breeds and sold in a variety of forms&mdash;was a perishable commodity requiring special storage space and the seasonal supply and demand rendered difficult the control of quantity and price.</P>
    <P>(2)  Own-label goods: Suppliers of these goods did not want to publish their terms for the supply of these goods as this would encourage demand for them to the detriment of their own branded product which would not be in their interest. The commission accepted the validity of this argument, and Article 4 implements their recommendation.  Article 6 implements the commission's other suggestion that the examiner should continue to have power to request details about these goods.</P>
    <P>(3)  Supplementary terms: In their report of the 1971 inquiry, the commission were not sympathetic to supplementary terms, that is to say terms additional to standard ones often negotiated confidentially with large suppliers.  The 1973 order provided that these should not become so important as to substantially lessen the benefit of standard terms. There was difficulty about the interpretation of this provision, and article 4 of the amending order seeks to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>(4)  Registration of suppliers' terms and conditions: Suppliers, under the 1973 order, were obliged to lodge their terms and conditions with the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and to adhere to these.  The examiner maintained that this provision did not work in practice.  The commission accepted this, and Article 6 provides that suppliers need lodge their terms with the examiner only at his request.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The amending order also provides for some minor rearrangements of a number of provisions but I hardly think these need to be commented on.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission recognised that their recommendations lacked precision and would allow a wide <Col N="853" /> range of options for the supplier in determining terms and conditions of supply. However, they felt that the realities of the situation called for flexibility.  The grocery sector of the distributive trade is very diverse.  There are variations in the characteristics of different products, difference in the size and market position of individual suppliers, and exigencies of changing circumstances over time. These considerations require that the supplier should have flexibility in formulating terms of supply while at the same time the order seeks to ensure equity of treatment for all customers.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order.</P>
    <P>The present position is unsatisfactory, and I believe this order will remove some of the difficulties which arose from the original order made in 1873.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Táim buíoch duit as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an rud seo a phlé.  I am glad of the opportunity of raising this matter.  I do so in an entirely non-contentious spirit and only in the interest of clarifying what seems to be an anomaly in the workings of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. At issue here, I suggest, is their credibility with the public.  The IIRS have done very good work indeed and there is no contention about most of the work they do.  Let me remind the House that they were set up by the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1946 and reorganised by an amending Act in 1961, and the functions of the institute are defined in section 6 of that Act of <Col N="854" /> 1961.  Among those functions are to undertake, encourage and foster scientific research, promote the utilisation of the natural resources of the State and so on, and these functions they have carried out excellently.  During the debate on the White Paper I paid tribute to the work of the IIRS in their work of ascertaining natural resources.</P>
      <P>Throughout the Act the public role of the IIRS is stressed.  Again and again it is conveyed that the institute shall work for the public benefit.  I am bringing up the matter because I do not think it is quite clear that the institute are carrying out their work for the public benefit exclusively and that there can be contradiction between this and its other role. Of the work they do 80 per cent is noncontroversial. They can, for example, be consulted by Irish Steel about specifications, and here their expertise and level of technical excellence are unchallenged. They have similarly done much work for small industries in the country and here again they deserve public gratitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But more and more over the past seven or eight years the IIRS have been called in as consultants to private industry in the very controversial area of pollution, or, put more widely, in the area of environmental hazards, and it is in this area that some of their work can give rise to public concern.  I would be disingenuous if I pretended that this did not arise immediately out of a particular case and that is the case of Raybestos Manhattan which has been agitating the emotions of my fellow Corkmen for some time now.  I do not propose to go into the pros and cons of that situation but it does present a perfect test case of the kind of thing I am talking about.  In <i>The Cork Examiner</i> at the moment there is a series of advertisements the purpose of which is to restore, or perhaps recover, public confidence in what is going on in the asbestos factory at Ovens and in the question of waste disposal at Ringaskiddy.  In these advertisements the public are reassured of what is going on and are told that the IDA have taken all necessary steps and so on.  International experts are quoted and the opinions of the IIRS are cited.  It would appear from that that the IIRS are acting as a public watchdog, which is the main <Col N="855" /> role envisaged for them in the Act of 1961, but the IIRS in the case of Raybestos Manhattan and in many other cases as well are playing a dual if not contradictory role.</P>
    <P>It is true that the IIRS have nothing ostensibly to do with private industry until planning permission is granted, and so the IIRS people might claim that this protects their independence.  They are apparently kept out of the picture until planning permission is granted and the industry is set up.  But in fact what happens is that as soon as a prospective industrialist looks at a site and puts his cards on the table the Industrial Development Authority employ the IIRS to look at that company's application, the IIRS services are paid for by the IDA and a report based on their recommendations is then presented to the planning authority.  After various appeals and so on the permission is granted, and then that private industry may, and in most cases does, consult the IIRS in a private consultant capacity. Therefore, you have a kind of concealed role at the beginning in which the IIRS act as consultants for the IDA and then subsequently on the granting of planning permission the IIRS are taken on as private consultants by the company in question.  The institute do not shun this role as consultants; in fact they seek it out actively.  They feel that they have somehow to shift the bulk of their financial maintenance from Government to industry and they are encouraged and feel themselves under pressure to thus increase their share of consultant revenue. The planning permission is a direct result of IIRS reports.  It is they who present a report to the IDA and that report goes straight to the planning authority and the planning authority incorporate the IIRS reports straight into their draft planning material.  Yet the institute go on to be employed as a private consultant by the company subsequently to guarantee the adequacy of pollution safeguards.</P>
    <P>There is also a lack of any sufficient safeguard at planning authority level to evaluate what the IIRS do so that they reign supreme really in the matter of assessing safe levels and so on of pollutants. <Col N="856" /> Theoretically the county council have an environmental officer, but it is well known within groups like An Taisce that there is unease about the qualifications of environmental officers to deal effectively with these matters.  The broad outline is as I have suggested.  The independence of the IIRS as a public watchdog is being limited by the economic imperative of having also to earn their keep as private consultants.  Is it not true that their watchdog role is being limited if not compromised?  Should there be another body set up which would be exclusively a public watchdog without any suspicion of being involved in the private side, or should the safeguards to maintain public confidence and credibility in the IIRS be spelled out more fully?  It reminds me of when I was young and innocent and a prospective purchaser of a house.  I found to my horror that the solicitor who was acting for me was also acting for the vendor.  Obviously in that situation somebody was losing out and it was not the vendor.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, what is needed is at least an acknowledgement that there is an anomaly here.  I am raising this matter in an entirely non-contentious spirit and I would like to see at least the problem acknowledged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult in the short time available to deal adequately with this subject, all the more so because of the importance and the very wide scope of the functions and the activities of the IIRS.  I would like first to make some general comments about these and then to deal in so far as it is possible for me to do so in the circumstances with the points raised by Senator Murphy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the IIRS as set out in section 6 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961 are very extensive. One could say that on the basis of these functions the scope of the activities of the institute in relation to industry could, in principle at any rate, be held to extend to all industrial activity from the efficient utilisation of raw materials and natural resources to the provision of quality assurance on manufactured goods and <Col N="857" /> processes.  In practice, however, industrial trends and the need to utilise to maximum advantage the resources of the institute mean that the range of services provided is not quite so extensive and that the institute's services to industry are concentrated on the manufacture and use of goods, minerals, chemicals, plastics and metals and on the building, textile and food industry.  In addition a wide range of industries are provided with general services in energy saving, in product and process evaluation and certification, standard specifications, product testing, calibration and measurement facilities for both home and export market.  In short, the institute endeavour to provide for Irish industry in one organisation a range of tasks that in other European countries are undertaken by a series of separate technical institutes or research associations catering for individual industries.  This means that there is in the institute a concentration of specialist technological skills and facilities which are available to industry generally on a shared cost basis.</P>
    <P>The tasks performed by the industry can be classified under four broad heads. They are: research and development which are orientated to industry; technical advisory services which are likewise orientated to industry and at their higher level tend to merge with research and development activities; standards and specifications which are partly consumer and partly industry orientated; and free advisory services. The number of jobs done in a year by the institute under the first two heads is about 10,000 of about which 80 per cent are jobs which cost the client less than £100 each.  It may interest the House to know that 72 per cent of these jobs are for firms in the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for much greater research and development effort on the part of industry generally, and in furtherance of this it is likely that the institute will have to extend further their activities in this area.  This does not mean that the institute should engage in fundamental research but that they concentrate on the development aspects and in assisting Irish firms, native or foreignowned, to identify and assimilate relevant technologies.  For instance the IIRS <Col N="858" /> are already playing an active role with foreign firms in the chemical sector by identifying new product lines and by establishing contacts with Irish companies to supply intermediate products and specialist machine parts.  It is also increasingly recognised both by the State bodies and by the managements of externally controlled companies that the continuance and growth of their Irish operations will depend on the development of new products or processes initiated in Ireland.  Demand for the technical advisory services of the Institute continues to increase There are many aspects to technical advisory services and they vary from industry to industry.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to comment on one aspect of the technical advisory services, and I do so partly because it was mentioned by Senator Murphy and partly because there appears to be a good deal of misunderstanding about the nature of the role of the IIRS in this matter. I refer to the role of the IIRS in regard to environmental problems.  In this area the institute have built up over the last few years the largest group of environmental consultants in the State and have developed an expertise to tackle a wide range of complex environmental problems.  Had the institute not acquired this expertise there is little doubt that the services of foreign consultants would have had to be invoked to deal with many of the bigger and more exacting environmental assignments.</P>
    <P>The service which the institute provide in this matter is available alike to Government, local authorities and industry. Despite, or perhaps because of, this there appears, regrettably, to be a certain amount of misunderstanding about the nature of the role of the institute. This sometimes is in the form of the accusation that in the case of new industry the institute act in environmental matters as judge, jury and executioner. The true position is that since 1973 the Industrial Development Authority have used the services of the institute and of An Foras Forbartha to undertake an assessment from the environmental point of view of new industrial projects.  This procedure ensures on the one hand that environmentally unacceptable industries are ruled out at an early stage by the <Col N="859" /> IDA and it also means that the Department of the Environment are involved, albeit indirectly, through An Foras Forbartha in influencing at the earliest stages the initial standards for new industry. At the planning stage of a new industry the local authorities are invariably presented with a copy of the joint assessment undertaken by the IIRS and An Foras Forbartha.  If the local authority do not accept the joint assessment they are free to seek more information from both the institute and from An Foras Forbartha to commission them to undertake further work on their behalf or to employ outside consultants.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there have been any instances where the integrity of the joint assessment was called into question by the local authority, although IIRS findings may of course meet with local opposition.  The local authorities rarely use foreign consultants although foreign experts are sometimes called in by local objectors.  Once the planning stage has been successfully completed the institute consider themselves free of their commitment to the IDA and the local authority, and can if requested undertake fee earning work on behalf of the new industry.  The institute never become involved in assisting a particular enterprise until planning permission has been received.  Part of the misunderstanding that arises here may be due to the misconception that the engagement of the IIRS as a consultant, either by the <Col N="860" /> IDA in respect of a particular project or by the industry itself when established, means that the institute are then on the side of their client.  The institute endeavour to be totally objective in their advice to clients and in environmental matters never claim to act for a private client to his advantage.  In this the institute set great store by the maintenance of their reputation for objectivity and will not be prepared to do anything that would damage that reputation.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the institute's activities which I would like to touch on, bearing in mind the present compaign for the promotion of increased sales of Irish goods on the home market, is the information that it has provided and will continue to provide in conjunction with the Irish Goods Council.  Senators may not be aware, for example, that the institute have produced in conjunction with the council an extensive 280-page directory of consumer product manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate what Senator Murphy said when he complimented the IIRS.  All of us in this country owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the IIRS for some of the tremendous work which they have undertaken not only on behalf of the IDA and of local authorities but on behalf of industry generally in our country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 June 1978.</P>
