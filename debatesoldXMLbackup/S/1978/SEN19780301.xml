      <P>I have considered a request from Senator Martin to raise, on the motion for the Adjournment this evening, the following matter:</P>
      <P>The threatened closure of Dominican Convent, Eccles Street, Dublin and the future role of religious privately-owned schools in Irish education.</P>
      <P>I rule that this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that (a) there is no ministerial responsibility involved in the decision to close private schools and (b) the general question of the future role of religious privately-owned schools in Irish education is one that should come forward by way of substantive motion.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1977: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits contained in the current legislation.  Specifically, the Bill provides for: (1) an increase from £25 million to £45 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company; (2) an increase from £17 million to £22 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, which may be made to the company; (3) an increase from £17 million to £22 million in the limit on the issue of repayable advances by the Minister for <Col N="635" /> Finance for the provision of housing and community services at Shannon.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that the level of remuneration and allowances of the chief officer of the company shall be subject to my approval given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works.  A small proportion of share capital is expended on tourism projects of a capital nature.  Repayable advances are used for capital expenditure on housing and community services at Shannon.  The houses are provided by the company to rent or to purchase and developed sites are also made available for private house-building. The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries at Shannon. A substantial part of the company's running expenses relate to tourism promotion.  Expenditure in this area is met by a grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Tourism and Transport is accountable but which, nevertheless, comes within the overall limit now being amended by section 3 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Expenditure by the company under these three headings at 31 December 1977 was as follows: Share Capital, £25,000,000; Repayable advances, £15,281,500; Grant-in-aid, £13,841,150.</P>
      <P>The existing limit for share capital has already been reached and there are no funds available under this heading to meet current requirements and to enable the company to continue with their factory construction programme. It is, therefore, a matter of urgency that the statutory limits be now increased.  On the basis of estimates of expenditure available the proposed new limits will be reached by about the end of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of control proposed in section 5 in relation to the remuneration of the chief executive of the company is now being inserted in relevant <Col N="636" /> statutes governing the different State companies as the opportunity arises. The power to control the chief executive's salary is already contained in the memorandum and articles of association of the company; so in fact the new provision will not affect the control operating at present but will merely give it statutory backing.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which legislation increasing the company's statutory expenditure limits was enacted was in July 1974.  As in the case of the rest of the country, the three-and-a-half years since then have been difficult ones for both Shannon and the mid-west region.  Employment in the Shannon Industrial Estate declined by over 700 during the period March 1974 to December 1975.  The level of employment recovered during 1976 and 1977 and by December 1977 it had reached 4,362&mdash;an increase of over 500 on the end-1975 level. Shannon's export surplus has increased consistently during the period under review.  The estimated surplus for 1977 is £50 million or over twice the 1974 figure.</P>
    <P>The population of Shannon town has grown steadily over the period and at the end of 1977 it had reached 8,023.  I note with satisfaction that there is a continuing increase in the number of Shannon residents who are opting to purchase their houses under the company's housing mortgage scheme.  This trend enhances the stability of the town and provides a firm base for further progress.</P>
    <P>Airport traffic developed satisfactorily over the period.  A record level of passenger traffic through Shannon was achieved last year.  Total passenger traffic in 1977 exceeded 1,170,000 of whom over 550,000 were terminal passengers. The tourism activities of the company also recorded satisfactory progress during the past three years.</P>
    <P>Although the original establishment of the company arose from the need to secure the future of Shannon Airport, the company have had, since 1968, the function of promoting the industrial development of the mid-west region in association with the IDA.  The international recession of 1974-75 cost the <Col N="637" /> region about 2,200 industrial jobs. mainly in the Limerick/Shannon area. There was a considerable improvement in 1976-77 and the region would have recovered those jobs fully by the end of 1977 but for the closure of the Ferenka factory.  Ferenka's closure resulted in a net loss of about 450 jobs in 1977 for the region as a whole.  The company are, however, confident that 1978 will see a return to steady industrial growth because of (a) the number of job approvals&mdash;3,900&mdash;in 1977 which will start to come on stream in 1978-79 and (b) the number of jobs&mdash;3,350&mdash;which remain to be established from industrial projects approved prior to 1977.</P>
    <P>In addition new industry inquiries are encouraging, running at about 25 per cent above last year's levels.  Based on these considerations, the company expect that there will be a net increase of about 1,500 industrial jobs in the region in 1978.</P>
    <P>The news of the Ferenka closure overshadowed the announcement of three major new industrial developments for Limerick and the region&mdash; Alcan, Beechams and Le Jouet Francais&mdash;involving a total job potential of 1,450 and planned fixed asset investment of about £270 million.  The unprecedented level of job loss resulting from the Ferenka closure and the serious impact that it is having on the Limerick area are the reasons why the Government decided to designate Limerick city and some adjoining areas for higher maximum levels of industrial grants.  All possibilities are being explored in regard to getting a replacement firm for Ferenka but it is too early to indicate what the outcome of these efforts will be.</P>
    <P>Alcan's decision to proceed with the establishment of an alumina plant at Aughinish has demonstrated the industrial potential of the Shannon estuary. The promotion of estuary locations for suitable new industry will remain an important part of industrial development strategy in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>When speaking on this Bill in the other House I referred to the recent retirement of Mr. Brendan O'Regan from the chairmanship&mdash;but happily not from the board&mdash;of SFADCo and <Col N="638" /> I think it is appropriate that I should do likewise now.  Mr. O'Regan's outstanding record of public service spans a period of 30 years.  More than anyone he is closely indentified with SFADCo of which he had been chairman since their establishment in 1959. My regret that Mr. O'Regan found it necessary to relinquish the chairmanship is eased by the fact that his guidance will remain available to the board who are now about to embark upon new tasks.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with a matter which does not arise out of this Bill but which I regard as being of considerable significance&mdash;in the most positive sense&mdash;to the future economic and social development of the mid-west region and I believe eventually&mdash;by example and extension &mdash;to the rest of the country.  This is the proposal which I mentioned at the corresponding stage in the other House, whereby SFADCo are to concentrate on the development of small industry in the mid-west region in an intensive way not previously attempted in this country.  This is a pilot scheme, the results of which will be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years when decisions will be taken about extending the scheme to the rest of the country.  As I told the other House, I see this new role as giving a new dimension and a new thrust to SFADCo's work particularly in relation to industrial development. The company have, to a considerable extent, achieved their original objective, namely, to secure the future of Shannon Airport.  Accordingly, the considerable flair for innovation and development work that they have shown on a number of fronts since 1959 should now be turned in a new direction.</P>
    <P>It has long been one of my concerns that we should seek to strengthen greatly the position of indigenous Irish industry&mdash;especially small industry. We must, of course, continue and indeed intensify for many years to come our efforts to attract here new manufacturing industry that is externally financed and controlled.  Industry of this kind is very welcome and indeed one of our problems is that we cannot get enough of it but the very <Col N="639" /> success that we have in attracting such industry means that unless we take concurrent steps to develop domestic industry to a greater extent, our industrial structure will get out of balance and in the long term this could pose difficulties for us.  It has in recent years come to be increasingly recognised not only in Ireland but in the EEC&mdash;and experience in the US also bears this out&mdash;that economic growth depends very much on a greatly increased &ldquo;birth rate&rdquo; of small firms. Very great emphasis was placed on the importance of small industry and the need to give greater attention to its development in the debates in the Dáil and the Seanad towards the end of 1977 on the Industrial Development Bill, 1977.</P>
    <P>The board of SFADCo have confirmed their readiness to take on this new and nationally important role. Detailed planning is now in hand and I look forward to positive action on the ground within the region in a very short time.  The main burden of the detailed planning immediately rests between SFADCo and the IDA but further consultations between my Department and the Department of Economic Planning and Development will also be necessary.  In particular I am anxious that local resources and skills be deployed to maximum advantage in support of the new role and here I am thinking particularly of the special contribution which county development officers in the region can make.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the other House, in order to free SFADCo to concentrate all their energies and resources on the new task I am arranging that the IDA will resume full responsibility for the promotion and development of industry other than small industry within the mid-west region.  Possibly because of this aspect of the proposal, a certain amount of opposition to and criticism of the new arrangements has been engendered&mdash;or perhaps I should say whipped up&mdash;at local level.  This opposition and criticism is based on the notion that, by returning to the IDA the formal responsibility which prior to 1968 they exercised in respect of medium- and large-sized industry one <Col N="640" /> is downgrading SFADCo and weakening regional development.  This line of argument is a totally spurious one.  We want, as I say, to give SFADCo a new and special role with a special regional significance.  In discharging their new responsibility they will, through new arrangements being worked out now with the IDA for the delegation of grant giving powers, be able for the first time to give grants to industry within the region.  And they will be able to do this in a speedy and flexible manner.</P>
    <P>As to involvement with medium-and large-sized industry within the region the development company to discharge properly their new responsibility will have to involve themselves with such firms.  What they will not have is responsibility for promotion in the region&mdash;apart from the industrial estate&mdash;of medium- and large-sized industry.  Since this activity directly involves, as I understand it, only some 2 per cent of SFADCo's total staff of about 200 and since the IDA have in any case always been involved almost exclusively in the promotion of new large enterprises in the region&mdash;for example, Alcan&mdash;the change does not represent a downgrading in any way of the role of the development company and it is wrong to think that it does.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who may have had genuine misapprehensions in this matter now have a better appreciation of what is involved in the new role.  What it entails is a change of direction, a change of emphasis in the industrial promotion work of SFADCo and with that change of emphasis I expect a greatly increased volume of industrial development work&mdash;of a new kind &mdash;by the company involving perhaps the diversion to this work of promotional skills now being deployed elsewhere in the company.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have just said will enable the House to have a better understanding of the new industrial and economic role now being planned for the company.  On their past record I have every confidence that the company will respond to the challenge posed by their role with the same energy and determination as they have <Col N="641" /> shown in the various other development activities that they have undertaken since its foundation.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its purpose is to increase and extend the financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  There has been universal praise for SFADCo since their foundation nearly 20 years ago.  In that period they have proved themselves a pioneering, enterprising and very highly successful development company and the praise showered upon them by both sides is well deserved.</P>
      <P>The company assume responsibility for the development of Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary.  For the most part that region was very poor industrially and, but for the work of SFADCo down through the two decades of their existence, it would be a very badly off region today.  The company have built up a vast school of experience and a great team of personnel equipped not only with a good business knowledge and executive flair but also armed with an ability and a conviction to sell the potential of the area to industrialists and investors.  In addition, the main advantage that SFADCo have had as a regional development company is the fact that they have been centred in the area and therefore, have a very good knowledge of the area's problems and of the area's potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must record one criticism of SFADCo.  I offer this not as a serious criticism, which I would aim at the central purpose and thinking behind SFADCo, but as a criticism from one coming from north Tipperary.  That part of the country comprises one-third roughly, geographically at any rate, of the mid-west region.  It has not received all the industrial benefit it could have received, nor has it been endowed with as much industrial development as have other portions of the mid-west region.  I know the Minister is conscious of this and the figures for jobs actually delivered in 1977 in the mid-west region indicate a bias in favour of north Tipperary.  But that is unrepresentative of what has happened down <Col N="642" /> through the years and it is exceptional. Indeed, the number of job approvals for north Tipperary in the context of the whole region does not, unhappily, show the same prejudice.</P>
    <P>Everybody is concerned in the first instance with his own area, his own people, and with his own prosperity, needless to say.  I record this criticism not as a serious criticism in respect of the operations of SFADCo but rather in the hope that the criticism will remain foremost in the minds and consciousness of the board and management of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister said here and in the Dáil that the primary aim of SFADCo was to save Shannon Airport.  The company were formed at a time when danger threatened the continued existence of the Shannon Free Airport and, indeed, the local prosperity the company had engendered.  But, even at that time, that was not the sole aim of the company and development down through the years and changing circumstances have put a far greater emphasis on the broad and more fundamental aim of the company.  It is worth while recording what the company's objective is.  The company's objective is to ensure the growth of Shannon Free Airport in trade, passengers and services and to create a healthy prosperity in the mid-west region through sound industrial development.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister said rightly that there was now no danger to the airport because of the work of SFADCo.  I agree with him but, even if that aspect of the company's objective has been satisfied and has been achieved, their overall purpose of creating healthy prosperity through sound industrial development has not yet been achieved.  There is still a great deal to be done.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, their board and management have great resources in a very broad mandate, a mandate to create and develop industries of all sorts in the region of Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary. Their function is to bring in industries, whether they are big or small, foreign owned or indigenous to the area, to encourage all type of industry, <Col N="643" /> to harmonise the activities of industries, of business, of town development, so that they may prove a benefit not only to the economy of the region but to the national economy. The company's mandate did not exclude them from introducing foreign industry or major industry into the area.  Their job of bringing the prosperity they were originally designed to bring into the area is not complete. Even at that, SFADCo as such have been extremely successful at all levels, whether it be in relation to small industry, big industry, native industry or foreign industry.  Despite recent setbacks the performance of SFADCo in the area over the last few difficult years of economic recession has proved their worth.  Their success has been due to the wide mandate they have, a mandate important to their autonomy. The company have shown the worth of decentralisation particularly from the point of view of regional development. The existence of SFADCo and their work down through the years has given the mid-west region a confidence in itself&mdash;a confidence I believe it would not have were the job of development in the area left with a development authority centred in Dublin, concerned with national as opposed to regional development.  I believe that, left with their present mandate and autonomy, SFADCo will continue to enchance their successful reputation and will bring to the region the healthy prosperity they were originally charged to bring.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I am greatly disturbed by the Minister's proposals with regard to the future of SFADCo.  The Minister wishes SFADCo to assume a special responsibility for small indigenous related industries.  If the Minister's proposals is that he would give extra financial resources and extra encouragement to create or develop new small industries in the region then this is a commendable proposal and I would support it, but the Minister's proposals go a great deal further than that.  He proposes that, in order to leave SFADCo with the opportunities, the time and the <Col N="644" /> resources to develop small industries, he will take from them the existing right or duty to bring in big industry and foreign industry into the area. I would say to the Minister, if he wants to ensure the growth of small industry in the area, then he should give more money to SFADCo to enable them to take on more personnel so that they will be able to create a special section within themselves designed to develop small industry.  As matters stand, the Minister is giving no new function to SFADCo.  SFADCo presently are concerned with small industry as well as big industry and they have been very successful at every level.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals are misleading in the sense that there is more to the proposals than meets the eye or more certainly than we are being told.  It may be that there is some difficulty between the Industrial Development Authority and SFADCo in so far as powers are concerned.  I do not really know but I would ask the Minister, if his desire is to help develop small industry, not to take from SFADCo the powers they have. The sum total of what the Minister proposes at the moment is to denude the most successful regional development company we have ever had of their real powers.  I am afraid that these proposals will reduce SFADCo to the level of a county development team with even less power than that team has.</P>
    <P>If effect is given to the Minister's proposals immense damage will be done to the mid-western region.  The area cannot get and will not get the same attention from the Industrial Development Authority or any authority centred outside the area that it received from SFADCo.  My home town of Thurles has done extremely well from SFADCo.  It could do with a great deal more because the town has developed over the past decade, or two, and now has a bigger population which it is anxious to keep at home.  I can say in relation to Thurles, as I can say in relation to many towns in the mid-western region, that the industries we have got are foreign-owned but SFADCo will <Col N="645" /> no longer have, under the Minister's proposals here, the power to bring these in and I am absolutely convinced that the IDA will not be nearly as concerned about towns the size of Thurles, Templemore, Roscrea, Nenagh or towns in other countries in the mid-west region as SFADCo have been.  SFADCo know the area and have the interests of the area completely at heart.  They have the conviction necessary to sell the area and its advantages, which will bring in industries suitable to the area.  The IDA, on the other hand, are concerned with bigger industries.  They do not consider a small town because, when they consider the introduction of an industry, they are talking about a massive labour pool.</P>
    <P>I believe that to take from SFADCo the powers they have would do immense damage to Tipperary, particularly north Tipperary, and also to Clare.  Limerick being a bigger city would probably receive more attention from the IDA.  Overall this is a regressive and bad proposal.  Industrially, the mid-west region has taken a bad hammering over the past several months because of the closure of Ferenka.  The Minister has said he did appoint a certain portion of the mid-west region a designated area so far as industrial development is concerned but, when doing that, he did not include all of the employment catchment area of Ferenka.  There is a large portion of west Tipperary, a very poor agricultural area, the Slieve Phelim region, where families rely on industry to supplement their incomes.</P>
    <P>If I might digress for a moment, the electoral promise made by Fianna Fáil and the guarantee given to include this area of west Tipperary, the poorer areas in the Slieve Phelim region, in the disadvantaged areas scheme, has yet to be honoured.  If the public utterances of the Minister for Agriculture since the election mean anything they indicate very strongly that there is an attempt to sidestep on this guarantee. We have lost Ferenka and people in poorer areas have lost an income or this means of supplementing their income.  Outside Nenagh, Silvermines employ several hundred <Col N="646" /> workers.  The life of the mine is limited.  The estimate at the moment is four to five years.  If the price of the mineral product it produces drops further, or does not stabilise, does not increase or sustain itself in world markets, the likelihood is that that mining enterprise will have even a shorter life span.  That is a very short period&mdash; three or four or five years&mdash;in terms of bringing in and establishing an industry that will absorb something in the order of 600 or 700 men.</P>
    <P>So, between Ferenka and the likely major cutdown in employment because of the mines reaching their natural end, there is the danger that we will require something in the order of 2,200 to 2,500 extra jobs in that area over the next few years.  That, of course, is in addition to the ever-increasing demand we have for employment in any area in the country anyway.  To take away at this juncture the autonomy, the enterprising and able executive powers SFADCo have will do immense damage.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider the position.  I know that he is approaching this in what he regards as a very sensible and proper fashion.  I do not suggest that he is being in any way dishonest but I doubt somehow that the reason SFADCo are being denuded of all powers is for the reason he has given.  I feel there is something more to this&mdash;I do not know what it is&mdash;but there are reverberations and I am not inclined to accept that the board of SFADCo are very happy with what has happened.  It is a State agency.</P>
    <P>A short while ago in this House we discussed the establishment of the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the necessity that that person should be independent and outside the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy so that he could act independently. In this instance the Minister tells us that the board of SFADCo are satisfied to take on their new job.  Of course, they are satisfied to take on their new job.  They are a semi-State body.  They are part and parcel of it. The board are subject to appointment by the Government and because they are there is a lack of independence. There may be some slight conflict <Col N="647" /> between&mdash;and, maybe, rightly so&mdash;the IDA and SFADCo.  Perhaps SFADCo have done too well while other agencies have not.  In saying this I may be leaving myself open to the charge that I am all for the mid-west region and forgetting about the rest of the country. I see particular problems there at the moment and I think that of all times we need the SFADCo now.  We need them to continue their work.  We need them to compensate for job losses above average job losses which, I am afraid, will continue to occur over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does me enormous good to hear Senator Molony praise so much a project which was the brainchild of Fianna Fáil.  We know the worries he has.  He has been in the region as I have been for 27 years.  I would just say to people to give the Minister a chance.  This is not at all as challenging or as frightening as when we started Shannon Airport a long, long time ago.  I am a good bit older than Senator Molony and I do not remember the start but I have lived beside it for 27 years.  I have also heard local criticism of this Bill in the past fortnight or three weeks because I am competing in the local paper with a Member from the other side of the House.  Rather than answer him I ignored him.  I have such faith in the Minister, the Government and Shannon Airport&mdash;because I have covered it and know the personnel so well&mdash;I consider it would be very foolish to think this constituted a downgrading of Shannon.</P>
      <P>I have always had very strong views on small industries and a dead set on large internationals.  How many times have they gone wrong?  I am not going to mention Ferenka or the others.  I have personal contacts with small industries and with family industries. Had we even four such small ones to every one of the big ones&mdash;about which some Members on the other side of the House are worried&mdash;we would get our people back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon and SFADCo's greatest asset was enshrined in all our personal commitments, every one of us in the <Col N="648" /> region.  There were ups and downs.  It is not amusing&mdash;this is not a House that is supposed to amuse people&mdash;but I wonder why did not the Senator's party put their money where his mouth was a few minutes ago when they were in Coalition for the past four years, when the chairman, now gone from SFADCo, Brendan O'Regan, had to stand up at a board meeting and say: We have no money to do anything or to go on.</P>

      <P>The Senator does not know yet because he does not understand the Bill; he will in time.  I should like to put on record here today how grateful we in Clare and in the region are to SFADCo.  Why should there be any doubt, why should one hand over the pioneering&mdash;which is pioneering of these small industries&mdash;only to somebody who has already been a success, who may be the man on the factory floor&mdash;a man like Paul Quigley? Brendan O'Regan is gone and I welcome Mr. McCabe who has not yet taken up his position, but I have no worries in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned an increase. He mentioned only all the things that were taken.  The Government have increased the money to SFADCo for Shannon from £17 million to £22 million this year.  The other side of the House are thinking of change in the past few weeks because from what I have been reading in the paper from a Senator we did not have that attitude at all when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil.  Therefore somebody has had a slight change in thinking or perhaps it is just a matter of publicity.  I do not really know and I am not concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  If it goes wrong Senator Molony will be a bit farther away from it than I will be.  I have no doubt at all about the Minister's abilities, he being the neighbour's child and a TD for the region.  I only hope that when he does get it off the ground he will see fit to do the same thing in other parts of the country.  Indeed, as Senator Molony said, we were often the envy of other regions.  I am sure that will be the case again in the future. But now of course we have an excellent <Col N="649" /> Minister and the minute he has SFADCo on the way with this new project he will not stall and sit, he will see that there are SFADCos spread all over.  I do not think in terms of being in Government for five years' rather I think in terms of another 16 years, and we will have plenty of time to do it.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony mentioned that the board of SFADCo were not happy. I would like to know where he got his information.  One does not brainwash them.  If he thinks one could brainwash some of the men I know or that one could get near them at all, even as a public representative, he does not know them too well.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of wishing the Minister well.  Being in the region he will see that his Bill is implemented when the doubting Thomases will come back and ask us if we would site a SFADCo in Mayo, Donegal or somewhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall turn aside for a moment from what I was going to say to make a very brief reference to what Senator Honan has just contributed. She is new here so perhaps we will make allowances for her.  But I would like to tell her that in my time in both Houses I have not previously heard claims about semi-State companies, which are the property of the whole nation, in terms of the sort of proprietorial rights as the brainchild of Fianna Fáil that she uttered.  I know there are people in Fianna Fáil who think that Fianna Fáil invented the IDA.  I have never heard members of the Coalition make the sort of claim about the IDA that she has just made about SFADCo.  I would like, through her, to tell people at large that when good things or, indeed, bad things are done they are very frequently done as a result of the gathering of a consensus. If one were to trace back who thought of it first one might find it was someone on the other side of the political fence or, indeed, someone with nothing to do with politics at all; great credit to the people.  For example, I know where the IDA idea came from.  It was not from anybody at the forefront of any political party. <Col N="650" /> But when we get to the stage of playing football in regard to what one might call political paternity for the things that are successful in this island we have got to a stage where political debate gets fairly childish and disgusting.</P>
      <P>In regard to one point Senator Honan made about money, she suggested that Brendan O'Regan, then the chairman&mdash;I will mention him later on&mdash;had complained that they had run out of money.  The inference was that in Coalition times SFADCo were starved for money.  If Senator Honan will do what I did not have the time to do&mdash;because I stayed in the House while she was speaking hoping to get in after her&mdash;if she looks at the evolution of the annual grant to SFADCo, year in year out during the previous term in office of Fianna Fáil and during the period in office of the Coalition, she will see that the innuendo she made&mdash;she did not say it; she merely implied it&mdash;that in Coalition times, and specifically in my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce, SFADCo were badly treated and starved for money, will not bear scrutiny.  I hope when she acquaints herself with the facts that somewhere or other in public she will have the grace to withdraw the innuendo she made on the public record here today.  That is enough about that.</P>
      <P>I want now to deal with more serious things and talk about the Bill. Then I want to talk about matters not directly in the Bill but introduced by the Minister in his speech.  The Bill is simple and short.  It gives us a chance to debate SFADCo.  It is principally about money for SFADCo than it is about remuneration.  I do not think anybody takes issue with any of its provisions but it is useful that we should have a discussion about SFADCo.  I do not propose to say anything more about the Bill as such except that it is not one I want to oppose in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister introduced very interesting thoughts in his speech.  I should like to offer my reaction to them and to say that, of the various jobs I had as his predecessor, except for the Energy bit, none was a greater pleasure than going to SFADCo, than <Col N="651" /> going to the airport, to the new town, going around with the people there.  I found an extraordinarily interesting, moving and valuable thing had developed there.  Sometimes they were more successful than others&mdash;I am not now talking about success but about mood and attitude.  What I found so interesting was that they were able to blend a number of considerations and do it on a scale related to a particular environment with which people could connect themselves.  Let me put that into more specific terms.  Their area of responsibility was small enough for them to have a very intense appreciation both of the strength and the weaknesses, a more intense appreciation I believe than is possible for any central organisation in Dublin to have.  Orginally their great pre-occupation was the securing of the airport.  But very rapidly it became evident that while the airport would continue to need to be nurtured and developed, such was the growth of traffic worldwide that the acute threat which had produced the thinking that generated SFADCo had passed and that the future of the airport would be better or worse, depending on how people exerted themselves, but that there was not that acute danger.  Then they went on and did many other things, some in relation to tourism, some in relation to industry.</P>
    <P>What I found so exciting was that they were able to have the sense of community exceedingly strongly in their work, to have the sense of environment exceedingly strongly in their work.  It seemed to me they were able to match up the sometimes conflicting requirements of industrial development on the one hand and the preservation, both of community and environment, on the other.  They did it extraordinarily well and they did it on a human scale.  They were small enough for people to be able to connect with them and not have this terrible sense of alienation that the decisions were being taken a long way away in Dublin and that it was all somewhat impersonal. I found great stimulation, encouragement and pleasure in being with them. I could not say that without paying a <Col N="652" /> tribute to Brendan O'Regan as the chairman, who has now retired, because he seemed to me to be the practical sort of patriot.  He did two things. One was that he made things happen and the other was that he inspired other people to make things happen. He was the best sort of activist.  I am very pleased that even though he does not remain as chairman his enormous vision, wisdom, practical experience and drive will remain at the services of the board and of SFADCo.  He has done great good to his country in his fruitful life.  I hope he will long continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I have said very approving things and admiring things about SFADCo.  I will say something else which relates to them and, indeed, I remember discussions of this kind with their board. The economic difficulties bear on many parts of the country and perhaps bear most heavily in some aspects on Dublin.  In the long term, from every possible point of view, we need triangular development.  Perhaps later if we added four or five points to our economic development it would be even better for us.  The three points should be Cork and Limerick as well as Dublin.  Therefore we have to see that both of them grow more rapidly than Dublin, that they grow past the sort of threshold point where they can sustain all of the things that modern cities and people near to modern cities are entitled to and also from the point of view of transportation costs, efficient communication services and so on.  For every other possible reason that triangular development is the best one.</P>
    <P>I always thought SFADCo played an extremely important part in the making of Limerick, the Estuary, that very remarkable piece of natural good fortune that we possess in the existence of the Shannon Estuary and the area around it, into something that, if we look down the decades, would be a development on a scale that could counterbalance Dublin.  It was fortuitous in a sense that a structure like SFADCo first came into existence in Limerick, in Shannon.  It was because of the location of the airport originally and yet it took on a completely new role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> I was very interested to hear the Minister say in the course of his introductory remarks:</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with a matter which does not arise out of this Bill but which I regard as being of considerable significance&mdash;in the most positive sense&mdash;to the future economic and social development of the mid-west region and I believe eventually&mdash;by example and extension&mdash;to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The argument has been raised here as to whether the decisions indicated in regard to middle-sized and large industry represent a downgrading of SFADCo.  In a sense, it is incontestable that they do in regard to one aspect of SFADCo.  Yet, the Minister has given a powerful impetus to another aspect. The idea of giving the IDA national responsibility for everything medium and big in regard to industry but simultaneously of giving an enhanced impetus to regional organisations in regard to small industry is certainly an interesting idea and not one I could find myself able to condemn <i>a priori.</i>  Indeed, I recall, in a wide-ranging conversation with Mr. Brendan O'Regan that this sort of idea was perhaps passed backwards and forwards. With the passage of time and without having taken notes of the meeting I could not purport to indicate his opinion more than to say that, from my recollection, I believe the idea now being expounded by the Minister was not one that Mr. Brendan O'Regan found unacceptable as a sort of evolution for SFADCo because there are genuinely a pair of difficulties in regard to industrial promotion.  One is that there is a central organisation; it is a bit far away, a bit inhuman, a bit distant and local people do not have as much trust in it as if it were close to them.  In that sense the identification of the people in the SFADCo region with SFADCo is greater than the identification of the people of that region with the IDA.  It is natural and right that it should be so.  Therefore one has the argument in favour of regional organisation having the power to promote industry of every kind.</P>
    <P>But let us say that SFADCo are a <Col N="654" /> success, which I believe them to be; let us say that we need regionalisation in this country and we need structures with which the population can identify and I believe we need such structures. Let them say&mdash;and this is what interests me in the Minister's speech&mdash;that we need something like SFADCo widely; we need it in other parts of the country as well.  In his speech the Minister said:&ldquo;...&mdash;by example and extension&mdash;to the rest of the country&rdquo;. That is an interesting and useful thought.  Yet it is unthinkable to replicate the IDA that many times.  It worked in a kind of way; there was an understanding between SFADCo and the IDA.  In fact on the big ones the IDA did it and they got on.  There was a bit of a grey area between them. Yet it worked out reasonably.  But if one replicated SFADCo all over the country and had the IDA as well, with both lots of structures responsible for big and middle-sized industry then one would have an organisational mess with endless disputes.  I am bound to say that the idea of leaving nationwide the big and middle-sized companies to the IDA seems to me logical and right in terms of efficiency of organisation.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's concern, as does anyone who is interested in industrial development in Ireland, with spawning the largest possible number of indigenously-generated small companies, and it does not matter.  The contrary argument is that in terms of effort it is enormous; you may get 500 jobs for the same effort as you get five. Nonetheless the little ones are the sort of training ground and hold the key to the future.  Therefore, it seems to me that having the more regional organisation devote its specific focus on the question of small industry, the generation of new small industry and ensuring the health of what exists in small industry amounts to a division of responsibility with logic to it.  I can only say I would hold a contrary opinion only if I saw evidence after a number of years that the thing was not working well.  I would have to say: let us see if it works well.  I hope the Minister will perhaps come back to this in his reply.  Perhaps he would amplify a little what is such a teasing <Col N="655" /> reference where he says to extend &ldquo;...&mdash;by example and extension&mdash; to the rest of the country&rdquo;.  These sorts of regional structures, blending industrial promotion with tourism, with the care for environment and with the nurturing and strengthening of community seem to me very precious.  It seems to me that SFADCo have done very interesting and original things with great feeling and verve.  They may be a very good model to replicate.  One cannot have the structure too small because then the country requires too many of them and they get so small as to be inefficient.  If one does it for a whole nation, even for one of our size, it becomes distant and somewhat inhuman.  I would suggest something perhaps dealing with the sort of two or three-county unit.  Let the units be natural ones; let them form themselves on the basis of where are the natural hinterlands and areas.  That is worth a try.  While I am aware of the criticisms I find myself more in agreement with the thoughts expressed in the Minister's speech than I do with those of Senator Molony though he is closer to the problem than I am.</P>
    <P>There is very little more I want to say except that we have been given an opportunity here to talk about Ferenka.  It is one I will quite deliberately and consciously decline. The Minister said also in the course of his remarks:</P>
    <P>All possibilities are being explored in regard to getting a replacement firm for Ferenka but it is too early to indicate what the outcome of these efforts will be.</P>
    <P>I have taken the decision previously that I will not enter this debate at this stage while that work is going on though it is an issue on which I have many thoughts and on which I hope on a future occasion to speak.</P>
    <P>I shall end by saying that I think the Minister may be moving and showing us the tip of the iceberg.  He may be moving towards new structures nationwide.  It will be impossible, if he is so moving, to say that idea started on day X with person Y.  It started in lots of places; those sort of ideas <Col N="656" /> have been moving about; they are being discussed.  If he is the person to bring them to fruition and to produce SFADCo-like structures widely in the country wherever the ideas came from originally he will be the person in whose time and under whose impetus they came to fruition. I may have critical things to say about the details of implementation.  I hope the Minister will amplify the small reference in the course of his speech I have quoted.  That sort of development is necessary and, if he is embarking on it, is one that is welcome and in prospect of which, certainly on the basis of political disagreement I will not find possible to oppose.</P>

      <P>Fáiltimse roimh an mBille seo leis.  Even though I am many miles away from the centre of SFADCo operations I am very proud of their existence.  I am very proud also of and heartily salute the wonderful work they have done since their initiation. Their story has been one of continuous success.  I wish them every success in the future now that they are in the happy position of having further capital with which to work.  For me the most important statement in the Minister's address is:</P>
      <P>...SFADCo are to concentrate on the development of small industry in the mid-west region in an intensive way not previously attempted in this country.  This is a pilot scheme, the results of which will be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years when decisions will be taken about extending the scheme to the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been a believer in small industry.  While it is true we all like to hear of a factory being built somewhere giving employment to perhaps anything from 200 to 500 people, unfortunately, the bigger it is the bigger the disaster if, for some reason or other, it fails.  Everybody, no matter where he lives, felt very upset, disappointed and disillusioned when Ferenka failed.  I have always thought it would be much better and safer to have, shall we say, ten factories, each employing 50, rather than one employing 500.  It suits us to have factories <Col N="657" /> that are reasonably small; it suits us being the kind of people we are. There is also less danger of disaster. This idea of getting SFADCo with their wisdom and knowledge to operate small industries is excellent and the Minister is to be highly complimented on it.</P>
    <P>Since SFADCo will be operating small industries, it means that there will be a number of small industries scattered around the area.  I am sure they will bear it in mind that, if they want to establish 15 or 20 small industries producing assorted types of manufactured goods in the foreseeable future, there must be without doubt an ideal place for each one of these factories. They should try to avoid having a factory, no matter how small, in a place that is environmentally unsuited to it, and they should take into consideration problems of pollution which seem to cause so much trouble at the moment.  I am sure they will keep these points in view.  I wish SFADCo every success in their new type of enterprise and in their new direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a limited welcome to the Bill on the grounds that some of it can only be judged in terms of performance.  The notion of SFADCo taking up the running for small industries in the north Tipperary-Limerick-Clare region has proved most controversial here today. That notion has already been covered from this side of the House by Senator Molony in a very eloquent and well argued speech and by Senator Keating. The Minister claimed that performance on this will be evaluated within 18 months.  That suggests a certain urgency and determination on the part of the Minister and his Department.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of results can be achieved in that time.  The development of SFADCo has been enormously successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of that success that has not been glanced at yet is that the development of SFADCo has resulted in a proliferation of cultural activities in the Limerick region.  It seems unquestionable that when there is a certain kind of buoyance with regard to the economic and industrial situation, <Col N="658" /> the people devote time and energy to cultural affairs.  From the very foundation of the Shannon free industrial area there was a great burgeoning of very enlightened cultural activities that were not only good in themselves but which had a very considerable spin-off for the tourist industry.  For instance, the development of Bunratty Castle and its mediaeval entertainments and the highly enlightened follow-through with the establishment of a folk museum in that area and the consequent improvement in amenity among the hotels, restaurants and all kinds of tourist enterprises in that entire region.</P>
    <P>There is a very high standard of hygiene and of catering capability in the region which is not unconnected with the scheme and its development and with the cultural amenities that have developed as well.  Various cultural schools and foundations like the Merriman School have been established. When one moves through that region one is aware that it is a region that is not only alive industrially and socially but culturally as well.  That is a dimension to the Minister's proposal worth glancing at.  Small industries are not alien from that consideration. When one moves through Donegal which is another culturally rich region which is very sophisticated in terms of tourist amenity, one is aware of the very strong penetration of the culture of the people into the cottage industry, the home industry and the small factory there.  That area seems promising but again it will only be possible to judge on performance.  Eighteen months is a grossly inadequate time in which to have a proper look at what may develop from the Minister's proposals but the sense of urgency and determination indicated is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>In looking at the positive side of the Bill I share Senator Keating's view that there is nothing to which one can take exception.  The small industry in itself is probably best looked after by a local agency.  It is inevitable that when a big industry like Ferenka is set up in a region it attracts and spawns small service industries which become sometimes pitiably dependent on that primary monstrous growth.</P>
    <P>One of the most plaintive results of <Col N="659" /> the fall of Ferenka was that many very small family industries which had grown up dependent on its patronage and goodwill, went to the wall.  Some of them may have recovered since but there was a good deal of human tragedy at that level.  A small industry taken under the wing of SFADCo would have a far better chance of continued life, because that agency is an enduring successful enterprise, which has its roots very deeply in the local culture.  Any enterprise that SFADCo undertook to support or sponsor, would have a far better hope of help and enlightened guidance in time of need.  It would get far greater help from such an agency than it would from something large and multinational in the Ferenka line.</P>
    <P>On that level it is wise to direct the small industries towards SFADCo and to direct the larger ones towards the IDA, with their global national concern. I am taking the Bill entirely in terms of goodwill.  The determination to take SFADCo away from these large industries and to direct them towards the small ones is not a downgrading, it is not just a ruse or a kind of trojan horse, in order to denude them of some of their powers.  Taken in good faith the Bill looks goods, but finally one will have to depend very much on its performance on the ground.  We will all be pretty vigilant in looking for results in that direction.</P>
    <P>The matter of remuneration is raised in section 5 and I hope that the ministerial control over remuneration will be there in order to ensure generosity rather than niggardliness in the paying of the chief executive. There tends to be a begrudging attitude towards people who hold important posts in private or in semi-State bodies.  It is a very great mistake to count pennies in this matter because good executives are hard to find.  If semi-State bodies are not willing to pay them well they can get paid elsewhere. A point constantly raised, is that it is invidious that the managing director of a semi-State body should be paid more than say, a Minister or the Taoiseach.  That is really a very irrelevant point.  A Minister or a Taoiseach <Col N="660" /> has a lot more motivation than a captain of industry.  He would have consolation in the areas of prestige and power and he would have spiritual consolations, in the sense that he is by definition somebody dedicated to the good of his country, who is not primarily looking for his rewards in financial form.</P>
    <P>The comparison between the two kinds of remuneration and the two kinds of office is false and it should not be brandished as a means of paying an inadequate salary to somebody taking on responsible work of this kind.  I hope section 5 is there in order to enhance salary rather than to constrict it.  This Bill is in many ways a more revolutionary Bill than it looks, especially when taking into account the foreshadowings on pages 5 and 6 of the Minister's speech.  With these reservations I welcome it and look forward with very great interest to its operation on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some misgivings that I welcome this Bill.  I almost do not know where to start.  To a great extent any of the success I have had in life is due to SFADCo and Shannon.  I was the first person employed by SPS International, which is one of the companies that SFADCo brought in to the Shannon Industrial Estate.  It was there that I got a grounding in industrial management. Sometimes that aspect of the contribution that has been made is forgotten. There are other people like me working in firms and in State bodies throughout the country who acquired their skills in the industrial estate in Shannon.  There are many people now working in AnCO training other people, who discovered and developed their talents on the factory floors of the industrial estate in Shannon.  This is one of the great contributions that came from that area.  The industries operated in new and modern technology generally and therefore there was an upgrading of the kind of work that people had to do.  I do not know how to say just how much praise we should pour on Brendan O'Regan, the chairman of SFADCo and his colleagues, Paul Quigley, chief executive, Tom Callanan and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> My first memories of SFADCo are associated with mud.  We crawled through mud all over the industrial estate because they were pushing ahead at such a rate that the infrastructure could not keep up.  There was no housing, but lots of mud. There was not enough heating because boilers were not working.  I remember having to make tea for girls in the factory estate at 8.30 a.m. because the boilers were not working and it was the only way we could keep them warm.</P>
    <P>SFADCo succeeded in consolidating the airport's position.  It also gave rise to the birth of a town in the middle of County Clare with a population of 8,000.  That is a tremendous achievement. It gave confidence to Limerick where there was an awful lot of doubt about Shannon.  People kept saying &ldquo;When is it going to fail?  When will they all get into their aeroplanes and fly out of the country and leave us all with our spent assets?&rdquo;  The development of Shannon and the growth of that town provided confidence in that region and some of that confidence rubbed off on the country as a whole. It was a pump-priming contribution to industrial development.  Over and above that, as Senator Martin brought out so well, it made a contribution in the culture area.</P>
    <P>When I think of Brendan O'Regan and his team in Shannon I think of people who had a vision that something could work and who were not put off by any doubting Thomases. They said that it was possible to bring a dead castle back to life, to bring the emigrants back to work in places like Shannon, and to get young children of farmers with no background in industry and with the right type of training and helpful coaching to turn them into skilled industrial operators and managers. That is the vision which existed at that time.</P>
    <P>When I look back on it I see the importance of planning at that time. They were professionals and they knew the need for planning.  It did produce the results.  It is very useful at times to go back and think about the decisions which had to be taken some ten years ago&mdash;I am talking about 1959 which is <Col N="662" /> nearly 20 years ago&mdash;and to think about the doubting Thomases who perhaps held back the amount of investment needed, the doubting Thomases who said the Ennis road between Limerick and Shannon would not be filled with cars, that it would not be necessary to expand it and that money going into that was going down the drain because the Americans would fly away, and to think about the vision and the confidence of the team that kept on and said that the cars would be going front to back separated by only 20 yards on the road between Limerick and Shannon.  That day came to pass and anybody who now tries to travel that road at peak time will know what it is like.  I remember people laughing at that projection in 1959.  It gives me confidence to think about a new direction as the Minister said, when we look back at that time, because maybe we are at another turning point now.  We should encourage and welcome it and let that brilliant team get on with their work.</P>
    <P>The other spin-off which came from it was the confidence it engendered.  It allowed the Department for Education to go ahead with a National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  I was working with the late Donogh O'Malley at the time on that venture and my belief is that that institution would never have been started if it was not for the growth of Shannon which showed that an institution of that kind was needed, that a new approach to the development of technology was needed.  Shannon, beside it, provided the encouragement, the inspiration, and the vision.</P>
    <P>Because so many foreign visitors and technicians were arriving, Americans, Germans, English, Dutch, and Japanese, there was a fear that some sort of a foreign cultural amalgam or hybrid would emerge around Shannon. What happened was that as a result of the introduction of the tours, the castle mediaeval banquets, the villages, the folk museum and the Irish cottages a sense of Irish identity developed out of the inspiration and the intrusion, to some extent, of the foreigners.  There again, it was the vision of the people who work there who saw that, and had <Col N="663" /> the drive and conviction to bring it about.  I remember people in Limerick laughing at the idea of a mediaeval banquet in Bunratty.  Having participated in the development of the idea, and having being thrown into the dungeon a few times as I sung my songs, it is great to see that it happened, and that it is still going on. Other countries are now building on the same idea.  It is great to see Irishmen leading in that way.  There is a national identity associated with the cultural development in that area which people in other parts of the country could follow.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of having Brendan O'Regan on Comhairle na Gaeilge when I was chairman of it a few years ago.  There I saw his contribution to the development of the Irish language in that he saw that it was an essential component in the evolution of national identity and that it could go hand-in-hand with industrial development. That is what led to the report called Gniomh don Gaeltacht.  As we have heard in this House before, we are due to have an Údarás na Gaeltachta arising from that report.  Brendan O'Regan was the inspiration behind that, and gave that report soul, rather than just producing an economist's stark, figure-full prose document.  It was a report with soul because it saw the possibility of the combination of development of industry and development of culture going hand-in-hand, grounded in the Irish language.  It is important to look back and learn from the way in which people thought in those days because we need the same sort of vision today.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined that he sees SFADCo having the opportunity to come forward with a new deal.  He is asking for a new lead in the development of small industry.  I went on at length in this House&mdash;not for three hours as the Press said recently&mdash;on the importance of small industrial development.  Forty per cent of our employment is provided by industries employing less than 100 people. Therefore, a tremendous effort must go into that.  That was a central component and theme of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  The uprise in interest in small industrial development which <Col N="664" /> has taken place since Fianna Fáil came back to power is in no small way due to the fact that we highlighted it and everybody knew the message was on the wall; Fianna Fáil are after small industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking advantage of this visionary group in Shannon to ask them to give a new lead in the development of small industry.  I welcome that.  I also welcome the fact that a review of it will take place within a year-and-a-half or so to see how progress is going.  Knowing the people there, I am sure that they will have some new ideas to display before the nation.  That brings us to the question of whether we are downgrading SFADCo.  I have to go home and meet my sister and father in Limerick who will say: &ldquo;What did you say up there in Dublin about SFADCo?&rdquo;  I have to take my courage in my hands and say that in this case we have to let the Minister have a go.  The Minister is asking SFADCo to provide us with a new lead.  They will do that.  They have more than the task of getting jobs.  They are there to help in tourism, in environmental renewal, and in putting up those thatched cottages which are now going up all over the country.  I would like to see a few of them in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Their interest in industrial development as such will continue and a fact that may be overlooked in this debate is that they will retain their function in relation to the Shannon Industrial Estate itself.  They are not pulling out of the industrial estate as far as a medium to large sized industry is concerned. It is outside the region that there is a change in emphasis.  One thing we have found in industrial development is that concentration is important.  There is no point as I see it, in having executives from the IDA calling on presidents of companies in California and the following day having somebody from SFADCo calling on the same man.  People can get in each other's way in a situation like that and possibly this new development will provide room for greater concentration which produces results.</P>
    <P>The team in SFADCo, led by the new chairman, Frank McCabe, who comes from an eminent family of successful <Col N="665" /> individuals who lead industry, will take up this challenge and will give us an approach to small industry development which will be an example for the rest of the country which then might, as Senator Keating said, use it as a model.  Possibly the Minister might say something about this when he replies, as prompted by Senator Keating.</P>
    <P>In relation to a few opening phrases by Senator Keating when he more or less paternally put down my colleague, Senator Honan, it ought to be remembered that the original IDA which the Opposition claims as their idea was a promotion body which worked with Foras Tionscal, the grant-giving body which was a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The structure and the strategy behind the IDA that exists today emerged later on.  So, everybody has a claim on IDA.  To that extent I agree with Senator Keating, but it should be put on record that the IDA that came into existence in the fifties was a small promotions group and not the large vibrant, multi-structure IDA that we have today. What is definite is that the combination of Seán Lemass's vision with Brendan O'Regan gave rise to SFADCo, to the development of Shannon and to that vision which inspired the rest of the country in its industrial development and provided the spin-off of trained people who were able to work in other industries throughout the country.  My hope is that somebody may stand in the Seanad in 20 years time and say that maybe the new Seán Lemass&mdash; Deputy Desmond O'Malley&mdash;has come up with a new vision which will give us a new lead and will ensure that the development of small industry takes place in line with the proportion it contributes to total employment, which is 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I welcome the action but I have some misgivings as an individual who grew up in that area and developed any expertise I may have, that people in Limerick may say it is a downgrading.  I do not think it is.  I think it is a new direction, a new deal and a request for a new vision from Limerick and Clare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> One negative thing&mdash;and here again I support Senator Martin and to this extent the Minister may not agree with me&mdash;I hate to see these little paragraphs in every Bill talking about controlling the chief executive's remuneration. It is anathema.  It is interfering with the reward system which should be determined not by reference to what the secretary of a Department or a Minister gets but by reference to the chief executive of organisations in Japan or Europe or anywhere else against which the chief executives of our organisations in Ireland have to compete.  If we have to pay £25,000 to a man to compete with the chief executive of a body in France or Denmark we should pay him that. That is my view.  I welcome the Bill and crave the indulgence of the Chair for some of the more emotional outbursts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill.  On this side of the House there is no disagreement and there is support for the Minister and the Government in terms of the detail of the Bill in the sense that it updates funding requirements in line with increased costs and the present-day position within the organisation in SFADCo in Shannon.  In that sense the Bill is conventional and has our support.  Having said that, it is rather in the small print and in the initial speech of the Minister wherein lies the controversy with which we take issue and I would like to deal later on with some of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the views expressed by those who paid a compliment to the SFADCo organisation who have done a most remarkable job since their establishment in 1959.  SFADCo started on a crisis basis because of the serious threat to Shannon Airport. Initially they did an excellent job in containing the rot where the airport was concerned and subsequently did extremely useful work in the sense that no organisation within this country prior to that had become involved in the regions in industrial and tourist development.  They have been an example to successive Governments to show what can be done on a regional basis, to show what <Col N="667" /> can be done when you give a certain amount of autonomy to a region rather than to a Government Department situated in Dublin.  Their work has been commended outside this country. They have been acting as advisers in many parts of the world in the tourist and in the industrial development areas in countries such as Egypt and more recently their Third World activity under the United Nations.  All of that is welcome and it has reflected greatly to the credit of this country and to the organisation in particular.</P>
    <P>In some of the speeches that have been made in this House and in the Dáil there have been pious hopes expressed that the example of SFADCo might be used as the foundation on which to base similar structures elsewhere in this country.  I smile a little when I hear these sentiments expressed because Governments in this country have had the wealth of experience gained from the operation of SFADCo since 1959, which is practically 20 years ago, and it seems to me that lessons could have been learned from that regarding the advantages or disadvantages of such structures, and the problems inherent in them.  Action could have been taken long before now in terms of analysing what has happened there and deciding in what other parts of this country similar structures might be developed.  It is in that regard that we have to take exception to the fact that there has not been any development along these lines.</P>
    <P>In the debate there was unfortunate reference to the supposed starving of finance of SFADCo by the Coalition Government.  It was not my original intention to refer to what happened when we were in Government but it is necessary in the circumstances of the speech made.  I have before me the annual report of the organisation for the year ending 31 December 1976 and we can put on the record what in fact happened in very simple terms where money and Oireachtas grants were concerned.  In 1975 Oireachtas grants to SFADCo totalled £1,636,000.  In 1976 Oireachtas grants totalled £1,960,152, an increase of about £300,000 on a base of £1,600,000 which <Col N="668" /> is a percentage increase of 20 per cent in the last year when we were in government. These are facts in so far as the Oireachtas grants were concerned in the last year when the previous Government had overall responsibility for the funding of the SFADCo operation.</P>
    <P>Again we have to question the views of the Minister both in his speech to the Dáil and in his speech to the Seanad this afternoon.  In particular there are two issues; in other words, there are two proposed changes in the activities of the organisations.  The first proposed change is the fact that for the future SFADCo will not have a promotional role for industry in the mid-west region and this role, which they have had for a number of years, is now to be dealt with by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I find this a most unwelcome development because in this area of industrial development we are particularly bounden to development by companies outside this country.  The sources of development are companies in the United States, Germany, Britain, France, western Europe and Japan and if you cut off from its source an organisation such as SFADCo who have been involved in industrial promotion, in this area of industry it is dead. Industry from other countries is the major source of industrial development and employment and all the consequent benefits that flow from it, but SFADCo will not now have autonomy in this area.</P>
    <P>Under this new arrangement SFADCo will succeed or fail not through anything to do with the initiative of the executives in Shannon but rather with the extent to which the Industrial Development Authority will or will not send the flow of inquiries from other countries and the extent to which the IDA will encourage visits by visiting industrialists to the mid-west region.  This is most unfortunate. I do not see any problem whatever <i>vis-à-vis</i> Shannon engaging in such promotional activity even though the Industrial Development Authority are doing it.  I see their role in promotion in that area as being a supportive role.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority <Col N="669" /> as a national institution are engaged outside this country and are doing a remarkably good job in encouraging people to establish industries here, but because it is not in their brief, when they speak to people in New York they cannot suggest to them that they should go to a particular part of this country&mdash;that is not their function and it creates problems.  The back-up which can be provided through the promotional activity of SFADCo, of local authority, RDO's and chambers of commerce is supportive of the national role of the IDA and is not in conflict, provided the people concerned are competent and that there is suitable liaison between the regional group concerned and the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been culpable in this matter in his speeches in this House and in the Dáil.  In the Dáil he talked about the new small industry arrangement and I would like to deal with that later.  At the very end of that speech he stated that in order that SFADCo would be free to concentrate all their energies on this new task in relation to indigenous small industry he was arranging that the IDA will resume full responsibility for industry other than small industry in the mid-west region.  This was a major change in the functions of SFADCo and yet in a speech running to a number of paragraphs the Minister chose to use a very brief paragraph and he offered no explanation whatever for the proposed change.</P>
    <P>I find it very unacceptable that the Minister should simply make this announcement of a radical change in the function of SFADCo without giving the slightest explanation for it. It seems to me, that where we are talking about public funds committed to a public body who have been doing useful work, where we are concerned with the disquiet there may well be within the mid-west region and possibly within the organisation in question, the public at least are entitled to an explanation why this major step has been taken.  That explanation has not been given.  Not only that, but in the speech the Minister made in the Seanad today he referred to criticism <Col N="670" /> of the new move where SFADCo are concerned, criticism from many vocational groups in addition to political criticism, and he suggested that some of this had been engendered or whipped up&mdash;this is a phrase he used&mdash;at local level.  If he re-read his first speech he would see that there was no explanation contained in it but if he felt that the criticism was unreasonable, and if he wanted to quell the Opposition, then it would have been logical to come back in this speech and to explain to this House why the move was made.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here at the moment&mdash;I know it is understandable&mdash;but I regret he is not present when I am saying this, but we have again about two pages of a speech referring to the criticisms without giving a single explanation as to why there has been this change and why the promotional activity in which SFADCo have been engaging is not being carried out by them any more. It is simply not good enough and it is no wonder that there is criticism engendered not only at local level but at national level on an issue such as this. I would ask the Minister to state precisely why an explanation was not given in his speech in the Dáil or in his speech in the Seanad.  I think we are entitled to ask why this move has been made.  In my judgment if we seek indigenous development in this country, and indigenous development takes many forms, if we want to develop a fundamental regional policy more and more we have got to involve people within the provinces of this country in the total aspect of development whether it is industrial or tourist or whether it is promotional in New York or west Kerry.</P>
    <P>If future industrial development is to be arranged in such a way that the sole promotional organisation in the entire country is to be the Industrial Development Authority, with every other organisation and unit such as chambers of commerce being spoon-fed from that source, you are going to get an extremely powerful organisation. They may be doing useful work but there will not be the same understanding of the regions because they <Col N="671" /> will not be <i>au fait</i> with the problems there.  It is most unfortunate and for that reason I must disagree with the new approach.  In saying that I speak for many people on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is new and concerns the comments of the Minister in his speech regarding small industries. Having read the comments, having gone through some of the background in SFADCo and having a certain knowledge of what has been happening in regional development in the past few years, I am forced practically to believe that this small industry innovation is merely introduced as something to allay the fears that may come from the other quarter where the promotional activity is concerned.</P>
    <P>My reason for suggesting this is the Minister's comment about the small industry section.  He said:</P>
    <P>This is the proposal which I mentioned at the corresponding Stage in the other House, whereby SFADCo are to concentrate on the development of small industry in the mid-west in an intensive way not previously attempted in this country. This is a pilot scheme, the results of which will be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years when decisions will be taken about extending the scheme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be, and I quote the Minister again, &ldquo;a new dimension, a new thrust to SFADCo's work particularly in relation to industrial development&rdquo;. My objections to this innovation&mdash;they are my views, I do not speak for anyone else&mdash;are that much of this work is being carried out very adequately at present by other organisations. If the level of employment is going to be reduced in an organisation such as this through the dropping of the promotional part or if some people are going to continue to work in a new area, duplicating what is already being done by other national or regional agencies, this will merely create jobs in the bureaucracy which ultimately is going to catch up with us and have very undersirable results both in terms of the cost of such employment <Col N="672" /> and in terms of the duplication that may occur.</P>
    <P>Some years ago before the Industrial Development Authority developed regional structures there was the excellent development of the county development teams system&mdash;it came when Fianna Fáil were in Government but let us not quibble about who was responsible for it.  It was applauded but in recent years it has not been given credit for the work which it did. It got away from this new fad of regionalisation where semi-State bodies are proliferating through regional outlets throughout the country, all of which are at variance with one another in the sense that different organisations are going into different regional groupings and there is no sense of identity within these regions.  There is the very sensible development on an executive structure, namely, the county council structure.  It is a structure based on an elective system with an executive, with a strong county management system with which I agree, and with chief executives in the various areas of engineering.  There is also decentralisation of agricultural services through the county agricultural officers.  Within this very sensible, strong and perhaps old-fashioned structure the county development system was developed and an arrangement was made under which a county development team was formed under the chairmanship of the county council.  Its membership contained the county agricultural officer, the county engineer, the county manager and two or three other people.</P>
    <P>Appointed to these counties&mdash;they designated 12 counties originally&mdash; were county development officers. There was an anomaly in that they were under the employment of the Department of Finance.  The county development officers revolutionised development at local level within this country because for the first time the county councils, rather than being caught in the straightjacket of expenditure in the traditional areas of roads, hospitals and other such services where they were bound by the financial constrains of the rating system and the constraints of the Departments in Dublin, developed an attacking development <Col N="673" /> role with funds being arranged through the Department of Finance. Excellent work was done by these county development officers who in my view are some of the finest people working in this country.  They galvanised the energies of local business people and local communities.  They acted as liaison officers between such communities and the various national bodies involved in development and all in all they did an excellent job.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, they worked very closely with the small industries division of the Industrial Development Authority.  The county development teams were involved at a local level and had a fundamental rapport with the community because they were involved in all types of services within the particular county and it was in my judgment the ideal basis on which to base small industries.  The county development team examined applications for grants and for assistance of different kinds and if they recommended them they passed the applications to the relevant Government Department.  The liaison and the skills of the county development officers were used to further the interest of these constituents within these counties.  It was a most successful programme which led to substantial development.</P>
    <P>The county development teams have been performing a useful function as I have described and they have been operating in the mid-west region and in these very counties where SFADCo are concerned, in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.  In each of these counties you have a county development structure, you have a county development team and you have county development officers doing excellent work.  When that is being done within those regions and done at such close grassroots level, what can another organisation moving in now do other than usurp what has been done competently already?  Is it not a case of serious duplication?  I do not believe that there has been any reason for the Minister to suggest any changes where small industries are concerned, where SFADCo are concerned.  Very interestingly if we look at the 1976 annual report of the organisation on <Col N="674" /> page nine, which concerns industrial development, we read:</P>
    <P>As noted in previous reviews the company has in recent years applied itself to the problem of economic development and job creation in areas of the mid-west region which has so far not been able to attract either local or overseas industries.  At year end the company had established an enterprise development unit which is geared towards identifying and marrying resources such as raw materials and people of enterprise and flair so that the two can be linked in a viable industry. Some success has already been achieved in this work and a number of small enterprises have been established.</P>
    <P>I submit that without the Minister issuing a single word in his speech either in the Dáil or in the Seanad related to SFADCo's small industry function they have already such a function and can sensibly do it without all the trappings we are reading about in both today's speech and the speech in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We talk now about the move to get a small industry structure going under SFADCo and there are expectations for a bright future but that is in parallel with the promotional downgrading and the lack of any explanation whatsoever for taking away this function. The Minister referred in his speech a month ago in the Dáil and today in the Seanad to the fact that SFADCo are going to undertake such a function but there is no reference, there is not a single line, in regard to what the precise function will be, how it is going to operate or whether it is going to operate with people in the business community in Ennis, Limerick, Tipperary, Newport and such places.  In my view it is going to involve serious duplication.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about this, there has been a debate running for many years about the level of industrial development within the country and the proportion of it that lies between foreign investment and indigenous or Irish investments.  I think it has been a debate that has lacked a lot <Col N="675" /> of understanding because the reason obviously why we have such a concentration of foreign companies in this country is that we did not experience the industrial revolution.  We had many political problems going back for a couple of centuries and we only started to develop an industrial structure in the last 20 or 30 years or so, or at least a serious structure.  For that reason if we wanted to develop and to create wealth, exports and jobs in industry we had no alternative, and successive Governments had no alternative, to attracting companies from other countries.  Because there was such a huge proportion of development in the foreign sector and a small amount in the national sector for the reasons which I have stated, unthinking people might tend to say &ldquo;Well, why are we giving all the money to the foreigners and why do we not give it to the Irish?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been my experience that the Industrial Development Authority and the county development structure have been doing a great deal to encourage Irish industry.  We want to step back to remember that there are staggering advantages.  There are advantages of grant levels up to outright grants to the extent of two-thirds of the total capital investment.  There is complete relief on tax on export sales, regardless of the size of the company.  There are training grants from AnCo.  There is a huge concession in the taxation field in that no tax is paid.  All in all there are huge advantages.  If the Government are talking about private enterprise, Irish industry and the development of industry, it seems to me that the Irish companies or individuals who are going to get involved in this field already know about the entire range of incentives that exist from State agencies.  They are already aware of the entire paraphernalia through the county development officers and local seminars in their towns arranged by regional officers of the Industrial Development Authority.  For that reason I find this type of development very bureaucratic and spoonfeeding, and how a large organisation such as this can get involved in this area which <Col N="676" /> has already been catered for, short of State investment in small industries, I cannot begin to think.  But then State involvement is apparently not the philosophy of the Government; their philosophy is private enterprise.  Again the paradox there is that for a Government that profess belief in the private development sector this is bureaucratic in the extreme and is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if SFADCo would look at an entirely different sector of the economy in which they could do revolutionary work which could lead to substantial development.  While we have this quite enlightened policy towards industrial development and the creation of industrial jobs with the range of grants which are available, there has been a complete neglect for many years by different Governments of the value of the service sector to the economy.  While there may have been complaints in the last year or two at the poor level of industrial development in Dublin and people may have tended to draw parallels with the booming west it is conveniently forgotten in all these arguments that a huge proportion of people working in Dublin are working in the service sector; in other words, in the insurance companies, in the banks, in the merchant banks, in Government Departments, in offices and in building societies.  There is this huge proportion of employment in this city and in particular there are many girls of country background working in the city many of whom would be infinitely happier if they could live in their native county if they had the choice of doing so.  It seems to me that the Minister might look into this question because in other countries, and in Britain in particular, concomitant with the commitment to industrial development in the regions, they have also developed a policy of encouraging service employment.  They have given positive employment premiums and other incentives, such as reduced office rentals, to companies to move out of the large cities and set up in the provinces. It would have been much more sensible had SFADCo&mdash;of course they are not to blame; I am talking about the Government in this case&mdash;been <Col N="677" /> requested to look at the service sector to see what could be done about redressing the imbalance in service employment by building up such a structure, as a counterpoint to Dublin, in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>I should like to end on the note that lessons could be learned.  I made the point that lessons should have been learned long before now and we are all culpable because the lessons were not learned.  But it is not too late to learn.  The fundamental message of SFADCo is, if it has been a failure, why not scrap it?  Of course it has not been a failure.  If it has been a success, then why should a Government allow a regional structure with autonomy and funds voted by the Dáil on an annual basis to go into one region and starve Roscommon, Galway, Mayo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Wexford, Waterford, Offaly and Laois of similar benefits?  There is scope for this type of development in other parts of the country.  It was suggested that a ridiculous stage might be reached if you had 20 or 30 SFADCos.  It could be arranged very easily if, for example, the function performed by SFADCo were extended to include west Cork and Kerry.  This was a proposal made by the previous Government. It might have been helped if within the western area the five western counties were included, with Donegal, for example, and there could have been a third unit in the north midlands.  We are not talking about a huge number of bodies.  We are talking about equal treatment for different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Whilst SFADCo has done excellent work, I do not believe it is a miracle. I would submit that, if similar units in other parts of the country were given the same types of incentives, the same types of fundings and the capacity to employ in their ranks some of the most intelligent people, the kind of activity we have seen in the mid-west would proliferate over the rest of the country.  The taking away of the promotional role, what I would call the gimmick, in regard to small industries&mdash;and it is stated in the annual report of SFADCo that this has already been done&mdash;is a trend towards <Col N="678" /> reverting to centralisation while many of us are trying to move in the direction of decentralisation.  In our Government we had a proposal for a western development board and we were criticised for not delivering on it. Some of that criticism may well have been justified but much of it was not justified because the development of any new structure, or new body, within the provinces, in the process of which one may take away certain powers from Departments, requires, through the Department of the Public Service, a colossal amount of liaison and reporting.  When one tries to get into the business of seeking views and reports and forming the liaison necessary subsequently with 14 Departments of State, one can imagine the problem there is in arriving at a delivery deadline.  For many reasons Government Departments are reluctant to lose their functions or see their functions usurped.</P>
    <P>We have had the western development issue and the SFADCo issue.  We have recently, too, had a major shift of policy within the Industrial Development Authority in the downgrading of previous job priority areas in the west and mid-west.  We had a speech delivered announcing that Dublin had a very low level of development in the period of 1969 to 1973 in comparison with Leitrim and Roscommon, a comparison I consider ludicrous.  It was suggested that Dublin at 21 per cent had the smallest proportionate percentage increase in real income per head, which is half the 41 per cent of increase in Leitrim or 43 per cent in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the <i>Evening Press</i> of February 3.  A comparison of proportionate increase is meaningless when one takes the baseline of income in this city and the baseline that existed in a county as poverty starved as Leitrim.  There is no comparison.  Leitrim would need to have an increase at a rate of about 300 per cent to match an increase of about 20 per cent in this city.  This trend is undesirable.  Whilst we agree <Col N="679" /> with the Bill, whilst we support the Government very fully in regard to the provisions, whilst we compliment SFADCo on the work they have done to date in their own interests and the example they have been in the national interest, we have strong reservations about the moves which are apparently afoot in the two areas I have mentioned and for the reasons which I have stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill.  I support the purpose of the Bill in providing further financing for SFADCo.  I should like to add my voice to those speakers who have commended the great work that SFADCo have done. We have read the reports of the industries they have attracted and the factory space provided for industrialists. I would hope that SFADCo would be extended to other areas and that county development teams would play a part in helping to establish industries all over the country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Honan that there has been a great deal of exaggerated criticism of what the Minister said.  Senator Keating made allowances for her, because she is a new Member but I think that, as she said, there has been a twisting of the Minister's remarks about the emphasis on the small industries.  People who talk about the downgrading of SFADCo are twisting the Minister's remarks.  There is a clear role and a defined responsibility for SFADCo.</P>
      <P>Under the Minister's proposals SFADCo will have power to allocate funds and to make decisions, with ultimate responsibility directly to the Minister.  I do not see any difficulty in reconciling what SFADCo will do with the role of the IDA.  Neither do I see any vaccum in industrial development which would be dangerous if the IDA were doing something completely unrelated to SFADCo.  SFADCo and the IDA, even though there may be a different emphasis in their policy, will certainly be inter-related.  There will be no conflict between the two organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the idea <Col N="680" /> of SFADCo not being involved in promotion of the medium and large sized industries.  The Minister made the point very clearly in his opening statement when talking about the promotion of medium and large sized industries. He said:</P>
    <P>Since this activity directly involves, as I understand it, only some 2 per cent of SFADCo's total staff of about 200 and since the IDA have in any case always been involved almost exclusively in the promotion of new large enterprises in the region&mdash;for example Alcan&mdash;the change does not represent a downgrading in any way of the role of the development company and it is wrong to think that it does.</P>
    <P>What we are really talking about here is a 2 per cent activity by SFADCo in the promotion of the medium and large sized industry.  I would question how much promotion SFADCo have done of overseas industries.  What offices have they outside the country?  I think the answer is that they have very few. They have been doing a great job in promoting native indigenous industry and that is why the area has prospered so well and that is why the mid-west area has benefited so much from their work.  They still have the autonomy which is very important.  They will be able to concentrate on that area in the mid-west and also on the estuary and I think that the clear role that the Minister has given them will be of immense benefit to that area.</P>
    <P>I would also like to commend the former chairman, Brendan O'Regan, and his staff and I wish the new chairman and his staff every success in the years ahead.  I hope that, as I said at the outset, this activity by SFADCo will be extended to other areas so that in the other parts of the west and in the other disadvantaged areas generally we would get this kind of industrial development which would benefit ultimately every part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to join with other speakers in complimenting SFADCo on their work throughout the years in bringing new life and hope to a region which was deprived and showing what could be done with <Col N="681" /> vision, dynamism and with the right philosophy.  I would also like to say how much we owe to the former chairman, Mr. O'Regan, who put his personal stamp on the whole operation and the success of the enterprise is to a great extent due to his vision and commitment.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the principle of this Bill.  I have no doubts about the extension of borrowing powers and the added finance which the company need but I want to confine my remarks to one aspect of the development of this company.  It is an important point the Government ought to bear in mind.  The semi-State bodies were set up to fill the gap, and this is a classic example, left by private enterprise and Government finance plus semi-State bodies have done a tremendous job.  There is no better illustration of this than in the case of SFADCo.  In recent times there has been a tendency to pull back from the original dynamic philosophy which underlay semi-State bodies and there is a natural tension, but not an unhappy relationship, between the civil service and the semi-State bodies, particularly between the Department of State involved with a particular semi-State body and the semi-State body itself. Because the semi-State bodies were started by people from the private sector they got an injection of dynamic philosophy from that sector of the economy and we are lucky to have had outstanding people, such as Mr. O'Regan, as chairmen of these bodies whose work and dedication has done so much to set them on the right way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, however, there has been a tendency for the tentacles of the civil service to stretch too far and to tend to enmesh the semi-State bodies.  This occurs in many ways. There has been a tendency, for example, to appoint former civil servants and acting civil servants to the board of semi-State bodies and, in some cases, to appoint the chairmen of semi-State bodies from the civil service. This tendency is wrong and the Government must right it.  I have nothing against the individuals involved. I believe we have an excellent <Col N="682" /> civil service.  It is sometimes too big and we should, perhaps, consider paring it back but the point is that the philosophy in a semi-State body and the philosophy of the civil service are entirely different.  We want to make sure that our semi-State bodies are at a distance from the civil service and from the particular Department involved in the administration of the semi-State body as far as the Legislature is concerned.  We have a duty here and, in the case of SFADCo, civil servants have been appointed to the board.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is another point a number of speakers have mentioned.  That is the problem of the remuneration of the chief officer of the company.  The point was made very forcibly by Senator Mulcahy and I entirely agree with what he said.  In every Bill we now have dealing with semi-State bodies we get a clause&mdash;I quote from the Minister's speech&mdash;stating:</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the level of remuneration and allowances of the chief officer of the company shall be subject to my approval given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>This echoes the philosophy in the Devlin Report in which a sort of blanket ceiling is put on the top of all chief executives in semi-State bodies so that they cannot be paid more than the secretary of the Department involved. That is totally wrong and Senator Mulcahy has made the point very eloquently.  If semi-State bodies are to continue, and if the dynamism which has been a feature of SFADCo is to remain, then what we have to do is get the best man for the job and, if that means paying him more than a senior civil servant, we have to pay him more.  I am totally opposed to this clause.  It is indicative of a philosophy I oppose.</P>
    <P>In the period of the last Administration Senators who were here then may recall that we had a very vigorous debate in which I tried&mdash;sometimes singlehanded&mdash;to resist the decision of the Minister for Agriculture to bring An Foras Talúntais in under the aegis <Col N="683" /> of the Department of Agriculture.  The present Government have seen fit to reverse that.  It is not a political matter. I would not care what Government were in office.  I would certainly have attacked any attempt to spancel the excellent work done by An Foras Talúntais and the freedom which the members of that organisation had.  This applies in every semi-State area.  The semi-State bodies do a very important job and the reason they do it so well is because they have had on their board and they have had as their chief executives tough guys from the private sector.  These are the people who should be running these organisations. They are the men who have experience in industry.  The industrial philosophy is not the same as the philosophy of the civil service.  They are quite different philosophies.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has experience of the two sectors knows this.  The civil service is a permanent part of our Government. Governments change but the civil service remains.  It has a great deal of control and it is up to us as legislators to ensure that the semi-State bodies are kept at the right distance from the civil service and, if there is tension between the civil service and the semi-State bodies, then that is a good thing generally and a healthy thing.  The former chief executive of SFADCo told me on one occasion that he had spent his life fighting off the bureaucrats.  That is what a chief executive in a semi-State body should be doing.  He should be pushing against the civil service.  He should be developing. He should be innovating and the innovations that SFADCo have brought about are a tribute to him and a tribute to the philosophy under which he operated, namely, the philosophy which comes from the free enterprise sector of our economy. I know that there are, of course, exceptions to this rule and there are people who can and have made the transition, but I am protesting against a tendency at trying to bring the semi-State bodies, operating independently, under civil service control. If that is done they will lose their identity, lose their way and their <Col N="684" /> individuality, and they will not fulfil the function that they were set up to fulfil.  There is a danger this could happen in the case of SFADCo.  There is danger it will happen in many other organisations and here I wish to register a vigorous protest while, at the same time, supporting the main purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill providing as it does substantial improvements in the financing of SFADCo.  I welcome, too, the focus on the development of small industries.  I share the confidence placed in SFADCo by the Minister in the challenging and innovative task of promoting the development of small indigenous industry in the mid-west region.  Speaking of innovation. SFADCo itself with its splendid record of achievement is a showpiece of innovation.  I would like to join in the tributes to the retired chairman of SFADCo, Mr. Brendan O'Regan.  His vision, energy and intense commitment have been crucial to the success of SFADCo over the years.  While the Shannon Industrial Estate is clearly a success story, the change of direction in the work of SFADCo to which the Minister has referred should lead to the correction of any imbalances in the industrial structure which now exist in the mid-west region.  The acceleration of job creation, especially in the smaller towns in the region, will breathe new life into many static and declining communities.  The highly experienced professionals in SFADCo will, I submit, complement rather than duplicate the work of existing agencies in generating jobs in small industries. The economic benefits which will accrue from the further development of small industry will, of course, be welcome but equally important will be the contribution to the social fabric of these small communities.  The further development of local industries will mean that many workers will be spared much time and expense associated with travelling long distances to work but, more importantly, they will find jobs in or near their native towns and villages.  The accumulated knowledge and experience of SFADCo will be brought to bear on <Col N="685" /> attracting, selecting and promoting industry, perhaps producing products to meet local as well as national and international needs.  With regard to the status of SFADCo, surely the delegation of grant-giving powers can only emphasise and enhance the regional role of SFADCo.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I welcome both the Bill and the pilot scheme which is now being launched to promote the development of small industry in the mid-west region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Senator from the region, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I welcome the purpose of the Bill which is to provide additional funds for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I have reservations with regard to the decision to remove the responsibility for the promotion of major industry in the region from SFADCo and transfer it to the IDA and I will deal with that in due course.  I sincerely hope that what I do have to say in that regard will be off the mark and that some time in the future I will be able to concur with the views expressed by Senator Hillery now.  They were confident and optimistic and I hope they will be proven to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the funds available to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company under three headings, share capital, a big increase from £25 million to £45 million, the repayable advances increased from £17 million to £22 million, and the grant-in-aid from £17 million to £22 million.  I think in view of comments made earlier here it would be as well that I should remark that on the last occasion the funds available to Shannon Free Airport Development Company were increased was in July of 1974 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Senator Justin Keating.  The funds available to Shannon then were increased by a total of £22 million and at 31 December 1976, of the amount of £17 million provided under the heading of repayable advances, £3.2 million was unspent and, of the £17 million provided under the heading of the grant-in-aid, £1.8 million was unspent. <Col N="686" /> Of the total funds, therefore, provided under the 1974 Act, at the end of December 1976 a total of £5 million was unspent.  It is against that factual background that statements by the chairman of the board that they were short of cash can be measured.</P>
    <P>A number of very useful contributions have been made today from both sides of the House.  One that impressed me very much was that made by Senator Mulcahy.  I refer to him because he is from the other side, but it is significant to note that he has a background of experience in business and in management. His welcome for this Bill was conditional.  He used the word &ldquo;misgivings&rdquo;.  He outlined his own experience of the SFADCo industrial estate.  He referred to the SPS factory there which he correctly pointed out was one of the first attracted to the region by SFADCo.  He spoke of the progress that has taken place in the region and he spoke of the vision and confidence of the team of men responsible for that progress.  He concluded in a subtle way by saying that he hoped the proposals would be successful and he said he was happy to leave it to the Minister.  I think that is significant.</P>
    <P>Now I would also like to refer to the fact that criticism has been levelled at those who have expressed reservations in regard to this proposal.  I have expressed reservations.  I intend to express them today but I want to assure the House that the reservations I am expressing are being genuinely and objectively expressed.  I am not doing it for the purpose of seeking headlines, as it were, but rather to ventilate and express here the misgivings that many people in the region have.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's speech this afternoon the reservations which have been expressed have had some result.  I detect in his speech a greater spelling out of what he envisages may happen and I welcome that.  Were it not for the fact that he said that what SFADCo will not have is responsibility for promotion in the region, apart from the industrial estate, of medium and large-sized industry it would not be necessary for me to say anything this <Col N="687" /> afternoon.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind what I have to say about it and to have a further re-think on that question of removing total responsibility for the promotion of major industry from what is a proven promotional organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to what he described as a certain amount of opposition and criticism to the new arrangements which had been whipped up at local level.  That may or may not be so but it is useful perhaps to identify sources other than political sources that have expressed reservations in this regard.  <i>The Clare Champion</i> of 10 February 1978, in the course of a leading article, expressed growing concern that SFADCo's powers had been severely eroded.  They expressed their concern also for the future of county development teams, for the promotion of major industries within the Shannon industrial estate and for the development of the Shannon Estuary.  They said there were many people in Clare, including leaders of industry and commerce, who believed the decision of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was a bad one.</P>
    <P>Similar views were expressed also in a leader in the <i>Limerick Leader</i> on 11 February 1978.  They described that decision of the Minister as a retreat from regional development and an advance towards centralisation. They asked was this the time and place to deprive remote, peripheral areas of a promoting agency's full potential.  They described it as a serious error of judgment and said it had sent a shiver of foreboding throughout the region.  That leading article continued to say that much as the Minister might like to talk about giving a new thrust in dimension the naked truth is that he intends to strip SFADCo of overall supervision for job creation in the region.  Therefore, I do not know whether it can be said that the whipping up&mdash;and I am using the Minister's term there&mdash;can be criticised.  The views expressed and the reservations of many people, including the editors of two local papers, and the views and fears of people involved in commerce <Col N="688" /> and industry, have to be taken into consideration.  They have to be expressed and answered.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will spell out in greater detail what exactly is intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the financial provisions of the Bill.  I want to join with the Minister and indeed with other speakers in the tributes paid to men like Brendan O'Regan, Paul Quigley and their colleagues on that team for their vision and dedication, in the development of SFADCo and the mid-western region over a long number of years.  Their commitment and ability to get things done resulted&mdash;as Senator Mulcahy expressed very effectively&mdash;in the transformation of a mudland into a thriving town and industrial area.  I would like to join others in welcoming Mr. McCabe, the new chairman of SFADCo and wish him well in his new position.  The history of the airport, of the development company and of their remarkable progress has been outlined here and elsewhere.  But, in that 20-year period, they tackled the problems of the region, provided employment, industry, developed tourism there and brought a surprising degree of prosperity to the area.  Their record in that field has been proven.  Perhaps some people would describe the methods they used as novel.  There are the duty-free shops, the promotion of the industrial estate, of service industry.  In the field of tourism there has been the unique establishment of the castle tours, banquets, the Rent-an-Irish Cottage scheme and the development of Shannon town itself.  There were substantial odds, local difficulties and many disadvantages but SFADCo succeeded in overcoming these and their record to date is impressive.  Almost one-and-a-quarter million passengers have used the airport.  Sixteen thousand tons of terminal freight were handled by the airport in 1976.  Over 2,000 jobs were created.  I understand that exports from the industrial estate exceeded £100 million last year.  There are 8,000 employed in Shannon Airport and there is a population of 8,000 there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is against this background of solid progress and achievement that I question the wisdom at this stage of removing from SFADCo the responsibility for promoting major industry in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to a matter it is relevant to raise at this stage, that is the administration of Shannon town itself.  It has not been touched on here and it is necessary that we should comment on <Col N="690" /> it.  Shannon is a unique town.  Senator Mulcahy referred to its growth.  It is now the second largest town in County Clare.  It is comprised of people, not alone from many counties, but from many countries.  It is a unique situation, there are changing needs but community bonds are being built there.  I believe the time has arrived when the administration of Shannon town would best be solved by a local-elected council.</P>
    <P>I want now&mdash;and I have already covered it a great deal&mdash;to revert to the consternation felt throughout the area with regard to the Minister's statement of 31 January.  In the absence of a more thorough explanation I disapprove, as do many other people the decision to confine the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to industries with an employment content of not more than 50 people and capital assets of less than £300,000.  Senator Cranitch spoke earlier and Senator Kitt re-echoed what Senator Cranitch had said.  They said they welcomed this new dimension, this new attempt to promote small industry and to give SFADCo total responsibility for it.  This is nothing new.  Shannon Free Airport Development Company have had the responsibility for many years of promoting small industry in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to give grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepted.  I want to make this point.  I know of no small industry, or no attempt by small industries, that did not receive other than the utmost support, encouragement and help from SFADCo.  Therefore, I do not accept that there is anything new, with the exception of the power to give grants, involved in the present decision.  Perhaps, taken on its own, the Minister's decision and statement would not have excited the same degree of concern in the area but when taken in conjunction with an article in the <i>Evening Press </i> of Friday, 3 February 1978 headed &ldquo;Job Targets Move Off Rural Areas&rdquo;&mdash;the man quoted being Michael Killeen, Managing Director of the IDA&mdash;which contended that in a major shift of policy the IDA <Col N="691" /> were planning to downgrade previous job priority areas in the west and midlands as part of a new blueprint to tackle unemployment in severely hit urban areas, then real concern and worry were caused in the area.  We have known SFADCo.  We can trust them to deliver the goods.  In view of that statement those of us in the mid-west are entitled to have reservations as to the capacity and the commitment of the IDA to deliver the goods in the mid-western region.  We believe that their first commitment will be what has been expressed in that article, that is not to the west and the midlands but to the east and the bigger centres of population in the east.</P>
      <P>There are problem areas referred to in many parts of the country.  We hear west of the Shannon referred to.  There is another area to which I want to refer, that is west of another river, west of the Fergus.  It is the most disadvantaged area that we have in County Clare and perhaps in the mid-western region.  It is short of employment opportunities.  Several attempts have been made in that region by SFADCo and by the county development team to promote industries in small towns and villages.  They have had but a limited measure of success. The greatest natural resource in that area is the Shannon Estuary.  I recall a short time ago reading a report entitled &ldquo;The Shannon Estuary, An Outline Development Framework&rdquo;.  That report projected that 5,500 jobs could be created on the estuary by 1986.  That is the greatest opportunity of providing employment, not alone in the west Clare area, but along north Kerry and west Limerick.  Therefore, the question of confidence and capacity as to the organisation that should promote it arises.  I repeat that I would have greater confidence in the capacity of SFADCo to do that job than I would in the IDA in view of the statement of their managing director on 3 February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of play has been made of the fact that it has been said that SFADCo have welcomed this development. I accept that they have welcomed their new capacity to make <Col N="692" /> grants available to small industry. Frankly, I doubt if that team in Shannon, in SFADCo have welcomed the removal of their responsibility in the field of major industry.  I understand that management at some level discussed this matter with the Minister a few days ago.  I do not know whether or not they conveyed to him that they were satisfied.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what happened there. There are people who feel that this may well represent the beginning of the end for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in all but in name.</P>
    <P>They have three main functions in the region, the principal one being the promotion of industry.  If the promotion of major industry is removed from that section, their focus and their capacity in that field would be very little better than that of a county development team.  If, as I hope&mdash;and as I think is necessary&mdash;we get a locally-elected authority in Shannon Airport, Shannon town, then SFADCo's second function, that of administering the town will be removed from them. They would then be left with their third function in which they have been most highly successful, the promotion of tourism in the region, the castle tours, the banquets, the Rent-an-Irish Cottage scheme and various other projects in that field which they have so successfully and effectively promoted.  I want to pose a question raised with me: if the IDA can now feel free to come in and assume the functions of promoting major industry in the region, is it not likely that Bord Fáilte may attempt a similar take-over where the tourist functions of SFADCo are concerned?</P>
    <P>Finally, I am concerned as to what may happen the team of men who comprised the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, men of expertise, of achievement and of great commitment.  I understand that the IDA are in the process of opening a regional office in Limerick.  It is conceivable that some of the Shannon team, the younger men, may drift there.  The older men will retire and vacancies may not be filled.  Therefore, at the end of this trial period of 18 months to two years the team that has <Col N="693" /> so successfully promoted that region may well be dispersed and the outcome of the events of the 18 months before us may be immaterial.  I do not want to sound too pessimistic but I question now, again in relation to the statement of the chief of the IDA, with the removal of the responsibility for the promotion of major industries from SFADCo, have we seen the last of the Burlingtons, the Syntexes, the Alcans, Beechams and Ferenkas?  Have we seen the last of these in the area until the imbalance about which the head of the IDA is so concerned is rectified, namely, the provision of more jobs and more industry in the east?  Even though I have the feeling I am misunderstood at times, I said at the outset that I would endeavour objectively to put the other side of the case.  That is what I have tried to do.  I have done so because of a genuine conviction that a mistake is being made, that employment opportunities, in the hope of attracting new industry to the region, will suffer as a result of this decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it provides additional funding for Shannon.  But because of the questions raised by the editors of our local papers, by the leaders of commerce and industry and of organised labour in the region, I would suggest to the Minister that he should at the conclusion of this discussion reply adequately to allay the genuine fears felt in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I welcome this Bill which provides further finance for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I am sure the substantial increase will allay the fears of the chairman of not having sufficient funds to meet commitments and ensure that projects will be developed in Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Molony outlined already the company's objectives.  I shall take the liberty of repeating them.  The company are dedicated to ensuring the growth of Shannon Airport through trade, passengers and services and to create a healthy prosperity in the mid-west region through sound industrial development harmonising the necessary activities in industry, tourism and <Col N="694" /> airport promotion and in town development so as to make the greatest possible contribution to the economy of the west and of using our experience and facilities to help also the people of less-developed countries. These company objectives have been well achieved and are commendable. Shannon Airport is handling air traffic at high levels, both in passengers and freight, from America and Europe. Shannon Airport is the gateway from the west to Europe.  There has also been the development of the industrial town at Shannon, the industrial estates at Raheen and Galvone, and other industries in towns such as Drumcollogher and Newcastle West in my area.  SFADCo's success has been proven also in the promotion of tourism, through mediaeval banquets at Bunratty Castle, the Folk Museum and Rent-an-Irish Cottage scheme. These are great achievements for Shannon despite the fate prophesised and forecast by some leading politicians at the time the establishment of Shannon was envisaged.  I would congratulate SFADCo and Mr. Brendan O'Regan, its chairman since its formation in 1959.  He is a man who got things done and who in turn inspired others to get things done.  He has now retired.  I am delighted to see he remains on the board and that his advice will be available to them.  I should like to congratulate his successor, Mr. McCabe.  I am sure his experience will render him worthy of the job in which I wish him every success.</P>
    <P>What I welcome most in the Minister's speech is the proposal that SFADCo concentrate on the development of small industry in the mid-west region in an intensive way not previously attempted in this country.  The Minister added:</P>
    <P>This is a pilot scheme, the results which will be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years when decisions will be taken about extending the scheme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The need for such indigenous industries is great.  For example, small industries manufacturing such items as are necessary to modernise our farming are essential to our economy, such <Col N="695" /> as labour-saving devices and other items necessary for modern farm buildings, milking units, and the provision of other vital commodities so necessary to farmers in the modernisation of their farmyards and holdings in order to achieve full output from agriculture and compete with other EEC farming countries.</P>
    <P>Other industries are needed also for the production of commodities catering for the manufacturing needs and demands of the immediate area, such as joinery industries catering for the building industry.  I should like to see such small industries or factories sited in small parishes.  Heretofore the practice was that such industries were sited in large estates, such as Galvone, Shannon town itself and Raheen.  Then there are others sited in such towns at Newcastle West and Drumcollogher as I have mentioned already.  This resulted in people leav-the land and going to live in towns. Ireland is becoming urbanised, or suburbanised if you like.  This is detrimental to community life in rural Ireland.  That is why I should like to see these factories sited in small parishes maintaining the parish identity and life in rural Ireland ensuring that future generations are brought up in the environment to which we were used.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry is being rationalised at present and creameries in these small parishes are closing down. Such creameries closing down or being vacated could provide sites for such small industries as I have advocated. Perhaps the Minister or SFADCo, whoever is responsible for the provision of these small industries, would take this into consideration, ensuring that rural and community life especially be developed so that we do not have ultimately an urbanised society.</P>
    <P>There has been talk and reservations have been expressed about the downgrading of SFADCo.  I do not agree and I cannot understand the motivations for expressing such reservations.  I can see them motivated only by those who may envy the present Government, and especially <Col N="696" /> the Minister, on their success in introducing this desirable and worth-while Bill.  We in the mid-west region&mdash;which embraces Limerick&mdash; recognise the efforts of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company since their formation.  We are most thankful to them.  I hope the Bill will be successful in its operation, and most successful in creating the small industries I have mentioned already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>All the people who had the reservations have been able to depart.  Thank God their reservations were not getting them down too much.  There are a number of points I would like to make in reply to the debate.  In my calculation, 98 per cent of the debate was about what I said in regard to the powers of SFADCo; 2 per cent of it was about the Bill.  I am not saying that the Chair was wrong in any way because I introduced the matter myself and, on a Second Stage, we are entitled to discuss the power or the functions of the company generally.  I am afraid, however, that there were a number of misapprehensions from the very start. The first speaker this evening, Senator Molony, said that I should not take away the powers that SFADCo have.</P>
      <P>I would invite the Senator to detail to me any power which SFADCo have which has been taken away from them. The answer is none.  He went on then to say that I was denuding the company of all their powers.  I invite him to specify what power they have been denuded of.  Then he went on to say that he doubted very much if the board were happy with what I propose.  I already dealt with that latest point in the Dáil when I said that board were extremely enthusiastic about the task I had asked them to undertake.  Not alone were the board enthusiastic but the executive of the company were equally enthusiastic about it.  A later speaker made the suggestion that the board had put up certain suggestions to me.  That, of course, is true.  They did put up certain suggestions&mdash;they were radically different from my reply to them.  I will not go into that matter any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> The board and the executive responded with considerable enthusiasm to the challenge that I put them.  If we get some of these basic misapprehensions out of the way it will not be necessary for me to go into every point that was made in the debate.  One of them is that SFADCo have not had statutory industrial promotion powers, they have been agents of the IDA in the mid-western region.  There is no question of any powers being taken from them.  They were associated with the IDA to some extent in the promotion of large industry in the region. Five examples have been given, Alcan, Beecham, Ferenka, Syntex and Burlington. Each of those was sponsored by and promoted by the IDA.  That is the situation as it was and that is the situation as it will continue to be. I can only hope there will be more than just the five major industries referred to here promoted and sponsored by the IDA.  I have no doubt, as I said in the Dáil, that they will have the help and the co-operation of SFADCo in the promotion of further industries of this kind, which we hope will come to the mid-western region.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating invited me to spell out in some detail the sentence I used at the foot of page 5 of my speech. I said that:</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with a matter which does not arise out of this Bill but which I regard as being of considerable significance&mdash;in the most positive sense&mdash;to the future economic and social development of the mid-west region, and, I believe eventually&mdash;by example and extension&mdash;to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>It was noteworthy that the views of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties were quite different on this matter, as they were in the Dáil, where the Labour Party supported my views in relation to SFADCo.  In response to Senator Keating's constructive attitude I will spell out what I mean by &ldquo;example and extension to the rest of the country&rdquo; what is being proposed here.</P>
    <P>No agency in this country has ever concentrated or had the time or the resources to concentrate in a major <Col N="698" /> way on the development of small industry whether it was indigenous or not.  The IDA, an immensely successful body, have been under pressure since their establishment from successive Governments, and not least by myself, to produce jobs.  Jobs are measured&mdash;perhaps we made an error in some respects in this way&mdash;in terms of numbers.  They are not measured by other criteria.  The public judge them in terms of numbers only irrespective of the value of the job, the worth of it, the technology underlying it, the investment associated with it or whatever.  The IDA have been under constant pressure, they are still under it, and I am the one above all perhaps responsible for keeping them under that pressure.  If the IDA have to deliver jobs in large numbers&mdash;they are doing it and they will continue to do it&mdash;it is a fact of life, whether we like it or not, that those jobs will have to be got in North America, in Japan, in Germany and in other places to a lesser extent.  That is where the great thrust of the IDA's promotional effort will have to continue to be aimed at.</P>
    <P>On reflecting on this over a period of years, I can see a situation whereby the IDA by its very success will create for us a major social sociological problem in ten years' time.  Seventy per cent, 80 per cent or even more of our industry will be foreign-owned and foreign-controlled.  I am worried in a long-term way about that.  Our short-term needs are met by the success of the IDA but we may be creating a long-term problem.  I will not interfere in any way with the IDA's activities. They are regarded by the people of America and elsewhere, as the premier industrial development organisation in the world.  The British are now learning from them.  The activities of the North and East of England development board and of the Welsh development board, intimate that the British are now learning from us about 10 years after the IDA acquired all this expertise.  The fact that they are being copied worldwide is proof of their success.  I will not change their operation in any way.  They are professionals and they are highly successful.  This <Col N="699" /> country has a great deal to be thankful to them for.</P>
    <P>At the same time we cannot afford to neglect our own people.  We cannot afford not to make an intensive effort with our own people.  We cannot afford not to work parallel with IDA's activities.  Another organisation pressing for industrial development in this country, in a way that is not in competition with the IDA but parallel to it, will achieve useful results without in any sense cutting across the efforts of the IDA or duplicating them. The most successful regional organisation in the country, SFADCo, should be the one to spearhead an intensive all-out effort to develop entrepreneurship and industrial development among our own people.  We will not develop industrial development of an indigenous nature by thinking in terms of plants of 1,000 or 1,500 people.  Many people might think that it is no longer appropriate or useful to think in terms of plants of 1,000 or 1,500 people, that because they are going to deal with Irish people and encourage the latent entrepreneurship which is in Irish people, they are of necessity going to deal with the smaller type of industry. It has never been done in this way before.  SFADCo are being asked now to undertake a task that is of major national importance to anyone who cares to think about it.  They see it that way and I know that they will respond.  It is a difficult task, but it is no more difficult than the very daunting task that faced those people in Shannon Airport in 1957 and 1958, when they were lucky if one plane in 24 hours landed at that airport. They once had 20, 30 and 40 planes on the ground together.  That must have been a daunting task but it was tackled with great spirit, determination and ability.  That task was fulfilled, the problem was overcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond made a very useful speech in the Dáil on this point. He put his finger on one of the difficulties which a company like SFADCo has when it is successful. Deputy Desmond at column 122 of the Official Report of 31 January said:</P>
    <P>There tends to be an appalling <Col N="700" /> tradition here that if one sets up some structure which proves to be a success, as has been SFADCo, that means permanency.  That is a dangerous illusion.  Perhaps there should be another revolutionary step forward in the structure in that region.</P>
    <P>SFADCo were aware of this.  I did not approve of the direction in which they intended to go and I steered them on to another direction.  There was great enthusiasm within the company for the direction into which I had steered them.  The board, although they had certain other ideas in mind in the social sphere and things of that kind, are now very enthusiastic about it. They fully realise that the primary objectives of this company must be economic and must be seen to be economic.</P>
    <P>There were two ways in which I could have gone about this task.  I could have established yet another State board for small indigenous industries or whatever.  It would have taken two years or so to have legislation passed and staff recruited.  It would take another two years to get it working as an efficient organisation. It would take perhaps another two years to acquire a reasonable amount of experience in this field.  It would have been quite foolish to start yet another board from scratch when I had available to me a highly competent board with a great deal of experience in these matters, with men on the board and in the executive who had shown themselves down through the years to be not just competent, but above all else to be innovative.</P>
    <P>This is innovation.  Innovation may offend some people but innovation is what gets countries going.  Innovation, whether some people like it or not, is what we are going to have because we will go down the drain if we are not prepared to innovate.  I make no apology for changing things for the better.  If change, of necessity, creates some tension in some areas I apologise for the tension and the worry and the misapprehension.  There is no need for it, because this company will make progress on these lines.</P>
    <P>Small industry is not the only area of development that I see open to this <Col N="701" /> company as the alternative to and running parallel with the IDA.  One of the difficulties that we as a nation suffer from all the time is a lack of technology.  I have been fascinated at times how other countries, even ones which ten or 20 years ago would have been looked on as comparatively backward, have managed to acquire foreign technology not by bringing in foreign firms to put subsidiaries or branches of their foreign companies there, but by buying the technology through a licensing arrangement or otherwise, and training their people to use it and to benefit from it.  One example is South Korea.  In 1953 was there a more devastated country in the world than South Korea, when that terrible war that had swept over the entire country twice was at last over?  Look at South Korea today.  South Korea is not dotted with the Korean subsidiaries of the American multinationals, although there is a share of them there, it is dotted with American, German and other advanced technology in Korean firms run by Koreans and managed by Koreans.  If they can do that why cannot the Irish do it?</P>
    <P>These are the kind of opportunities open to SFADCo now.  It might be convenient for everybody that SFADCo remain a localised, or regionalised second-class IDA.  It is not my way of looking at a company that achieved a considerable objective against all the odds.  That company have the ability to achieve further considerable objectives no matter how many begrudgers there may be in the early days when that task is set about. I have confidence in them to develop in that way that I see it.  I have confidence in them to grapple with these difficulties and to undertake these tasks and solve them for the benefit of the country.  By picking them to do it rather than setting up a new board I have demonstrated that confidence in them.  The feedback from them is that they appreciate that confidence and that they will not fail in the task.</P>
    <P>The extension of that to other areas, about which Senator Keating raised queries, can be seen in either of two ways.  I would not rule out either, or the possibility of both.  If at the end <Col N="702" /> of two years SFADCo have developed, as I am sure they will, a useful working and successful strategy for the intensive development of small industry in the mid-western region, I would see the experience, the knowledge and the plans that they have developed being extended to all parts of the country, either by sending a SFADCo man into each of the regions, or alternatively and perhaps in addition, expanding the operations of SFADCo in this respect outside the mid-western region.  They have already expanded beyond the region to some extent.  One of their major castles is in County Galway and they were instrumental in helping the establishment of this thatched cottage village development in Renvyle, County Galway, and in Ballycastle in County Mayo and perhaps in some other places in the west too.  There will be no difficulty in that regard.  Either opportunity is open to them, depending on how things stand in two years' time.</P>
    <P>One could see this company developing as a sort of West of Ireland Development Board rather than just a Shannon Development Board.  They are tackling problems which, while they are problems for the whole country are most particularly problems for the west. The alternative of extension is that one or more SFADCo people could be sent into each IDA region to implement the SFADCo plan for small industrial development in that region when that plan has been worked out and shown to be successful.</P>
    <P>In relation to small industries, the criterion by which SFADCo will be judged is not a criterion which some may have thought appropriate, the number of jobs that they will create at the end of two years.  The criterion is how they go about the job and how relevant the plans and strategies that they achieve will be to the development of the indigenous industry in the whole country.  They have a free hand as far as I am concerned as to how they go about it, but I want them to go into every town, village, and parish in the mid-west and scour it out in the most intensive way that it was <Col N="703" /> ever done to develop any possibility of local enterprise there.  I would like to see that local enterprise based on the local natural products.  In the long run that is the surest type of development.  I do not care how small a proposal may be.  Even if it is only to start with two or three people, the important thing is to get it started. SFADCo can and will do that.  It will be the first time that SFADCo will have grant giving powers up to a maximum, at the moment anyway, of about £200,000.  They can write the cheque themselves there and then. They had never been in a position to do that.  It is very important that they would now be in such a position. They are glad that they are entirely their own masters in this respect and that they will not have to refer to anyone in regard to anything.</P>
    <P>While all this is going on the development of the mid-west region, in the normal way, by the IDA as it has gone on over the last ten years, will continue.  I hope, if anything, it will intensify because the IDA may be perhaps pushed into making a bigger effort than ever, in view of the fact that some people say that the mid-western region is doomed now that the IDA have arrived on the scene.</P>
    <P>In connection with the IDA I will refer to a statement made and repeated three or four time by Senator Howard about a report in a paper on 3 February, which attributed certain views to Mr. Michael Killeen, Managing Director of the IDA.  That statement is entirely erroneous.  Mr. Killeen did not say that.  Mr. Killeen, whom I know very well, would not dream of saying anything of that kind.  The Seanad can disregard this attribution to Mr. Killeen of views which he certainly did not hold and did not express.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard and a number of other Senators spoke about the town in Shannon, and about the necessity of establishing some form of local administration there.  That is an objective with which I and the Minister for the Environment have sympathy.  I have spoken to him about it at some length. It cannot happen overnight, unfortunately, <Col N="704" /> because the ramifications of local government seem to be considerable, but it will happen.  If anyone wanted to talk about the downgrading of SFADCo, the only time that they ever will be downgraded is when they lose their town management function. Quite a number of their staff are involved in that.  Only four of their staff are involved in major industrial promotion. That is 2 per cent.  A considerably larger number than that are engaged in the running of the town.  I sympathise with requests which have been made in the town itself, that it should evolve its own local government, and that in due time it should become part of County Clare and should come under the jurisdiction of the Clare County Council.  That is the proper way for it to develop.  That is the way it will develop but it may take some years to bring that about.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the criticisms made.  I thank the Senators who spoke.  I assure those who had misgivings or apprehensions that there is no basis for their misgivings.  The mid-western region will make even greater progress in industrial terms and in other associated terms than it has done in the past.  From a national point of view SFADCo is being given a specific objective in a most vital area.  It is a company that will respond to that task extremely well.  The benefit of their response will not simply be confined to two-and-a-half counties and a city, but will be nationwide.  At present Ireland needs that kind of response and that kind of development.  As a result of what we are now doing Ireland will get that kind of response and development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Micheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 6) Regulations, 1978, and <Col N="705" /> Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporters' Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1978</P>
    <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Seanad on the 14th day of February, 1978.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations would increase the fees payable in respect of cattle, sheep and pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The present rates of fees are quite inadequate to meet the cost of the veterinary inspection service provided by my Department and it is necessary that they be brought more into line with that cost.  It is proposed to raise the fee for cattle from 45p to £1 per head and that for sheep from 8p to 17p per head.  In the case of pigs the increase would be from 12p to 25p per head.  I propose to bring the increases into effect on 6 March 1978.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing the veterinary inspection service at meat export plants has increased steadily over the years.  This is attributable to increased salaries, inflation, and the need to provide a more intensive system of veterinary control at factories in accordance with EEC rules.  The cost has risen steeply in the past few years and the position is that the receipts meet less than half of the cost of the service.</P>
      <P>In 1977 receipts from fees amounted to £700,000 while the cost of the service was in excess of £2 million. The new rates of fees are expected to bring in £1.6 million in a calendar year.  When they are viewed in the context of the present-day values of livestock the rates of fees are very modest.  Without veterinary control and certification we could have no meat export trade.</P>
      <P>The proposed increases have been cleared by the National Prices Commission. These fees do not apply to abattoirs catering for the home market only, which are under local authority supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the necessity to increase fees of this nature.  I am concerned at the moment because even though the price <Col N="706" /> of stock has risen very high it is no good to a farmer unless he can still make a profit.  If there has not been a sufficient increase for him to see his profit then this, in effect, can erode that type of profit.</P>
      <P>I agree and sympathise with the necessity to keep fees like this in line with the increased cost which the Department and the economy must suffer, but I am a little bit concerned that certainly at EEC level the emphasis is on restraint in price increases for agricultural produce.  I am concerned that there have been several acts committed in this country in the course of the past few months that have had the effect of taking large sums of money out of farmers' pockets, like the abolition of the abatement on rates and the removal of the subsidy on phosphorous manures. I am concerned that this trend should stop because I think this is a time when farmers need to be encouraged more than ever to increase production on their land.  They are going through a stage where they cannot expect to get the increased prices that they have been getting over the past few years but it is important for the economy generally and particularly for the agricultural economy that there would be increased production and we should try to maintain the margin of profit that exists.  My party in the Seanad will not oppose this in the sense that we know and sympathise with the necessity for it, but I think that I would speak for many of the farming community when I ask at least for a break for the moment in the removal of subsidies and increases in taxes like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the regulation. I think it is an updating of veterinary fees.  While we are on veterinary fees, may I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Agriculture in again gaining the confidence of our veterinary association in regard to the eradication of diseases. It was important to gain the goodwill of the association and I want to compliment the Minister.  Our programmes for bovine TB and brucellosis eradication <Col N="707" /> are going to continue in an accelerated fashion because this is an EEC regulation and we must have a disease-free animal herd here by at least 1979 or 1980.</P>
      <P>In connection with the fees, I would like to bring to the notice of the Seanad that in the Irish livestock exporters trade an Irish livestock exporter at this point has to have three examinations of his breeding heifers before they are exported to Britain or indeed to the EEC.  That costs veterinary fees to the extent of £1 to £1.50 because the exporter must arrange a veterinary TB examination, a brucellosis examination and a pregnancy examination for the animals. This cost is not being pased on to the farming community.  For that reason I would hope that this increase, which is modest and is necessary to meet inflation, would not be passed on to the farming community by the fresh meat exporters and by the factories throughout the country.  As I said, the livestock exporter must bear this cost himself when he is getting certificates for exportation of his breeding heifers and for bullocks exported through the port of Dublin he has to have a bovine TB test which costs in the region of £1. That also has not been passed back to the farming community.  That is the only reservation I have in this.  I welcome the regulation for the increase. I think it is necessary, provided it does not go back to the producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Molony and Senator O'Toole for their contributions and their observations on the proposal and their obvious recognition of the reality and good sense in the context of modern cattle prices and of the reasonableness of the charge now being made under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Senator Molony spoke a bit with his tongue in his cheek when he spoke of certain other things that have taken place in the agricultural economy in recent months.  He was a bit selective as one would understand and possibly even forgive, but he did omit to say that in the same context as the removal of the £4 <Col N="708" /> million phosphate subsidy there was an increase in the price of reactor cattle that will cost an extra £7,500,000. As well as that there is the introduction of the beef classification scheme. In the later part of last year there was the restoration of the sheep export subsidy and later still the opening up of the French market so that it is not quite correct to say that the farming economy has been damaged in any way.</P>
    <P>In the general context of the financing of agriculture, even if I had twice the amount of money that is now being made available to me by the Dáil, I am not sure that I would devote any part of it to the subsidisation of veterinary inspection fees because there are areas within the agricultural sector that require greater investment and require it to a bigger extent.  I think that both Senators who spoke on this measure recognise that and I am grateful to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, a Chathaoirleach, on the last occasion we discussed this motion, on balance I am quite sure we took the right course in the Government, and the Irish people in the referendum, in deciding to join the EEC, whether we look at it from an economic point of view or from the point of view of the political implications.  However, we are now at a new turning point in relation to EEC matters and the Minister <Col N="709" /> for Foreign Affairs has spelled this out in his reference to the absence of a credible regional policy and the necessity for the avoidance of serious regional disparities.  If we turn to page 88 of <i>Developments in the European Communities: Tenth Report,</i> July 1977, we find the heading:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Means of Regional Policy&rdquo; and under it, the following:</P>
      <P>Determining Priorities:</P>
      <P>The first task is to establish an effective monitoring system which can regularly review the situation of all the Community's regions and define where Community action is required.  Then, every two years beginning in 1979 the council, on a proposal from the Commission, will set priorities and guidelines to be followed by both the Community and the member States.</P>
      <P>The next paragraph states:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Regional Impact Assessment:</P>
      <P>From now on, in preparing its proposals in all main fields of community policy the Commission will take account of the regional consequences of those policies.  The Community will thus be able to take into consideration the interests of the regions concerned and where necessary adopt specific measures to correct any negative effects.</P>
      <P>Then under &ldquo;Coordination of National Regional Policies&rdquo; we read:</P>
      <P>Coordination will be based on the guidelines to be set by the Council and the regional development programme of the member States.  The Commission is concerned in particular to bring about the coordinated use of disincentives to investment in the developed regions and the coordination of infrastructure projects, especially in internal frontier regions which, obviously would be of great interest to us and to ensure that Regional Fund and national resources are used in a complementary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all very well but we are, at this point in time, considering in the Community the admission of Portugal, Spain and Greece.  In fact, we are quite close to the question of the admission of Greece.  If the EEC is <Col N="710" /> to be enlarged&mdash;and to a considerable extent we and the other member states are already politically committed&mdash; there are two key points which I consider should be not only emphasised but should be required before these other states are admitted: (1) that there is specific regional policy which is acceptable to this country and, as the Minister has pointed out, this does not yet exist; and (2) that there be agreement on EEC structures in particular, including agreement on majority voting.  These are two matters which must be decided and agreed in a manner acceptable to this country before we, in turn, can agree to the admission of Greece or, later, Portugal and Spain.  These are very essential requirements for Ireland if we are to continue to gain the economic benefits of the EEC on a really worth-while basis.</P>
    <P>When we consider Portugal, Spain and Greece we find that they have three major features in common.  First, they are all relatively underdeveloped; secondly, they all have large and relatively inefficient agricultural sectors to their economy; thirdly, their industries are industries which could compete with those already established in the EEC and they already have excess capacity in textiles, which is obviously very relevant to us with difficulties enough as it is with our textile industry, with excess capacity in shipbuilding, which is a major difficulty to the EEC as a whole in this moment in time, and with excess capacity in steel. We have already had our own difficulties <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC as regards the Irish steel industry.  Yet, this year we are considering admitting Portugal, Spain and Greece which have an emphasis on these three industries.  As regards agriculture they will clearly be directly in competition with the agriculture of southern France and of southern Italy.  But, effectively this is going to have implications, and perhaps very serious implications, for our agricultural industry and I think we must look at this very, very closely indeed and watch the agreements that are made before we can possibly, in our turn, agree to the admission of these three countries which might have most <Col N="711" /> serious consequences agriculturally and industrially on the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the government and running of the EEC, there are very considerable practical difficulties in the admission of those three countries.  All three have languages which are at present not used within the EEC, Spanish, Greek and Portuguese.  Already we are in a rather unwieldy situation in the EEC and the addition of three further languages will pose serious practical problems.  Another factor we must consider is that all three countries have rejected a pre-membership period.  I understand the EEC at one stage was considering a pre-membership period for Greece and, perhaps, now regrets that it did not insist on such a pre-membership period.  But, having failed to do so as regards Greece, it will find it equally, or more, difficult to do so as regards Portugal and I am quite sure the Spanish would effectively and bitterly resent any attempt to impose a pre-membership period.</P>
    <P>As regards the actual government of the EEC, if we move from nine member states up to 12 member states, and we still continue with the present method of unaminity in government, we are continuing a situation in which effectively the major states have by far the greater say in what happens.  It is a simple fact of life that inevitably the major states will have a very considerable say in what happens and their say will become overwhelming if we have an enlargement without some form of control over voting procedures, presumably majority voting procedures.  We should insist on some change before we agree to an enlargement of the Community because, if we do not, the larger powers will become even stronger. Such a development might be very welcome in the United Kingdom but it would make the EEC institutions as such very much weaker and I cannot see that a weakening of the EEC institutions will be of any benefit whatever to this country.</P>
    <P>If we look at the applicant countries in detail, taking Greece first of all, there has recently been an election <Col N="712" /> there in which the Premier Constantine Karamanlis and his National Democratic Party found themselves still with a majority of 173 seats out of 300 in the Greek Parliament.  That still represents a substantial drop in the vote for Mr. Karamanlis' party, a drop from comfortably over 50 per cent down to less than 40 per cent. His main opponent, Mr. Andreas Papadreas, heads a Pan-Hellenic socialist party which, interestingly enough, gets large agricultural support.  In the Greek general election that party doubled its number of seats and now has 92 seats in the Greek Parliament.  The important point is that this particular party is totally opposed to Greek membership of the EEC and a situation of considerable conflict within the Greek Parliament is building up.  We have to take cognisance of this when considering the admission of Greece. Greece is already an associate member of the EEC and as such it is due to receive over 300 million dollars in credits in the period up to 1981. If Greece becomes a full member of the EEC, even making due allowance for Greece's own contribution to the EEC budget, it is still reasonable to suppose it would be expecting that sum annually from the EEC budget&mdash; in other words, 300 million dollars annually.  Greece and the other applicant countries then will not be substantial contributors to the budget. There will be a deficit and that 300 million dollars has to come out of whatever funds are already available unless one or other of the member states is willing to increase its contribution. There is no evidence whatsoever that the major financial supporter of the Community, the Federal German Republic, is willing to increase its financial support.  The implication of this is that inevitably our share of the Community budget will probably fall.  We have to take this factor into very serious account.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the fact that shipbuilding is a major Greek industry&mdash;shipbuilings in yards which by and large are outdated and no longer able to compete with present day methods or with the yards which exist in Sweden, West Germany or, <Col N="713" /> perhaps, more important nowadays, in South Korea or Japan.  We will have a considerable problem there. Obviously it will only be to a slight extent a question of direct competition where we are concerned but it will be a very burdensome problem for EEC finances generally.  The sums involved in shipbuilding are so vast this inevitably will cut into any Community budget available.</P>
    <P>Greek agriculture is very much underdeveloped.  There is, of course, also the question of relations with Turkey which is an associate member with the EEC.  Turkey has already made it clear that, if Greece is admitted to the EEC, there must not be any political disadvantages to Turkey.  In fact, Turkey has requested that she be included in political consultations if Greece is admitted to the EEC.  There is this major conflict between Greece and Turkey which involves Greece at the moment in a defence expenditure of 1.5 million dollars.  I cannot help thinking that that also has implications for us to consider before Greece is admitted.</P>
    <P>Portugal is currently a member of EFTA and it is true that the Portuguese gross domestic product has increased by a figure of something like 7 per cent in the past year.  Of all the countries of western Europe, Portugal's financial position is the most critical.  In fact, the balance of payments deficit amounts to something like one billion dollars.  Curiously enough, about the only thing keeping Portugal afloat financially is the very large gold reserves amassed under President Salazar between 1938 and 1968, something like 800 tons of gold. The financial position of Portugal could well be a substantial burden if she is admitted to the EEC.  The internal situation is perhaps rather different in that all the parties in Portugal are in favour of joining the EEC, including even the Communist Party. The Communist Party has some slight reservations but these are related really more to the burden which joining the Community would in turn throw upon Portugal rather than to any specific objection as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> One matter which could be of very considerable direct practical importance to us is the enormous petro-chemical complex and oil refinery which is being established at Sines, south of Lisbon.  We have a personal interest here obviously, but one must say immediately we have already had in the EEC very serious discussions as to over-capacity in refineries within the EEC.  If we, in due course, are going to set up our own oil refineries and hydro-carbon complexes then we may find ourselves in considerable difficulties particularly as the geographical location of the Sines refinery would be in almost direct competition with any possible Irish refinery or petro-chemical complex.</P>
    <P>With regard to Spain, we are dealing here with a major country of 35.5 million people.  You have a situation in which the Spanish are pressing ahead very vigorously and seriously with their application for EEC admission. Perhaps, to a large extent, it is an emotional rather than a specifically economic desire to join the EEC.  For many years, when General Franco was in control in Spain, there was an absolute veto on Spanish membership of the EEC and it seems to be thought generally in Spain that, just as democracy has been restored, so also concomitant with this they should join the EEC and, to some extent, we on our side in the EEC have tended to regard ourselves as under some obligation to support the democratic institutions which have now returned to Spain by enabling Spain to join the EEC.</P>
    <P>Spain has its own economic problems and difficulties.  You have a situation in which you have this Monclao Pact between the Spanish Premier, Mr. Suarez Gonzalez, the Socialist leader, and Mr. Carrillo, the Communist leader in which you may well have a Larbinger of the future, in that the Communist, Socialist, Right Wing or semi-Right Wing parties are joined together in agreement on such matters as wage restraint, credit squeeze, substantial support for education and changes in social welfare.  Nothing similar to this has happened, in recent years at any rate, in western <Col N="715" /> Europe.  Even the working arrangements between the Italian Communists and the Christian Democrats is very different from this specific pact.  This may well be of very considerable interest in due course in regard to certain other EEC countries in which conceivably the Euro-Communists could come to power.</P>
    <P>Spain has appointed Senor Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo as their negotiator with the EEC.  He is a nephew of the Calvo Sotelo whose death was regarded as the starting point in the Spanish Civil War.  He is an extremely able person and he will report directly to Premier Suarez.  By April the Spanish Avis is due to be received at the EEC and the EEC plans to open offices in Madrid within two months.  Negotiations with Spain are really proceeding quite rapidly.  Yet, in Spain agriculture is extremely depressed, though very extensive, and so there will be immediate competition with Italian and French agriculture and, indirectly again, with any subsidies, supports or other financial incentives to Irish farmers. So there will be a direct and very serious effect on Ireland if Spain is admitted to the EEC.  Equally, Spanish industry, although far more advanced than Portuguese or Greek industry, does contain shipyards, quite modern shipyards, but nonetheless not sufficiently competitive in a worldwide sense.  In fact, I believe this year they have very few, if any, orders.  Again, the sums of money involved are enormous.</P>
    <P>The Spanish textile industry is a strong industry.  It will be competitive with us.  Most of all, perhaps&mdash;let us go back to where the Minister commented on his attitude about regional development funds&mdash;the regional demands of Spain will be enormous and where are the funds to meet those demands going to come from?  There is only one substantial financial contributor at present, the Federal German Republic, and already within the present Nine nations of the EEC there is considerable resistance within Germany to additional financial support. We have to look at this very carefully, indeed, in terms of its implications for this country, implications <Col N="716" /> which will affect every single one of us.</P>
    <P>I welcome, nonetheless, the idea and general principle that the EEC should be enlarged.  To me, it makes logic and sense that western Europe as a whole, Spain and Portugal, should join the EEC.  I am not quite so sure about Greece.  Greece is geographically very distant.  Culturally it is in many ways very different from western Europe. Perhaps there is here a greater question mark, although curiously enough Greece is closer now to membership than either Spain or Portugal. But there are practical implications These must be sorted out to our satisfaction. We are not Britain, France, Germany or wealthy Holland.  We have our own difficulties.  Our difficulties, unfortunately, could well be seriously aggravated in the event of the accession to membership of the EEC of any or all of these countries.  I repeat again, before they are admitted there should be agreement on the specific regional policy which is acceptable to this country and agreement also on the EEC structure including, in particular, the voting structure.</P>
    <P>There are a great many other aspects of EEC foreign policy or external economic arrangements on some of the outstanding ones of which one should very briefly comment.  First of all, with the developing world generally&mdash;we have had one or two debates already here on the developing world and aid for the developing world&mdash;perhaps one of the good features of the EEC has been the united policy which it has shown, for example, on the north-south talks.  Perhaps the support which we have given in the EEC to the developing countries has not been up to the level which the developing countries quite naturally would hope and expect. Perhaps it has not been as great as many of us in this country would like to see.  Nonetheless, there is a one billion dollar development programme &mdash;a special action programme&mdash;by the EEC.  That is far better than anyone else is doing.  I think we should bear this in mind and not always be so self-critical.  In other aspects of policy there is the common Mediterranean policy which means that we in the EEC now have established working relationships <Col N="717" /> with virtually all the Mediterranean countries.  There has also been, I understand, the common policy on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Again, this is essential from the point of view of the economic wellbeing of this country as well as of the EEC.</P>
    <P>We to some extent were responsible for another EEC foreign policy and economic initiative and that was in relation to the Euro-Arab negotiations and talks generally.  There seems to have been little progress on these recently and this may be perhaps because the attitudes and outlook of the two sides have been motivated rather differently.  I suppose the stimulus effectively to our contribution to the Euro-Arab dialogue was the oil crisis where the Arabs were, perhaps, looking at it more specifically from the point of view of Middle-Eastern problems.</P>
    <P>One area in which the EEC, I think, has been a grave disappointment and has let down the democratic world has been in its relationships with Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has witnessed a drop in trade from nearly 40 per cent down to 20 per cent odd during the last seven years in its trade with the EEC.  Yugoslavia is, perhaps, the one country in the world in which you have a truly Communist regime.  Whether we agree with Communism or disagree with it we would all, I hope like to feel that, if people wish to choose Communism, they should be, on the one hand, free to do so and, secondly, that it should have a human face.  I think it would be tremendously important for world peace and progress generally that this should come about. Certainly, those of us who know Yugoslavia, read about it or visited it, know that, by and large, in Yugoslavia you have a fairly happy and contented society and one which is making considerable progress despite enormous difficulties both in the last war and since it broke away from the eastern Soviet influence.  I think it is a great pity that there has not been more support for Yugoslavia from the EEC. I know there have been recent discussions&mdash;a Yugoslav trade delegation has been received&mdash;and that some sort of effort is now being made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I hope that we would look at it as well.  The last time I visited Yugoslavia&mdash;in September 12 months ago, I think it was&mdash;I was rather horrified to discover that I had to produce a visa.  I would hope something has been done about this in the interval.  From other countries in western Europe, apart from Spain, it was possible to visit Yugoslavia without a visa.  It was very irritating to be held up at the frontier each time one went in and out and I do not know that we have any particular reason to withhold visas from the Yugoslavs, which is what I was told out there&mdash;we refused to give them admission without a visa.  I do not see why we should not allow them to enter here and, in turn, be allowed enter Yugoslavia ourselves.  There is, of course, the simple factual question that the leader of the Yugoslav Government is very elderly and inevitably there will be some degree of, shall we say, instability when he leaves. I would hope that the EEC would seize within its institution the opportunity of helping the Yugoslavs and reducing any instability as far as possible.</P>
    <P>A major area of concern for the EEC has been negotiations with Japan. There, unfortunately, as we see announced today, the Japanese are being anything but helpful.  I think the EEC must watch very carefully. We see already on our roads, the number of Japanese cars.  Good luck to the Japanese.  Their cars are excellent but the Japanese are not members of the EEC.  They are not allowing our goods to go in freely into Japan.  If the German car market or German shipbuilding is not doing well, that has implications directly, financially and economically, not only for Germany but for us.  We cannot expect a weak German economy to be willing to come along and support regional developments in the west of Ireland.  I would hope that a much stronger attitude <i>vis-à-vis</i> Japan would be taken by the EEC in future.  Another area where I think the Minister of State here, Deputy Andrews, has been personally influential has been in relation to China. Any developments there, both in markets and in contacts generally, I am sure, should be very welcome.  Congratulations <Col N="719" /> to the Minister on his personal initiatives, quite apart from any departmental contacts.</P>
    <P>I would not like any of this to be considered as specific criticism of the Soviet Union or of the other major trade area in Europe, COMECON. The Soviet Union is entitled to its policies as much as any other major power.  It is a matter of regret that until recently it has apparently looked with disfavour on the EEC and that there has been so little trade contact between the two major economic areas of Europe.  I am glad that recently a COMECON delegation came to Brussels and that some effort has been made to open serious negotiations and that effectively for the first time the eastern Europeans are recognising EEC as an entity.</P>
    <P>In regard to trade and relations generally with the US, here again the EEC has played a very useful part in mitigating, at least to some extent, the tendencies towards protectionism, which seem to be on the sidelines at any rate in the US.  Here the EEC, I think, must use all the muscle it has to make sure that the American market remains open to EEC goods. Again, to this country with its export-orientated industries this is a matter of key concern.  Any degree of protectionism in the United States would immediately have very serious consequences in this country for employment and for prosperity generally.</P>
    <P>There is one specific group of countries in Europe which must be thought of in the context of the EEC and are little referred to in these reports.  Those are the EFTA countries, Austria and Iceland, Norway&mdash;which had the opportunity to join the EEC but declined to do so&mdash; Portugal, which is an applicant country, Sweden, which for various reasons has not joined, and similarly Switzerland.  It has, as an associate member, Finland.  For political reasons there is no way that Finland can join as a full member of EFTA or, later, the EEC.  Similarly, Austria is under political limitations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> Since 1 July last there has been free trade between EFTA and the EEC. Many people do not fully realise that the free trade area for industrial goods extends right through the population of 300 million people and not simply through the 250 odd million of the EEC.  There is now a unified market in industrial goods across 16 European countries.  The EEC takes somewhere in the region of 46 per cent or so of EFTA exports and accounts for over 50 per cent of EFTA imports.  Yet, in terms of EEC's overall trade, EFTA is surprisingly minor, it took only 11.5 per cent of total EEC exports despite the very close relationship which obviously exists between the Federal German Republic and Austria. Despite that, 11½ per cent of EEC trade went to EFTA and from the point of view of EEC imports, only gave 8.3 per cent.  Another curious feature is that growth in world trade between the EEC and the rest of the world has grown far more than growth between the EEC and EFTA, and a similar position exists as regards EFTA and its trade.  I would hope that further contacts will be encouraged and increased there, and particularly perhaps with Austria and Finland in view of the problems which they face and with which we should.  I think, very considerably sympathise.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect.  Sometimes it is more interesting to note what is specifically referred to in a report and sometimes more interesting to note what seems to be totally omitted from a report or from a speech.  I quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday 20 February 1978, headed &ldquo;Not Joining NATO&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Ireland would not be a member of NATO, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. O'Kennedy, said.  However, if it ever did get to the point, some time in the future, that the European Economic Community was being attacked, then we, as members of that Community, could not negate the fact.  As members of the EEC, we would have to play our role and carry out our obligations responsibly.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy added that there <Col N="721" /> was absolutely no basis whatsoever that any request or any pressure was being brought to bear on us to join NATO.  &ldquo;The case does not arise and Ireland will not be a member of NATO&rdquo;, he said.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly to.  Nonetheless, there are these hard facts of life that we should consider very carefully.  I referred to these very briefly in relation to the appropriations.  Since I referred to them the situation I mentioned then has become much more evident because we have had, since then, the publication of the American Defense Estimates and of the corresponding United Kingdom White Paper.</P>
    <P>We are not members of NATO and we are not joining NATO but the simple fact of the matter is that NATO is sitting effectively on either side of us&mdash;Britain and various other EEC members, with a question mark perhaps over France; on the other side, the Americans and Canadians.  They are all members of NATO and whether or not we like it we are in a vital strategic position right in the centre of the NATO area.  We are in a strategic position in what used be called the western approaches, now generally referred to as the Eastern Atlantic area.  Unfortunately for us, this is a very exposed position in which we find ourselves, which is obviously and inevitably of considerable interest to our EEC colleagues who do not meet directly to discuss defence matters, as EEC, but who tend to meet I understand virtually at the same time, or within a matter of hours or days of their EEC meetings, wearing other hats to discuss defence priorities.  Inevitably, and rightly from their point of vew, they must consider our strategic position and what we could do in the event of any degree of security problem.</P>
    <P>It is a simple fact of the present-day world, unfortunately, that the Warsaw Pact States of Eastern Europe have vastly increased their offensive capability.  Just as Federal Germany, in relation to the regional fund and so on is the main financial contributor, in the event of an attact on an EEC State, Federal Germany, unfortunately, is likely to be in the forefront.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> I quote here the Department of Defense Annual Report, Fiscal Year 1979, Harold Brown, Secretary of Defense, February 2, 1978, page 3, paragraph 4:</P>
    <P>Over the past 15 years, Soviet defense spending has been gradually increasing; we estimate the average rate of increase, in real terms, at between three and four per cent a year, roughly in line with growth in the Soviet GNP.  For a substantial part of that same period (from FY 1964 to FY 1975), U.S. baseline budgets (with military retired pay and the incremental costs of the war in South-east Asia excluded) have been declining in real terms.  Only since FY 1976, has our defense budget been increasing in real terms. As a consequence, the Soviet defense effort now appears to exceed ours. The margin is a matter of judgment, and depends on whether the two programs are compared in rubles or dollars.  Estimates of 20 per cent to 40 per cent for this excess appear reasonable.</P>
    <P>I now quote from the bottom of that page:</P>
    <P>In particular, an increasingly precarious conventional balance between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Europe is a matter of serious concern.</P>
    <P>We have, on our Order Paper, a reference to disarmament.  Without going into further detail on this I shall quote one further sentence of that report, on page 4, paragraph 4, first sentence:</P>
    <P>A strategic nuclear attack is the least likely military contingency we face.</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of the American Secretary of Defense given within the last few weeks.  Unfortunately this has implications for us in relation to our membership of the EEC.  Our sister island, which has a Labour Government at present&mdash;and Labour Governments are anything but committed to increasing defence expenditure or supporting defence budgets&mdash;have in creased their defence spending by 3 per cent.  From 1978-79 the budget will be £6.919 billion.  This is <Col N="723" /> totally against the wishes and the desires of the British Government but nonetheless they feel it necessary to do so.  I quote here from a <i>Financial Times</i> report of &ldquo;Command Paper 7099, Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1978.&rdquo;  The original has not as yet arrived in the Library but is expected here shortly.</P>
    <P>We have to take some congnisance of these matters.  We have an excellent Army in Ireland which performs an internal security role, which is very important, extremely well.  We must be very proud also of our contribution overseas.  But it is a simple fact that our Defence Forces have not been such as to deal with any external threat.  It would be a pity for us to find ourselves in a position where others found it necessary to step in for our protection.</P>
    <P>This sort of matter is something which we in the Seanad have a duty to address our minds to if we are looking at long-term policies and matters which may not be of immediate importance in day-to-day constituency business.  We in the Seanad should consider these matters very carefully and draw attention to them.  It is no use suddenly, in a state of crisis, starting to take steps.  I must compliment the Minister for Defence on his recent Estimates and for showing evidence that, for the first time in some years, some serious consideration is being given to the Army in the sense of having a defence posture.  This must be very substantially increased in the present world situation.  We want to be able to decide what our policy is to be rather than have it decided for us from outside.  Unless we are capable of showing that we could make some contribution or some effort to defend our own territorial integrity, we cannot blame others for having contingency plans which might not perhaps meet our wishes.</P>
    <P>In this particular relationship I am glad to see that, as a practical matter, our Naval Service is now increased and we are doing it in a practical matter with the EEC.  There is a financial contribution to them but the ships will be under the Irish flag.  Certainly <Col N="724" /> this is an area in which we should pay particular attention to the development of the Naval Service with EEC support, if possible, and if not alone. It is necessary for the protection of the substantial global area which we now have, our large sea area.  It is very reasonable for a maritime nation to develop its marine resources.  A previous Taoiseach, Séan Lemass, set a very good example in this matter.  I would hope that we would continue to develop it, and I am delighted to see it. It also gives employment of a nature which is useful, which can be used in civilian life and which contributes very much generally to our economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be fairly brief.  There are only one or two points I want to make.  The subject has been very well and constructively covered so far.  It is true to say that a considerable amount of disenchantment was expressed on both sides of the House with the development of the European Community since we joined. I do not know if a considerable amount of disenchantment is really felt, or if politicians generally are more anxious to proclaim that they feel that the people of Ireland are not getting enough out of the Community or that the people representing us have not succeeded in bringing home to our people a fair distribution of the excess wealth they think exists in other European countries.  It would be a pity if we were to adopt this attitude.  It would be regrettable if we were to debate this continually on the merits of the European Community from an economic point of view as it applies to us only.  It is fine to hear <Col N="725" /> somebody who has something to spare talking about the redistribution of wealth but when one hears people waiting for something, continually talking about it, it boils down to the fact that we are saying we are not getting sufficient assistance from our neighbours in Europe.  There is too much of this sort of argument advanced each time we discuss the question of European development.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of membership of the Community was sold to us on the basis that we would be better off.  That was an important consideration when 80 per cent of us voted but it was not the most important consideration.  It was used to sell the idea of the Community.  It was used to get people thinking.  However, the vast majority of our people would see more in this community of nations; they would see more in it for us than merely the amount of financial assistance we are able to get from our neighbours in Europe.  They would also expect that, at times like this we would make constructive proposals as to how the Community can be improved and how we, as a nation, can make that sort of contribution.</P>
      <P>When we talk about an extension of the Community, the question of Spain and Portugal arises.  As one of the poorer nations, naturally, it would be in our most selfish interests to seek to have countries like Portugal and Spain perhaps excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong if we were to seek to direct the progress of the Community of nations along a road which would leave behind us those two very important parts of the Continent of Europe.  We cannot say that, as a nation, we have not reached a stage in our development where we can make progress, leaving things as they are, even without the need to tax the people of Germany or the people of France further.  It is quite within our capabilities to work hard at home with some sacrifice towards the solution of our problems.  As a member of the EEC our biggest obligation is to work towards the establishment of a Community which can eliminate the serious problems in all parts of Europe and help further in bringing about <Col N="726" /> solutions to various problems in those countries where unemployment, ignorance, famine and so on are completely beyond solution in the foreseeable future.  That is the most important role of the European Economic Community. When we talk continually about the need for the Community to redistribute wealth, to take more wealth ourselves from other countries, we are talking about improving the situation for a people who are comparatively well-off.  We have our employment problems and so on but we should and can find a solution to those problems even without increased assistance.  At the same time I am not saying that as a country we should not seek to have schemes introduced, legislation passed and the Community develop along lines that will bring about eventually an equal standard of living, or as close as possible to it, by all the people in Europe.  That would be more my hope rather than what might be described a redistribution of wealth.  When we look at the situation in the under-developed world&mdash;if we are reasonable or natural at all&mdash;we must see that this will be the big requirement that we, as Europeans, will be expected to meet in the future.</P>
    <P>When I made the decision a few years ago to support the idea of involvement in Europe one important fact that coloured my decision was that I saw this as an opportunity for our nation to assert at least its independence of a neighbouring country who had dominated us for so long in so many ways and also in recent years through their economic power and influence, particularly because we depended entirely on them for a market for most of our exports.  In this area, through our association with Europe, we have achieved more than most of us will accept at present.  At the time we joined the European Economic Community most people would have said that the first argument against the reunification of Ireland that would be advanced would be on economic grounds, that we could not expect the people of the Six Counties to join us. Today, more than for any other reason as a result of our involvement in Europe, we find we have made such <Col N="727" /> fantastic progress that argument cannot be advanced any longer.  Our people should be grateful for this fact.  Some people express disenchantment with our progress since we became a member of the Community but this is one of the areas which I feel has solved an enormous problem for us.  Not only has it rendered the average household income of people in the Twenty-Six Counties higher in the past five years but that income is £2 or £3 weekly higher than its counterpart in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Additionally we had the old arguments about the levels of social welfare that were paid.  Shortly after we became a member of the Community there was a fairly rapid increase in the rate of social welfare paid to our weaker sections.  We have almost closed the gap that existed there.  Were we not a member of the European Community I do not think we would have the will at present to stretch our limited economic resources to bridge that gap.</P>
    <P>When we look at all the various schemes, not alone in the field of agriculture, it is fair to say that before we joined the Community the figure of total agriculture exports was something like £179 million.  Last year we exported £700 million.  That sort of growth and the prices we got for our produce would not and could not have been achieved otherwise.  Our unemployment problem, serious as it is, would have been much worse also.  I do not know how we could put a figure on it but it must be obvious that our agricultural growth achieved as a result of joining the Community played a big part in keeping employment in industry generally up to its present level.  In all our industrial training schemes we had a negligible number of people in industrial training under the Department of Labour in 1972.  That number has been increased by 1,200 to 1,300 per cent in those years.  It has been done largely with the assistance of the social fund which has financed all this training. We could not have had training on the scale to which it has been extended today had we not received the sort of assistance that we got from <Col N="728" /> the social fund as well as the training schemes that were promoted within particular industries, financed in cash by grants from the EEC</P>
    <P>If we tend in this House or elsewhere to express disenchantment we are probably not being constructive, or fair, but are probably being a little grasping and selfish in our attitude to the whole idea of a united Europe.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to raise on the Tenth Report, Chapter 5, page 44, on Customs Policy. Coming from a part of the country where there have been severe disadvantages in cross-Border trade in the last few years I want to emphasise this part of the report:</P>
    <P>5.1.  On 15 June 1977 the Commission sent a Communication to the Council and to the European Parliament on the state of the Customs Union of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>5.2.  The Communication proposes that in the short term&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;certain measures should be adopted in order to increase the public's awareness of the reality of the common market,</P>
    <P>&mdash;non-customs barriers to the free movement of goods should be eliminated,</P>
    <P>&mdash;checks at domestic frontiers should be reduced,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the programmes for the approximation and simplification of customs legislation should be completed and the decision-making machinery in the context of the Customs Union should be improved.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>I want the Minister to note that in my part of the country over the last four or five years we had a policy, for whatever reason&mdash;sometimes the point eluded me&mdash;of a deliberate breaking-down of roads by the British Government or British forces connecting parts of Connacht and Ulster with the Six County area.  I say the reason eluded me somewhat because I could not really see that all this was necessary in the interest of security.  This area could not be compared with the rest of Europe, with boundaries, say, between France and Germany, or Holland and <Col N="729" /> Germany, places where borders have existed for a very long period and where perhaps roads were not as close as in the area about which I am talking. In these areas we had roads on which people were dependent, roads to towns that were used by people from Leitrim, or in areas like Enniskillen, towns in County Leitrim like Kiltyclogher and villages like Rossinver, always used by the people of the Six County area.</P>
    <P>In the past few years there has been a policy of breaking down or spiking these roads or blowing up bridges. The British Government have consistently refused over the years to have another look at this policy, to re-open these roads in the interest of better communication, freer movement, in the interest of trade and of promoting good neighbourliness, if not between people in one island, in what we say is one country, but between people in the EEC, if it came down to that.  At this stage the attitude of the British Government on this whole subject is very hard to understand.  Even in County Cavan there is a bridge which was blown up by some illegal organisation a number of years ago. It is known as the Aughalane Bridge. The British Government have refused to allow this bridge to be re-built in spite of the fact that Fermanagh Rural District Council have unanimously passed a resolution asking the British army to agree to this as have Leitrim County Council and Cavan County Council.  All interested parties in this part of Ireland have agreed that this is important.  If there is a difficulty about manning posts there, if there is any difficulty about protecting the personnel involved then that is a question for the respective Governments to come to terms with and solve.  But the blind eye is being turned to this problem.  All of County Leitrim is completely separated from County Fermanagh; there is no communication of any sort.  People who traditionally crossed in a number of places have to go miles now to crossing points.  At European level, it appears the British Government have refused to consider this problem.  The Irish Government should take up this <Col N="730" /> question at European level.  If approaches are being made between two neighbouring Governments, outside of a European context, if these requests are not being acceded to the Irish Government should use the full weight of its membership of the European Economic Community and demand that the European Community request the British Government to comply with what is the policy of the European Parliament and Commission at present.  For the past five or six years people of a particular part of our country have suffered as a result of this injustice.</P>
    <P>We are now a full member of the European Community.  We have equal voting rights.  We have a voice equal to that of any other country in Europe. We have an obligation in the interests of one of the most disadvantaged parts of the European Economic Community, one of the areas with the lowest income, one in which we can least afford to have the disadvantages of an unnatural boundary running between areas where boundaries&mdash;even over the past 50 years&mdash;were largely ignored around which people traded and communicated in every way.  I ask the Government to please take this seriously because it is very important in the part of the country I represent.</P>
    <P>I am not in the least disenchanted with the progress of the European Economic Community.  Decisions are difficult and sometimes are being made too slowly.  We, just as does any other country, bear part of that responsibility.  It is difficult for us to blame the European Economic Community, with new processes, new institutions and people who are not perhaps experienced in European problems.  It is hard to blame them for being slow when we see some of our own failures at home, some of the difficulties in having decisions taken within a small country, sometimes even at local level.  We should keep working at it.  We should seek to make a contribution and when we go out to sell the idea, when we talk about elections to the European Parliament, we should talk more what we can offer to Europe and less about what we can get.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> I have experience of some of the schemes operated under European directives, and people from the Department of Agriculture come to us and tell us they cannot do this, that or the other because of the restrictions imposed by the EEC.  When the people from AnCo come around they do not say &ldquo;I am here because we get so many millions of pounds in grants every year to be spent and I am giving a service related to that assistance&rdquo;.  The farm building people do not say that 10 per cent of grants come from the EEC.  If there is a negative statement to be made we are sure to hear about it. Various Governments, one party have been as guilty as another, claim the credit for everything that they do through taxation and the raising of funds within the country, but they always ignore, except when it suits them, the assistance and initiatives that have come from the Community to encourage and help us to carry out improvements or introduce schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of the doubts cast by many Senators on the sincerity of the member nations in pursuing the objective of total economic integration with the EEC, and the Minister of State's concern as to whether the commitment to the objective of economic and monetary union has been wholehearted on the part of all concerned.  This is something we should face up to in considering the application of any new members to the EEC.  An example of this is in the Tenth European Report which includes the adoption last May by the European Council of the Sixth Directive on a community-wide basis for a common system of value-added tax, for a uniform basis of assessment and for a common method of operating. This directive was to have come into operation on 1 January and the legislation needed to implement it is at the moment with the Dáil.  It is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation, from the point of view not only of the Irish consumer but of the Irish manufacturer, that the Council of Ministers has agreed on and it was steered through by our <Col N="732" /> EEC Commissioner, Mr. Richard Burke.</P>
      <P>At this stage, it is bewildering and many are under the misapprehension that food is exempt.  It is not.  Specified food has a rating that at present is zero, but that could be changed in the future.  The directive spells out what will have to bear VAT, what is exempt, and what for the time being can have a zero rating.  As far as I can make out, the national Governments in the various countries can still levy VAT on items of their choice and are entitled to zero-rate other commodities if the Government so wishes.</P>
      <P>What is disturbing about the Sixth Directive on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to value-added tax, is that it does not attempt to harmonise the rates applied in the various countries.  This allows for a great number of anomalies and considerable hardship on some of the industries which are subjected to a high level of VAT in one country and to zero-rating in another country. What must also concern those industries and services which are subjected to value-added tax is the immediate Community objective to complete the own resources arrangements for financing the budget of the Community.  This is already in arrears.  They have not completed this for the 1978 budget. The Sixth Directive was due for implementation on 1 January this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the agricultural levies and the common customs duties on imports from outside the EEC, the third constituent part of the own resources system will derive from the common VAT basis assessment to be established.  One per cent will be due to the European Fund, repayable out of the revenue from the VAT collected. In other words, Ireland will pay over to the Community the required sum in respect of VAT own resources at the rate of 1 per cent from retail expenditure subjected to VAT whether it is subjected to VAT in this country or not or in any other country.  In the Community sense this presents a very unfair situation in regard to certain products.  The ones I am acquainted <Col N="733" /> with are cakes, biscuits, crisps, icecream and newspapers.</P>
    <P>Why should certain foods and newspapers in Ireland have to pay their share of 1 per cent of Ireland's own resources, whilst those foods and newspapers in our neighbouring country, for instance, are not subjected to this obligation?  Member states will have to provide compensation equivalent to the loss of VAT if they do not charge it which therefore amounts to a hidden subsidy for certain industries which compete with ours.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe by the Council of Ministers that harmonisation of the rates of VAT applied to the various countries is a long time ahead.  I hope that our Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities will advise the Minister to press for an urgent review of this unfair and irregular trading situation. In the meantime, what can we do about the advantages which the increasing imports from our major competitors, for instance the UK, enjoy? The UK have a greater opportunity to increase their volume with the cheaper food policy right across their home market, which has a much larger population and so many subsidies both direct and indirect that we have not investigated.  There is a need for a comprehensive analysis of the imports from the UK into this country which will include an in-depth research into the disparities.</P>
    <P>We are all very much aware of the effects of the much-discussed temporary employment subsidy.  This is not only enjoyed by the textile industries in Britain but it is also enjoyed by many of the food industries in the rural areas.  This analysis of products being imported should also examine the rates of VAT, if any, that are levied in the UK on such products.  There is also the advantage that imported products do not suffer VAT until the point of sale in this country whilst Irish manufacturers have to charge VAT on invoices to the retail and wholesale trade in advance of sale to the customer. The CII have drawn attention to this unfair advantage, so far to no avail.  Incidentally, it will present a nice point of argument on today's duty <Col N="734" /> free facilities.  After all, time and again we hear of the stubbornness of the British to accept the full terms of their membership of the EEC.  I join with those who advocate that we should be, if not equally stubborn, at least ingenious in safeguarding our domestic manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>Whilst the EEC are making up their minds about harmonisation in the true sense, including harmonisation of the rates of VAT, at least we should examine how we can safeguard our enterprises, providing them with parity of opportunity as guaranteed by the Treaty of Rome, with those enterprises operating in our neighbour country which enjoy disparities of one kind or another, some of which I have illustrated.  Furthermore, arising out of such an analysis, it might be feasible to subject products being imported, which are not manufactured in Ireland, to the maximum rate of VAT in order to ensure that these imports are paying their way in the context of our national economic plan.  This could be an effective way of either reducing imports of this nature or adding to our total tax collected.  In the meantime, at least VAT should be imposed at the point of entry into Ireland which would remove one unfair anomaly.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Deputy White raised the question of the differing rates of VAT operating in the North of Ireland from those operating here.  Anybody who watches Ulster TV can be misled at the prices that are advertised, not just because of VAT, but because of the British food subsidies. I was interested in Senator McCartin's view of the North, because another barrier to the integration of this island is that the North enjoys these food subsidies and is not subjected to the same VAT rates as we are.  Why should they think of joining us when their cost of living is lower than ours, when a great number of items cost so much less in that area?</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy White, the Minister said there would have to be negotiations between the two Governments or that alternatively the Irish Government would simply follow what the British Government does.  This <Col N="735" /> whole Sixth Directive is about harmonisation, and that is the ultimate objective which must inevitably happen and in this instance there is every reason why the British Government should follow the Irish Government in the application of rates of VAT which are now zero-rated in the UK.  I realise that neither the food items mentioned nor the newspapers are likely to be zero-rated here within the next year.  Why should we not pressure the Council towards the harmonising of rates among the Community members in the same way that we won our case for fair trading in processed foods in Brussels for a Community-wide MCA system, when the validity of the points made by Ireland were upheld by the Commission?  I am heartened that the Minister agrees that there should be harmonisation between the north and south of Ireland if it could be implemented.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating highlighted the controversial factors concerning the Community maintaining a price differential for food between it and the rest of the world.  This is a problem for Ireland, because we are beneficiaries on the agricultural front.  As this is a major question on the horizon we should be doing far more to analyse our strengths and weaknesses in the Community on this subject.  We should examine whether there is a likelihood of the abandonment of the higher food price policy outside Britain, or whether Britain will succeed in imposing its philosophy on the Community to the long term detriment of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Further questions need to be answered if Senator Keating is right that the big multi-national banks and industries have got all that they want out of the Community and that consequently these highly influencial forces want to see individual members as different as possible and having options about their industrial incentives, and that tax legislation is drawn up to suit each other to the benefit of their multi-national operations.  I can speak from my experience of the pressure put on our food processing industry, to forego our efforts, and to drop the <Col N="736" /> pursuit of our aim to get equalisation of opportunity through the imposition of monetary compensation amounts. I came in for a considerable amount of personal lobbying from the type of multi-national which Senator Keating is wary of and I would like to acknowledge the determination and support which we received from Deputy Clinton when Minister at the time.  We had to face multi-national pressures who have expert consultants and lawyers resident in Brussels.  The worrying aspect of this is that such lawyers and consultants are still trying to upset the decision of the Council of Ministers and therefore our representatives must be ever keenly alert to the undermining strategy of the big forces which Senator Keating has continuously warned us about, against whom we have to match our wits without the same financial clout.</P>
    <P>VAT in Ireland accounts for 15 per cent of our total taxation compared with less than 9 per cent in Britain. Our Minister of State in this debate admitted that the movement towards economic and monetary union in the Community has been sluggish in recent years and EEC Commissioner Richard Burke has already forewarned us that economic and monetary union would see that taxation policy becomes a subject of central importance.  This will involve a common currency and closely integrated economic management but for industry, particularly the private sector, the most important aspect is the factors in the formation of many manufacturing costs which need to be equlised, which in turn implies broad equalisation of tax burdens. If this is to be achieved member states must adapt their taxation systems towards a common pattern.  I suggest that we start with the harmonisation of the rates of VAT.  The time scale for the harmonisation of the rates of VAT should be agreed at least before the accession of Greece, Spain and Portugal.  This step would be in line with the policy expressed by the Minister of State, that positive action will have to be taken to eliminate existing disparities before the accession of new members.</P>
    <P>I have found this debate on the <Col N="737" /> European reports both stimulating and encouraging because the House is facing up to the EEC as it is, and not perhaps as the Irish citizen thinks it is. The non-partisan message to the Government throughout this debate from all sides of the House seems to be loud and clear, that Ireland's role must be one of both catalyst and vigilante, to ensure the promotion and maintenance of the principles of the Treaty of Rome in the best social and economic interests of us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody reading the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth reports of the Community must be impressed by the amount of legislation that has gone through in the period covered by these reports, by the new policies that have been introduced and by the variations of the policies.  Reading these reports, and looking around us, we must be unfavourably impressed by the lack of information we have in regard to what is going on in the European Community that is of consequence to this country.  It is true to say that we have a rather haphazard approach to the European Community.  We have a lack of accurate information about the measures in the Community that are of consequence to us.  We are often very critical of certain aspects of the Community.  We were very critical, possibly unduly critical, in recent months, of the situation that has developed in regard to fisheries.  On the other hand, we accept without question the very great advantages that are available to this country, from the agricultural point of view.  On the one hand, we are critical of some things, complacent about the others, but in many areas we are completely uninformed.  To that extent, we fail to avail of advantages that are available to us in the Community, and on the other hand we sometimes suffer disadvantages that might be minimised if we were fully informed.  After five years in the Community, there is no excuse for this.  It was understandable that this should have been the position in the first few years, but at the end of five years we cannot make the excuse that the European Community and its various regulations and so on, are too complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> We have had ample time to learn and we should learn when it is so important in this country.  It is particularly important now when the Government are introducing a new drive for economic growth and for increased employment.  It is increasingly necessary that we should be informed.  We must make a determined and comprehensive effort to inform ourselves and to understand all the implications of membership.  That means not merely to understand them, but to exploit every opportunity available to us in the Community and there are many. Perhaps in a relatively small way there are contracts and research grants available there.  There are 101 big and small opportunities which this country is not availing of simply because we are not fully aware of what is available. There are problems and disadvantages which could be minimised and perhaps eliminated altogether if we prepared adequately for them.</P>
    <P>This is not true of all sections of our community.  The farmers and the agricultural community have probably informed themselves better than any other section.  They have a very sophisticated presence in Brussels.  They know practically everything that is going on and they have benefited from it.  This is true to a lesser extent in industry, and to a very much lesser extent in many other sections of the community.  This is something that we must apply ourselves to this year and in the years ahead.  When I say that we must do it, whose responsibility is it?  It is true that the Government have the principal responsibility and they have to a considerable extent made an effort to understand, to study and to pass back to those concerned what is going on in the Community.  A lot of what the Government have learned in these years has, unfortunately, been filed away.  They do a lot of work on it, they bring it back, they have it in files, but it is not passed on to those concerned.  It is not publicised.  To do that is to do only half the job.</P>
    <P>To give an example of what might be done, in the United Kingdom the Department of Trade and Industry publish an information magazine regularly which usually has quite a lot of <Col N="739" /> information dealing with developments, new regulations and so on in the European Community.  In that way this information is made available to the public and to those who can profit from it.  We have nothing of that kind here. In agriculture, in industry and in certain other sectors there are magazines published by the sectors in question, which give quite a lot of information, but not every section of the community is big enough or sophisticated enough to have magazines of that kind and there are many areas where consequently this information is not passed on.  This is primarily a State responsibility and it will have to remain primarily a State responsibility.  But every sector of the community must do its utmost to be informed of the happenings in the Community that are of consequence to themselves.  Every sector must not only ask the Government for information but must make their own efforts to inform themselves and constantly to keep up to date with what is happening.  In this way opportunities can be availed of and problems can be anticipated and to a very considerable extent mitigated.  There is a lot of hard work involved in doing this.  I do not for a moment suggest that it is not hard work.  It is something that must be tackled in a businesslike way. Everybody involved must devote a good deal of time to this.  It must be taken seriously as being of such importance that failure to deal with it will be serious and will be something that, as time goes on, will become more and more serious.</P>
    <P>We have been in the Community for five years and we have been a full member since the end of last year. The difference between the end of last year and the beginning of this year was very largely a technical one.  We have experienced membership for five years and by and large the structures of the Community during that time, for us in particular and for other countries as well, have worked fairly well.  There have been difficulties but generally speaking the structures have worked well.  We have been equal members of that Community.  We have taken part in decision-making.  We can and do on many occasions not only urge that <Col N="740" /> certain things be done which are to our benefit but also object to certain things being done which are contrary to our national interests.  The recent controversy about fisheries has shown that if we dig in our heels, that if we object, it creates a situation where the Community has to think and think again.  We could indeed have created an impossible situation for the Community if we failed or refused completely to listen to other points of view put forward by other members of the Community. That indicates to what extent we can influence things to our advantage and to what extent we can prevent things being done which are to our disadvantage.  It was argued again and again during the time of the referendum that generally it is not a case, and it has not been a case over these years, of the Community trying to impose things which would be to the deteriment of this country.  Most of the policies, most of the regulations and most of the advances made during that time have been not only to the benefit of the Community generally but have been to our benefit also.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of the founders of the Community was to move to a situation of economic and monetary union.  At best very slow progress was being made in this direction but when the oil crisis took place a few years ago it almost completely undermined any progress being made. Most of the states in the Community took individual action to deal with that crisis and instead of taking a few paces further in the direction of EMU during the past few years if anything a few steps backward were taken.  Mr. Roy Jenkins, the Head of the Commission, at a recent money lecture commemorating the founders of the Community urged that the Community should make a move forward again.  He said we should think of the long-distance jumper who starts with a rapid sucession of steps, lengthens his stride, increases his momentum and then makes his leap.  That is what monetary union would involve.  He went on to talk about the problems which exist in the Community at the present time.  He referred to the intractable unemployment, <Col N="741" /> inflation and international financing.  He suggested that EMU would be the answer to many of these problems.</P>
    <P>This is possibly a rather facile way of looking at these problems.  There is no doubt that the problems exist but to say that because they exist EMU is the answer is making an assumption which is not necessarily valid and certainly in the short-term is very definitely not valid.  It is dangerous to assume that these problems would necessarily be cured; in some respects these problems might become even worse if we moved too quickly in the direction of economic monetary union.</P>
    <P>In theory EMU has advantages.  It appears to make a great deal of sense not only to have no customs, trade or economic barriers but it also appears to be a great advantage to have a common currency.  This would certainly facilitate trade, would minimise financial and accountancy problems and could, of course, in the long run, lead to a strong European currency which would have exchange control advantages. The dangers for the weaker regions still exist.  They have always existed, and will continue to do so unless you have a situation where the weaker regions become a lot stronger and more in line with the richer regions in the Community.  Unless and until the weaker regions, and I include Ireland in that area, reach a stage when they are able to compete fairly satisfactorily with the stronger regions, then EMU is a dangerous concept and one which we must look at with some reservation. The dangers are that in the present situation economic resources and funds would flow from the weaker regions to the richer regions, to the golden triangle and so on.  That is the belief of most economists.  Of course, it may not be fully correct but it is certainly something we would have to worry about.</P>
    <P>Mr. Roy Jenkins in his speech anticipated this criticism.  He said that the legitimate fears, and he acknowledged they were legitimate, and needs of the weaker regions must be met&mdash; and these are his words&mdash;&ldquo;far more powerfully than is at present the case&rdquo;. By that he meant, at this stage, far <Col N="742" /> more help by way of regional and social funds.  He suggested it might be necessary to increase these up to seven times the figure that is being given at the present time.  I am not sure why he picked on seven times but that was the multiple he mentioned.  If such steps were taken and if the Irish economy was strengthened as a result of that, then certainly a move towards economic and monetary union would merit fresh appraisal on our part and I am sure it would be given that appraisal in these circumstances but it seems very far away at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is of some significance that it is not only the weaker regions who are unenthusiastic about the idea of EMU at present.  It is probably for different reasons, but the French Commissioner Ortoli, who is the present Economic Commissioner, says that any dramatic move to EMU at the present time would be politically absurd and the West German Chancellor, Herr Schmidt, said he saw no realistic way to total integration of the Community. It was a great ideal, but past experience suggested it was unlikely to be translated into practical reality.  Similar observations were made by the United Kingdom Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Healey.  We do not have any need to worry that we are going to be rushed into it at the present time.  All the countries at present have considerable reservations although each of them has that reservation for a different reason.  Therefore we will make slow progress, if any, towards the concept, and hopefully by the time it arrives we will be sufficiently strengthened economically and otherwise to be able to take full advantage of it.</P>
    <P>For those who still cherish the idea of EMU and are disappointed by the slow progress towards it, they can take some encouragement from the progress which has been made towards direct elections.  It made very slow progress for many years and looked as though it might never be reached, but it is now safe to say it will be achieved during 1979.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will be refreshed and strengthened by its new role with democratically elected Members.  These <Col N="743" /> elections will give the public a new interest in the Parliament and this interest will be reflected in the democratic and effective manner in which the Parliament will carry out its duties.</P>
    <P>I am very glad we have at last broken the chicken-egg controversy about the Parliament.  For many years it was argued that there was no point in electing the Parliament democratically until the Parliament had more power and the other side of the coin was that there was no point in giving it more power until it was democratically elected.  That has been broken now and the elections will take place.  The European Parliament has been given some extra powers during the past few years and in a sense it has taken more powers because as the Parliament proceeded it evolved in a certain way and in that way it got extra powers without specifically being given them by the Council of Ministers or the Commission.  I am confident that with the new democratically elected Parliament more powers will be demanded and will be given.  This will help to mitigate both the image and the reality of a bureaucratically dominated community.</P>
    <P>During the five years in the Community we have had a number of disappointments.  I say that as a convinced European and a person who advocated entry to the Community in 1972.  In spite of these disappointments I am still convinced we made the right decision at that time and I am certainly convinced that membership has been very much to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Currently the fisheries problem has coloured many peoples' view about the EEC.  Such events will arise again and we must keep them in perspective.  We must weigh such disadvantages that arise from time to time against the overall advantage of being in the Community and there is no doubt that there are many advantages.  What is important in regard to the problem of fisheries is genuine conservation measures to ensure that enough fish are preserved in the waters around this country to provide Irish fishermen with a livelihood and the Irish people with <Col N="744" /> fish.  Whether that can be achieved by one formula or another does not matter provided the objective is reached.</P>
    <P>The regional policy is one of the disappointments we have had in the past few years.  It seemed to have great hope for this country and there is no doubt that good work has been done under the regional policy and with the help of the regional fund.  It has been of great assistance in many projects throughout the country.  But the problem, of course, is that the amount was much too small, something like 1,300 million units of account over the three years, of which this country only got 6 per cent.  That, as I say, was of considerable importance but no real impact was made by it.  No impact was made by the regional policy or the social fund which would bring us up to the level or near the level of the richer regions.  I must emphasise that is still the position, that we are still far short of the requirements, the help and assistance which would bring us in line with the other countries.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of our begging for help or saying that we want a hand-out.  What we are saying is nothing more or less than the fact that the Treaty of Rome envisaged a Community in which all the countries would be economically on much the same level, that by being members of the Community they would be all equally well off and that this was to be not merely the aim of the Community but one of the essential characteristics of the Community.  All one can say at the present time about the regional policy, and to a lesser extent about the social fund which has been far more satisfactory, is that what has been done so far has not lived up to the objectives of the Treaty of Rome. But although it has not lived up to it, it has gone some distance and I believe it will continue to make progress.</P>
    <P>Whatever the disappointments of the Community in recent years, it has been a great advantage to this country.  It has been a tremendous benefit to agriculture, both in regard to prices and a guaranteed market and last year alone the benefit was measured in something in the region of £400 million.  Even <Col N="745" /> in the area where great fears were expressed during the referendum, that is in regard to industry, when we were told that our industries would be overwhelmed by the industries of the big countries and would go out of existence, that did not take place.  Some smaller industries did suffer.  Some went out of existence but, by and large, the effect was that many smaller industries prospered and many industries are now in existence that were not there five years ago.  These have more than compensated, far more than compensated, for the industries which have been damaged by membership of the Community.  There has been a very, very impressive expansion of industry and expansion of exports during the past three or four years which, I think, was due to the membership of the Community.  Certainly the fears that were expressed at the time have not materialised in regard to the adverse effect on industry.</P>
    <P>I think that in addition to these advantages there has been a relatively unimportant balance of payments advantage to this country.  It is a considerable sum but compared to the other advantages it can be regarded as relatively unimportant.  At this stage it is true to say that most of those who disagreed with membership, who expressed fears about membership, are in the position that they would not now go back to advocating that we should never have joined the Community or that we should leave it.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that we must concentrate in particular on informing ourselves in regard to the advantages and policies and so on that are available to us that we have not already taken advantage of, and that we must also inform ourselves about the problems that can be mitigated and anticipated. If greater effort is made in this regard, and there is a good deal of leeway to make up, I am confident that in the next five years membership of the Community will be even more beneficial than it has been during the past five years.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on one of Senator Eoin Ryan's remarks, namely, that many of the people who opposed entry into the EEC would not <Col N="746" /> now in the light of experience oppose our entry.  I think there is a lot in that. I was one who did oppose it but I accept the point of view that it would be difficult to argue about entry now.</P>
      <P>By and large the basis of our opposition to it, my own in particular, was the problem of the regional fund. We have had that in the debate.  Senator Eoin Ryan has acknowledged that the regional fund has not lived up to expectations and the same applies to the social fund.  The reason for it is, I suppose, that the wealthy nations who have not got a regional problem are the ones who have to pay the money. It is going to be much harder to break them down.  However, I am satisfied that the structures are there and they can and should be worked out in a democratic way.  We should keep up the emphasis, as Senator Ryan said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also mentioned in the course of his contribution that in many areas sufficient information was not available. There is one particular area and because it is not one of the economic highlights we do not hear much about it, and that is in the area of the performing rights of artists.  In 1968 the Fianna Fáil Government introduced a Performers' Protection Bill.  As I understand the position, the Irish Federation of Musicians have been trying to get something done in Europe relating to each member country with regard to the prohibition of making records without the consent of performers, the prohibition of making cinematograph films without consent, the prohibition of broadcasting without consent and rebroadcasting performances.  Generally speaking, the tone of the 1968 Act is all right here but there is something happening throughout the Community that is affecting Irish performers.  For example, they do not know what is happening in discotheques and so on. They do not know what is happening. There is no information available.  It does not appear as if anybody is advocating their case.  Since the Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce I wonder if the Minister would think about this, see if anything has been done in this area and if information could be made available on what has happened.  If <Col N="747" /> nothing has been done, can something be done about the technical rights of Irish performers?</P>

      <P>One of the advantages of the Upper House is that we have some time to take the longer view and it has been very interesting listening to various Senators contributing opinions and comments on matters of longer-term policy.  The other recent development of interest is the EEC Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation which has now broken up into sub-committees.  I chair the sub-committee on economic affairs and industry and commerce.  We can now discuss matters of policy that arise as a result of communications from the EEC as well as discuss directives.  At the moment in the sub-committee on economic affairs we are looking at the papers that are coming from the EEC on economic and monetary union and EMU has been reported on in each of these reports before us.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Leader of the House, has made what I think is a major contribution in his summary of the EMU situation and it is very important to hear it debated here in the Upper House.  I suppose what is more important is that I would differ with him.  He said that EMU was a dangerous concept.  I do not think it is unifying concept which may not be immediately achieveable but it is the one that inspires us and provides the vision, the ideas that Schuman had, which led to the notion of a united Europe, and we must keep it before us.  I know the Senator did not mean it was dangerous in itself but I assume he was saying it was dangerous to get too hung-up on it in the short term or to be too worried that the EEC would move too fast and we might find it difficult to cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure about this and I think it must be debated.  Certainly we will discuss it in the joint committee. Personally I think we must distinguish between economic union and monetary union and my own conviction from my fairly superficial understanding of the economic principles involved is that monetary union in itself might have <Col N="748" /> some advantages.  Although there would be a lot of difficulties because of the differences in economic performance in the various countries, nevertheless the existence of a common currency would highlight those differences in the economic performance and might, therefore, encourage and compel the EEC to operate a more realistic regional policy.  It also might get over the problem of the speculation that goes on when currencies drift apart for many of the most complex reasons that nobody can understand except those so-called genii, &ldquo;the gnomes of Zurich&rdquo;.  I am not so sure, but certainly I think we must examine it and our Ministers and our extremely busy senior officials in Departments may unfortunately have to be involved with the shorter-term issues.  Maybe it is something on which this House could contribute.</P>
    <P>For instance, in relation to matters of detail there are a couple of issues I would highlight.  Industrial democracy in the form of worker representation on boards of management or supervisory boards has been before us for some time.  I would think that the EEC is in a position to provide leadership in this move.  Some of the rather strident defensive screeches from the Institute of Directors in the UK is an example of what happens when a particular body or a country does not want to go along with what is recognised as being essentially good in principle.  We are very slow about it.  The trade unions are slow about it. I would be inclined to say that a little bit more daring, more adventure is needed.  I would support the Leas-Chathaoirleach when he said we should take the positive view of these things. We tend to try to find ways of avoiding what the EEC was set up to do.  I am very disappointed with the slow movement there.</P>
    <P>I note from the Tenth Report that £26 million had been approved for the social fund at mid-1977.  It must now be in the order of £30 million but only £11 million has been paid.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we in Ireland have taken full advantage of the social fund.  Certainly we are getting a lot out of it and it has helped to finance the <Col N="749" /> training developments as outlined again by Senator McCartin.  What I am upset about, and I think we should be examining it in terms of the bureaucracy of the EEC, is that the failure to deliver the money is costing us money. I have said that before here.  It does not seem to be improving.  On a recent visit to Brussels I found that in that area staff seem to be changing and at the end of every year when it comes to settling the accounts some new person has to work out again what it is all about.  This might sound strange to be getting into so much detail here.  I go on the one hand from big thoughts about monetary union and then I get down to the nitty-gritty of paying a few bob.  That is the EEC and we must get to know it.  It is not working that well in terms of releasing money from <Col N="750" /> the social fund.  I would refer that matter to the Minister and may be he might be able to get things moving a little faster.</P>
    <P>Talking about not being in a position to take, or not to take advantage of opportunities as raised by Senator Ryan, something that hit me recently again during chats on that visit to Brussels was that in the UK some firms manage to get social fund money for temporary employment subsidy grants so as well as getting those grants they are also able to apply to the EEC for social funds to match them.  It seems to me to be a good trick and one that maybe we might watch.</P>
