      <P>Would Senator Ryan indicate with regard to the Appropriation Bill if he has given any consideration to a suggestion which I heard being made that even if the debate is not finished, the Bill could be formally passed and the debate continued, rather than keep the House sitting unduly long?</P>

      <P>Many people are anxious to come in on the Appropriation Bill and I am sure we would appreciate some opportunity of having the chance to speak on the numerous items in it. This is the one real opportunity we have during the year of speaking on virtually any aspect of Government business, and I am sure that the acting Leader of the House would like to facilitate the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>We propose sitting tomorrow till 5 p.m.  I have every sympathy with Senator Cooney.  Last year we passed the Bill and had the debate some time in January.  I understand that for the month of January 1979 this House will be undergoing repairs and we may not be able to use this <Col N="840" /> chamber until the first week of February.  We will do our best to get the debate finished by tomorrow, and if not we will pass the Bill and adjourn a further debate until we come back, whenever that is.  That is as much as I can say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum on section 1 clearly states that:</P>
      <P>Use of a hall for one or more particular sports or games will not of itself make a premises a community hall.</P>
      <P>It would be most unfair, particularly in rural Ireland where there are a number of halls used for table tennis, badminton, playing cards at night, if such halls were not exempted under the Bill.  There is also the question of farm buildings. Farm buildings prior to the given date in the Bill are exempt.  Does that mean that poultry houses, piggeries and that type of buildings which were built prior to that date or since then are exempt under the particular section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the manifesto no reason was given as far <Col N="841" /> as community halls were concerned but the exemption is provided for in this Bill. The definition of community hall is outlined in section 1.  It is a fairly open interpretation. The one limit is that if a community hall is used as a registered club and is licensed for the sale of alcohol it would not be exempt.  In normal circumstances a community hall is exempt from rates under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to farm buildings the position is that entitlement to rates relief for a farm building will depend on its being described as such in the valuation lists by the Commissioner of Valuation.  The present Bill simply extends existing reliefs for farm buildings to pre-1959 farm buildings and does not define farm buildings in any new way.  It is not for a Minister to say whether certain marginal types of agricultural premises, such as intensive rearing units and hatcheries, should qualify for exemption from rates.  This is a matter for the Commissioner of Valuation, who must ask himself whether these premises are farm, outhouse or office buildings within the meaning of the 1852 Act.  If he decides they are they would not be rated, and if he decides they are not, they will be rated in full.  This is a matter for the Commissioner of Valuation to a great extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position of ball alleys under this Bill?  From my reading of it they are not exempt. They are a form of entertainment and can be compared with community halls. I cannot understand why they are not exempt.  While I understand the position the Minister finds himself in with regard to piggeries and intensive farmyard enterprises.  I would like to hear him say that, from the point of view of intensive farming, he would like to see those buildings exempt, irrespective of what the Valuation Office say.  As he knows many small farmers do not have any way of making a living from the land except by intensive farmyard enterprises. There can be no way that that can be regarded as an industrial enterprise.  As I said, from my reading of the Bill, ball alleys do not seem to be exempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards ball alleys, this is a matter for the local authorities to decide.  If any person disputes the decision of the local authority or the rating authority, it is open for him to appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation. If he is not satisfied, he can appeal to the courts.  I would not like to comment on various intensive farm enterprises because, as I said, this is a matter which is coming up shortly before the courts.</P>

      <P>I have just one more question to the Minister.  A mixed hereditament is defined as a:</P>
      <P>hereditament which consists wholly or partly of a building which is used partly as a dwelling to a significant extent and partly for another or other purposes to such an extent;</P>
      <P>presumably also to a significant extent. The question arises here, who is to determine whether the extent of private user or non-private user is significant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the local authority to decide.  In the event of a dispute it is referred to the District Court.  All appeals are covered in section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 5, to delete lines 40 to 49 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  In any other case a sum equal to such portion of the building valuation as may be appropriated by a rating authority in respect of that part of the hereditament as is used for other than domestic purposes provided that the rated occupier if dissatisfied with such apportionment may not later than one month from the date of such apportionment make application to a justice of the District Court who may thereupon confirm or alter such apportionment as he may think fit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This takes up a point I raised yesterday when speaking on the Second Stage with regard to section 2. This section provides that in the case of a finding by the local authority that there is a significant non-domestic user in regard to what would otherwise be a domestic premises, one-third of the rates shall then not be subject to any allowance. I was making the point to the Minister that to fix an arbitrary proportion of one-third could work an injustice on many people in this position who are using some part of their houses for non-domestic purposes.  I take the point that such a person, if aggrieved, can always appeal to the District Court, but I think this has put a clumsy and expensive procedure in train to solve something which should not require that.  Most people would be guided by the views of the local authority as to the proportion that should be attributed to the non-domestic user.  What we are seeking in the amendment is to exchange the fixed proportion of one-third provided for in the Bill for a discretionary power to the local authority to fix the proportion having <Col N="845" /> regard to the particular case.  That would be altogether more fair and equitable.</P>
      <P>I gave the instance of the different types of user.  You could have a person repairing a few shoes in the front room of his house, perhaps a handicapped person supplementing his income.  You could have a person doing an intensive shoe repair business in his house.  Again you could have a hairdresser accommodating a few neighbours, or a hairdresser doing a fairly intensive business.  You could have a doctor having a surgery in the house, a doctor in the prime of his professional life carrying on a large practice, or a retired doctor seeing a few old friends, so to speak, in the surgery part of his house.  I think it is unfair that the proportion for rating purposes should be one-third.  There should be room for discretion and the discretion should be with the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put down this amendment to give that discretion and provided for an appeal to the District Court if the rated occupier is dissatisfied with the apportionment by the rating authority of the valuation as between the business and domestic user.  The drafting of the amendment was rather rushed and it may not be drafted entirely satisfactorily, but it does enable me to make the point.  I suggest that the arbitary apportionment fixed by the Bill can work fairly in many cases.  I would say in the great majority of cases.  However, it is much better to give a discretion to the local authority.  The rated occupier can go to the county manager and argue his case and they can hammer out an agreed solution.  At the moment it is a third or the District Court.  That is too harsh and is going to work an injustice on many people.  People will be faced with the alternative of accepting the third or going to the District Court, an unknown procedure and place, that people by definition want to keep away from and there are also the financial implications of going to court, particularly when the party on the other side will be the State or local authority.  People do not feel like taking on somebody for whom the court has no financial terrors.  Consequently, most people will accept the one-third apportionment, even though it will <Col N="846" /> be an injustice.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment or at least the spirit of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment envisages two changes from the section as drafted.  First, it would drop the one-third/£18 formula and require an individual apportionment to be made in every case.  Secondly, the amendment would make the rating authority, rather than the Valuation Office, responsible for carrying out the apportionment.  I oppose this amendment on a number of grounds.  The one-third/ £18 formula is useful because it allows relief to be given immediately and without question in every case.  It need not be final if either the rated occupier or the rating authority think it is inappropriate.  They may have the valuation referred to the Valuation Office for a special apportionment.  The Senator will appreciate that there are an estimated 35,000 mixed properties in the country, which is a significant figure.  It would take a considerable time to carry out a special apportionment of all these properties and this could hold up the collection of rates unduly and create a certain amount of uncertainty.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposal to have rating authorities rather than the Valuation Office carry out apportionments, I dealt with that point in my reply to the Second Stage debate.  The Valuation Office are experts in this field and we thought it best to avail of their expertise.  I also mentioned yesterday that in cases where a room in a house is used for a non-domestic purpose, but which is of an insignificant nature, it is open to the council or to the local authority to use their discretion there, having regard to the nature of the business.  They must also bear in mind the reports submitted to them from the local investigation officer. The majority of local authorities will have to act reasonably in this respect.  If I thought otherwise.  I would take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put two points which arise from that?  If, in practice, this turns out to be unsatisfactory and the machinery provided is not working well and there is patent injustice being caused to householders by virtue of this, would the Minister undertake to look at <Col N="847" /> this with a view possibly to amending the Bill to meet any injustices that may manifest themselves in the operation of the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State says it is a question for the Valuation Office to fix the rating and valuation of the premises&mdash;I agree that that is the law&mdash;and that it will be appropriate to give the local authority discretion here. as suggested in the amendment.  In effect, have not the local authorities got the discretion by implication because they will be the people who will decide whether the non-domestic use is significant?  For example, if a hairdresser is carrying on a small business in a room and the local authority decide that it is insignificant and that the total use of the premises is domestic, is there any danger of a conflict between the local authority's decision and the Commissioner of Valuation?  Admittedly he cannot revise the valuation unless it is listed by the local authority for revision, but if there was some way in which he came into the picture, can the Minister see any conflict there?  Will the local authority be deciding what is domestic or what is non-domestic?  For example, washing hair is a domestic procedure.  Does it become non-domestic if you are paid for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That conflict is most unlikely to arise because, as the Senator said, the Valuation Office will not step in unless they are notified by the rating authority or the local authority.  I am certain that the officers in the rates office have acted, and will act, in a reasonable manner in this respect.  We must bear in mind also the fact that the £18 formula worked well last year in connection with the 25 per cent rates remission introduced by the former Government and it has worked reasonably well over the last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section we have the question of community halls. Do I take it from what the Minister said under section 1 that community halls, unless where intoxicating liquor is available, will be exempt from rates?  In most small towns in rural Ireland there are 20 to 30 people who go to the halls at night to play badminton, table tennis or cards.  A big percentage of these halls are controlled by the local community, under the chairmanship of a local clergyman.  Do I take it that this type of hall will be called a community hall and will qualify for the relief of rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for a specific case in the context of this Bill. Generally speaking, community halls are exempt.  As I said previously, if a community hall has a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor it is definitely out.  An occasional licence may not necessarily rule out that premises from derating.  A lot depends on what business is carried on in the community hall.  Playing cards and anything of a community or recreational nature being carried out in a community hall would not mean that it would be rated.  If the owners of a community hall have a grievance they have the right of appeal.</P>

      <P>This is the section of which I expressed grave criticism on Second Stage.  I am unhappy that the Government have not tried to fulfil what I believed was a promise to flatdwellers. I believe the Government promised that the benefit of rates relief would transfer to tenants in private furnished accommodation. The reality is that this is not happening in a large number of cases. This Bill, which is retrospectively providing a legislative framework for the decisions already taken by the Government, does not remedy that situation. That is a major defect in the Bill.  I tried hard last night to devise a possible amendment and I was caught between the difficulty of it being a financial change which would not be admissible or, alternatively, just the sheer difficulty of the wording of section 5 which is obviously catering for a complex situation but is certainly one of the most difficult and complex sections, running over four pages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major problem is that since 1 January it is clear from the survevs carried out by the flatdwellers and local Labour Party branches, that in private furnished rented accommodation&mdash;I am not talking about local authority or fixed rent-controlled accommodation; I am talking about the vulnerable people in flatland in Dublin, particularly people in the Rathmines area and other similar areas&mdash;they are not getting the benefit of the abolition of the rates by having their rents reduced.  I should like to make further reference to the survey carried out by the National Flatdwellers' Association. It is worth looking, in some detail, at the results of that survey in a typical area of the kind we are talking about, in Grove Park, Rathmines.  The <Col N="851" /> following is the quotation from the survey:</P>
    <P>The survey was carried out during the week of February 28 to March 7 1978 in Grove Park, Rathmines, Dublin 6.  Sixty-seven of a total of 99 rated houses in Grove Park are now known to be let in flats.  Full details on rents and conditions were obtained for 51 houses and 469 tenants.  Incomplete information was obtained on a further 16 houses where the surveyors failed to gain access.  In six cases a person believed to be the landlord claimed that the house was not let in flats.  There was one case where the tenant refused to give any information on rents charged, etc. There was nobody at home in nine houses surveyed.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Survey Findings.</P>
    <P>None of the 469 tenants in 51 houses for which complete information is available received rent reductions owing to rates abolition.  According to the Rates Department, the total rates bill for 67 houses was £17,219 in 1977.  The average rates bill was £257 per house.  The average house let in flats in Grove Park contained five flats and nine tenants. Since January 1 1978 each of the 600 tenants in Grove Park is legally entitled to an average rent reduction of £28.50 from 1978 owing to the rates abolition.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the survey was carried on relatively early, in March 1978. There were subsequent small sample surveys done by a number of Labour branches and they came up with the same kind of depressing picture, either that the tenants were not aware at all that they should have been able to avail of a rent reduction or they had moved in May, June or July 1978, and did not know whether the rent they were being offered included the reduction for the abolition of rates and were in no position to bargain.  They just had to accept the accommodation at the rent offered because of the shortage, the imbalance between the flatdwellers and the sellers' market that the landlords are in.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious problem.  If this <Col N="852" /> rates abolition is to have the kind of social benefit that was being argued for it last night it must transfer to those who should be getting the benefit.  It must result in automatic and enforced rent reductions for tenants in the private rented accommodation.  The problem, as I see it, with section 5 is firstly that it is a very elaborate calculation&mdash;I can understand the reasons for that&mdash;but subsection (5) provides:</P>
    <P>An allowance required by this section to be made by a landlord shall be a debt due and owing by the landlord to the tenant concerned, and in default of being made to such tenant by way of set-off or otherwise may be recovered by that tenant or by his personal representative as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Bill is saying: &ldquo;We will leave it up to the tenant&rdquo;.  The tenant has to fight for his rights and has a right of access to the court to pursue his rights.  That is not a just remedy.  As I mentioned last night in another context, we do not have any system of civil legal aid and advice. Therefore, the provision in a Bill of this sort of access to the court to pursue a simple contract debt is like telling the tenants that they can go to the Shelbourne Hotel.  They cannot get access to the court because they cannot get private lawyers to take the case for them because they cannot afford it and they cannot get the free legal aid centres to take the case for them because they are inundated with work.</P>
    <P>In the Coolock Community Law Centre there is a two month waiting list before any case will be taken.  We are in an area where people are not accustomed to going into court to enforce their rights against landlords.  Unfortunately, we do not have the kind of system of legal aid or lawyers particularly concerned to provide that kind of service. This is one of the aspects why tenants have not their rights secured and flatdwellers, particularly in Dublin, are so vulnerable and at risk.  I should like to ask the Minister why he did not seek in this section to secure that the benefit of the rates abolition would be transferred by way of a rent reduction to flatdwellers <Col N="853" /> in private rented accommodation. There are a number of different ways in which he could do it.  He could do it by providing that it would be an offence for a landlord not to pass on the benefit.  The landlord is obliged in part of the section which states:</P>
    <P>Where a landlord receives a notice given to him pursuant to the requirements of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, he shall, not later than ten days after receipt of the notice, give to each tenant of any dwelling of which the hereditament to which the apportioned valuation relates is partly comprised a copy of the notice.</P>
    <P>Is there any enforcement of that?  Is there any sanction to enforce it?  Is there any sanction to enforce the more important thing, that he passes on the benefit of the rates abolition through a reduction of rent to the tenant?  This is an extremely important section.  It is denying the kind of protection to flatdwellers which the abolition of rates should be giving.  If there was a way to amend it at this stage it should be amended and strengthened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this also on Second Stage.  I did not know it was as serious as I have now learned from Senator Robinson who is concerned about the people in the Rathmines area. I was satisfied it was happening because last year these tenants got no benefit. Ninety per cent of the tenants referred to by Senator Robinson are young boys and girls from rural Ireland on a nominal enough income in the city and paying a substantial rent for their flats. There is no point in telling these people that the cost of living has dropped for them by the reduction of rates, because they did not get a reduction of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same situation exists all over not alone for the reasons Senator Robinson outlined, that they cannot go to court. but because they are genuinely afraid to go to court, as I have said on Second Stage.  The landlord will get them out of the house by some means or another and unless the Department of the Environment&mdash;the corporation in this case or the local authorities throughout rural <Col N="854" /> Ireland&mdash;move these people will not get any relief.  I heard recently of landlords maintaining that they are entitled to the rates relief because the cost of repairs, and materials for repairs, and wages, have gone up so much.  They said it was their intention to keep this unless something is done by the Department, or the local authorities.  There is no point in telling these unfortunate people to go to court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that tenants who moved in or became tenants after 1 January 1978 after rates were abolished cannot claim a reduction as rates did not form a cost-element in the letting after 1 January 1978.  Senator Robinson spoke about properties in Dublin embodying multiple lettings.  In most of these cases the valuation of the total property will not have been apportioned into the various units of letting. Section 5 provides the machinery for this and this machinery will come into operation only on the passing of this Bill but its effect will be retrospective, which is a very interesting point.  Senator Robinson mentioned other matters in relation to section 5 but the position is that until such time as the Bill is enacted, including section 5 which is fundamental, it will not be possible for the tenants to take any action whatsoever.  On enactment they will have an action in the courts.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's apprehension about the tenants' problem in getting competent lawyers to handle such cases for them but if the situation is nearly as bad as the Senator suggests I am sure it will not be long until some lawyers become very competent and interested in this field.  I am also sure that if the law is being flouted to the extent the Senator mentioned lawyers will become experts in this field.  I hope that if the position is really serious that will be the case eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section places an obligation on landlords who before 1 January 1978 paid the rates on buildings occupied by their tenants, and who benefit by an allowance granted under the Bill, to make to the tenant a corresponding allowance in the rent.  This section does not apply <Col N="855" /> to small dwellings within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, whether owned privately or by a local authority; these are dealt with by sections 6 and 18. Subsection (1), in addition to the above, specifies the amount of the allowance to which a tenant is entitled.  Two situations are covered in subsection (1).  The first is where the tenant was in occupation immediately before 1 January 1977.  Here the tenant is entitled in 1977 to an allowance equal to that by which landlord benefited as a result of the 25 per cent relief of domestic rates.  For 1978, and subsequent years, he is entitled to four times this allowance.</P>
    <P>The second situation arises where a tenant has come into occupation of a dwelling some time during 1977.  Here no allowance is due to the tenant in 1977, since only the reduced rates were a cost factor in providing the accommodation in that year.  However, for 1978 and subsequent years the tenant is entitled to an allowance equal to the three-quarters rates which influenced his rent for 1977.</P>
    <P>These illustrations assume that the dwelling comprises the whole of the premises or which the rating authority have made a rates allowance.  Where this is not so, subsection (1) allows landlord and tenant to agree on an appropriate portion of the above amounts as the size of the allowance to which the tenant is entitled.  Failing agreement between landlord and tenant on this apportionment, the provisions of subsections (2) to (4) can be availed of.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that where a rented dwelling is not separately valued, the landlord or the tenant concerned may apply to the rating authority to have the valuation apportioned for the purposes of this section.  The rating authority must notify landlord and tenant of their decision and indicate that this may be appealed to the Commissioner of Valuation.  The landlord is then obliged to publicise this to the tenants of other dwellings which may be affected; that is those forming part of the same valuation complex.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Subsection (3) provides for the coming into force of apportionments under subsection (2).  If no appeal is taken, an apportionment becomes operative at the end of the 30 day period within which appeals may be taken.  If an appeal is taken, the apportionment comes into force on the day after the Commissioner's decision or on the appeal being withdrawn.  The coming into force of a decision refers to the stage at which the decision is absolutely final and beyond the reach of any possible revision.  Decisions, when they come into force, will, of course have retrospective effect in 1978 and, where appropriate, 1977.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) spells out the amount of the allowance due to a tenant whose valuation has been apportioned under subsection (2).  The formulae involved apply in exactly the same way to an apportioned valuation as do the rules of subsection (1) to a dwelling which comprises the whole of a valuation.  Subsection (5) provides for the recovery by a tenant from a landlord of any allowance due under this section as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  This section is a long and complex one but that was unavoidable. It is the best solution I could find to the problem.  I shall keep this matter under continuous review and do my best as far as possible within my competence and laws available to me, to make sure that the provisions of section 5 are enforced. If a better way of dealing with this problem is brought to my notice, or if in the immediate future something better comes up, I will deal with the situation in the light of experience gained, and of additional information which may be made available to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply on this point, though I appreciate that he has replied at length but he has not answered my basic criticism about the fundamental flaw of the section.  I asked whether there was any sanction obliging the landlord to give to each tenant in the dwelling the notice relating to the allocation of the apportionment of the rent from the rating authority.  The problem with the section is that there are no sanctions and Dublin Corporation does not have <Col N="857" /> power to prosecute landlords for failure to pass on the benefit of the abolition of rates to the tenants.</P>
      <P>The Minister is admitting that section 5 is an unreal way of trying to seek enforcement and protection of rights. The problem is not that there are not lawyers who might have a knowledge of the field, it is that the whole system militates against a tenant in rented accommodation being able to go into a court to pursue a claim against a landlord.  This is because the amount of the claim will not be large, about £30 or £40 which is not large in terms of claims that come before the courts.  The matter is very important to the kind of person Senator Reynolds was describing, a single person coming from the country on low wages, an elderly person or a single mother with her child.  There are a lot of single mothers in Rathmines in private rented accommodation because they cannot get any other accommodation. This is a significant amount for them but if they go into a solicitor's office, more times than not, the solicitor would know that he would be at a substantial loss in taking the time to issue District Court proceedings, attending the District Court, waiting until the matter came up, pursuing the claim, and then getting back to his office.  He could lose a day's work.  He will not get any substantial fee because it is not a situation where he could charge one.  If the tenant is successful the fees would be borne by the landlord but the solicitor knows how long he could be chasing the landlord for his fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a situation where a tenant dare not bring a landlord to court for the reasons Senator Reynolds mentioned.  It is an unrealistic situation for the vast majority of tenants.  They are already very vulnerable and are afraid that the tenancy could be terminated.  They cannot get other accommodation in the area.  They cannot get Corporation accommodation because there is a long waiting list.  If we had a full-time community law centre in Rathmines, like the Coolock community law centre, only fully funded by the State, if the recommendations of the Pringle Report which were submitted to the Government a <Col N="858" /> year ago today&mdash;this is the anniversary of the submission of the recommendations of that report drawing attention to the urgency of those recommendations&mdash;with lawyers paid by the State, serving the community in flatland, then it might be more equal.  The Minister said he would like suggestions and I should like to know if he would accept an amendment on Report Stage to impose sanctions, not just to say that the landlord shall pass on the relief to the tenant but providing a sanction for failure to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in Rathmines is that a small proportion of these private landlords are registered, and one gets a denial&mdash;it was revealed in the survey of the National Flatdwellers Association&mdash;that the house is let in flats. There is no follow up or monitoring of the situation or authority ensuring that landlords, if they have let the premises in flats, register and pass on this notice of the apportionment of the rates relief to the tenants by a rent reduction.  In this section we are not taking any appropriate steps to see that that would happen.  The suggestion that tenants can pursue his rights in the matter as a simple contract debt in the courts is not a remedy.  As a lawyer I am sorry to say that, but under our present system that is no remedy for those people.  It is not a remedy that they could dare avail of in the majority of cases.  Taking proceedings in a court is not something they feel confident enough to do.  They do not like solicitors or getting involved in courts of law.  What they need is the concern by the State and the Minister to ensure that the benefit of rates abolition is passed on to those who are most vulnerable in circumstances, who are paying very high rents, and are in need of an enforcement by the State of their rights, and not to be told that they can hire a lawyer to take their landlord to court.  They do not do it in other situations where they might.  Tenants have a lot of reasons why they might bring their landlords to court but they do not do it for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>Therefore the framework set up here is legal gobbledegook as it is set out.  It is not achieving what should be the <Col N="859" /> primary objective: the automatic passing on of the relief through abolition of rates to the tenant through rent reduction.  The Minister should consider bringing in an amendment on Report Stage.  Is it possible to build in not only a sanction for failing to do that but a requirement that landlords register for the purposes of availing of the rates relief?  Why is that not part of the structure of this Bill? Would it not be a much better approach to say that any landlord who wished to benefit from the rates relief would have to ensure that he was registered before he could do so?  I realise this would create a further necessity for a very complex apportionment to the tenants &mdash;they could not be the victims of the fact that the landlord had not registered. There should be an obligation to register and there should be an obligation to pass on the benefit of the abolition of rates.</P>
    <P>It is striking to notice that in the survey of the 51 houses in Grove Park there were 469 flatdwellers living in those houses.  That is a fairly typical pattern in these areas.  The rates relief is a very significant factor for the landlords concerned if they are able to absorb it all themselves.  I note that the Minister has made the point that this section will be retrospective to 1 January 1978.  I would like to ask him what active steps his Department will take to ensure that with all the defects, that it results in rent reductions for the tenants who should have been getting this relief since 1 January.  How is it going to be enforced? Who is going to be monitoring it?  Who is going to be spending time ensuring that this is the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those of the Senators who have already spoken on section 5.  While many people have gained considerably from this aspect, nevertheless there are genuine fears as have been expressed by Senator Robinson.  I share those fears to a large degree.  While there are many responsible landlords in the city, there are very many irresponsible landlords who, as Senator Robinson rightly pointed out, are not meeting their obligations for very many reasons.  In relation to allowances paid by landlords to tenants <Col N="860" /> there is no definition of a tenant. What is a tenant?  A landlord, a lawyer and a Minister will have different definitions of a tenant.  The landlord will have his own definition of a tenant.  In very many cases in the first instance there was a friendly approach and then a strong-armed approach to the people who were occupying flats of one type or another.  These happen in many ways. The landlord can say he did not know you were there because someone else had the tenancy.  People have been glad to get accommodation over the years because of the situation in the city.</P>
      <P>We have a housing problem in the city and there are housing problems in every city.  The large-scale demolition in the city brought about immense problems and many houses were turned into flats. As Senator Robinson rightly pointed out, many of the people who turned dwellings into flats and have a large number of people in them have failed to register.  They do not want to know about that aspect.  They want to keep that as quiet as possible.  They do not want to be involved in accountancy. There are people in flats for a considerable period of years who are told by the landlords that they are not tenants at all.  In order to maintain themselves, they sign new tenancy agreements.  They have no lease or agreement because somebody else had it and this is going back over a period of years.  So justice has not been done to a section of people who are in accommodation for a number of years.  They have not got and will not get the rebates that they should have got. They were panicked into situations by a landlord saying he wanted to regularise the situation and give tenants a good deal.  They have signed agreements as and from the period when the landlord has no further responsibility within the legislation for making any sort of rebate to the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These genuine fears must be expressed from all sides of the House in relation to some landlords.  They use every type of device including strong arm tactics with tenants.  These are the facts of life.  These are the facts that the Minister has to grapple with to ensure that justice is done to this section of the community <Col N="861" /> who are the weakest section.  They cannot afford to purchase their own homes and have taken up accommodation. They were glad to get it and get shelter. Now they find themselves in the hands of unscrupulous landlords.  I hope that the Minister will have a look at the situation and see that where a person can prove to the Minister's satisfaction that he has had the tenancy of a house for a period of years he will get the rebate he is entitled to.  The fact that the landlord has used this device, either by strong arm methods or otherwise, or to get tenants to sign new agreements so that he can wash his hands of responsibility, is a very real fear.  It is a fear that must be expressed and one that the Minister must take into consideration.  The Minister must seek to rectify the situation of landlords being unscrupulous towards people that we and the law might regard as tenants but that the landlord does not.  The Minister should define what exactly he means by a tenant because lawyers would have one definition and landlords another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the longest and most complicated section in the Bill.  The nitty-gritty of the section is that to a percentage of our population, not alone in Dublin city but in every town throughout the country, we want to give relief.  If one of these tenants comes to the Minister or to any Member of the Seanad and says: &ldquo;what relief am I going to get out of this&rdquo;?, can any of us, from the Minister down, satisfy himself that these people are going to get the relief that they are entitled to?  We could not live with ourselves if we did not do something to protect this type of person. Some of them are very poor people. There are other tenants who can afford to take action and, I am sure, who will take action if they are not getting the relief that they are entitled to.  But, there are a big number of tenants who are not going to get this relief and every one of us knows that.  There will have to be something done to give the local authority or the corporation the power to protect these people.  These are people who cannot protect themselves.  They have not got the money and they have a <Col N="862" /> fear of going to court.  They know well what is going to happen to the landlord.</P>
      <P>What is a tenant?  To us the definition of a tenant is a person who occupies a house and who pays the rent weekly, monthly or yearly.  Some landlords have no tenant agreements.  Some of them have and they change them periodically. They are not registered anywhere and there is no way that the tenant is going to be protected under this Bill.  The Minister will have to do something to tighten this up.</P>

      <P>The fact that in section 3 provision is made for certain parts of farmland buildings and community halls is an example of discrimination against flatdwellers.  If a way can be found to deal with living off the rates of portions of farmland buildings and so on, there must be a way of dealing with the problem of unscrupulous landlords to make sure that tenants who are, by necessity, forced into situations of signing new agreements and so on have their just rights under the Bill the same as the people in the farming community.</P>

      <P>It is not as simple as all that.  I am not a city dweller but I am aware that in every city and large town in the country there is exploitation of flatdwellers to a large degree.  The practicality of finding satisfactory machinery to remedy that injustice is altogether a different matter.  I do not envy the Minister or his Department in endeavouring to find that remedy.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Robinson, Reynolds and Dowling, but the problem is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Minister take the necessary steps to implement section 5 when we know that there are exploiters?  It is the gombeen position of extracting the maximum amount of rent from these people who are in the vulnerable and unfortunate position that they have to avail of whatever accommodation they can get.  I do not see that the Minister can go very much further than provide the legal provision.  How can the Minister enforce it?  I would be glad if he could offer an explanation as to how he and his Department would enforce that section. <Col N="863" /> It is complex and its implementation is the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We could be talking about, say, 30,000 people who are in a situation where the rent is passed on, but we could be talking about in excess of 100,000 people who still are not getting the benefit and who under this section will not get the benefit for themselves and their families.  That number of people in a family context will not benefit from the passing on of the relief on the abolition of rates.  That is the kind of failure rate that these surveys are showing.  We genuinely do not believe that this section is going to change that position.  This section is leaving tenants and flatdwellers with their common law rights to enforce contract debts in the courts against their landlords.  They will not thank the Minister.  That is not really the kind of enforcement of the situation and monitoring and even policing of the situation that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very serious problem and while I emphasise the Dublin situation I am well aware that there is a problem in other areas where there is a housing shortage.  That shortage is acute in certain parts of the city where people want to remain in that part and have to avail of very expensive private rented accommodation and very bad facilities.  The landlords are not registered or not accountable to anybody.  The number of <Col N="864" /> people involved in that situation is very substantial indeed.  We are rightly concerned about it.  Unfortunately and regrettably this section is not going to improve the matter.  I would ask the Minister to respond to the requests that have been made by a number of Senators to see whether it is possible, at this stage, to introduce an amendment which would ensure enforcement of the apportionment of the rebates or rent relief that is intended.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to have some type of publicity campaign in the simplest possible language, directed to the tenants and the landlords, in which the question of tenancy would be clearly defined so that the people will know exactly what their rights are and will know what rebate they are entitled to.  Would the Minister indicate if he is prepared to formulate some type of publicity scheme from his Department either by newspaper advertisements, television or by some sort of booklet?  People do not know their rights in many cases.</P>

      <P>Senator Dowling referred to rent control generally and the landlord and tenant relationship.  This is really a matter for legislation by the Department of Justice and not for the Department of the Environment. Naturally, I am concerned about the fact that tenants have rights.  It should be seen that they have rights and their rights should be capable of being implemented. Section 5 of this Bill should be given a chance.  Apart from what the Department of Justice are doing in relation to the review of the landlord and tenant <Col N="865" /> relationship, I am also keeping this matter under continuous review having regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson and Senator Dowling suggested that a great number of landlords are bad landlords who wish to deny tenants their legal rights.  I would not like to accept this suggestion in a general manner.</P>

      <P>It can be.  Landlords often provide much needed accommodation and should not be condemned generally as a class.  Only time will tell whether they are guilty of the behaviour referred to by the Senators.  Senator Robinson knows that the field of landlord and tenant relations is, generally speaking, a branch of civil law.  The present section has to be fitted into this context.  If a tenant suffers by any failure of a landlord to comply with the requirements of section 5, he has the right of redress to the courts.  The revision of the legal system or the arrangements for the discharge of justice are matters far outside the scope of this Bill.  It has also been suggested that this section is unreal because people may be slow to go to court.  All sensible people will weigh the trouble involved against the extent of the loss they believe they are suffering.  Time will tell how effective this section is.  It will work very well indeed.  Once it is seen to work tenants will quickly use their own rights under the Bill and a few cases will quickly settle any bad landlords.</P>
      <P>I mentioned quite recently a figure of 230,000 persons who would be tenants in uncontrolled dwellings.  These are persons, not families.  If we take the controlled tenancies out of this, the figure would be far less.  Any determined tenant can pursue the landlord under the provisions of section 5 of this Bill.  Solicitors and lawyers are most understanding and give their time generously in dealing with numerous cases which are not profit-making.</P>

      <P>I think they will put in the same amount of effort into defending the tenants should there be an approach by tenants under section 5 of this Bill.  A certain amount of fear will be instilled in the landlords when the Bill has been enacted.  I am concerned about the position of the tenants in relation to landlords.  The provisions in section 5 of this Bill are the best way to deal with the problem at the moment.  I strongly suggest that section 5 be given a chance to operate.  Senator Robinson mentioned about a survey that was carried out in January or February of this year.</P>

      <P>I might have been misunderstood. I did not indicate that all landlords were bad landlords.  I think I clarified that.  I disagree with the Minister in relation to his opening remarks about this being a matter for the Department of Justice.  The rights under this Bill are the responsibility of the Minister.  In relation to what is available to tenants under this Bill, it is in this Bill that that protection should be included.  I have no objection to giving section 5 a fair chance and a fair trial.  In relation to the rights under the Bill, the Minister specified that the tenant would need to be a person who, for the purpose of this Bill, has been paying rent to a landlord and the landlord has been accepting it over a period.  This would give rights to the individual that he has not got at the moment.  Unless the Minister is going to embark on some type of publicity campaign and is going to keep the suggestions that have been made here in the forefront of his mind, many people are going to suffer under section 5.  They are the people who should be getting the concessions.  Again I ask the Minister if he will embark on a publicity campaign to ensure that people know exactly their rights in the simplest possible terms.</P>

      <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that the survey carried out by the National Flatdwellers Association was carried out in the last week of February and beginning of March and, therefore, early in 1978.  I also referred to some surveys carried out later but on a much smaller scale by branches of the Labour Party.  The Minister is the person with the resources. Will the Minister undertake a full scale survey, particularly in areas like Rathmines where there is a high number of people in private rented accommodation, and will that survey be accompanied by the publicity of their rights that Senator Dowling was referring to? This is the very minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied at all that this section <Col N="868" /> is the way in which the Minister and his Department should approach this problem.  I do not think he can pass it off by saying that tenants' rights are a matter for the Department of Justice.  The rights of benefiting from the abolition of rates are a matter for the Minister and his Department.  They are a matter for this Bill and there should be proper enforcement. But if there is not effective machinery for enforcement in this section then the very least the Minister can do is have a full scale survey of the flatland areas in Dublin.  I would suggest that this would give very good employment, particularly to young people as it would be a way of giving them the experience of carrying out the survey.  The Minister cannot really criticise a survey done by a voluntary body unless he is prepared now to carry out a survey of how the abolition of rates is being or, as many of us would maintain, is not being transferred to the tenants in private accommodation.</P>

I will also arrange for the necessary publicity as regards the provisions of section 5 of this Bill when it is enacted into law.  As regards carrying out a survey, this would be a matter entirely for the rating authorities concerned. I would have no objection to them carrying out such a survey or to any publicity campaign.  I would do anything to help this situation.  These are the proper authorities to carry out the survey, and I shall make suggestions to the local authorities, including the councils and the county borough corporations, on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 7 there are some queries to the Minister.  I presume the allowance under paragraph (i) of subsection (1) (a) is the allowance made where a hereditament is divided as between domestic and non-domestic. The provision is not later than the expiration of the period of two months beginning on the day on which the rate for such year is made.  The day for the making of the rate is often very obscure, and it is not publicly or well known, and the time begins to run from that date.  I wonder is this provision meaningless in effect because, by the time the rates demand note is issued to a person for that person to see whether an allowance is made to him or not, in many cases I suspect the period of two months would have very nearly elapsed anyway.  The rate has to be made in December and the appeal has to be two months from that date, there is no mechanism being built into this to ensure that the rate demand note, which will inform the person whether he will get the allowance or not, will be in his hands before the end of two months.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters involved.  First, there is the determination of the rates which is made by a resolution of the council.  Secondly, there is the making of the rate which is also made by a resolution of the council at a later date when the various rateable properties have been applotted.  Public notice is given before the final step is taken.  I will give an undertaking to circularise councils, local authorities and rating authorities to ensure that maximum publicity is given as regards the making of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how quickly the rating authorities get to work immediately after the rate is struck.  The rates should be determined as early as possible and the final meeting should be held as soon as possible afterwards.  The demand notices should be sent out as soon as possible as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that that is the desirable thing, but I have a recollection of rate demand notes coming out quite late in the spring.  My recollection again is that that would be a considerable time after the rate has been formally made.  The point I was making is that the person who would be adversely affected by not getting an allowance will not know that until the rate demand note is in his hand.  He will not be notified in advance, I take it.  He will only know when he gets his rate demand note and sees there is no allowance or only a partial allowance given.  It is only then he knows he may have to appeal to the District Court, but if more than two months have elapsed from the date of the making of the rate his appeal is lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the rate is not made until the demand note is ready to go out.  There is no significant delay at that stage.  There is sometimes a delay between the date of the actual striking of the rate and the <Col N="872" /> making of the rate.  Ratepayers should get their demand notes as early as possible in the year for numerous reasons.  I intend to circularise the authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister arrange for a circular to direct the authorities?  By statute they have to give formal notice of the making of the rate. That is a formal requirement.  That appears in the small print and nobody looks at it.  It is another official notice.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister arrange for the local authorities this year to change the lay-out of the notice so that it will attract some attention, and incorporate in the notice a statement to the effect that people should look at the rate demand notes to see have they been given the allowances under the Act, and if they have not, inform them of their rights that will be given by section 7.  People should be informed publicly that they have these rights.  Every man is presumed to know the law and that is the way the maxim has to be, but the actuality of it is that the ordinary ratepayer will not know of his right of appeal to the District Court. Will the Minister be able to arrange that a circular will ask local authorities to publicise the effect of this section in a fairly graphic way?</P>

      <P>Section 9 will be making a refund to the local authority in respect of the allowances.  Could the Minister give some indication of the mechanics of making this refund, bearing in mind that some of these allowances may be appealed and the appeals allowed?  Consequently, the final figure may not be obtainable for some time and a substantial amount of money could be withheld or perhaps owing to the local authorities? Could the Minister give us any indication as to the timetable or the mechanics for the payment of this money?

      <P>Generally 100 per cent of the grant will be paid within the year.  There may be a very small carryover for various reasons.  There is a provision in this section also, as the Senator knows, to ensure that a rating authority will not get a grant in respect of a property which would not be rateable, such as premises which are not rented by reason of the fact that the owner could not get a tenant at a suitable rent, and so on.  Normally the rating authority would not be in a position to make rates on those premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit puzzled because the previous section, section 8, provides for the collection of the rates by the rating authority where there is a dispute. This is rather unusual in that, if you like, it is heads I win, tails you lose. Section 8 provides that the rates have to <Col N="874" /> be paid even in a case where there is a dispute and then, if the dispute is resolved in favour of the ratepayer, a refund is made.  There is no provision for interest or anything else to compensate the ratepayer for being out of pocket. wrongly as it might subsequently be held.  This is in contrast to the income tax code if where a person overpays he can have it refunded with interest in respect of the over-payment in certain situations.  That is extremely harsh.  It is a novel section, a totally new principle.</P>

In practice they will be based on the refunds made in the years preceding the year and I would like to inform the Senator and the House that discussions have taken place in practice to ensure that this operates fairly between the rating authorities and my Department. We make sure that there is fair play all around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair play for the Exchequer and fair play for the finances of the local authority, but not fair play for the ratepayer.  He pays the money.  He finds subsequently that he was entitled to a refund. He then gets a refund and that could be quite a time afterwards.  The local authority have his money all the time without interest, in effect money they were never entitled to have.  The Exchequer will not have to give the money back until the end of the year, and the local authority will not have been out of the money.  In other words, the ratepayer will be financing the local authority for the benefit of the Exchequer.  This is wrong.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section of which I was very critical on Second Stage and which the Labour Party believes is an unnecessary and very crude denuding of the autonomy of local authorities.  It will give rise to great bitterness and great resentment, not just from Labour councillors or, indeed.  Opposition councillors but from all councillors in local authorities in a very short time when they realise the very tight and controlled framework within which they must now operate.  The fact that the control will be exercised effectively not by the Minister for the Environment but more by the Minister for Finance and in reality the Department of Finance is a dangerous centralising of fiscal power at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a direction given to a local authority in writing, require the authority, in relation to a local financial year specified in the direction, to limit in such manner as is specified in the direction all or any one or more of the amounts required by section 9 (1) of the Act of 1955 to be shown in the authority's estimate of expenses for the local financial year so specified.  It goes on to say that the Minister may, again with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a direction given in writing to a local authority which is a rating authority, and so given before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses relating to the local financial <Col N="876" /> year specified in the direction, give a direction in relation to the rate in the £ that may be struck.  We have seen an example of just how this is going to operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has issued a written directive and he has directed that the estimates must provide for a maximum of a 10 per cent increase on last year.  This is a much tighter percentage than the local authorities themselves would view as the minimum required to maintain the existing services to the local community. We heard evidence of that on Second Stage from various Senators who are members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Labour group believe that this power of limitation of the Minister by binding directives, which are absolutely binding on the authority and which will affect the rate even if the local authority tried to have a different level, is not necessary.  Because rates have been abolished on private dwellings it is not necessary that there be this centralising of the real financial control and that the parameters be set by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The point was made by one Senator on Second Stage, and I think by the Minister, that there must be concern for those who will continue to pay rates, businesses and those who will be liable for rates.  But this concern would be just as acute, probably more acute, in the mind of the councillors in the local authority.  They are not going to penalise or put an unbearable level of rates on their local business community for the simple and logical reason that they would drive away the local businesses, or put them to the wall and create local redundancies or unemployment.  They would be that much more concerned, one can argue, than the Minister and the Department of Finance would be to see that rates were kept at the lowest level possible that would enable the existing services to the community to be maintained, and perhaps give some possibility of some new initiatives and new services or improvement of services to be offered by the local authority.</P>
    <P>This is very serious and in the Seanad we have an obligation to point out exactly what is happening.  It is a very real <Col N="877" /> change in the power structure at local government level and we should understand that.  It is a very substantial centralising of power to the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;as I read that it means power to the Department of Finance itself&mdash;and it is going to remove from local authorities both the primary power and primary responsibility in assessing what rate will be struck for that area and the kinds of services that will be maintained and the provision of services to the people in that local area.</P>
    <P>It is going against a very deeply felt desire and need of our people.  It is going against the desire for more participation, more influence and decision-making, for more devolved power and responsibility. I do not think it is appreciated yet just what this Bill means for local authority autonomy.  Criticism has been made but I do not think it has really penetrated. The year that this Bill has been going through the Houses of the Oireachtas, because it was ordered to be printed a year ago today, has begun to alert councillors to what is proposed in this section and what will be their reality from now on.  Each year there will be a written directive from the Minister telling them just precisely what they can do.  Surely this undermines totally the most important reserved function of a local authority.  Surely this can create enormous stress and strain in a local authority where there is a global directive from the Minister and where both the population size and the particular needs of a local area may be very different from the policy from the centre of ensuring that there be, as for this coming year, the maximum of a 10 per cent increase on the estimates from the year before.  This kind of centralised control is not a necessary follow-on from the abolition of rates from private dwellings.</P>
    <P>If this section and section 11 were removed from the Bill the situation would be much better for the balance of power between the exercise of functions by the local authorities and the responsibility of the Minister and his Department and the Department of Finance. For years to come this Bill will be looked back on and people will say, &ldquo;We never <Col N="878" /> appreciated just what exactly was being done by this section.  Now we know deeply and seriously that there is no real flexibility, no real autonomy left to local authorities.&rdquo;  This may have a bad effect on elections to local authorities themselves.  I do not know whether it will have penetrated sufficiently to affect the coming local elections in June, but the local elections after that may be substantially affected.  People may not bother to be concerned to put themselves forward and be elected to a local authority which does not have the financial power and basic autonomy which local authorities had and which this section will now deprive them of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important section in the Bill.  The public generally and the Houses of the Oireachtas do not seem to have been sufficiently conscious of what is happening here today.  We do not seem to realise that this section, if passed, brings to an end any effective powers or authority that were held by local elected representatives.  In the past sometimes it was difficult enough to convince people, although we usually had a high percentage poll in local elections, of the importance of local government.  There was always a hard core of people who firmly believed that the retention of the powers at local level to provide essential services, to collect and levy rates for the purposes which we did in the past, was an important power to hold at local authority level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We always felt happy at local authority level that, even if this year we did not raise sufficient rates, we did not provide all the services we would like to, we had the power to do this next year if things improved a little.  Then we could collect more rates, provide more services and if we saw opportunities in the tourist or industrial area, we could provide for whatever services we wished&mdash;a new road here and there, extra amenity schemes and so on.  We can do these things regardless of whether they are sanctioned by the central authority.  We now have the power at local authority level, in the end, to levy whatever amount of rates we wish and to provide whatever services we think are necessary. <Col N="879" /> If this section is passed that power will no longer exist.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for anybody to suggest that the county council, or any local authority, can juggle the figures, change the situation and still do whatever they wish.  The local authorities in every area are tied to the services they are given.  In my county, where valuations are not increasing, last year the local authority required 14 per cent to provide the same services as the previous year.  Another local authority might get that extra 4 per cent through newly valued buildings and factories and so on, but in an area like County Leitrim that is not available and we had to do with 11 per cent.  There was no place we could cut expenditure except off our roads.  We have watched a steady deterioration since in the services we provide.  In addition we had other charges which came in during the year which had to be further deducted.  For instance there were increased wages which were not budgeted for and which had to be further deducted from our road fund.  The result has been a steady deterioration in the services we are giving and the one area where we are forced to put on the pressure is on our roads.  It is obvious 10 per cent is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, through this legislation, have lost whatever effective power they had to influence the development of their areas.  It has been said that this Bill was necessary to protect the interests of other sections.  In the past if any accusation could be levelled against county councils it was that they neglected to give many essential services and sometimes neglected to develop those services because they had too much concern for the people who were obliged to pay rates.  The one thing local authorities, who have always been very close to the people at local level, and were always the first to react to any pressure that came as a result of any injustice, would not do was to penalise any section of ratepayers in order to improve services or provide new ones.  Even if they failed in the past, they always looked to the day when things would improve, perhaps when it would be necessary, and they would have this power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> In the immediate future I do not see what functions local authorities will have.  In this year and next year their sole function will be to supervise spending by the manager in the services they have been given, to supervise the day-to-day running of the county council. Years ago this function was taken over by the county manager.  I never complained about that, although many older councillors did, because I did not see that as a serious taking away of the powers of local authorities.  But this is the end of local government as we know it.  This means that local authorities have no function except to pass pious resolutions which will be sent to the Ministers for Finance and for the Environment and wait for the reply to come back denying them the right to do this, that or the other, and refusing them the money. It does not take into consideration that a 10 per cent limit will be imposed any year, or less if a Minister decides, while no limit can be imposed on the bodies which make demands on the county councils, such as committees of agriculture, drainage boards, the Board of Works charges, all the things which could increase expenditure by 20 to 25 per cent.  This has not been looked at.  It is unfortunate that the Government found themselves in the position where they realised that local authorities were going to run short of cash.</P>
    <P>If the sole purpose of this Bill was to give relief on rates there was no need for this section.  In the past when a Government gave relief on rates they did so, and the local authority struck their rate and passed the demand note on to the Minister for Finance, which could have been done in this case, and allow the local authorities to carry on as they did in the past, and leave them the discretion they enjoyed up to now to levy whatever rate they thought necessary.  With the passing of this Bill local authorities will find themselves in a situation where they are purely bodies who will give advice to the county manager on the day-to-day working of the authority.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the local authorities is to promote the development of their areas and to provide essential services.  That has disappeared.  They <Col N="881" /> will be tied to the services they have been given in the past.  There is no question that any of the services which local authorities provided last year can be eliminated in this year's budget.  We must continue to give these services.  In rural areas where county councils have, over the years, extended their mileage of roads, declared a certain quota of roads public every year, and which demanded increased cost of maintenance, must all stop from now on.  It is futile for county councils to carry on this because there will not be any money to carry out maintenance.</P>
    <P>In most counties in the west there is a credit squeeze at the moment.  It is obvious it is going to continue.  The roads have started to deteriorate and it is obvious in every area that this is happening, particularly in Leitrim where because of inflation any improvement in services must come directly out of our existing valuation.  We do not have new factories and new buildings coming into the rating net.  We will have a steady erosion of the services and facilities we provide and we will not have the power even to put a light outside a church gate or an extension in a town or village.  That is the position we find ourselves in.  It is most regrettable that local authorities do not seem to have noticed what is happening. The public will not be conscious of it until the debate starts leading up to the local elections.  Suddenly they will ask themselves: &ldquo;What is local government about?  They will find that whatever it was about at the last election, there is a lot less involved today.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are talking about power being taken away from Parliament, we should be more careful than ever to ensure that the local community have a say in the running of their own affairs as far as possible.  It was a healthy situation where local authorities had the right to levy whatever rates they thought were necessary and to provide services.  It is said that this Bill is to protect people from their own elected representatives.  It is the most dishonest approach I have ever seen.  It is an effort to compel local authorities to cut back on their services to enable Fianna Fáil to pay for the promises they made in the <Col N="882" /> last elections and people will think it is the local authorities that are at fault, not the Government.  As the election gets under way and as people start to think seriously about the question of local government in the next few months I hope people will be made conscious of all this and that unlike much legislation that has been passed we will in the future see legislation brought in to repeal the wrong that has been done here in the interest of &ldquo;protecting people from their local elected representatives&rdquo;.  It is disgraceful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the debate on this section which is the deathknell of local authorities.  I agree with Senator Robinson when she said the effect may not be found in this year's local elections.  Possibly a number of councillors will say to themselves: &ldquo;We will contest again to see if this is going to be changed.&rdquo;  I cannot see how any of the political parties, or independent candidates, are going to offer themselves as candidates when they discover what little power they will have.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 35 or 36 years and when I came in to the local authority the Managerial Act came in too.  Prior to that local authorities had the powers of appointing staff and allocating houses. This power has all dwindled away from them.  After that they were left with the county managerial system and the only appointment they had left was of rate collectors.  That appointment was taken from them, for good or bad reasons.  The powers of a local authority are continuing to dwindle all the time.  It will be difficult to get young people to offer themselves as candidates in local elections. It may not happen next year but certainly the following local elections will present a desperate situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roads are becoming a serious problem.  We had an experience recently at a county council meeting where one member of the county council, who was a member of the Government party, had a motion to have a few bushes cut along a road so that a bus could collect school children.  The county engineer said he had not the money to do it.  We got 11 <Col N="883" /> per cent last year and we have a shortfall on it.  We are getting 10 per cent this year and we are going to have a greater shortfall.  Because of potholes, it is dangerous to drive a car on some of our roads.</P>
    <P>Our housing programme is going to drop since the Minister's announcement. The officials of the council which I represent had prepared estimates, and their problem is now where are they going to cut back.</P>
    <P>On an earlier section somebody suggested that a survey should be carried out in an area to see what the population living there was.  The Minister suggested that the county council or the corporation might do that.  Senator Dowling who is from Dublin asked a simple question: where are they going to get the money?  That is the situation in every area.  Normally county councils had money for the purchase of sites for advanced factories which they ultimately sold to the IDA.  They will not have any money for this type of development now. The money is not there and the situation is worsening.</P>
    <P>This morning I received a note from the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  With the permission of the Chair I would like to read some of it to the House:</P>
    <P>At the Annual Conference of the Association held in Sligo in September last, eleven Motions (from Tralee, Passage West, Fermoy, Thurles, Nenagh, Enniscorthy, Clonakilty, Athlone, Limerick, Midleton and Cobh) dealing with the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977, were discussed and passed.  The Motions, together with a report on the discussions which took place thereon, have already been submitted to the Minister, but it has decided that this further submission be made by the Executive Committee in support thereof.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Association welcomed the removal of rates from domestic dwellings, etc., the provision of Sections 10, 11 and 13 of the Bill were strongly opposed.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="884" /> SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>(Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct local authorities to limit the amounts to be provided in the estimate of expenses for a particular year, and in the case of rating authorities, in their rate in the £.  It shall be the duty of local authorities to comply with the direction, and if they purport to exceed the limit specified in the Minister's direction the Manager shall be empowered and it shall be his duty to amend the relevant estimate so as to make it consistent with the Minister's direction.)</P>
    <P>The Association is very concerned that, despite assurances given by the Minister, as expressed in his speech at the Conference Dinner last year in the following terms:</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that no diminution of the standing of either county or urban authorities will result from the decision to abolish rates.</P>
    <P>their powers and functions will be seriously reduced.  To take the current year as a guide-line, the Minister has used his powers under the Bill to limit the increase in expenditure and the increase in rates to 11%.  Having regard to the diminishing value of the pound with such control there is little, if any, room for improving existing services not to mind providing for expansion. The limit is especially hard on urban areas where the rate in the £ for 1977 was relatively low.  The impact of the 11% limitation was very serious in the case of a number of Councils owing to there being no limit fixed to the increase in the county demand.  In many instances this increase exceeded 11%. In one case it was as much as 30% and in another 40%.</P>
    <P>That letter came from the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and that is the situation as far as local authorities are concerned, and I think something should be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refute the allegations made, especially by Senator McCartin, in relation to the <Col N="885" /> Government's alleged dishonesty behind the Bill.  I was a member of the Dublin local authority who at one time got a Government guarantee and an assurance that money would be forthcoming, but when the corporation went to the bank they were told that they were not a good risk and would not get any money, despite the guarantee.  Is that the type of dishonesty Senator McCartin refers to?  That was dishonesty all right from a Government point of view in relation to the financing of local authorities in the distant past.  Senator McCartin is a member of the party that was a party to this despicable type of approach to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Having listened to many Senators concerned about a lack of candidates for the local elections, it is a laugh.  We are probably the most underpaid outfit in the country and there is a clamour for every seat in the Seanad.  I do not think there would be any scarcity of candidates for local elections.  Maybe some of the people who go forward will do a better job than we are doing on the local authorities.  So far as local representatives are concerned, and the striking of the rate, this has been a rat race over the years.  We have seen pressure groups, packed galleries and protest meetings of all types.  Every device was used to reduce the rates.  At rates meetings the aim always was that there should be a reduction in the rates and every gimmick was thought up to apply pressures to attain that end.  Now members of councils and local authorities can plan in advance and be assured that there will be an increase in next year's rates to meet the developing situation.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>Any rate which is so required to be determined shall not exceed a limit specified in the direction...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were Dublin City Manager I would order a complete revaluation of Dublin City so that every house that has installed central heating would have the rateable valuation increased and every dwelling that had structural alterations carried out would have the rateable valuation increased.  We would get a very substantial increase in this way <Col N="886" /> because the amount given by the Minister is based on the rateable valuation. I take it that the increase of 10 per cent is in relation to the rate struck on the pound.  With a greater rateable valuation we would get substantially more.</P>
    <P>The ever changing situation of local politics, local authority problems and local authority involvment, brings about new changes, new demands and new thinking in relation to local authority financing.  A positive step has been taken and I do not think it should be condemned as being dishonest because when we examine the situation after a reasonable period we will see how effective the change has been.  As a member of a local authority I cannot see any great difference in my position before and after the restrictions that have been mentioned come about.  One function which is being taken from the local authorities is the striking of the rates.</P>
    <P>This gives the council more time to devote their attention to the real problems which are often overlooked and set aside because of pressures that have been applied by the various protest pressure groups.  Nobody want to pay rates.  There is a big change taking place, particularly in cities like Dublin.  Most of our development is in another local authority area.  This is a completely new ball game.  We build industrial estates in another local authority area.  We house our people in another local authority area.  These new problems must be met with new measures, thoughts and initiatives. Any changes that take place must be discussed in the light of the every evolving situation that is creating new problems, ensuring the council at the same time that they can plan for the future, is something they could not do in the past.</P>

      <P>It is rather extraordinary that we had a Senator from the <Col N="887" /> other side attacking this Bill in the manner she did.  That Senator may be an expert in many fields but she is not an expert in local government.  As a person who has lived a long time with local government, I could not see our Minister bringing in a section that would damage or take away the powers of our local representatives.  It would be political suicide for any politician&mdash;and I think our Ministers are politicians&mdash;to underestimate the power of county councillors, members of corporations, urban councillors or town commissioners.  That is the reason why section 10 is not as wrong as we are told and the concern of the other side of the House is political.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a local committee and I learned from a man the other day, when we were discussing this Bill, that he is a member of 11 committees.  He has no notion of coming up here, or to the other House but he is absolutely committed to the local community.  That is the main role of local representatives. It is not power, it is that they serve.  This is the way I see them.  I am speaking from the experience of having worked with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the many Senators who spoke on section 10, I should like to mention some of the considerations which justify the powers of control which the Minister is now taking under it in relation to local authority rate poundages.  Before domestic derating the State's contribution to the total rates income of local authorities was about 25 per cent.  That was through the agricultural grant only.  With full derating of domestic and certain other property Exchequer participation in the total amount levied through the rating system has increased to over 60 per cent.  This represented a liability of nearly £120 million in 1978 and will cost even more in the coming year.  I estimate that figure to be approximately £133 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If no limit applied to rate poundages of local authorities the Exchequer would have to meet, without question, through the domestic rate grant and the agricultural grant any demand which <Col N="888" /> local authorities individually or collectively choose to formulate.  This would not be a fair situation.  Local authorities' services would be alone in having an unquestioned and unlimited claim on Exchequer resources.  Other services, equally vital to the country's well-being, would not have this privilege.  A major purpose of the limit on rate poundages is to ensure a fair alignment of local government needs with those of other sectors. The limit affords protection in two other ways.  It protects remaining ratepayers against excessive increases in rates.  This must be clearly acknowledged by everybody.  It also protects responsible local authorities from the pressure which would be caused if only a few authorities began to resort to unreasonable rate increases in a free for all situation.  In the context of derating of domestic dwellings and other hereditaments we could have a free for all situation.</P>
    <P>Some Senators claim that costs such as wages and materials have outstripped the 11 per cent increase in rate poundages allowed for 1978.  I do not accept this claim.  The overall rate of price increases for 1978 will work out well below the 11 per cent allowed in rate poundage increases.  Secondly, the average income increase which local authorities derive from rates and rate-linked State grants in 1978 will work out at considerably more than 11 per cent. As a matter of fact, 14 per cent would be more appropriate in the case of the vast majority of rating authorities.  In all local authorities had a record amount of £550 million available to them in 1978 for their current and capital services, an increase of more than £100 million on the previous year.  The 11 per cent formula gave them a boost of £25 million in 1977 income from rates and from rates-linked State grants.</P>
    <P>Far from being short money in 1978 local authorities had £100 million more than in 1977 between current and capital moneys.  I could list approximately 16 rating authorities who did not need the full 11 per cent allowable in 1978.</P>
    <P>Nobody is better qualified than local councillors to know the needs of their own area.  That is true in one way but the reality of the situation is that their <Col N="889" /> knowledge, efforts and plans must fit in broadly with national plans and policies and finances in a reasonable way.  The upper limit on rates increases achieves this balance.  Within the ceiling of a fixed rate increase local councils will still have full discretion to decide their programmes and priorities.  That is as it should be.  Many councils will be in a position, as a result of increasing valuations in their districts, to realise an increase of up to 17 per cent.  In the case of Dublin Corporation the 10 per cent increase, if fully availed of, will yield an increase of at least 15 per cent, and probably more, in income from rates and from the domestic rate grant.</P>
    <P>The increase in the city manager's estimate for Dublin represents but a mere fraction this year over and above last year's, taking into account the 10 per cent increase allowable this year.  Allegations have been made that the powers of members of the local authorities are being denuded and that local government autonomy has now gone forever. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I stated previously it is clear, if any Member wishes to study the booklet published by the Department of Local Government&mdash;now the Department of the Environment&mdash;in 1975 regarding the reserved functions of local authorities, that no real functions are being taken away from elected members under this Bill.  I have been associated with local authority finance far longer than I would like to remember, since 1952, and as far as I can recall there was always a situation whereby councillors fought with each other to see who would gain most credit in the eyes of the public and the local press, for reducing the rate in the pound.</P>

      <P>The only time I ever heard of criticism about a fixed level of increase in one year over another was during the past twelve months.  In previous years the cry went out from all councillors: &ldquo;We are the great defenders of the ratepayers and we must cut down <Col N="890" /> the rate, we must keep it down to this very minimum.&rdquo;  That is what I always heard from public representatives.  This is the first year we hear of councillors fighting to increase the rates.  In previous years the fight was the other way, to cut down the rates in the pound.  The elected representatives were then seen to be the great defenders of the ratepayers.  It is amazing that when domestic dwellings and other properties are derated we have responsible people saying that the system we want to work is wrong and that they are fighting for a substantial increase in rates, that they are fighting against the small businessman, against the farmer, against the PAYE worker and the ordinary taxpayer.  That is a very shoddy and inexperienced view on the part of the Opposition, to say the very least of it.</P>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that this section is necessary.  It is of vital importance and fundamental to the Bill.  If local authorities now or in the future are to plan and programme their works in the same way that the Government must do so they must face up to the reality of the situation.  We must remember that there is a limit to what the taxpayer can pay.  There is also a limit as to what ratepayers can pay.  We must bear all these things in mind in considering section 10.</P>

      <P>In this discussion on section 10 I have never heard so many red herrings introduced into a subject which is crystal clear, the future role and powers of local authorities.  We are discussing a change from a situation in which those local authorities had power to levy and collect rates to carry out whatever developments they thought necessary within the area of their jurisdiction.  We are talking about a situation where that power has been taken away.  It has been represented on the other side of the House that this was necessary by some means in order to relieve domestic ratepayers of the obligation to pay rates.  This section has nothing to do with that.  In the past it was quite simple for any Government to give relief of rates to any section, as they did for farmers.  The county council prepared its estimates, struck its rate and <Col N="891" /> gave the demand note to the county manager.</P>
      <P>The central authority are aware, of course, that they have created a situation in which county councils will find themselves in an impossible position. The central authority promised to make money available to relieve domestic ratepayers and the implication was that they would find the money by some other means.  The other means by which they will get the money is by reducing the level of services available in the counties.  This argument has developed into a debate between people elected at central level&mdash;those in the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;and local elected representatives. What we are saying here is that we have been forced to introduce legislation to curb the powers of local authorities because they cannot be trusted.  We have been told by elected representatives that county councillors were subject to pressures, and pressure groups, deputations and so on.  Have we not seen that kind of pressure being brought to bear on every elected representative in this House and the other House?  Do these pressures not exist in Dublin just as well as they do in Carrick-on-Shannon, in Galway, Castlebar or any other area where responsibility is discharged and decisions made.  That is a ridiculous argument to make.  The argument being made is that one cannot trust elected representatives of the people; that one can trust them when they are in Dublin but one cannot trust them in their local community.  On the other hand, the Minister said that in the past councillors sought to keep down the rate.  That is the very argument I made.  Is that not a good reason for eliminating this section from the Bill?  Is that not a good reason to leave the county councillors to the electorate to decide whether they are discharging their responsibilities or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this section was to cloud the issue so that the services of local authorities would be cut down to pay for the promises the Government made to get into office.  I admit that some local authorities found themselves in a better position than others when the 10 per cent was imposed.  Some local <Col N="892" /> authorities had an increase in the rateable valuations in their counties.  In County Leitrim in the nine years 1968 to 1977, we had only an increase from £150,000 to £158,000 in the gross valuation.  From 1976 to 1977 we had just less than £2,000 of an increase in the gross valuation in our county.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the situation that exists whereby the counties in the west who have a slow economic growth, where not so much industrial development has taken place, where not too many new buildings are being valued, find themselves totally dependent on the 10 per cent the Minister will allow us to raise.  In other countries&mdash;and I believe the Netherlands is one case&mdash;where central authority has decided to finance local authorities they made allowances for imbalances between the regions for these different situations.</P>
    <P>With his majority in the other House, and his feeling of security in power for the moment, I know the Minister is not prepared to change this Bill, the most important piece of legislation introduced in the life of this Government.  It is important in that it changes the whole system of local authority.  It eliminates the situation of the elected representatives having any effective power or control, any ability to carry out any development, to offer any increased services or do anything to change the course of development in their local areas.  The Bill is important from that point of view.  It has not anything to do with relief in rates.  I would ask the Minister to take into consideration&mdash;I know he has his mind made up about the other situation&mdash;the position in the western counties where we have not an increase in valuations or as many farmers coming into the net.  We know these farmers are being brought into the net in other counties where the valuations are bigger.  They are intended by some means, of course, to make up and pay for the relief on domestic rates.  We could say that farmers who are finding it difficult enough with valuations of £55 and over are being forced to pay to relieve rates on the millionaires houses in the suburbs in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take into consideration <Col N="893" /> the special position of counties like Leitrim where we will have a definite cut back in the level of services we have been giving.  We are forced each year to take on more roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I should like to ask a question.  How much of an increase in rates was there in County Leitrim from 1972 to 1978?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a case for the counties in the west and I want the Minister to take those into consideration. The Minister can quote figures and, of course, with the rate of inflation we have been having over the years, figures are always impressive but when one converts the services we have been giving over the years one will find a decrease in the actual amount of services we have given in our county.  The same applies to many counties in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I believed that the three main political parties would be leaning towards the idea of participation in industrial democracy and so on in the sense of involving people.  The section seems to be contrary to that concept.  It seems to be a contradiction of what we all believe should be the situation, that there should be a hiving off of certain responsibilities and more autonomy for local bodies.  As a result of the Minister taking so much control and power in this situation he must consider a lot of things.  Eventually local government will have to involved in the creation of jobs, they will have to be involved in the war on waste and will have to deal with the question of free collective bargaining because we do not have a national pay agreement.  Where will the money come from?  Who will decide the wages?  Will it be decided by ministerial order that they cannot meet their commitments to pay industrial workers, road workers or those who cut and trim hedges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section means that the normal careful, conscious decisions made at local government level before will have to be curtailed.  They will be dealt with in <Col N="894" /> accordance with the arbitrary wish of the Minister who makes a decision to introduce a limit.  Therefore, no initiatives can be taken.</P>
    <P>In the European Community we are struggling to hold on to our own self-sufficiency and trying to avoid as much as we can letting people dictate to us, but at home where it is possible for us to remove that tone of dictatorship or taking of arbitrary decisions we are not adopting the proper procedures.  This will have a terrible effect on people.  In anything relating to local government we should be considering decentralisation to the maximum.  In the long run cooperatives have to go to the local council to see what they can get.  When we start to take on a greater role at central authority it is not compatible with the other things we say are good for the nation such as a greater involvement by people and the democratisation of institutions. We cannot, on the one hand, say we are going to make sure a certain institution is democratised to the fullest extent by putting people on the board of State companies and so on and encouraging this in the private sector and then pass a provision like section 10.  In an area where we can let go a little and create a little extra local democracy that is needed to meet the various demands on local government we are taking it entirely onto ourselves by saying: &ldquo;Thus far and no further.&rdquo;  In other words, everybody else can expand, develop and grow but local authorities must only grow in accordance with the wishes of the Minister.  That does not seem to be very democratic.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what was said in the past or who falsified something or might have misled people.  That is irrelevant. The fact is that this section threatens democracy in the sense that we know it.  There is a concept here that there should be a hiving off from the central position to a more participating way by all the community.  Frankly, I cannot see why it is necessary that the section should remain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking because I was prodded to do so.  A Senator from the west can hardly sit in the House and accept criticism of this <Col N="895" /> Bill.  The very foundations of survival in the west are at stake in the introduction of this Bill.  I take exception to Senator McCartin opposing the Bill in so far as Leitrim is the one county that must be developed.  The day we break from relating the development in County Leitrim to what we can pay in the £ in rates will be a great day for County Leitrim.  I think Senator McCartin should have accepted this Bill as a good measure for County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>All of us realise that any county in the west that is under-developed with regard to sewerage, housing, forestry, employment and tourism was depending on the amount in the £ that they would get. People in County Leitrim have had a difficult period over the last 50 years. Nobody knows that better than Senator McCartin and I think the Senator is talking with his tongue in his cheek.  This Bill certainly benefits County Leitrim, County Donegal and the west.  The move away from relating the input from the ratepayers is a basic and fundamental one that is very necessary if we are serious about regional development and want to partake of regional development from the European fund.  The same can be said of the west.  This is a major step. It gives parity and allows development in counties where, in fact, that development is not related to what they contribute towards the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators on the opposite side of the House should bear in mind that in opposing section 10 we are not opposing the Bill.  This Bill can exist quite fully without section 10.  The Minister made the comment that there were a number of instances where the 11 per cent ceiling last year was not needed by many local authorities.  If it were not needed that would be justification for the continuation of the old system.  In other words, local authorities could be dependent on the use of good judgment to determine the proper priority of spending.  Therefore, if the 11 per cent ceiling was not required in a number of instances, that is one answer to the contention that the Minister is really implying in the section that local authorities are not to be trusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Down through the years there have been many instances in local authority expenditure where 100 per cent subvention has existed.  Yet, we have not seen in those cases that the sky was the limit. Local authorities will always be dependent on good judgment and a sense of responsibility to determine the figure which would warrant 100 per cent subvention. That is another reason why what the Minister is contending, that local authorities cannot be trusted, has absolutely no foundation.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of a percentage ceiling generally has disadvantages.  It places some authorities at a considerable disadvantage towards others.  There is no local authority which can say: &ldquo;We have the same level of expenditure, the same level of requirements in local authority services, as any other local authority.&rdquo;  They all have different demands, different needs and different services. Therefore, they should all be treated in a separate fashion.  To impose a general ceiling is condemning what could be the most efficient local authority.</P>
    <P>Since this section refers to section 9 of the City and County Management Act, 1955 it will do us no harm to go briefly over that section 9 and see that what stood for many years is now being uprooted by the Minister in section 10 and the effects it will have on local authorities in striking the rate.  Section 9 (1) states:</P>
    <P>...there shall be prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 9 of the 1955 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 of the 1955 Act which is referred to in section 10 of the existing Act.  Section 9 (1) of the City and County Management Act, 1955 states:</P>
      <P>...there shall be prepared ... an estimate showing the amount estimated as necessary to meet the expenses and provide for the liabilities and requirements of a local authority...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> The important word there is &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. Who is to determine now what is the necessary level of expenditure for any local authority?  The county manager must act, if he is drawing up the estimate, under the dictates of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment.  Are they, therefore, to determine what is the necessary level of expenditure rather than the county manager or is it to be local council estimates committees?  In other words, are they no longer to be given the authority to determine what is the necessary level of expenditure to meet their expenses?  I would like the Minister to answer that question.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The manager shall...furnish such information, assistance and advice to the committee as is required by them in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>What will be the situation in future?  I have seen both in 1977 and this year where the Minister sent a directive to a county manager as a result of which the county manager is most reluctant to give any information or advice, because he is not in a position to do so, which will enable the councillors to compare what his estimate for the ensuing year will be with the outgoing expenditure for the current year.  The county managers are naturally reluctant to prepare and submit to the countil any figures which will show a balance with what they themselves estimate as being the requirements to meet the ongoing expenditures and the ensuing year's expenditures also.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Where the manager considers that an estimate of expenses...would, if adopted, seriously prejudice the efficient or economical performance of the functions of the local authority, the manager shall prepare a separate report specifying the provision which, in his opinion, is necessary.</P>
    <P>That was the greatest disregard of all that the manager and the Department had to the proper functioning of any local authority.  That section saw that the temptation confronting councillors in all local authorities was to underestimate <Col N="898" /> rather than to strike a rate which would present an increase which they felt would be prejudicial to their own reelection chances.  Where does section 10 leave that subsection (3) of the 1955 Act?  Will we ever again have a county manager who will come and say the rate that is being struck is not adequate? These are instances which, comparing section 9 of the 1955 Act and this section 10, highlight what has been done. The Minister no longer trusts county councillors.  The fact that the greater number of county councillors are members of the Minister's own party leaves something to be answered.  I wonder if he has any feedback from them as to whether they believe they can be trusted or not trusted to strike a reasonable rate?</P>

      <P>I want to support the comments made by Senator McGowan.  The Bill is a very good one. Section 10 has been challenged now, as have other sections.  The Bill is to the advantage and development of local government generally and particularly local government in the west.  The question has been asked by the previous speaker whether the Minister trusts local representatives.  That is an unreasonable question.  Any Minister in any Government would trust local representatives, because it is through local governments that legislation is often channelled to the central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a local representative.  I am a newcomer to this House to all intents and purposes.  I am here since 1977.  A greater allocation of finance has now been made available to the two counties in the constituency which I represent&mdash;Roscommon and Leitrim.  A greater financial allocation has been made available by the Department in question than has ever been made before.  There are in train, at the moment, schemes to the extent of £2 million for sewerage and other ancillary schemes in Roscommon.  I have never <Col N="899" /> known of any such substantial allocation of finance in my time in Roscommon.  It is the greatest allocation of financial commitment to the administration of local government affairs that I have known in my time.  I want to compliment the Minister and the Department.</P>

      <P>They want the rates reintroduced.  There are no half measures in this situation.  If they want the rates reintroduced they should come forward and say so.  Having listened to the comments and, indeed, the comments of the other councillors, that is what Fine Gael and Labour want to see happening at the moment.  They want to see the reintroduction of rates and, if so, put it to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an uncalled for statement.  We are discussing this section. This section means simply, and the Minister has admitted it, that there are 16 rating authorities in the country that can carry on with the 11 per cent. Naturally for the basis of the Minister's argument he has 16 picked out.  They can carry on for many reasons: because of increased valuations, and increased development within the area.  I do not know how many are left, but whatever number is left must not be able to carry on with the 11 per cent.  It is that simple. That is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can mention some of the places that I know of in County Leitrim, <Col N="900" /> County Roscommon, County Mayo, I would not be too sure about County Sligo but, whatever the difference is, the Minister must admit that the balance cannot carry on with 11 per cent.  As the Minister has said, no member of any local authority wants to increase rates any further than it will take to keep the services going and to keep the area serviced with development for advance factories with infrastructure and everything else you can think of.  It is that simple, and there is no point in Senator Dowling getting up and trying to pull a red herring across the trail because a red herring is not there.  I say to the Minister there may be an easier way.  It can be solved by giving an extra grant to these areas based on last year's figure.  I am sure County Kerry is in the very same situation. I do not know, but I am sure it is.</P>
    <P>There are counties and areas finding it utterly impossible to carry on.  Some have increased staff over the past year on the suggestion of the Minister's Department.  They find, within that area, that there is less work to be done but possibly, more money to be spent.  This is the Minister's argument.  He talks in terms of a £500 million increase but he forgets the calculation of inflation.  It means, with the extra staff in the county, there is less work to be done and I suggest something should be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 10 the Minister is quite capable of making a just allocation to all local authorities. Senator Reynolds mentioned the fact that the Minister might be able to make further grants available to local authorities.  In the 1978 allocation to Leitrim County Council, the Minister did that because he increased one very important scheme, the local improvement scheme, from £108,000 in the previous year to £175,000 in 1978.  With regard to remarks made previously on section 10, as a member of Leitrim County Council I do not think we got an allocation when we, as a local authority, were responsible for striking a rate of more than 10 per cent for either of the two years in which we struck the rate. Senator Reynolds and Senator McCartin will bear me out in that because, <Col N="901" /> as far as I remember, the last rates that Leitrim County Council struck was, in fact, an increase of something like 8 per cent on the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intervening because of Senator Dowling's contribution and the fact that he anticipated that there might be a vote and that some of us might be voting in a particular way.  If we did, he would interpret a vote of ours as being in favour of the restoration of rates.  I have no doubt that if a vote is taken on this section, I will vote in a particular way.  The main reason I will be doing that is to preserve what remaining power rests with local authorities and which is likely to be removed with the passing of this section in the Bill.  Some Senators said earlier that the Minister could have his Bill but that it was not essential that he should have this section in it.  The Minister earlier in the debate said that the main reason was to ensure that unreasonable demands would not be made by members of local authorities now.  Local authorities and their members have acted responsibly over the years and they have rendered an excellent service.  They have always displayed good judgment.  The Minister can have the safeguards he is seeking by some means other than ensuring that he is reducing the remaining authority of members of the local councils.</P>
      <P>I am, in common with many of the members of the Seanad, a member of a local authority.  As I said, I know they have at all times acted responsibly in this and in any other field.  I feel that the Minister could find the safeguards he is seeking without, at the same time, diminishing or taking away another part of their authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a booklet published by the Department of Local Government in 1975 which outlined the authority that members of local councils had.  Some of us are aware that where members of a local authority tried to make an issue all the booklet indicated was their power, and if a county manager indicated that that was not the case there was a High Court case to back him on it.  Gradually, over the years, the power and authority of local <Col N="902" /> councillors steadily diminished, and that is a regrettable situation.  It happened because people who could have opposed it and expressed reservations when these removals of powers were taking place failed to do so.  The power to raise and to levy rates is the last remaining major function that is available to members of local authorities.  Do we take it now that we are reducing them to the level of a talking shop?  I have always regarded them as people of good judgment and common sense.  An example of that is the fact that I, and the majority of my colleagues, are here with their support. However, it is not necessary for the Minister to press on to have that section included.  He can get the safeguards he requires without eroding further the authority of local representatives.  If the Minister insists, I will oppose him and vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene because of statements made on the other side of the House.  No doubt it is one of the democratic rights of Opposition Senators to put forward a defence in their own right.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned by Senator Reynolds that only 16 local authorities failed to reach the maximum of 11 per cent.  That is not quite correct.  Sixteen local authorities did not reach the 11 per cent target but the other authorities worked within the 11 per cent last year. It is my experience that estimates presented by county managers have from time to time been padded.  This will eliminate any padding of estimates in the future.  As a result of that padding, a sizeable amount of the ratepayers' money went into what is known as a capital reserve.  I am sure most councillors here never knew in their own county that there was such a package known as the capital reserves sources of that particular local authority.  I can assure you, we in Mayo did not know it was there until we got a bit longer in the tooth and when we delved into the financial assets of our local authority we found that. This will limit the padding of estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quite frankly said that we had, last year, £100 million of an increase in our expenditure.  Nobody <Col N="903" /> denied the services.  There is no need for panic about the devolution of the county council or local authorities.  There is no way that is going to happen.  As the Minister said, I would not like to see the day when the grass roots of a local authority would not have a say in the running of their own county.  I do not think that is on the cards.  It was never envisaged.</P>

      <P>Senator McCartin spoke about pressures on public representatives.  The point about section 10 is that much of the pressure on local councillors will be coming, from now on, from people who are not liable for rates. This is one of the principal reasons why protection must be given under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do trust them. Senator McCartin and others who complained about section 10 really want the upper limit of 11 per cent or 10 per cent for 1979 increased.  In the western counties, the agricultural grant fully relieves almost 100 per cent of farmers.  This helps to redress the balance against the counties where farms are bigger.  I never suggested that councillors could not be trusted.  They are rightly concerned with the needs of their own areas.  The Minister's directive on the upper limit enables a balance to be struck between local and central needs and resources. The provision of the main capital services on which development depends does not directly affect rates.  These are largely capital services such as water, sewerage schemes and housing schemes. Only the unsubsidised part of the loan charges falls on the rates.  The principal road works are financed now by way of direct State grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Markey stated that the local authorities did not overdo it in the past. The fact is, of course, that the amounts available to local authorities are now fixed. Local authorities are free to spend the amount allocated.  Before now, they had to comply with certain requirements within the Public Bodies Order. <Col N="904" /> There is no evidence available to me or my Department that local authorities could not carry on within the limit of 11 per cent which was fixed for 1978.  I am confident that local authorities will be able to carry on their programme for 1979 within the context of the 10 per cent limit imposed on them.  It is, of course, entirely a matter for the elected members of the local authority to decide on their priorities.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest a report in the <i>Evening Press</i> dated 12 November 1978 where it was stated that Dublin County Council expenditure for 1979 will remain within the Government's rate increase limit of 10 per cent.  The manager emphasised that no shortfall in public services for the county is anticipated.  He stated that the local authority will be taking on additional employees to cater for increased activity in various departments as a result of the 10 per cent increase.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator's high esteem for local authorities and councillors.  I also believe they will act responsibly and settle their budgets within the limit.  The limits fixed are a result of budgetary considerations by the Government, and responsible local authorities will recognise this and act accordingly.  Senator Howard stated that no real powers should be taken away from the local authorities.  No real powers are being taken away from the elected members of local authorities.</P>

      <P>It is clear from an examination of that document that 99.9 per cent of the reserved functions of members of local authorities still remain with them, and will remain with them after the passing of this Bill.  Under the terms of section 10, elected members of local authorities are free to select their own priorities and to direct their managers as to how the money should be spent.  This is clear in section 10.  Section 10 of the Bill is fundamental, and if Senators vote against section 10 they are voting against the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and other property.

      <P>Where the manager considers that an estimate of expenses prepared by the estimates committee of a local authority (whether by reference to the whole of the estimate or to any part or parts thereof) would, if adopted, seriously prejudice the efficient or economical performance of the functions of the local authority, the manager shall prepare a separate report specifying the provision which in his opinion is necessary.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This can be a rather dangerous section because it actually means that, if a local authority require money, say, in the month of June or July after the estimates are over, for some emergency or some development, for example, if a factory was coming to an area and money was required for development, or for some emergency such as flooding, there is no way they can get the money without getting the sanction of the Minister.  This is interference again by the Minister.  There is a very big danger that the county manager and his officials could over-estimate in some part of the estimate in order to provide himself with a surplus of money which would be transferred, say, from roads or general purposes into another section.  When I say that, I do not mean there is anything wrong with it, but the danger is that, in the event of an emergency, there is no way that the county council can get the money.  They would have power to transfer money from one area to another, say from general purposes to roads, and for that reason it is a rather dangerous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is necessary because without it local authorities could circumvent the controls provided by section 10 simply by authorising excess expenditure as the year went on. This would result in commitments building up for the following year's rate, related not to planned expenditure for that year but to money already spent in the previous year.  If this were to happen in an uncontrolled way, limitation of rate poundages by the Minister would be made particularly difficult and invidious as regards these local authorities who would not have resorted to the excess expenditure. A major purpose of this section is to ensure a fair and orderly use of the power to incur excess expenditure as between all local authorities.  This is necessary to avoid any unfair preemption of rating resources by local <Col N="908" /> authorities who show less restraint than others in resorting to excess expenditure.</P>
      <P>As a matter of policy I would hope to be able to rely mainly on general sanctions under this section.  For instance in the present year I issued a general authorisation of any excess expenditure financed from increased income or from savings on other programmes.  Any reasonable proposal submitted to my Department will be dealt with as a matter of urgency, because increased expenditure under section 11 of the 1955 Act was always regarded as a serious situation. In the cases outlined by Senator Reynolds, in the case of an industry, for example, or an emergency situation, I would envisage that a sanction under this section could be conveyed in advance by phone if there were postal delays.  I see nothing at all exceptional or unusual about this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unusual about it.  There seems to be some fear in the Minister's mind that local authorities will go on a spending spree.  I would love if I could get that out of his mind and out of the minds of the officials of his Department. Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is easy enough for the Minister to tell us that if you have an emergency or if something happens you should get in touch with his Department of Finance and you will get it.  I do not want to cast any reflection on the Department of the Environment or any other Department, but when it comes from the Department of the Environment it will have to be cleared by the Department of Finance.  If an industry was coming into an area the industrialist would have moved off long before sanction would come from the Department of the Environment.  There will be an over-estimation by some local authorities.  For that reason the Minister should have another look at the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is Senator Reynolds really serious when he indicates that managers would be able to pad certain sections of the estimates and keep money aside and then spend it at a later stage and that when we cut out fiddling with the estimates we will really do business.  I would not subscribe to the suggestion that they should be able to <Col N="909" /> fiddle, that managers or even public representatives should be able to fiddle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there could be an over-estimation, that managers would be able to pad the estimates in such a way that they would be able to utilise this money later.  This would be a fraudulent type of approach where they endeavoured to con councillors into believing they required a certain amount of money for a particular service knowing there would be an excess set aside for use for another purpose which they did not disclose at the estimates meeting. The estimates meeting is the place where they should disclose the entire projection for the coming year.  I wonder is Senator Reynolds really in earnest about this? There must be a safety valve to every situation.  That safety valve must be in the Department to meet emergency situations.  Where better can they be met than in the Department?  We know we are able to get additional money so we are not tied really to the 10 per cent.  Additional money can be forthcoming.  We were told a few moments ago we were voting because it was tied to a particular limit.  Now we know there is this safety valve and that in emergencies additional finance can be made available.  Does Senator Reynolds not trust the Minister? He accused the Minister previously of not trusting members of local authorities.  The Minister will administer this in the best interests of the nation and of the local authorities.  He gave an undertaking <Col N="910" /> that there would be no delay in an emergency in meeting the problem. whether it is in relation to factory development, site development, or whatever it may be.  If any local authority service requires additional finance, if the proper case is made, I am sure moneys will be forthcoming.  A safety valve is necessary and desirable. The Minister has put the case very well, and he is a man who can be trusted.</P>

      <P>Everybody in the House probably does not know Senator Dowling as well as I know him.  I did not use the words &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo; or &ldquo;padding&rdquo; and I in no way implied them.  I want to say this for the information of the House.  It has very often happened in estimates&mdash;and I am sure Senator Dowling will admit this&mdash;prepared here by central government, prepared by a local authority, that there was either an underestimate or an over-estimate.  That can happen.  I said that, in the event of an emergency, there was a danger that the estimate could be inflated in one section in order to have money in the event of an emergency.  I did not use the word &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo;. I cast no reflection on anybody. Nor did I say earlier on to the Minister that I did not trust him.  I certainly did not say that, and there is no point in Senator Dowling trying to put words into my mouth or to misconstrue what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion may never arise where the county manager has to act in any surreptitious manner.  He might well be forthcoming and tell his councillors in the preparation of the estimates that, rather than going through this process of having to write up to the Minister looking for approval for over-expenditure, which happens maybe nine years out of ten, he is providing a little extra money under a particular heading. The heading has to be specified in the estimate to be covered under section 11 of the 1955 Act.  The manager can be quite open and above board in the whole preparation of the estimates.  County managers have had to tell local authorities in the course of the year that they just cannot write up to the Department looking for over-expenditure <Col N="911" /> because they would probably be refused. Rather than going through that humiliating procedure, they would probably provide a bit of padding in the preparation of the estimates and take all the councillors into their confidence. There is nothing surreptitious about that. Senator Reynolds' point is that perhaps we are going a little bit too far in this second restriction on local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider section 11 every bit as fundamental to this Bill as section 10.  I can assure Senators that the section will work satisfactorily.  The principle of section 10 worked fairly well in 1978.  With good will at local level, and in my Department, there will be no need for concern or anxiety.  This section is necessary because, without it, local authorities could circumvent the controls provided by section 10 simply by authorising excess expenditure as the year went on.  This would result in commitments building up for the following year's rates, related not to planned expenditure for that year, but to money already spent in the previous year.</P>
      <P>I can assure Senators that there will be no undue delay on the part of my Department in considering any request coming up from any local authority, or any manager, for sanction for additional expenditure under section 11 of this Bill. We will treat this with extreme urgency in the Department.  Councillors would not request additional expenditure under section 11 of the Act except in an emergency or an urgent situation.  This will be treated with the utmost urgency in my Department and by me.  I see no cause whatsoever for alarm in relation to the provisions of section 11 of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Heretofore a local authority had a reserved function to strike a rate.  If a local authority refuse to strike a rate under this section, the <Col N="912" /> county manager has the power to strike the rate.  It could be a dangerous section in so far as more power is given to the county manager than to the combined public representatives.  For instance, if a county council of 20, 30, 40 or 60 people do not agree to the estimate, the county manager has the power to overrule them.  It is a dangerous section which could have an awful effect on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wise and necessary section.  The Department and the Minister are aware that councillors can play politics with the rates.  There is a temptation for councillors to give the impression by refusing to strike a rate that they are actually opposing payment of rates by those who find it difficult to pay rates.  This section is a safeguard and it will cut out local politics in the striking of rates.  If the members of local authorities do not face up to their responsibility to strike rates, their county managers are obliged to strike rates.  I have been a member of a local authority for a long time and I see it as being necessary.  At two council meetings in my own county prominent members of the local authority proposed that the rate should not be struck for no other reason than parochial advantage.  It was a ridiculous suggestion, and for that reason the section is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The withdrawal of this reserved function from the members of local authorities merely adds to the restrictions imposed on them by section 10.  Local authorities will feel that their authority is being diminished by section 10 and may therefore feel obliged, not tempted or politically inclined, to express reservations and objections in what has always been regarded as the most democratic way possible at local authority meetings.  The difficulty about this section is that it is merely a consequence of the restriction imposed by section 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view put forward by Deputy McGowan for very obvious reasons.  We know that there have been difficulties in striking rates in certain areas and that there have <Col N="913" /> been disagreements.  We know that council and local government meetings have been adjourned because agreement could not be reached on the striking of rates.  This was due more to political differences and the publicising of certain matters than genuine interest in the ratepayers or in the rates.  If councillors are aware of the overriding power that the manager will strike a rate, they are motivated to do the right thing in the interest of the people, in the interest of local government and in the interest of the central government, because that is what it is all about in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this section.  I was a member of a local authority that would not strike a rate on one occasion and we know the consequences.  We have a situation where the rate must be struck but for political reasons a group of people who decide to sabotage a meeting or to disrupt the affairs of an authority for political reasons create a serious situation.  If a rate is not struck the public services are at risk and the jobs of the workers are at risk.  What about the water supply, the lighting service, the fire service, the sewerage service and refuse disposal?  Unless a rate is struck and moneys made available for these services, both the services and the workers suffer.  We are aware of the consequences. The section is desirable and necessary when it is related to section 10.  As the striking of rates is necessary I fail to see why one member should be opposed to this section.  Section 10 has already been agreed to.  The agreement on section 10 ends the risks involved in the non-striking of rates reinforces the Minister's desire to ensure that this section is agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) of this section makes it clear that the powers of elected representatives to prepare and adopt estimates and to strike rates are not touched by the present provision. The reserved function exercised by local authorities under section 10 (4) of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 are exempted from the application of the present section. Councillors will be required to hold <Col N="914" /> estimates meetings and to strike a rate in the pound just as before.  I think there is a misunderstanding as regards the distinction between the striking of a rate and the making of a rate.  We know that councillors must meet to strike a rate. They may meet on numerous occasions to strike a rate.  We also know that councillors must also meet for the making of the rate when the applotment work has been done and when the rate has been fixed for each hereditament in the county or within the rating district. What subsection (1) removes from the range of reserved functions is the endorsement of the rate book which normally takes place some months after the estimates meeting at which the rate is struck.  It is difficult to see why the involvement of elected members should be required in this process.  The rate in the pound has already been struck and cannot be varied.  Neither can the valuations to which the rate in the pound must be applied.  The applotment and bidding of the rates is properly an administrative function, and this section simply recognises that fact under the old provision whereby the making of the rate was a reserved function.  Rating authorities were required by Article 62 of the Public Bodies Order, 1946, to endorse the rate book at a meeting specially held for the purpose.  On the coming into operation of section 13, the Minister would amend the Public Bodies Order to remove this requirement.  He would ensure, however, that appropriate provision is made to preserve the existing right of the public to inspect the rate book for at least 14 days before the rate is finally made.  The various enactments mentioned in subsection (1) of this section are those under which the making of the rate is treated as a reserved function.</P>

      <P>Senator Dowling said he was a member of a local authority who failed to strike a rate.  Since the foundation of the State few local authorities have failed to strike a rate.  I cannot see what we are protecting with this section.  If a local authority refused to strike a rate, which could happen more frequently than heretofore, the day of co-operation between the manager and the local authority would be gone.  It <Col N="915" /> is a dangerous situation and something should be done about it, even at the next stage.</P>

      <P>Senator Reynolds' statement that few local authorities have failed to strike a rate may be true.  The local authorities who failed to strike a rate on one occasion subsequently struck a rate because they knew that the <Col N="916" /> meeting would be reconvened and that it was necessary and obligatory to strike a rate.  With that knowledge they will be more inclined to do their duty in the first instance in the interest of the people who elected them.</P>

      <P>The challenging of section 13 is not reasonable.  It appears that the opposition to this Bill is not genuine but obstructive.  If this is all we can expect from Fine Gael and the Labour Party in this House, what can we expect from their members of councils?</P>

      <P>This section has been deliberately inserted to provide for a delay in the adoption of the preparation of estimates of expenses, as has been experienced this year.  It was also the case at the end of 1977.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>...it shall be lawful for the authority to expend money or to incur liability in that local financial year for any particular purpose in respect of which money was expended...in the immediately preceding local financial year;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens in an emergency situation, say, in the month of January under a particular heading, in respect of which heading there was no provision made in the preceding financial year?  Is the county manager in a position to have any moneys expended pending the adoption of an estimate?  If moneys were not provided for pollution in 1978, and, if, in <Col N="917" /> January or February of 1979, pending preparation and adoption of an estimate the expenditure under that heading is required, what can the manager do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator read part of subsection (2).  Subsection (2) states that where an estimate of expenses is not adopted until some time into the local financial year to which it relates a local authority will still have authority to incur expenditure in the intervening period.  Under section 11 (2) of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, the authority for revenue expenditure by a local authority in a particular local financial year derives from the estimate of expenses actually adopted for that year.  In the absence of an estimate of expenses, the subsection authorises expenditure by a local authority in the intervening period of up to one-half of the amount provided in the relevant programme group of the previous year's estimate.  The subsection is similar in structure to the corresponding provision for expenditure by Government Departments which is set out in section 2 of the Central Fund Act, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this section.  It is the first intervention in our tax code designed to remove the inflation tax.  I think it is a little unhappy that the intervention is in relation to a capital gain and that the inflation tax is being maintained in relation to income tax.  There is no indication <Col N="919" /> whatever that the recommendations of the consultative committee of the accountancy bodies with regard to this which have been made for some considerable time now are going to be met.</P>
      <P>That said, I would like to ask a question with regard to what the House may consider is the appropriateness of the index used and the appropriateness of the application of the index to every asset held by anybody, whether resident or not resident, whether an individual or a company, and whatever the nature of that asset may be, whether situate in the State or situate outside the State, whether invested in a manner thought to be desirable or not desirable, and how the Minister wishes to explain the curious and distorting effects of the application of the particular multiplier chosen to different assets.  I saw a paper which I have read and from which I derived considerable understanding of this Bill, which had a curious phrase in it with regard to the Stock Exchange, &ldquo;the security and price rise have been outstripped by inflation&rdquo;.  What that means, if in general true, is that in relation to the security market over the period of years in question there will not be any capital gains to be taxed, because the consumer price index is not the appropriate index to discover what is the real value.  I do not know, I would be interested to have a view on this.</P>
      <P>On the other hand we have the price of land which has gone as everyone knows, in this extraordinary way.  The price of houses has risen also, altogether out of line.  I do not know if the Minister can tell me where else indexation is applied and whether this is the type of index which is operated.</P>

      <P>May I ask one <Col N="920" /> question in regard to my understanding of the section?  Is it quite clear in the section that the pre-1974 cost is no longer at all relevant.  It may have a relevance in subsection (3) and has it the effect that in certain circumstances an increasing loss would not become allowable, which would not be the position if this section did not apply it, which it does?  I think I can see what the draftsmen are trying to do; they are trying to make the situation neutral as regards gains and losses, not to have an impact on the situation as of April 1974.  Could you have a loss situation actually arising from the date of original acquisition up to, say, to-day's date which would be greater than the loss which will arise because the market value was fixed and a no gain no loss situation was fixed on the 6 April, 1974 and some of the loss was lopped off as a result of that? Somebody with a loss may have, as an effect of this, a reduction in the allowable loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that all market values are taken on the date mentioned but, as the Senator said, subsection (3) may apply.  The purpose of this provision is to avoid the creation by the application of indexation of artificial losses.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;If a company so elects, section 3 shall not apply in relation to the disposal of an asset and the provisions of paragraph 18 of Part II of Schedule 1 to the Principal Act shall apply thereto as if Part II of the Schedule had not been repealed by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to apologise for the manner in which that recommendation has been drafted because I think there would be a number of consequential amendments to the Bill requisite if it were acceptable to the Minister.  In particular, section 14 of the existing Bill would require to be amended to take care of that recommendation. Section 14 of this Bill reads:</P>
      <P>Section 132(2) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;Section 3 of the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978,&rdquo; for &ldquo;Part II of Schedule 1 to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975,&rdquo; and the said section 132 (2), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
      <P>and would have to get similar treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> The effect of not having this election may be to have a company paying, in certain circumstances, tax on a higher gain than would be available if time apportionment were still preserved.  Despite the fact that in general the existence of time apportionment tends to spread the taxable gain over the time and therefore within the then taxable period.  But there are circumstances in which this could be, and I cannot see that there is a great inconvenience or a great difficulty in giving a company the election to continue to be treated, admittedly at the new rate of tax but on the basis on which they have been treated up to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Time apportionment is now being repealed in Schedule 2 to this Bill because it does not fit into the system of indexation which requires that relief be given in respect of the inflation as measured by the consumer price index that has occurred since 6 April 1974 only.  It is considered that the proposed recommendation could not be justified.  The fact that market value as of 6 April 1974 is the starting point in the computation of the gain ensures that no more than the gain from that date, as reduced for inflation, is taken in the computation of the amount to be charged.  This appears to be fair and there would seem to be no justification for making any exceptions for cases where fortuitously, time apportionment by reason of its lack of precision conferred a benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing imprecise about time apportionment. It is a very precise measurement once you know the date of acquisition and the length of time.  The fact of the matter is that on time apportionment there could be a gain which will be less than the gain which will accrue on a deemed acquisition on 5 April 1974 and companies can have so provided in their arrangements.  I take it we can provide against the fortuitous by observing the possibility of its happening.  If it does not happen often, it is not going to create much difficulty.  I am not impressed by that.  I would rather press this recommendation on the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could give the Senator an example of the position. Take, for example, an asset which cost on 6 April 1960 £2,000, the market value on 6 April 1974 becomes £5,000, and the asset is sold in 6 April 1978 for £20,000.  The chargeable gain as computed under this Bill is worked out on the basis of the proceeds of the sale, £20,000, index cost at £5,000 multiplied by 1.815, becomes £9,075.  Therefore, the chargeable gain becomes £10,925. The chargeable gain under the proposed recommendation, that is, on the basis of time apportionment is as follows: the overall gain is £20,000 minus the cost of £2,000, which equals £18,000.  Therefore the chargeable proportion is four-eighteenths of £18,400, that is £4,000. This would mean that a substantial portion of the gain which accrued after 6 April 1974 would escape taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And is precisely the existing law, so that that company will be paying extra taxation because of this, and under a Bill which it was intended to be beneficial to enterprise is not to get the benefit of that stimulus.  That company's profits presumably will be applied and used in its business and it has been operating its business on the basis that time apportionment was the rule.  The Minister's example is even more striking than the example I had myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1975 Act there was provision in paragraph 18 of Schedule 1 for computing the amount of the gain which arose after 5 April 1974, by assuming that the gain had grown at a uniform rate from nothing at the beginning of the period of ownership to its full amount at the time of the disposal and apportioning the whole gain on a time basis so as to determine the amount which had accrued after 5 April 1974. Time apportionment, as this was called, was at best a rough-and-ready method of calculating the gain from 6 April 1974 and was introduced mainly for administrative convenience so as to obviate as far as possible, especially in the early days of the capital gains tax, the necessity for valuations as at 6 April 1974.  It happened with time apportionment <Col N="924" /> where the rate of growth gain had been greater after 6 April 1974 than before that date, that some of the gain which arose after 6 April 1974 was in apportionment, attributed to the period before the 6 April 1974, and consequently escaped taxation.  The amendment proposed in the recommendation would in effect retain the benefits for the taxpayer of the defects of the time apportionment system.  It is not immediately clear why the proposal relates to companies only as of course time apportionment applied to all taxpayers, save in relation to certain assets.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(9) In the case of an asset the time of acquisition of which cannot be established the beginning of the period over which a gain or a part of a gain is assumed to have grown shall be the 6th day of April, 1964.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people expressed doubt as to what was to be the position under this section where the date and cost of acquisition was not known.  There was provision, as the Minister will know, for the ascertainment of this on the basis indicated in the recommendations the existing basis of the existing Act in fact.  It seems to me that there is no problem with regard to the cost.  If I am wrong in that I would like to be told I am wrong and that the critics are right, merely for my own information. I thought they were wrong.  It seems to me that the deemed acquisition in April 1974 replaces and gives us the <Col N="925" /> cost of acquisition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate in the context of tapered rates of tax and the cut off point after 21 years ownership that a period of ownership should be decided in such an arbitrary manner as suggested.  For example, a person might be able to prove that he owned the asset for over 21 years but might not be able to state the exact date, or even the year in which he acquired it. He would be treated however under this recommendation as owning it for 14 years only, if he were now to dispose of it, and its disposal would give rise to a chargeable gain, even though the asset was held for at least 21 years and should under section 4(2) no longer be a chargeable asset.  The proposed amendment could therefore operate to the disadvantage of the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> In view of the new provisions in sections 6 and 7 in relation to assets acquired on death, there should be little difficulty in practice in ascertaining the date of acquisition of an asset.  Formerly assets acquired on a death, and later disposed of, were treated as if the successor had acquired them when the deceased acquired them.  The successor might have no knowledge of deceased's affairs, and thus might have no way of establishing the deceased's period of ownership.  This difficulty no longer arises in such cases because the period of ownership of the successor will commence at the date of the deceased's death, save in the case of a surviving spouse.  A surviving spouse will normally be in a position to say when the other spouse acquired the asset, as effectively it will not be necessary to look back more than 21 years from the date of disposal to which section 4 applies.</P>

      <P>I expressed considerable unhappiness with regard to this in my Second Reading speech and in secret session in Seanad, as we continue on most of these Finance Bills, I can take up the point.  Would the Minister answer one question with regard to this relief because it is a relieving section of some importance?  How much will this relief cost?  When the Minister for Finance, who has shown an intimidating consistency, said in his budget speech with regard to this matter of the capital gains tax that it would not cost anything because of the basis of capital gains tax, that is, that it would not affect the Exchequer returns in the present year, obviously that was correct.  But we are approaching the Minister's second budget and he must be concerned to measure the cost of all relief.  This relief which is going to benefit particularly the better off members of our society, is going to cost the Exchequer a sum of money which in some degree must be capable of estimation in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this indexation proposal the Inland Revenue in the UK, in a <Col N="927" /> document which they issued on 5 October 1977, described the proposal for this relief and for indexation as involving substantial extra work both for officials and taxpayers.  This Bill cut out the only serious provision in the code for relief of the man with the small income&mdash;what they call the half income rule.  That has gone here and in the UK too.  When they got rid of it in the UK they substituted reliefs for exemptions up to a gain of £9,500 applicable to everyone.</P>
    <P>The Minister to the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the British Treasury could not afford what the Irish Government had decided the Irish Exchequer could afford in giving this relief, a relief which they will enjoy irrespective of their income.  What is this cost estimated to be?</P>

      <P>Yes, but I think my proposition is impeccable.  We are taxing, cutting services or borrowing. We are doing one of those three.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the relief contained in this.  I appreciate that the Minister is not able to give a breakdown as between the main other relief, the indexation relief which is removal of an inflation tax, to which I do not object and which, in fact, I welcome.  The others are smallish.  The relief in relation to death is certainly not going to affect the receipts in a short period because death was not a chargeable event anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were circumstances under the old code whereby tax was collected after death by sales, personal representatives and so on.  This relief does not affect individual foreign investors unless they are resident or ordinarily resident.  They will pay the same both before and after the relief is taken off.  It does not assist companies, and, incidentally, if I am reading a later section correctly, it does assist policy holders in insurance companies.  It applies equally to foreign investment as to domestic investment.  Therefore, it does not encourage home investment.  It <Col N="929" /> in no way affects that decision.  It applies to people who speculate in property in a situation other than the situation specified in subsection (3).  If the speculators in question can hold on to the property which they acquire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I read subsection (3) correctly it only applies to a situation where one has land with market value in excess of its use value, which is not the type of property I am talking about, which has risen in price in the city of Dublin by 30 per cent in the last six months.  It favours the man who can freeze up his assets, who can afford to dispose of his assets so that he does not have to call on them to educate his children and does not have to call on them for some pressing need.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is possible to debate the introduction of this relief without looking at the removal of the relief to small taxpayers.  Would it be the wish of the House if we could take into this debate, because it takes in most of what I have to say&mdash;I am sure you would all like to get that done quickly&mdash;the proposed insertion of the new section before section 5?  Is it possible to have the debate on that at the same time, because I do not want to be repeating myself any more than is necessary?</P>

      <P>I am not tied to what was in the old code which is what they call the half-income rule, that is to say one was charged on £2,500 of the first £5,000 and the excess over that up to £5,000 added to the income of the individual taxpayer; he has had that option. That is gone but I am not tied to <Col N="930" /> that.  Neither am I tied to the British replacement, which they say is infinitely cheaper to the British Treasury thus is, of having exemptions&mdash;we have an exemption of £500&mdash;all the way up with breaks at different points.  I am in favour of a system which is like the one operated in America where capital accruals are treated as what is loosely called accruals to economic power which, of course, they are.  Originally, capital gains were treated as income.  They had tapering relief for a while but there is a clear distinction between short-term gains which are treated as income and long-term gains which are treated at a lower rate than the income tax charge. There is a lot of debate internationally about this as to whether it should be one-half or one-third, but nobody seriously argues that capital gains should be taxed at the same rate as income tax and I do not propose it.</P>
      <P>My idea, poorly expressed, no doubt, assisted largely by revenue language in the drafting also, is that the income taxpayer should be able to get his tax gains in at half his top rate.  I may be told that that is a costly thing; I do not know&mdash;the British say otherwise with regard to their scheme and this seems to me easier.  It has all the advantage of removing the grievance that is felt by people who see others able to realise capital gains out of assets that have qualified for exemption.  All assets that are being held at this moment since 1957 by anybody in this society are exempt from capital gains tax held by the same person.  That provides all these people with a source of cash giving rise to no tax if the asset of course is a realisable asset.  That obviously is a point.  It gets rid of a real feeling of unfairness.  They can have access to spendable cash without giving rise to a tax whereas the man dependant on his income is not in that position.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed in the recommendation would substantially restore the effect of section 6 of the 1975 Act which is being repealed in Schedule 2 to this Bill. Broadly speaking, section 6 provides an alternative basis of charge whereby regard was had to an individual's income tax situation when determining his capital gains tax liability.  The recommendation, as drafted, would create some anomalies.  Where, for example, a taxpayer had very little income so that &ldquo;the rate applicable to the highest part&rdquo; of his income&mdash;the quotation is from subsection 2 of the proposed recommendation&mdash;was nil then his chargeable gains, however great they might be, would be charged at half that rate.  That is nil, so that no tax would be payable. This could hardly have been the Senator's intention.  The repeal of section 6 of the 1975 Act was fully debated in the Dáil on an Opposition amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains very substantial reliefs for the individual who makes a capital gain.  His chargeable gain is reduced as a result of indexation and that reduced gain may then, assuming the conditions set out in section 4 are satisfied, be charged at a rate as low as zero after 21 years' ownership.  These reliefs add to the cost of administration of the tax.  Any linking of the capital gains tax liability to the taxpayer's income tax position would create complications which would further increase the cost of administration, with little or no benefit to the vast majority of taxpayers. The number of taxpayers who would benefit, having regard to the introduction of indexation and tapering rates, would inevitably be very small and the cost of administration would be disproportionately increased.  In addition, it would not be beyond the ingenuity of a taxpayer to so arrange his affairs that his income for tax purposes in a year in which he expected to realise a substantial capital gain would, after relief for interest, <Col N="932" /> accelerated capital allowances and stock relief, be very low or nonexistent, thus ensuring that the gain would escape or virtually escape tax. The old half-income rule in section 6 cost the revenue virtually nothing in tax. There were very few cases who benefited from it.  It was an expensive relief to administer. The repeal of it will save practically nothing in tax but will save administrative costs.  The number of people who actually got the benefit of the half-income rule to date is estimated to be less then 25 people in a period of three years.</P>

The draft was only an idea and, obviously, would need cooperation to deal with the contingencies that the Minister has drawn attention to. Am I right in thinking and it seems to me to be very odd, that looking at paragraph 7 and 8 of the First Schedule, the position is that somebody who has got himself into the position that he has made a taxable gain of 30 per cent is not within the relief?</P>

      <P>There is provision for replacement assets in the existing Act without classes.  In this case there is provision for replacement assets with classes.  I am not clear about it.  If one was carrying on a trade which involved plant or machinery and land and buildings, good will and so on, and are disposed of that to get new assets they must be of that kind of assets for the relief to be available.  It is a sort of roll-over <Col N="933" /> in this situation.  What do the words at the beginning of Class 1 (B) mean: &ldquo;except where the trade is a trade of dealing in or developing land&rdquo;?  Does that mean that if somebody who is in the trade of dealing in or developing land or providing services for the occupier of land has his assets compulsorily acquired, he cannot replace them with assets of like kind?  I am not wishing to do anything other than understanding what is in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Class 1 comprises the capital assets of a trade, for example, plant or machinery, land and buildings and goodwill.  In this context farming land in the State is a trade.  It is not necessary that the orginal assets and the replacement assets be in the same subdivision A, B or C all in Class 1.  It is sufficient that they are both within Class 1.  For example, if the proceeds of the disposal of farmland are used to purchase farm machinery the relief would be due.  Where a building is occupied and used for the purposes of a trade which consists of (a) dealing in or developing land or (b) providing services for the occupier of land in which the person carrying on the trade has an estate or interest it is not within Class 1. Such a building would in case (a) normally be included in stock in trade and the receipt from its disposal would be an income receipt of the trade.  Accordingly, any gains arising would not be within the ambit of capital gains tax.  Where, however, the trade is a trade of dealing in or developing land but the profit on the land occupied and used for the purpose of the trade, for instance a builder's yard and offices, would not fall into trading profits, such land would be within Class 1 and Class 1B the exception being in relation to a trade of providing services for the occupier of land in which the person carrying on the trade has an estate or interest.  For example, the owner of an office block who provides to occupiers services such as cleaning, lighting, heating, caretaking and so on.  Technically, the provision of such services is the carrying on of a trade, but the reality is that the income is from the letting of the building.  The <Col N="934" /> building would therefore come within Class 2 and is excluded from Class 1.</P>

      <P>That is most helpful.  I am grateful to the Minister for that.  I had not understood that and he has made it very clear.  With regard to Class 2, what does one do with a dwelling-housing situation?

      <P>Class 2 comprises land and buildings not used for the purposes of a trade but it excludes a dwelling-house which is used as a principal private residence by the person making the proposal.  The gain arising on the disposal of a principal private residence is exempted under section 25 of the 1975 Act and such property has, therefore, been excluded.  If, for example, a let house were compulsorily acquired and the proceeds used to purchase a principal private residence the relief would not be due.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much.  Another question will mean that I can clear up a recommendation which is a bit of a cod at the end.  Do the words, &ldquo;the original assets and the replacement assets shall be treated as the same assets acquired as the original assets were acquired&rdquo; mean that the tapering relief under section 4, and the indexation under section 3, which was annexed to the original assets, carries forward to the new assets through this language?</P>

      <P>This is a different treatment of these matters of indexation and tapering relief to that which arises with regard to subsequent disposals of gifts which are relieved, or businesses by family gifts and disposal?

    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister said I was wrong. Whatever it was I said was wrong I do not know but it is probable that everything I said was wrong.  At any rate in regard to this point I referred to the treatment under the Income Tax Act, 1967 and to the special provisions for the taxation of settlors in respect of settled or transferred income.  There are a lot of sections in Chapters 1 and 2 of that, sections 438 to 448 and they relate to a number of different cases.  They are designed, in effect, to prevent people <Col N="936" /> who are high taxpayers with money giving it over to their children and letting their children pay low tax on it blocking it off their higher rate.  Obviously, this is the design of the whole thing.  For the purposes of this part of the Income Tax Act an illegitimate child is deemed to be a child.  The illegitimate child is one of the family.  Under the income tax code there is an attempt to provide this kind of income in, hopefully, a genuine case and the disposer is treated as if an illegitimate child's income was his income, just as if it were a legitimate child. In one of the most recent Finance Acts there is a provision broadly to the effect that the child, wherever it is used should be an adopted child, a stepchild.  I suggest in this case where a relief is being given to an old chap of 55 who gives over his property to his children that it should <i>in jure</i> as well be given to an illegitimate child as well as to a legitimate one.</P>

      <P>It is undesirable that an exemption from capital gains tax should depend on a taxpayer's incapacity because it is almost impossible to define satisfactorily the degree of incapacity which should exist before the taxpayer could qualify for exemption.

      <P>In relation to section 28 of the 1975 Act it provides that where an asset is disposed of and replaced the conditions in the section are satisfied, the gain on the disposal is to be treated as not accruing until the replacement <Col N="938" /> assets are taken out of use.  This is commonly called the roll-over relief.  It is clear that relief under section 28 can be granted in respect of the gain which accrued during the child's own period of ownership.  The fact that, in subsection 4(a) of the new section 27, the tax on the gain that had accrued up to the date of the parent's disposal is coupled with the tax on the gain which accrued during the child's period of ownership, will enable the Revenue Commissioners to administer the provisions of subsection 4 (a) of the new section 27 in the few cases that are likely to arise on the basis that the question of the clawback of the parent's relief will only arise when the replacement assets acquired by the child are finally taken out of use.  It is considered therefore that an amendment of the new section 27 on the lines proposed in the recommendations to cater for roll-over relief is not necessary.</P>

      <P>This section amends certain anti-avoidance provisions contained in section 39 of the 1975 Act which provides for exemption in respect of transfers of assets to the State, charities and certain national institutions. To prevent avoidance, that section provides that where such assets are transferred for no consideration or for a consideration less than the allowable expenses and they are subsequently disposed of there would be an occasion of charge.  As, however, the State and most of the other recipient bodies, for example, local authorities, would be exempt from capital gains tax, the charge is directed mainly against charities set up for a limited period only with a view to obtaining the benefits of the section but with the real object of disposing of the transferred assets at a later date.  In this event, the body concerned was to be charged to capital gains tax on its disposal of the asset on the whole gain computed by reference to the original cost of the asset to the person who had transferred it to that body, thus negativing the relief afforded under the section. With the introduction of indexation and tapering rates, this provision would not serve its purpose because the period during which the asset was owned by the exempt body would be included in the period of ownership.  The amendment ensures that in the event of the disposal of the asset by the body concerned it would become liable to the capital gains tax which would, were it not for the relief under the section, have been chargeable on the original owner when he made the transfers to that body in addition to any libility on gains which may have accrued during its own period of ownership.  The exemptions afforded to genuine charities under section 33 of the 1975 Act and to other bodies, such as local authorities, under section 23 of that Act are not being disturbed.</P>

      <P>This section amends the company tax legislation in two places to take account of the new basic rate of 30 per cent for capital gains tax provided for in section 2.  Companies are charged to corporation tax in respect of their profits and, for this purpose, profits are defined as including chargeable gain. Notwithstanding the inclusion of the chargeable gains in profits, however, the application of the basic capital gains tax rate to chargeable gains is preserved by reducing the chargeable gains by a fraction before including them in profits.  The new fraction by which chargeable gains are to be so reduced is fifteen-forty-fifths. Accordingly thirty-forty-fifths of a given chargeable gain multiplied by 45 over 100, the normal corporation tax rate is 45 per cent&mdash;is equivalent to a rate of 30 per cent&mdash;the basic capital gains tax rate on the whole gain.</P>

Is it a Bill to promote a greater degree of social equity through the tax code?  Is it a Bill to increase employment in the public service or is it to raise revenue?  From what I heard from the Minister it is not of much service in the last-mentioned category because the expected intake of revenue in 1980 is only £1.6 million.  I assume when the cost of administration is taken off that it will hardly be worth more than £1 million.  It is not that kind of Bill and I assume the Revenue Commissioners would not be interested in employing people in their offices or work of such little benefit to themselves.  I am asking for confirmation that it is a Bill to promote a greater <Col N="943" /> degree of social equity through the tax code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned last night, I referred to the very disappointing performance by the Government in several specific areas. For example, the disappointing performance of the Department of Justice in several important respects, the failure to adopt a position on the Pringle Report on Civil Legal Aid and Advice which was submitted to the Government a year ago today and the failure to introduce a Bill to provide for civil legal aid and advice, the failure to provide basic reform of the law relating to children and the failure to provide reform of family courts, despite the commitment contained in the manifesto.  I also referred to the very disappointing performance of the Minister for Social Welfare and that he projects an image of a Minister for Health but seems to be the Minister for non-Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hardship and deprivation of the 20 per cent at the bottom, those very substantially dependent on social welfare, has worsened dramatically.  I referred to the continuing failure by that Minister to ensure the proper working of the Social Welfare (Supplementary Benefits) Act, 1975, which came into operation on 1 July, 1977 and which, therefore, coincides with the term of office <Col N="944" /> of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I also referred to the failure, particularly by the Minister for Labour but also by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to ensure the good working of industrial relations and to create both the climate for co-operation and working together between the social partners which is basic to our economic progress.  The attitude and the approach of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a positive barrier to the creation of industrial peace in that Department and has led to several very disruptive and damaging strikes already and looks as if it is going to trigger off more strikes.  We have now a reputation, not only in this country but abroad, for failing to maintain the kind of telecommunications system which is a component of a modern developed State.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the area of education and to regret the fact that the implication both of the Green Paper and the attitude of the Government has been one of not delivering on the manifesto promises.  We are not seeing a radical improvement in the teacher-pupil ratio in primary schools.  There has been no implementation of that much promised commitment by the Minister for Education that the ratio would be reduced to one teacher to 40 pupils in the primary school.  We do not see the investment in education which is absolutely vital for the particular demographic structure that we have, the young and fast growing population that we have.</P>
    <P>Recently we had an opportunity in this House to look at the deteriorating situation at third level in the area of higher education grants.  I put on the record of this House statistics which show that a lower percentage of students in our third-level institutions, in our universities and other third-level institutions, are in receipt of State grants. There is an increasing student population, but a smaller percentage of them are State aided.  That in itself is a reflection of the fact that the Government are not committed to providing equality of access to third level.  Even those students who are State aided cannot live on the grants available and are in great hardship, the kind of hardship which <Col N="945" /> was not a feature of student life some years ago.  They are particularly hit by the very high standard of living, by the fact that universities have raised their fees, and by their inability to find the range of jobs that were available before to students who had to work to supplement their education and pay for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a serious crisis in third level education and the possibility that a number of students may have to drop out in their second year, or after their first year.  They simply cannot continue to study because of the economic deprivation which they suffer.  This is a terrible tragedy in a country which must provide a very well-educated, well-trained, intelligent and adaptable young population.  The challenge to them will be to create the industrial advance, to provide the kind of expertise and services which we need as a community. The Department of Education seem to be drifting, but it is a drift in the wrong direction.  It is a pattern which shows a smaller percentage of students receiving State grants and the level of State grants is not keeping pace with the cost of living. It is fair to say it never has kept pace, but the situation is worsening all the time.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the economic performance of the Government in the past year.  There is no doubt that one of the successes of Fianna Fáil in the last election was to put forward and to have accepted the proposition that Fianna Fáil were better at managing the economy, better at running the country economically than any other party or parties.  The record over the 18 months of Fianna Fáil administration has been a very sharp disappointment to those who believed that Fianna Fáil were better at the economic management. What we have seen since Fianna Fáil took office is classic Tory policy.  It is a policy of making the rich better off. This cannot be said often enough.</P>
    <P>We had an example this afternoon in the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Bill.  By the removal of wealth tax, by the removal of car tax, by the removal of rates in a global way, people paying the <Col N="946" /> highest rates got the greatest benefit, those in the largest private dwellings benefited most.  In order to pay for this largesse to the better off the Fianna Fáil administration engaged in very substantial external borrowing which has made us very vulnerable as a country.  We are now pledged to the extent of 14 per cent of our GNP.  That is our external borrowing deficit.  This is extremely high.  It is much higher than it is in the United Kingdom which is often criticised as a country with very extensive external borrowing. We are not, as yet anyway, sitting on known North Sea oil resources.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that one has to examine what I would call the debacle of the negotiations for the European Monetary System.  Since the Bremen Summit European Council on the issue there appears to have been both a false confidence and a lack of attention as to what precisely would be available to us if we were to enter into a European Monetary System with other member states of the European Community.  The Government appear to have been more optimistic about what might be on offer and more optimistic about how certain vulnerable industries will survive both the disruptions and dislocations which might follow entry to the EMS without Britain and not to have related whatever kind of transfer of resources or soft loans we might get to the immediate severity of membership of the EMS to so many of our vulnerable industries which employ people and the very real danger of increasing redundancies and of greater difficulty in sustaining and increasing our employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This has never been properly spelled out by the Government and I do not believe that the White Paper published last week gives a balanced and detailed view on this issue.  The Government need to borrow more money and they would like some kind of framework within which to try to introduce local internal unpopular measures to pay for some of the largesse which was spread around during their first year in office.  That really is what we are talking about when we are talking about the European Monetary System.  It is interesting that the discussion, as one reads it in the <Col N="947" /> newspapers&mdash;and many conflicting views are being expressed even by the Taoiseach and different Ministers of the Government&mdash;seems to turn on the question of how much can be obtained in soft loans and the possibility of a delay before these loans have to be repaid.  This is dangerously attractive to a Government who are prepared to borrow to the extent that Fianna Fáil appear to be prepared to borrow.  If you can get a three- or four- year postponement on the loan, then that is a problem for the citizens of the future but it may be a great bonus and benefit to a political party in office during that period who may be able to live on borrowed time and borrowed money to build up a very severe and crushing borrowing requirement in the future.  This is a very serious situation indeed.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the real impact of membership of the European Monetary System&mdash;and if I am to believe rumours circulating round this House I am talking about a reality rather than a possibility at this stage&mdash;has not been spelled out.  The real assessment of the consequences for employment, for vulnerable export orientated industries like textiles, footwear, clothing, has not been put fairly and squarely before the people. The Government have spent a lot of time whipping up a kind of nationalist sentiment to break the link with sterling. They are striking a very understandable chord in Irish people.  We all share this. Not one of us who would not wish to break the economic link with sterling.  It is the responsibility of the Government to do it at the right time with the right kind of safeguards and with the right kind of prospects.</P>
    <P>The real problem is that the Government over-heated the economy and over-borrowed externally.  The prospect for 1979 is one of much more retrenchment. As well as that the Government are looking for very reasonable and responsible attitudes on the part of workers. They want very substantial wages restraint.  The problem is that the Government have not created the climate for this.  They have not prepared the way for the kind of social contract of consensus which would be the forerunner <Col N="948" /> to a reasonable response on the wage front area.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be surprised at the degree of polarisation and resentment which is much sharper now than it has been in the past decade.  There is more real polarisation, bitterness and potential strife on the industrial relations front than there has been in the past decade.  The Government have only themselves to blame because of the one-sided approach to the economic reliefs and benefits and bonuses they have provided since taking office.  They have widened the disparities between those who are better off and those who are either in low paid jobs or, worse still, in our high percentage of unemployed, or those who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The situation in which we find ourselves coming into 1 January 1979 is very largely of the Government's own creating.  They have accentuated the polarising of the working class and the better off in our community.  They have tried to adopt the classic Tory strategy. Sir Keith Joseph would be proud of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Sir Keith Joseph would approve of the present policy and strategy of the Fianna Fáil Government because they have tried to put money, benefits and income into the hands of a so-called productive elite, higher up the scale, hoping that that productive elite would consume more, produce more and provide more jobs. This is the classic private enterprise approach to the management of the economy.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Labour Party, it is encouraging to see Fianna Fáil do this so blatantly.  They will continue to try to approach the management of the economy on classic Tory lines.  It does not suit the country.  It does not suit the problems we have, and it makes all the more credible the socialist alternative to the management of the economy.  We have problems we have not faced since we achieved independence.  We have a growing young population to absorb, feed, clothe, educate, train and provide jobs for.  It is very interesting to look at the demographic statistics down the years in Ireland.  Between 1926 and <Col N="949" /> 1971 there was relatively no change in the overall population size to the nearest hundred thousand.  From 1971 on, the graph of increase is a very dramatic one. We will have to absorb half a million people over a very short time.</P>
    <P>This is an enormous richness, an enormous source of energy and strength. It is a great challenge to us because empirically we are an under-populated country.  You cannot provide the economic strategy, the job creating strategy, the social investment necessary to feed and clothe them and achieve a social consensus in that population by the classic Tory approach of promoting the activity of the better-off in our society, promoting private enterprise and trying in some instances to dismantle State-sponsored bodies and hand all or part of their activity over to private enterprise.  This will become clearer.</P>
    <P>The Government are hoping to be rescued by the European Monetary System.  The Irish people have not been impressed by the way they have negotiated and are not impressed by the terms which it appears will be offered and which it appears will be accepted by the Government.  Nineteen seventy-nine will be a very interesting year.  It could be the break year for the Fianna Fáil Government.  Knowing that a number of Senators want to speak I will end on a note of waiting to see what the situation will be between now and when we debate the next Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to follow the headline I set myself last year.  I will speak first on a particular head of public expenditure and then on the public finances and development policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular head I have chosen is fisheries&mdash;policy in relation to salmon fishing.  This is a matter of considerable economic and environmental significance. Our salmon stocks are a great natural asset which should be carefully exploited but which are in fact being brought to the point of extinction.  The crisis in relation to the survival of salmon in our waters and certain Government decisions imposing restrictions <Col N="950" /> on salmon fishing were discussed recently in Dáil Éireann.  As an interested individual, and as a member of the Board of Management of the Salmon Research Trust, I would like to make a few comments now rather than wait wearily for the motion on our Order Paper to come up for debate.</P>
    <P>While the controls imposed by the Minister for Fisheries are overdue and in themselves to be welcomed, they do not measure up to the needs of an extremely critical situation.  More severe restrictions should be introduced for a time, even if this entails temporary compensation for licensed fishermen who habitually draw their main livelihood from net fishing for salmon.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper admitted that there has been substantial over-fishing of salmon in recent years compounded by an upsurge in illegal fishing.  I will give two figures to highlight the extent and reality of the crisis.  At Lough Furnace, near Newport, where the Salmon Research Trust operates, a complete count is possible of the salmon coming in to spawn.  One female salmon parent should produce at least two mature offspring, one male and one female, to sustain the population.  This is true also of human beings.  Instead however, of being two plus, as it is in the human population, the net reproduction rate for salmon is now less than one.  This indicates a progressive and rapid depletion of stocks.  Since the inland conditions are favourable at Lough Furnace there can be only one cause, the low survival rate of salmon in the sea.  This is largely attributable to excessive drift net fishing, legal and illegal.</P>
    <P>The second figure relates to the entry of salmon to the spawning reaches of the River Shannon, now more than ever the river on which hopes of survival of the species centre, since the salmon has virtually disappeared from the Boyne, Liffey, Lee and the Erne.  There is a count of the fish passing through Thomond Weir at Limerick.  For the five years 1963 to 1967 the yearly average was 17,000 odd.  This year the number was only 2,000&mdash;one eighth now of the intake of 15 years ago.  Again the blame lies with over-fishing at sea and in the estuaries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> It is in the light of these facts, and of the fact that three-fourths of the salmon catch is taken by driftmen, that I query the adequacy of the measures announced by the Minister.  It will not affect drift fishermen very much to be prohibited from fishing before 15 March or after 20 July.  Not many of them ever went out before 15 March or stayed on after 20 July because it was hardly worth their while.  They will still be free to concentrate on the main run of summer fish from mid-May to mid-July.  The Minister is, of course, extending the weekly close period from 48 hours to 72 hours but, as everyone knows, there has been blatant disregard of the present shorter period and the problems of enforcing the longer period will be acute.</P>
    <P>Rod and line fishermen have been prepared to accept stringent restrictions on their own activities if only for the appearance of equity.  But it is an unnecessary penance for them to be excluded altogether from September fishing.  To keep a sense of proportion, it is necessary to remember that anglers take only a tiny proportion of the total catch of salmon, less than half of one per cent. This is in conformity with my personal experience.  It is to be hoped that controls of fishing at sea and of fishing by anglers will not have the effect of providing greater opportunities for the greedy, organised, commercial poachers who have been plundering our rivers with impunity for years.</P>
    <P>I conclude these remarks by urging the Minister to consider, before it is too late, the more severe measures of control and conservation which are called for in order to preserve this important natural and national resource.</P>
    <P>Coming now to my general comments, the state of the public finances was described as &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance in this House before last year's budget.  The position, to say the least, has not so far improved.  True, we have had a year of highly expansionary policies which will have raised the gross national product by six per cent or so in real terms for 1978 and given an even bigger boost to personal consumption.  From what I heard the Minister for Economic Planning <Col N="952" /> and Development say in the Dáil, the present expectation is that there will be a net increase of some 17,000 in employment in 1978&mdash;a good achievement, indeed, even if still far short of needs.  The Government would be the first to recognise that the expansionary stimulus of higher public expenditure and borrowing cannot be sustained. There will have to be a move, all the more quickly if we join the EMS, towards safer and more fundamental means of ensuring continuous growth of output and employment.  We have got to get away from excessive Government borrowing and balance of payments deficits.  The sharp increase in Government borrowing this year has been adventitiously facilitated by the inward rush of short-term investment funds associated with the prospect of our entering the EMS without Britain.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last year, the ratio of total public expenditure to GNP, which is a measure of the pre-emption of the community's output by the public sector, was a reasonable 28 per cent 20 years ago but it had already reached 40 per cent before the oil crisis and now exceeds 50 per cent.  The Government are committed to bringing it down to 48 per cent by 1980.  The danger of allowing the present drift to continue is that the Government would be generating a form of inflation just as intolerable as price inflation&mdash;a form revealing itself in large balance of payments deficits requiring equally large foreign borrowing or reductions in reserves and a form also which would be making itself felt even more in high taxation were it not for the enormous current account deficits which are being incurred, £400 million, as you know, this year.  Indeed, the particularly disquieting feature of the public finances is the continuing rapid growth of current expenditure, and of borrowing to finance it.  Current expenditure for many years now has been rising much faster than national production.  I do not mean just in real terms but even in money terms. The pace quickened this year.  The returns for January to September show an increase in current expenditure of 23 per cent over the same period in 1977 and that compares with a budget estimate of an increase for the whole year <Col N="953" /> of 21 per cent.  The total borrowing still seems likely to be of the £800 million order.  If there is any shortfall it seems likely to be on the capital rather than the current side.  Capital expenditure was up only 13 per cent on last year in the nine months period as against an expected 28 per cent for the year as a whole in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper, in the budget speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, in the Green Paper too, the Government committed itself to &ldquo;critical review&rdquo; and &ldquo;containment&rdquo; of current public expenditure.  I do not suppose I will get an answer to the question: &ldquo;Have there been any results yet?&rdquo; Will we see these in the Estimates Volume and in the budget?  The Green Paper mentioned &ldquo;reduction or elimination&rdquo; of &ldquo;some expenditures&rdquo;.  I look forward to seeing what these will be.  I suspect from my own experience that economy in public expenditure is an area in which responsible parenthood, indeed judicious contraception&mdash;since there is no safe period&mdash;is likely to be more effective than belated attempts at infanticide or assassination.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed not only to reducing the overall ratio of borrowing to GNP but, as an essential part of that commitment, to reduce the current account deficit to minimal proportions.  I have welcomed and commended this objective in debates on the White Paper and the Green Paper.  I hope we will see significant progress towards it in the next budget.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to weaken the Government's resolve by conjuring up the spectre of deflation if the borrowing ratio is reduced as planned.  I have already suggested in this House that this argument, apart from being shortsighted and somewhat irresponsible, may also be too pessimistic, because it discounts completely the possibility, indeed necessity, of gearing ourselves in preference to world demand, that is, of gaining more than our share even of slowly growing world demand through making our goods and services more competitive.  If, however, for overwhelming <Col N="954" /> and valid economic reasons, total public borrowing cannot be reduced to the full extent planned and within the time period proposed in the Green Paper, I hope the Government will at least ensure that much less of the total will be for current purposes and that more will be reserved for capital purposes. To me, personally, higher taxation, better spread amongst those who can afford it, would be acceptable as one of the ways of reducing the current deficit and of freeing more of our borrowing capacity for useful employment-giving development of the national infrastructure. That jargon term includes such important things as telecommunications and roads, where grave deficiencies are acknowledged to exist, deficiencies which are impeding the growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, stimulation of the economy through deficit financing cannot go on.  When I spoke briefly here on the EMS on 1 November I suggested that too much attention, perhaps understandably, was being focused on our getting appropriate external conditions of membership, appropriate financial facilities.  I stressed that much greater importance attached to getting the domestic conditions right.</P>
    <P>I listed a number of unsatisfactory features of the domestic economic scene&mdash;the prevalence of extravagant expectations of annual income increases; the weakness of internal trade union discipline; our comparatively poor industrial relations; the level of unemployment; the excessive public borrowing requirement; and the large external payments gap.  Most of these are interrelated. Remedial action is urgent, all the more so if we are joining the EMS.  I would again stress the primacy, as a remedial measure, of genuine moderation of money income claims.  This in the end involves no sacrifice of justifiable real income improvements.  Pay restraint is the most important condition, not only of tolerable co-existence with the EMS if we join but, in any case and more importantly, of progressively attaining our employment objectives.  I was surprised and rather disappointed to find no direct recognition of this point in the recent White Paper on the EMS.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> To sum up, therefore, I put pay restraint in the front line as the most urgent and necessary policy objective. My version of pay restraint is to reward only genuine increases in productivity. Perhaps I should call it pay realism rather than pay restraint.  In my view, no claim for higher real income is justified unless and until it has been earned by a commensurate increase in output.  This pay realism, fortified by economies and restraint in current services, is the key to any significant improvement in the public finances.  Pay bulks very largely in public expenditure.  It is the key to improvements in job creation and it is the key to our being able to make the grade in the EMS if we join.</P>
    <P>That ends my piece of pre-budgetary advice to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity for a slightly broader discussion than we normally have.  I propose to touch very briefly on two areas.  This debate will not be as sound or as valuable as it could be.  I do not feel that there are many debates in either of these Houses which are as valuable as they could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the first point which I want to discuss under the heading of Item 2 in the appropriations list as scheduled here, which is the salaries and expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including grants-in-aid, and the total £3,298,000.  I am well aware that when I am discussing this it might be described as fools rushing in. However, I will press on regardless. There was a time when the salaries of Senators were about three-quarters of the salaries of Deputies and they moved together upwards or downwards, usually upwards.  I understand that since 1971 Senators' salaries have been losing ground steadily.  I am not going to talk just about money.  While the money is bad enough there are other aspects which come under the heading of this Bill, and they involve the back-up facilities, the conditions in which politicians work, the secretarial facilities and the manner in which we are expected to fill our roles.  I am aware that there are various Senators who get a fraction of a <Col N="956" /> secretary's time, but there are others, including myself, who are not entitled to any secretarial help.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Senators are not supposed to be full-time politicians.  We have, therefore, limited sitting hours and the rate of payment reflects our kind of part-time occupation.  Despite that, we should expect the kind of assistance which any middle or junior manager in any size of firm would consider his normal right, some privacy, some place which might be comfortable to work in, telephones for private use and efficient secretarial help.  The reason I said fools rush in is that I seem to be rushing in here.  It seems that an extraordinary reticence affects Irish politicians when it comes to talking about the money that they pay themselves.  It is not difficult to find the reason.  They take terrible &ldquo;stick&rdquo; from the media any time they talk about money for themselves, so they continue to do their work in a Western European Parliament in 1978 with salaries and conditions which seem to me to be more suitable for 1928.  It is not surprising that 50 per cent of Deputies have other jobs to keep them going.  Added to the poor salary and conditions we have insecurity, which is obviously a <i>sine qua non</i> of political life, and poor pension facilities.  All of these things add up to making politicians naturally seek some more secure financial base in their lives from which to operate.</P>
    <P>It is beyond me why we cannot have a system, as so many other countries have, whereby the salaries of politicians are linked to certain grades of civil servants and move as those grades move. This would put an end to the spectacle of politicians cringing from the onslaught of ill-informed public opinion when they vote themselves an increase in salary. Public opinion is ill-informed about the kind of conditions which politicians in other countries enjoy because of the standards expected of them.  Our system of democracy, a two-chamber system, is not general in the world.  If our people expect the Oireachtas to function properly they must pay the price.  We should have the kind of salary which would not attract golddiggers, or whatever term applies to people who are <Col N="957" /> looking for decent wages, but which would not deter the young and the talented either.  I believe the present system is a deterrent.  We should be ashamed of our appallingly inadequate conditions.</P>
    <P>A feature of this is that it discriminates against people who are not sufficiently well-off or do not come from the kind of background where there is a secretary ready to support them in their public work.  It is wrong that Members who do not come from that kind of background should be less well equipped to do their parliamentary work than Members who do.</P>
    <P>If I might briefly turn to Europe, the salaries of the Members of Parliament in other EEC countries are quite dramatic. I am not going to go through the whole list because others may not find it as interesting as I do.  I am taking these figures now from the <i>Hansard</i> report of Question Time in Westminister on 7 March 1978, during which the Prime Minister answered questions relating to EEC salaries.  Britain was the lowest with Members of Parliament getting just over £6,270.  Ireland came second at £6,273 followed by Italy at £10,500.  It went on until it reached the dizzy heights of West Germany where Members of Parliament are paid £22,700.</P>
    <P>Is it a coincidence that the three lowest paid Houses of Parliament are also the three weakest members of the EEC and the poor relations when it comes to EMS?  We must consider the cause.  In Belgium, France and Italy Senators' salaries are almost the same as our Deputies' salaries.  Every EEC country, except ourselves and Britain, links the salaries of their parliamentarians to civil service scales.  We should seriously consider their system.  In West Germany Members of Parliament also receive £13,500 each for their offices outside the Bundestag, which enables them to do their constituency work.  Inside the Bundestag they each have a private office and secretary.  They have free travel in Germany and unlimited postage facilities.  Need I go on?  Perhaps we are talking about cloud-cuckooland in an Irish context when we talk about <Col N="958" /> that kind of figure.  We must remember than the West German economy is in a healthy state; it is in a commanding position in Europe.  Is it a coincidence that they treat their politicians seriously?</P>
    <P>Recently we discussed the people who will represent Ireland in a new European Parliament after the direct elections.  At first, their salaries were going to be quite high but now they are going to be equivalent to the present salaries of Deputies plus some expenses.  From my limited experience of European travel on business and from talking to people who travel a great deal, it seems to be some kind of endurance test to actually get to the place where you are supposed to do your business.  Once our unfortunate representatives reach wherever the Parliament happens to be sitting they will be disadvantaged in comparison with their European colleagues.  They will sit beside people who are better briefed, better paid, who have assistants bring them all the right documents for different discussions, and who are serious politicians doing a serious European job with serious European salaries.</P>
    <P>The situations we seem to be heading towards is that we are going to have 15 part-timers representing us in Europe, which we cannot afford.  The 15 people who go to Europe need to make an impact out of all proportion to their numbers.  We cannot afford to have our European representatives looking over their shoulders at what is going on in their local constituencies because they are depending on that salary as well to keep some kind of equilibrium.  I feel that we must consider very carefully the kind of standards we are applying here.  We have been penny-pinching for too long and we should put this area in order. People have complained of inadequate service and inadequate leadership from politicians.  That kind of inadequate service and leadership will continue to cause a vicious circle of criticism.</P>
    <P>The sum of £26 million is listed in the schedule for the salaries and expenses of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is costing £26 million to collect the various kinds of taxes which we must remind ourselves are levied on an unwilling and resentful PAYE section to the tune of 87 <Col N="959" /> per cent.  I hope not to stray from the permitted areas of debate but what I have to say in this area is related to the efficiency of the people who are getting £26 million for doing it.  The tax inspectors are beavering away at a most unpopular job which must be related to the figure also of £390 million for the Department of Social Welfare, which is also listed in the Schedule.  I should like to mention some figures which a medium employer in a craft industry gave me recently.  A man earning £90 a week paid £26.14 to the Government between income tax, insurance stamp and pay-related insurance.  The company paid £5.26 for the stamp.  If he was made redundant, the State would pay him £50 a week.  If he were unemployed, neither he nor the company would be paying anything to the State, so the State would lose £31.40 added to the £50 that they would be paying him if he was unemployed, thus costing the State £81.40. The man is employed at the moment and he has take-home pay of £63.84 so you could say he is working 40 hours a week for a nett £13.84, or 34p an hour.  That is not an incentive for anybody to work, and that kind of wage level is echoed right through the economy.  It is typical profile of somebody earning that kind of money.  For married couples who are working the tax burden is even higher.</P>
    <P>PAYE and social welfare contributions between them have created a situation where there is little difference whether people are employed or unemployed. If they are unemployed the cost to the State is enormous.  When people could not care less about their work and when they feel that the State could not care less whether they are working, it is a bad indication for the economy generally.</P>
    <P>We should take a broad look at the way in which revenue is collected.  The burden of taxation is going to fall upon so few productive workers that it will began to operate a disastrous law of diminishing returns.  The Minister is aware, as most of us are, that there is a flourishing industry in this town of chartered accountants who are engaged in creating schemes for the avoidance of tax for their highly-paid clients.  As their <Col N="960" /> schemes get more and more sophisticated the Revenue Commissioners devise more sophisticated means to collect tax.  It is a highly-paid and sterile sort of industry.  Many of the people engaged in that work have told me that they do not like it because they feel it is unproductive and sterile.  But if we take 60p in the £ from entrepreneurs what else can we expect?</P>
    <P>The higher rates of taxation should be reduced to 50 per cent.  The people who avoid the higher taxes and the chartered accountants who help them should be put in jail.  We should be strict in regard to tax avoidance and we should reduce the higher rates which are causing the corruption in the first place.  A fair rate of income tax would get a fair response from citizens.  At the lower levels of tax PAYE penalises the middle and lower income groups to the extent that it saps their incentive.  The higher levels of 60 per cent are a slap in the face for successful entrepeneurs who do not see why they should bother expanding their businesses.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of PAYE is that it severely affects the craft industries which require a great deal of care and patience, more so than in the mass-production type of industry on which we seem to be spending a great deal of time and money without being sure that that kind of industry has a place in the economy or the environment.  I can see that we are not going to be able to emulate the success story of Waterford Glass.  But even if we could encourage native industry to the point where we had ten companies a quarter of the size of Waterford Glass, they would have a turnover of £250 million and provide 24,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>Taxation does not mean tinkering with budgets.  We should be talking about the manner in which revenue is collected.  Removing car tax and making wealthy people wealthier by removing rates is not the way to approach taxation.</P>
    <P>Jobs have to be important to people and I believe people have to be important to jobs.  If those two factors do not operate the present industrial and social chaos will increase.  There is no doubt <Col N="961" /> that a person who is doing an honest and productive week's work should be financially rewarded and should find himself in happier financial circumstances than someone who is not working.  It is important to look after the unemployed and to make sure that they are well treated.  If everybody who was doing honest productive work was suitably rewarded it would increase their morale and we might not have the kind of disasterous figures mentioned by Senator Whitaker of 100,000 unemployed and £650 million of a trade deficit.  It is an unhealthy looking score for a country with only three million people.  Whether we are in or out of the EMS will not solve our difficulties. It is going to present us with far more challenges than escape routes.  We could find ourselves in deep water if we do not make a great effort to solve our problems.  The kind of imagination and talent that are needed will not be found in the area of politics if we go on making politics a dreary, uphill difficult job.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas are falling below their potential we have no one to blame but ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of year it is appropriate that we should have an opportunity to expand on some of the things that have been discussed throughout the year in this House.  The number of jobs created this year was 17,000, the largest net increase in employment for many years.  In the circumstances we should be congratulating ourselves, but many problems are still arising.  A number of factors have tended to slow our progress, and these include a far from satisfactory industrial relations situation.  Too many people are inclined to blame the workers in all cases of industrial chaos.  Quite often the workers are not to blame.  Employers and managers are too involved in projections and do not deal with the day-to-day problems that are encountered by their workers.  This causes frustration amongst the workers.  Sometimes delays in settling legitimate claims can exacerbate the problem.  A strike can occur for a reason which is totally different from the original cause of the workers' grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Our industrial relations legislation must be brought up to date to meet the needs of a modern society which is changing every day and which is a lot more complex than it was five or ten years ago.  Too many of our managers were trained in industrial relations situations which are totally removed from today's industrial situations.  They have not got the expertise in man management. They have not got the expertise to run the businesses as they should be run. In a sense, the worker is made a scapegoat too many times because of the employer's lack of expertise.</P>
    <P>I have no time for the disruption that is caused by the unofficial striker who has no regard for the rights of his fellow workers, who could not care less what happens, except that he has some minor problem that can only be resolved by standing on the road and preventing other people from going about their legitimate jobs.  I often wonder where these people get their sense of values. Are they getting them from the Irish or are they importing them?  Where do they get the funds to stay out on unofficial strike?  Are they being sponsored by international bodies which have no regard or interest in the Irish State, who do not want the Irish State to run efficiently and who might, in the main, have as objectives the doing away with the institutions of this State?  A genuine appeal must be made to everybody in the industrial sector, to politicians to the business entrepreneur, whether he be public or private sector, and to the workers to look at the damage that is caused to the future prospects of our young people, and people who are not even born yet.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem is created for the disadvantaged in our society.  The more people who are out of work the bigger the burden there is on the State to provide services for the disadvantaged here&mdash;and there are many of them.  It is easy for us to talk about Ireland being a country which is advancing and which is prosperous.  Indeed, it is prosperous for many of us, but it is not prosperous for the person who is out of work, who is sick and who has no hope of getting off the ground.  People who disrupt the normal economic running of this State are <Col N="963" /> contributing to the grave problems these people have in trying to live here.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson highlighted many of the social problems which upset our society.  I was disappointed in one regard and that was her seemingly lack of charity when she did not acknowledge the degree of involvement of the people who look after the children in Loughan House.  It seems to me that she feels there is a certain breed of person who can magically arise and look after children who are mentally retarded in some manner or who have come from bad environment and never know any home life.  She thinks the people who look after these children in Loughan House are insensitive.  She made excuses on a number of occasions by saying that she is not against them, but in her next sentence she said they were not qualified and that basically they were insensitive.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the body of men who look after these children are normal people who had normal training to do an abnormal job.  Nobody in this country can be trained to look after children who have grown up in an area where they have never had sympathy from anybody, where their social conditions have been atrocious, and unless they are taken out of this environment, they would never have had a chance to live a normal life in this country.  Hopefully Loughan House will not have to continue indefinitely, but it is a solution that had to be tried and hopefully, in the short-term, it will do a good job.  By the short-term I mean that somebody might come along in the very near future, with a magic wand and wave it over Ireland and in doing so do away with the social problems which create the conditions which make the kind of people who have to be sent to Loughan House.</P>
    <P>We must become more aware of the problems that exist in our country.  We must become more involved in the solutions that have been found in other countries to similar problems.  We are a young country with the youngest population of any country in Europe definitely and possibly in the world.  The fact of our newness and youngness creates problems that our parents and even those in the middle age group never had <Col N="964" /> to tackle.  Twenty years ago Ireland was a totally rurally oriented country.  Today people all over Ireland are subjected to the influence of the modern media. Whether it be television, radio or newspaper, they are subjected to influences from all over the world.  It is not often that people who have lived in a quiet rural area can assimilate what they see and hear on the media.  This has had an effect on the country.  It has had good effects in certain areas but definitely it has had bad effects in other areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the need for legislation in the family law area, and I agree with her wholeheartedly.  As local representatives, 90 per cent of the problems we come across are problems that are created by the strains and stresses of modern living.  Whether it be a couple who have taken on mortgage repayments and suddenly find they cannot meet them, or whether it be that a wife has gone away from her husband or that a husband has gone away from his wife, or bad housing, the effect is still the same.  There is discord.  Once there is discord there is a need for some type of legislation to ease the burden on the partner who has been disadvantaged.  I do not think you can set up courts to legislate for family problems.  This is an area which has to be treated very gently because the human factor is involved and you are meeting people when they are at their lowest ebb, mentally and physically.  The thought of going into a court puts a lot of people off from looking for their rights.  There is a need for legislation which can bring in a family type tribunal where people can be met informally and where their problems will be thrashed out and possible solutions found.  If the solutions cannot be found, and if there is to be a break-up, each partner should be treated equally and there should be no blame on either side. If there are children involved they should be looked after as best the State and the separated parent can to ensure that the children of problem marriages do not end up as problems for the State in the future, or as problems in their own marriages.</P>
    <P>Most of what I said has been in the area of family problems and worker relation <Col N="965" /> problems.  This country has a chance to succeed if the people have the will to allow it to succeed.  At present it seems as if the will is not there to the degree that it should be.  Let us hope that in the next 12 months we will not stand up here and talk about the same problems we are talking about to-day.</P>
    <P>We are on the threshold of a new era, if we go into the EMS.  What it holds for us I am not too sure, but if it gives the Irish people the realisation that they cannot drag out of anybody's coat tails, that they have got to work for what they get and that we have a country that is worth living for, at the end of next year it would be very satisfactory for me to stand here and address the House on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the present state of the Irish economy, and having regard to the EMS negotiations which are still continuing, one of the main preoccupations of this country at present is the extent of the Government's indebtedness. We have lived through a period of massive spending and boosts to the consumer demand in the economy but we are reaching the point where certain chickens are coming home to roost and where a party must be paid for at a not too distant date.  Entirely independent of the EMS issue and the loans which we will get, which in turn will lead to a certain subsidy, and apart altogether from an indebtedness which that may lead to if we enter, it is sobering to look at the extent of indebtedness in this country at present.  Our foreign borrowing total is higher than that of any other EEC country and the extent of our foreign indebtedness presently runs at the extent of 30 per cent of our GNP. That is an alarming percentage of our GNP.  I was a witness recently outside this country to some disparaging remarks made by people in other Governments about the level of Irish indebtedness and the problems that would be created for this country on entry into the EMS because of the further extent of indebtedness that is envisaged, should we enter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the present <Col N="966" /> Government and the last Government, of which I was a backbench member, is that this Government tended to be critical when the Coalition were in power.  There was certainly a large level of borrowing but it was borrowing that took place during the oil crisis which hit every country in Europe, and without which the economy could not have been sustained.  It was not simply borrowing for the sake of borrowing, for a false type of fuelling of the economy.  Around the middle of last year we were beginning to get things right in the sense that the deficit was declining, foreign currency reserves were rising and things were coming back on an even keel.  At the present time, the colossal extent of borrowing and the boost to consumer demand have set events in motion which are very alarming.</P>
    <P>To start with, the fact that the money supply has loosened in the economy in the last 18 months has led to a massive consumer boom.  One of stated aims of Irish Government policy has been the Buy Irish Campaign.  We had speeches from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy about a year ago with projections that we would get a 3 per cent swing over from imported goods to Irish manufactured goods, which in turn would lead to the creation of so many thousand jobs.  But that is not happening. What is happening is that the consumer boom is leading to a massive amount of purchasing of imported goods.  It is worth reflecting on the extent to which this is happening, and the extent to which we are running into serious financial difficulty.  If we talk about our exports and imports and what is termed the import excess, meaning the numbers of millions of pounds, in a particular month or year, our imports exceed our exports, we begin to see the root of the problem.  In the latest statistics for October this year, the import excess was £73.9 million, approximately £74 million. Even more alarming for the September figure the import excess was £27.7 million.  This meant that in the most recent month for which we have statistics, there was an increase of £46 million.  In comparison with the same month last year, there was an increase of £36.2 million.  This is the clearest possible <Col N="967" /> evidence of the train of events and of the extent to which the spending that is happening in this country is of benefit to jobs.  To a large extent about half the spending at the present time is leading to the creation of jobs in Japan, Germany, Britain, France and the United States. This is absolutely true.</P>
    <P>Again the import excess in the ten months from January to October this year was £672 million.  For the ten months in 1977 the import excess was £523 million.  That means there has been an increase in the ten months of £149 million.  The total import figure in February this year was £266 million. Imports for October were £338.8 million, an increase of about £80 million.</P>
    <P>This very grave disimprovement in the balance of payments has got to lead to a crucial decision for the Government which they must tackle by either increased taxation or reduced purchasing of foreign goods.  The import figure for July 1977 was £262.5 million, an import excess of £17 million; in October 1978 the figure was £338.8, which I mentioned, and the increase in that period from July 1977 to October 1978, in terms of imports is £80 million.  The increase of the excess amounts to 225 per cent.  This is an alarming indication of the present trend.</P>
    <P>While the initial reaction of the general public to the budget of last year might have been one of pleasure at the extent to which one's pocket was helped, through car tax and total relief from rates on housing and such matters, the long-term effects of that budget are implicit in the statistics which I quoted and which means that in the long-term the Government have to face up to these issues, this will result in a period of deflation that can be very much worse than the inflationary period during which these events happened.</P>
    <P>What it means is that the tax increases which were needed were not used for productive purposes but to pay off the bills implied in the promises made before the last general election.  In the Dáil last June the Taoiseach commented on the Green Paper and on the balance of payments deficits.  He said that the accentuation of the consumer goods coming <Col N="968" /> into this country could aggravate the balance of payments to a point where corrective measures would be necessary and that these corrective measures would affect the prospects for employment.</P>
    <P>It would be fair comment to ask the Taoiseach what corrective measures he now suggests are necessary in view of the deficit he is talking about and to what extent does he see them as affecting the prospects for employment.  In essence what I am saying is what type of policy which at first sight might have been acceptable to the general public, on a closer look by economists and people who understood what economics is about, had very alarming prospects in the longer term which were pointed to at that time.  We are presently at the stage where the Government will have to face up to these issues with very hard decisions that will be anything but palatable. The Government, in agreement with the EEC, agreed to reduce over two years the extent of foreign indebtedness from 13 per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we take the Government's word at face value and if we give them good faith in what their objective is, this reduction in the borrowing level from 13 per cent of GNP to 8 per cent in a two-year period means the Government will have to raise about £400 million which must come by one of two methods, either by increased taxation or reduced expenditure. We cannot have it both ways.  We either run with this huge level of foreign indebtedness and allow future generations to pay for the party, or, alternatively, we come to grips with this indebtedness and attempt to reduce it.  In addition the Government will also find it necessary to raise £200 million to pay for borrowing in 1978 and 1979, that is, the compiling of repayment and interest, which is a total of £600 million.</P>
    <P>There are people without a grasp of these items who believe this country is in a very healthy state and do not realise the immense problems there are incorporated in this whole issue of indebtedness. When we go from that to the EMS we begin to realise the seriousness of the problem.  While joining the EMS might well be the lesser of two evils for <Col N="969" /> this country it is no panacea for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>The first crucial fact about the EMS issue is the fact that what we have been offered by the wealthier countries of Europe has not been non-repayable cash grants; what we have been offered are loans.  Reverting to the extent of the indebtedness which I have described and the Government's commitment to the reduction of that level of indebtedness, entry into the EMS would certainly help our economy in the short-term by giving us a boost of loans from other countries. But loans simply mean further indebtedness, and loans mean repayments of loans.  Commentators have been talking about net cash grants to this country if we join the EMS.  There has been a great deal of confusion in this regard because of the Taoiseach's initial press conference and subsequent statements. The Taoiseach said initially that this country would be getting £45 million a year in loans whereas the £45 million was not a loan but an estimate of the grant to his country through an interest subsidy.  What we are getting is an offer from the EEC of a soft loan of £1,125 million over five years, which is £225 million per year.  It is called a soft loan because we get an interest subsidy which amounts to about 3 per cent.  A 3 per cent interest subsidy on the principle sum means a grant equivalent to about £45 million a year, but that is very different from saying it is £45 million into our pockets every year because again we are reverting to the loan situation.</P>
    <P>The borrowing of £1,125 million over five years can of course lead to substantial developments and infrastructure which will be beneficial.  In the first three or four years we will not be under any intense pressure for repayments due to the fact that there will be a moratorium. After the period of the moratorium we will run into the period of repayment of both principal and interest which, at the present level of indebtedness and before going into EMS, means that for at least the next decade successive Governments will have to come to grips with these issues. In the next few months we will have to face these problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> As I said, EMS loans are not grants, and loans have to be repaid.  That is an essential point.  There was a great deal of muddling which was not the work of the Opposition but of the Government. There was an attempt by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to blame the press.  They had their notes and had got it absolutely right.  There were recent attempts to suggest that when Mr. Chirac came to Cork the Press were wrong when they reported what he said about the European Parliament.  The journalists collectively issued a statement referring to the fact that they were absolutely correct in what they had reported as apparently was the reporter whose notes were available after the Minister's speech in Clontarf.  This motion of attempting to criticise the Press for all of these issues is wearing a bit thin.</P>
    <P>Another point that should be dealt with is a political point relating to the EMS issue, our involvement within the EEC and the links which Irish parties have there.  I note from reading reports of the EMS negotiations the marked reluctance of France to help the Irish position.  There may have been rapport initially when the Taoiseach visited Giscard D'Estaing in Paris, but obviously subsequently there seems to have been a great deal of reluctance and digging in of heels by the French.  From the comments in the international Press I see that the principal agent at work to pressure the French Government into adopting a very hard attitude where Ireland is concerned and not to yield any concession in the regional fund area, without France getting its share&mdash;the regional fund could have been used as an instrument for what is termed the net transfer of resources&mdash;was the same Mr. Chirac, the Leader of the Gaullist Party which is a party in Government in France at present.  So far as the European Parliament is concerned, and where various parties in this country have links with parties in the mainstream of Europe, the link between Fianna Fáil and the Gaullist Party becomes more and more fascinating every week.</P>
    <P>Mr. Chirac made a speech in Cork in which he expressed the view that he was <Col N="971" /> sorry European elections were taking place, and that even if they were taking place, they would be working within the Gaullist Party to limit severely the extent of its powers.  This was said by the leader of a party which is aligned with the largest political party in this State.  In this State there is a consensus that a strong European Parliament is in the interests of the smaller nations, and possibly detrimental to the interests of the larger nations.  The link between Fianna Fáil and the Gaullists becomes less logical every day of this week.  I believe that Fianna Fáil should face up to this issue by breaking loose from the Gaullist Party which is acting in a manner totally detrimental to any question of European co-operation, European unity or the type of Europe which those of us in Ireland and some other countries are keen on building.</P>
    <P>Under the Appropriation Bill we are talking in the largest sense about the economy and the wellbeing of the country.  If we are talking about the EMS issue and the negotiations that were involved in that it is relevant to talk about the French position and the attitude within France to those negotiations which, in turn, influence this.</P>
    <P>One of the principal issues here is the level of indebtness, the commitment of the Government to reduce borrowing from 13 per cent to 8 per cent of GNP over a ten year period.  This in turn means the raising of £400 million by increased taxation or reduced expenditure. In addition, there is £200 million which is necessary to pay for the borrowings related to 1978-79, and the repayment of principal and interest on that.  This will lead to a crunch we have to get to grips with.  It can well lead to a deflationary policy which need not have happened had policy for the past 18 months been on a more even keel with a more even type of development, without this massive boost, some of the effects of which are extremely undesirable.</P>
    <P>The principal undesirable affect will be the extraordinary level of imports. There was an increase from £27 million in September 1978 to £74 million in October 1978.  The huge proportion of the <Col N="972" /> jobs being created by this consumer boom are being created in countries outside Ireland&mdash;in Japan, Germany, Britain, France and in Eastern Europe.  It is a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the EMS.  The gross interest payable on the loan we will get will amount to more than £1 billion, which will be mitigated by the interest subsidies, the 3 per cent interest subsidies equivalent to £45 million a year, or a total of £225 million. This means that the interest outflow over the term of the EMS loan will amount to more than £800 million.  That is in addition to the present enormous level of indebtness which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We welcome the subvention from the EEC concerning drainage in western areas.  The administrative problems being experienced at present will probably be sorted out but the subvention is welcome.  However, there are areas in the west to which EEC funds could flow. That is not happening.  On the question of roads Mayo has the largest proportion of untarred county roads at present and there is an enormous backlog of schemes for the tarring of roads leading to farm houses.  The same could be said about counties from Donegal down to Cork.  In the past few months an EEC policy has been adopted under which Italy and France are getting EEC loans for this purpose.  There is a huge anomaly in that the governments of France and Italy can negotiate successfully with the EEC to get grants for their farm roads, rural electrification schemes and other schemes that have to do with farm life in underdeveloped areas such as the south of Italy.  When they talk about undeveloped areas of France there are none there that could compare with the lesser developed parts of this country.</P>
    <P>If these are schemes under which roads are being tarred in Italy and France under EEC subventions there is no reason why roads here, particularly in the west, should not be funded from the same source.  I urge the Government to make immediate representation to find out why there is this anomaly and why these two countries are getting these grants for purposes for which we need money to an extraordinary extent.  They <Col N="973" /> should ask why this scheme cannot be extended to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is lack of Government policy concerning parts of the west which are not in Gaeltacht areas.  I regret that the Government chose to scrap the decision of the previous administration to establish a Western Development Board.  I questioned the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, on this and I was pleased to learn that the Government are looking at this issue of regional development and possible decentralisation in certain areas. I am not concerned about titles of such boards and whatever the Government choose to call it is acceptable if we get the type of structures required.  One of the biggest anomalies in western development is that we are seeing a policy under which there is a special type of economic plan for Gaeltacht areas.  However, in those parts of the west which are equally impoverished, but which are English speaking, there is a totally different structure.  We all respect our language and traditions and see the need for a special policy for the language, culture and heritage but we see this as being necessary in the cultural and educational area.  However, when we see this spilling over to special incentives in the economic field, special grants in certain areas, while areas beside them that are English speaking do not get a fraction of those incentives we see positive discrimination and a lack of human rights.  It is reaching the stage in some parts, such as the difference between north Connemara and south Connemara, in which there are remarkable developments in south Connemara on the fringe of Galway city which is Gaeltacht, but north Connemara is starved of the same type of development because of this problem.  In Mayo we see even greater anomalies. We see part of Achill in the Gaeltacht with special benefits, parts that are not. We see Ballycroy, between there and Erris, is very badly off for developments but does not get the same level of grant. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There is an island policy under which there are special incentives for those <Col N="974" /> people who live on Aran and those who live off Aranmore.  We see discrimination against the people who live on Clare Island or who live on Inisturk, off the Mayo coastline, or Inisbofin, off the Galway coastline.  About one year ago we were told that policies would emerge under which the islanders on Clare Island, Inisbofin and Inisturk would get the same deal.  That did not happen.  It has reached the stage on Clare Island where a committee there are seeking to make the case legally that under the Constitution they are entitled to similar treatment which, in fact, they are not getting.  It was because of those backgrounds, and illogical and one-handed development that we sought to establish the type of structure in the west under which a board would be established with autonomy, made responsible to a Minister in Government, and responsible for all aspects of western development in agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism.  It meant that in that part of the country which is uniquely different from any other part we established a special type of policy run by people in that province who understood it.  In view of our involvement in the EEC and the fact that for the European Parliament there is a special constituency entitled Connacht-Ulster it would have proved to be a catalyst which could be illustrated by this State to show that part of the country in that organisational area which needed special help and assistance.  I hope that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who answered me favourably some months ago when he said that the Government were investigating this sub-national need will be able to tell us that a structure similar to that which we have been talking about will emerge.</P>
    <P>In so far as SFADCo is concerned, the Government were ill-advised in taking away the promotional facility which they had because it tended to make it much more a province of the IDA's national office in Dublin and took away the small independence which they had before that.  The substituting of that for a policy in which they say that in future SFADCo will deal with small industries in a special way in that region can only be described as a gimmick.  We had a <Col N="975" /> very sensible policy for small industries before this under the county development team programme.  I compliment the Fianna Fáil Government on establishing that county development team programme.  It worked well and meant that in western counties we had a structure under which a county development officer worked in liaison with the county manager, the chairman of the county council and the various heads in the different areas of vocational education and agriculture and other areas.  We had sensible development at the most local level. SFADCo, in moving into the small industries scheme in some counties are moving in to do a job that was being tackled adequately.  There is no reason why they should have a function in counties in Connacht where that function is already being serviced within the county council structural unit which is a local unit for development and all that goes with that.  This move was ill-advised and somewhat gimmicky.</P>
    <P>Another western issue about which I have a view relates to the question of air services development.  We had a discussion last week on air services and some Members sought cheaper travel in and out of the country.  Members also referred to Aer Lingus's performance.  I agree with the whole question of cheap travel because it can generate for an island country such as ours a great deal of traffic which would otherwise not happen. The experiences in Britain under Freddie Laker's plan whereby the amount of traffic across the Atlantic through cheap fares has dramatically increased should be a lesson to us.  Earlier this year, those going to the United States at short notice without pre-booking tickets found it was cheaper to fly from here to London and from there to New York than it was to fly directly from Shannon to New York. That is the type of anomaly which should not be happening.  It is something which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>In so far as the west is concerned there is a serious issue which has not got much publicity but which is very important. We are in an age of subsidised transport. We have the transport services of CIE subsidised up to the hilt because we are told that it is a part of a social pattern <Col N="976" /> and to an extent air travel is subsidised. In Britain there are air services going to Inverness, to the outer Hebrides, to Benbecula, to the islands of Harris and Lewis.  What is happening there is that the more lucrative fares from London to Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Continental routes are helping to subsidise what they term a social service which is necessary in the interests of those more outlying areas in parts of the north of England, north of Scotland and the islands off the Scottish coast.</P>
    <P>There is a great weakness in public transport policy here in regard to air transport.  While Dublin Airport is an international airport serving a certain radius and Cork Airport again serves a certain radius working around from the south-east to the south-west, and Shannon Airport, an international airport, serves a radius from Cork across to Tipperary and up to Galway city, when one gets to the north-west there is no air service. I am talking about the area which would service Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Donegal, West Longford and Cavan.  There is no such thing as a decent airport in that area.  There are severe problems because of that lack. For example, at present some of the larger manufacturing companies operating in the west when they fly their executives in they arrange that they fly from Shannon or Dublin in special small aircraft into the smaller airports.  That shows the significance of air travel.  If we are trying to attract a higher rate of industrial development, if we are to encourage people to establish industries in our more remote counties in the west and in the north-west, we are at a grave disadvantage if we do not have a decent airport within about an hour or an hour-and-a-half's drive.</P>
    <P>Additionally, there is the question of the mass movements in tourism.  If one looks at international air travel and international tourism one will see an enormous growth in tourism in regions which are within an hour of an international airport.  One of the reasons for the high level of tourist development in Cork-Kerry at present in contrast with the level of development in the Mayo-Sligo-Roscommon-Donegal <Col N="977" /> areas is the fact that this air link exists and that people from other countries can fly to within about one hour of those resorts.  The remoteness of the north-west from airports is a limiting factor.  It is probably not recognised as much by the public as it should be for the reason that many people do not grasp the significance of something until they have it and then lose it.  They then know what they have lost.</P>
    <P>The Government should make a study of this issue and, without being parochial, whether it is in Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon or North Galway would not worry me too much.  It may require subsidy, but subsidy is, apparently, an accepted part of transport whether it is ground or air transport.  There is a need for an airport development.  The limitations on the small airfields are very grave.  They are limited in length.  They are limited by the fact that they do not have lighting systems which confines them to daylight hours.  That means that they are practically out of the question in the winter months, except for a few hours.  The airport in Castlebar in Mayo has the most severe limitation because it has a short runway between the main railway line and the main road from Castlebar to Dublin.  The airport people have not got permission to cut that main road.  In my view two things should happen: they should get permission to extend that runway, if that is feasible, or, alternatively, if that cannot happen a decent airport should be built somewhere in the broad interests of the public of these counties.</P>
    <P>Another point has been made, that no Government have got to grips with what is loosely described as the services sector, the services sector being the type of employment provided in offices and stores.  It is interesting that in many other countries where they seek to get developments going in the more outlying areas, in addition to giving grants and special incentives for the development of pure industry as we are doing they also give grants for the development of the service sector.  That means that per worker employed, per unit, or per square <Col N="978" /> foot, a special grant is given.  There has not been any development of that type here.  There is an imbalance here because we have a huge proportion of jobs in the service sector in Dublin which is outgrowing its facilities, its road structure and ability to cope with the increased population.  Additionally, in this service sector socially we have a great many girls working in Dublin who could be much happier in many cases working in that part of the country from which they came initially.  If there is not some special type of Government policy, and a special incentive to try to get the services sector out of Dublin and into other towns we will not see it happen to the extent it should.  It would be socially and economically desirable that that should happen.</P>
    <P>On EEC enlargement the Government need to cast a jaundiced eye.  We know that within the protocol it has been established&mdash;it was put on record initially by Deputy Garrett FitzGerald and, subsequently, the Taoiseach&mdash;that Ireland welcomes EEC enlargement to include Portugal, Spain and Greece, for reasons to do with democracy and the broadening of Europe.  At the same time we do not want to see the enlargement of Europe take place at the expense of Ireland's national aspiration in line with Treaty of Rome and what is implicit in that in areas such as the common agricultural policy and areas that have to do with regional policy.  We have to take a fairly jaundiced look at this after the EMS negotiations in which we ran into the crudity of certain power blocs, where at the end of the day the expected commitment to us did not exist.  We need to be extremely wary on this issue of enlargement.  As the population expands to include those three very underdeveloped countries within the EEC and if we do not have a commitment by the governments of the EEC to increase, proportionately, the funds they are prepared to put into areas such as the common agricultural policy and regional policy, we will be in for a very rude awakening.  Rather than having a situation where we would be getting an increased proportion of funds into those areas, the cake will become smaller and, proportionately, we will get much less <Col N="979" /> unless we are extremely wary and diligent in tackling this issue at every stage of the enlargement debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak on this issue.  Our democratic set-up is at risk on occasions if appropriate action is not taken in order to ensure that the law is upheld.  Any back-down on this situation, or any disrespect for the law, means that many people will either take the law into their own hands or have little regard for the appropriate Department that deals with law and order.  The whole question of law and order and the whole question of upholding of it is rather terrifying.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the security forces, the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces for the manner in which they have carried out their duties. There are gun-thugs and bandits of one type or another roaming around with firearms and no regard for the lives of our people.  Recently in my area a security man was shot.  We have also seen gardaí being shot.  Until such time as we change our attitude to these killers this situation will continue.  I do not think the law is tough enough on this section of the community who take the law into their own hands, have no regard for the rights of the community or for democracy.</P>
      <P>It is because of the soft-pedalling that goes on from time to time and the soft measures applied to these people when apprehended means that more people are taking the law into their own hands. There are many Bugsy Malones and bank bandits roaming around.  From the statements made recently I understand that appropriate action is being taken to stiffen the process of apprehension. Nevertheless, there is much more at stake than that.  The public have a responsibility also because in many cases they are shielding these people from the law, possibly through fear or the neglect of duty.  They have a duty to the country and to their own families.  It is all too sad to see people being gunned down in the manner the security guard was gunned down in the Dublin suburbs. This type of violence must cease and we must get tough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Rape is almost like the common cold throughout this city.  No matter where one goes people are afraid to report it. Horrifying cases came to our attention but the great majority of cases of rape in the city are not reported because of fear or threats.  We have reached an appalling situation in this regard and we must examine our consciences.  The Government must take further action to ensure that people can walk our streets without fear of any type.  Violence and rape and the other things that have been happening are appalling in the extreme and the necessary measures must be taken to deal with these people.  These people must be removed from society quickly.  I will support the ultimate measures if they will rid the country of the rapists, the gun-thugs and the bandits who are taking the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see members of the security forces being gunned down.  This has happened on many occasions.  Many gardaí have given their lives to protect ours but we have scant regard for that. We say it is very sad that this is happening but what do the community do in this regard?  Do they report information? Many people are withholding information.  Those with information should come forward and give it to the Garda so that these bank bandits can be apprehended.</P>
    <P>In many areas people have been intimidated and threatened.  This is a serious situation.  If democracy is to break down we are all at fault.  I appeal to the people, in common with Members of these Houses, to toughen the law to ensure that these people are brought to justice at the earliest possible moment.  I hope this disgusting situation in relation to rape in the city, where rapists are at liberty in almost every street in this city will be brought to an end.  Those of us who have gone around many parts of the city know the appalling stories of girls who, after going to police stations, returned home and dropped the charges. They did so because they were told by their advisers that they might have to give evidence.  I hope that the law is changed so that this situation can be highlighted and people unfortunate to be caught in this trap can have the cover of <Col N="981" /> the law.  Successive Governments have been guilty of disregarding many aspects of the law.  We are all aware of this cover-up situation or the putting in abeyance of problems.</P>
    <P>We are aware of a contraceptive shop that opened recently which is flouting the law.  If they are wrong the shop should be closed down and the people punished.  There is no substitute for justice.  It must be applied.  I do not think a group of people who set themselves up against the law, whether it is in Harcourt Street or on the university campus, should be allowed boast that they can freely dispose of contraceptives, to other people.  Those people on the university campus, where recently the Taoiseach spoke, clearly indicated that they were using contraceptives.  They will be the leaders of society tomorrow.  What type of society will we have if they do not uphold the law and if they are going to encourage other people to break it?</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the law I do not like but I must adhere to it.  There is the question of the bigamist who can sleep on the wrong side of the law for the rest of his life.  But if I park my car on the wrong side of the road I get a ticket. If there is a problem we should tackle it. We should not brush it under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Many other problems have been brushed under the carpet from time to time.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have been responsible for soft-peddalling in certain directions.  I hope the Minister for Justice will take a hard look at the various problems, whether they are family problems or other problems, where the law is disregarded, particularly by the State.  If the State fails to uphold the law and ensure that the law is maintained, then other people will have scant regard for it.  I often feel, when I get a ticket on my car, like taking other action.  That is the situation which has developed over a long period.  Certain things are played down right under the carpet.  With other people, it is applied with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>We heard about the breathalyser.  I saw on the paper an advertisement in relation to the breathalyser.  That is the <Col N="982" /> first I heard about it for many months since it was brought into operation. Where are all the people whose tests were found to be positive?  What happened to them all?  I do not read much in the papers about convictions.  If these people have been apprehended the law should be applied and there should be no covering up of the situation.  If there is a defect in the law, the law should be changed to meet the situation whether it is in that or any other field.  Many people have lost their lives on the road through drunken drivers.  I have no regard whatsoever for a drunken driver.  He is as bad as the gun thug who raids a bank because he takes the lives of innocent people by taking charge of a vehicle.  I hope that the law will be upheld.  When it is seen to be upheld people will be encouraged to come forward with the necessary information.  I do not want people to be police informers but I want them to come forward when issues in relation to the common good of the community are involved.  Where people's lives are being put at risk, where families are being put at risk, where people are being intimidated then we have a duty to come forward, and that duty must be clear to everyone.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a variety of problems&mdash;some of them were mentioned in relation to family law&mdash;need to be dealt with, and the quicker the better. Some laws need to be revised.  I know that changing the law is a long and tedious business.  When a Bill comes before either House it has sometimes a long and rough passage.  The problems that existed before may well be eliminated but other problems can arise. A number of measures are necessary and desirable to bring us into focus with commonsense in the family law area, whether it is a deserted wife or indeed a deserted husband.  There are many of them and, far too often, we do not hear about them.  Problems concerning children, gambling or drink problems, and so on will have an effect on tomorrow's society.  It has an effect on the children of today.  Many of the children of those families are growing up in appalling conditions that could be remedied in a short space of time if proper legislation was available to ensure <Col N="983" /> that the area was fairly and adequately covered.</P>
    <P>The whole question of law-breaking is a very important one.  We had it in the State services some time ago.  We were told about sabotage within the telecommunications section.  There was a positive statement that sabotage did take place.  I have raised this on a number of occasions and I want to state it here again.  I have no time for saboteurs.  People who are employed in sheltered employment, if they are guilty of sabotage, should be disposed of in the quickest possible manner in the best way available.  They should be sorted out because they too are a menace to society.</P>
    <P>During the telecommunications dispute many small businesses went to the wall.  Many people were put into serious situations by virtue of the fact that they could not communicate.  People who make their living by communication find themselves disadvantaged by some section of the community sabotaging the equipment.  It is all too sad.  We have had this in areas other than State Departments where statements were made, from time to time, that equipment was sabotaged.  We have a responsibility to ensure continuity of the essential services that should be available to every person in the State, whether in the local authority area or in the area of the public service that the Government are responsible for.  Some solution must be found so that there will be a continuity of essential services.  Why should the lives of people be put at risk because some person in sheltered employment, be he an engineer in a local authority or otherwise, decides he will not carry out a job that he has agreed to carry out? Where a person has a legitimate problem it should be dealt with immediately.  In some cases there are grievances that go back over four, five and six years.  That is not fair to the people concerned and one has a certain amount of sympathy for the person who takes action after that length of time.  But, on the other hand, if essential services are affected the community is under siege.  I hope that the Minister for Labour, and the other Ministers of State who have <Col N="984" /> responsibility for essential services will find some formula.  If the Labour Court is not effective or if the present machinery is not effective, then we must have new machinery in order to deal with the problems to ensure that nobody is put at risk.</P>
    <P>When we switch on the television now we get a blank screen.  We have seen the busmen at the drop of a hat depriving people of the opportunity to get to and from their employment.  We have seen it in the ESB and in the Corporation.  We had eight million gallons of water a day leaking away out of reservoirs when people were without water in this city.  These are sad situations.  I could go on and on in relation to essential services that have been disrupted in recent times.  One time, to go on strike was an honourable thing to do.  Now apparently, not alone do workers want to go on strike but they mutilate the equipment so that no-one else can repair it or so that it cannot be effectively used.  The law must be applied against the saboteurs wherever they are. I do not accuse people who are on strike and who have not tampered with the equipment of being saboteurs.  We want to see saboteurs apprehended.  Strikes are all too frequent at a time when the nation is endeavouring to get over the many problems that confronted us with our entry into the EEC.  One would think that we would stand behind whatever Government were in power to ensure that the wheels of industry would be maintained in order to penetrate the markets that are at stake, but the reverse is the situation.  There are many people, motivated by influences outside the country, who would disrupt the economy and the entire industrial setup. Some trade unionists will accept less for workers abroad than they will for workers here.  This puts our people in a disadvantaged position.  We must have a general look at the situation where the lives, job opportunities and future of our people are concerned.</P>
    <P>If the machinery that has been established and worked effectively over the years with a fair degree of success is not suitable to meet the requirements of the future, then we should modify it and bring it up to date so that we will have a <Col N="985" /> system of dealing with sudden strikes. We have two problems.  We have the long drawn out situation where the problem has to be fixed at some time. On the other hand, we have the situation where, at the drop of a hat, some person goes outside the gate.  In the Liffey dockyard, we had a farcical situation where a picket was put on the dockyard by a person who was not employed.  On the placard was: &ldquo;I should be employed in there.&rdquo;  The workers stopped going in and made the picket an official one.  At the same time in the dockyard another group who felt that was unjust decided that they would go on unofficial strike action for a productivity allowance for a job that they had already got a productivity allowance to do.  We have this farcical situation that must be dealt with.  If it is not, we will have more of this type of industrial unrest and more people taking irresponsible action.  More people will stop work just for the sake of stopping, and put the livelihoods of many people at stake.  It is sad to think that, when we have some Departments and responsible trade unions asking us to participate in the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and endeavouring to ensure that the machinery of trade unionism is effectively worked, other people are not so co-operative. We must have a look at this whole area again in relation to the modern day problems.</P>
    <P>I have a high regard for civil servants but many of them are attuned to a system that has been in operation for some time.  Change is slow.  We must ensure that the attitude of civil servants and Ministers is changed to meet the modern and developing problems.  The problems of today will not be the problems of tomorrow.  The problems of two years ago are not the problems of today.  We have other problems.  This is a progressive situation where we must take account progressive development. We must be prepared to meet the problems as they arrive.  We have seen the cycle of violence that has to come to us after it was in other countries.  We have seen the cycle of rape.  There are many other cycles that will take us into their orbit.  We must be prepared for them.  It is no use allowing a situation to <Col N="986" /> develop where people will be forced on to the dole queues or on to the unemployment registers by unscrupulous people.  We must take the necessary action to ensure that we are ready to meet the problems.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is another area where there are vampires sucking the State. There are a great many people drawing social welfare benefits who are not entitled to draw them.  This is an area where we must ensure that the position is regularised.  There are other people on social welfare benefit who could well do with increases to meet the increasing cost of every day life instead of having able bodied men breaking the law and drawing unemployment benefit and other benefits they are not entitled to.</P>
    <P>A local authority, of which I am a member, last year got 22,000 sick certificates. This shows the volume of the problem that is confronting local authorities, semi-State bodies and other organisations.  Some of these sick certificates are for the purpose of taking time off or for getting benefits that the people are not entitled to.  The problem has reached outstanding proportions. We must ensure that the responsible people in this country get an adequate return and backup where they require it for every day life.  I hope we bring this under control at the earliest possible moment. This has developed over many years and maybe we are all responsible to some degree.  But, when it reaches crisis proportions we are all concerned. This has reached crisis proportions.  We hear outbursts about it and then it fades away just as the breathalyser faded away.  It comes back again when some problem develops.  In these areas where the State is being attacked in one way or another we should take the necessary remedial action to ensure justice is done when people are apprehended.  People who are prepared to suck away the finances of the State are not concerned about public property.  They are not concerned about my rights or your rights or the rights of other people.  They are only concerned about what they can get out of it.  There must be a collective effort on our part to bring about the type of nation that we want.  All responsible people <Col N="987" /> should respond effectively to ensure that laws are not broken and that those who are breaking the law are apprehended and brought to justice at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Those are the most important issues. The question of the millions of pounds has already been dealt with by other people.  I am not interested in millions of pounds.  The poor people who live in the flats and tenement accommodation in the city are not talking of millions of pounds.  They want security.  They want to be able to go their way in peace.  They want to ensure that justice is done to them when they have problems.  Many of these people have problems but their problems are so small that they are disregarded. To them, they are the biggest problems in the world.  When people who steal £500,000 or £300,000 are apprehended they should be removed from society for all time.</P>
    <P>While I agree with many of the things Senator Hussey said in relation to the status of Senators, I disagree with some. One would think that we were poor house politicians or cut price TDs.  That is not the case.  We have a constitutional position here.  We are elected by the country at large.  We are not in the same position as the Deputies in the lower House who are elected by a small constituency. Our constituency is the country at large and we have a responsibility to the people throughout the country.  Our responsibilities are great responsibilities because they are not local responsibilities.  If I want to meet my constituents, I have to travel to Donegal or to Galway or Kerry and elsewhere.  The job of Senators is completely underrated.  If anyone takes notice of what Devlin says in his assessment of Senators, they are on the wrong line.  I hope that, in any review that takes place, nobody will take notice of what Devlin indicated in his red book on a previous occasion.  Our pay and conditions are an indication of how people think of us as individuals.  We have a very important constitutional responsibility. We carry it out to the best of our ability sometimes under difficult conditions and without the back-up service <Col N="988" /> that is necessary and desirable.  We all need a back-up service in this House quite apart from political parties.  We need a Seanad back-up service that will give us the information and facilities necessary and desirable for people who are endeavouring to perform an important function.</P>
    <P>Our function, as I said before, is an important one.  If we are going to undersell ourselves or under-rate ourselves we are doing ourselves an injustice.  I feel proud and honoured to be a Member of this House as I did when I was a member of the other House.  As a Member of this House, I feel that some of my duties and responsibilities are greater than they were previously.  Over the years, the State has tended to undervalue this House.  We must perform and we must be the effective unit we are supposed to be according to the Constitution. That is the way we want to operate. If we are impeded by lack of services or by lack of respect from other politicians, that brings this House into disrespect.  I hope that the views given by Senators in relation to our standing will be listened to by the appropriate Ministers and that a situation will evolve whereby services justly deserved, will be made available so that when we come to a debate such as this we will have the necessary back-up facilities and will not be making notes at a moment's notice to meet a situation.  It is all too sad to think that a person who comes in here and listens for a few moments to a Minister has no one to do research work for him.  We are not paid researchers.  Many of the other Houses mentioned by Senator Hussey have these facilities.  We are underpaid and overworked.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned pay.  The ushers here have more pay than Senators.  It depends on what job you are required to do.  The job that we are required to do is an important one.  I do not begrudge any section of the community getting more money for the job they do.  I want to be paid for the job I do and I want to ensure that other people get adequate remuneration so that they can equip themselves to deal with debates of this nature and indeed with debates that will be coming forward in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> Our entry into the EEC has created problems for many people.  It is a new area and there are research and development problems.  The problems of the Continent are with us now each day.  We have to do research and examine the situation.  We must be equipped to do it. We are not equipped at the moment.  I hope that in the near future we will get the respect and services we require in order to allow us to do our job in the manner in which we wish to do it in order to fulfil our constitutional position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not allow this opportunity to go without complimenting Senator Dowling.  All I can say is God help the Bugsy Malones in Dublin if he gets his way.  I am only too delighted to be living as far west as I am if Dublin is as bad as what he says it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the problem of the drainage of the Dunkellin River in County Galway.  Much has been made of this drainage job over the years.  At every election the river in question was drained.  However, a remarkable thing has happened.  In Brussels we negotiated a fairly big grant for land drainage generally.  When the allocation was made we found that the Dunkellin River in south Galway was not included.  I want to bring home to the Minister that this is causing grave concern to several thousand farmers in that part of Galway.  There are about 20,000 acres in an inferior condition because the land is seeping in water, and that at a time when land prices in that area are about £2,000 an acre.  We have an invisible industry left dormant just because money is not forthcoming.  We were told that there should have been a cost benefit survey done on it.  I understand this was attempted, in part, some time ago but it has to be updated and we were told by the Minister's office that there is no guarantee it will be done in 1979 either. Allowing for the possibility that the cost benefit happens to be carried out in 1979, it is quite unlikely that the river will be drained for the next five or six years.  It is very important that this be done at a time when there are so many people out of work, when the <Col N="990" /> agricultural sector is going so well and when the Brussels authority see fit to inject so many millions of pounds into the Exchequer to help us to do the very things we want done in County Galway. I cannot understand why this cost benefit survey cannot be carried out immediately. I was informed that there was a shortage of staff in the Department.  If that is the answer to it, that is even worse.  Certainly, with the number of people unemployed, we should not have any problem getting personnel to carry out a cost benefit survey.</P>
    <P>One could ask why was County Galway left out.  I understand that there is a river in County Cavan to be drained. One can only assume that the Government are so delighted with their results in County Galway, with six seats out of eight, they think it is a type of county that will stay with them anyway and can be left in abeyance for a number of years.  They will probably win six out of eight the next time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dunkellin River is not drained next time, there will be no six out of eight.  It is vitally important that the cost benefit study be carried out in the next couple of months.  I was travelling through that area a short time ago and there was a lot of rain water and severe flooding.  It is unbelievable the hardship that so many people have to put up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say in passing that the priority given to land drainage generally is not what I would have expected it to be.  From the figures I have received it appears that there is about £30 million for field drainage and a sum of between £12 and £15 million for arterial drainage.  Speaking from a farmer's point of view, that is putting the cart before the horse.  There is no point in trying to drain land if there is not an outfall for it.  There are several rivers like the Dunkellin that would alleviate great flooding and hardship if they were cleared first.  Then field drainage could be tackled.  The Government negotiated the deal even though the criteria, as far <Col N="991" /> as I am concerned, are incorrect.  It is vitally important that those types of rivers are drained to allow farmers to drain their land.  Field drainage is very little good if the outfall is choked.  We have a similar situation at the Islands River near the Galway-Roscommon border.  We have more problems there.  I cannot see for the life of me why the Department of Agriculture, under the EEC Scheme, could not drain that river as well.  Many thousands of acres in one county are left waterlogged at a time when so much money is being pumped in.  I have to ask why County Galway got such a terrible &ldquo;scutching&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Once the cost benefit survey is carried out I should like the Minister to say when exactly the Dunkellin can be drained.  It is in close proximity to the mining operations at Tynagh where they are on strike at the moment.  In two years many people will be out of a job, perhaps 200 or 300 people.  This is the catchment area of the Dunkellin.  Many of the workers are part-time farmers and they could earn a better living if their land was drained.  I want to take this opportunity to ask the Minister in the strongest possible way to use his influence to ensure that that river is drained as a top priority.</P>
    <P>On land drainage I should also like to say grant-aiding for the purchase of machinery by co-ops is being mooted at the moment.  I understand 25 per cent of the cost of land drainage equipment will be refunded to co-ops who buy this machinery on a co-operative basis.  I welcome that.  I am very co-operative-minded and I believe it is a step in the right direction.  In an area where the co-operative movement is not strong, or where it cannot service an area, I cannot understand why contractors who have been there over the years, and have been giving a very good service, are not entitled to the grant as well.  They perform a very useful function against all the odds over the years.  Certainly no private agricultural contractor I ever met was a millionaire.  Provided they give a good service, which most of them do, I cannot understand why they are not entitled to the 25 per cent grant as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> On the question of the Office of Public Works and their responsibility towards the cleaning of certain waterways, drains, and so on, I understand that under an Act of the Oireachtas passed a few years ago, the Office of Public Works will only maintain waterways they maintained before a certain date.</P>
    <P>In my duties as a public representative I have come across some remarkable happenings because of that legislation.  I came across a farmer in a place called Abbeyknockmoy near Tuam who actually found himself in the situation that the Office of Public Works maintained a drain and cleaned it from what they call the big river to within 21 yards of his land.  For some unknown reason the 21 yards were just left there.  This means that 70 acres of this farmer's land could not be drained.  The legislation provided that if the Office of Public Works did not clean it the last time they were maintaining the drain, they could not do it now. There are laws and laws, but when it comes down to the common good I wonder why those 70 acres could not be put into prime production because of 21 yards.  I would ask the Minister to take a personal look at this matter.  When legislation is being framed it should not be as tight at that because it verges on being stupid at that stage.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to which I should like to address myself for a moment is the question of the Government's subvention to some of the rural organisations.  I refer to the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Macra na Feirme, the IAOS and the Farm Apprenticeship Board. From what I understand from the accounts, the ICA get £20,000 per year, Macra na Feirme get £25,000, the IAOS get £20,000, and the Farm Apprenticeship Board get something like £37,000.  Because of the type of business these organisations are doing, and the remarkably good work they have done for the State over the years, this type of figure is totally inadequate, and has not kept pace with inflation.  Senator Dowling outlined the ills of society a few moments ago.  In the rural areas things are not that bad.  I would attribute our wellbeing at the moment to the unselfish <Col N="993" /> efforts over the years of organisations like the ICA and Macra na Feirme.  Any organisation who unselfishly train people to be leaders in their own community, to involve themselves in projects of a local nature, and provide leadership courses and much-needed recreation in the rural areas, should be helped by the Government to a far greater degree. There is no doubt that the organisations in question are very thankful for what they are getting but, in relation to what they got three or four years ago, and because of inflation, the figure needs to be increased.  I take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to those organisations for the wonderful efforts they have made on behalf of all the people over the years.  Some months ago the Minister for Agriculture insisted on legalising the 30-day tuberculosis and brucellosis cattle tests.  I work very closely with the livestock trade and I know it was necessary over the years to tighten up on disease control, but I cannot understand why the Minister did not make it a 60-day test.  I believe it was pressure from the better farming areas which persuaded the Minister to do what he did. For the benefit of the House, what actually happens with a 30-day test is this: if a farmer in the west is selling his total of ten cattle in a year, he might actually have five sales.  This is commonplace. That means he would have to get his vet five times extra that year and pay him five times extra.  At the rate of £8 per visit plus £1.50 per animal, that can be a costly exercise.  It is all right for the farmer with 20, 30 or 40 cattle to be tested at a time.  He will get good value, but if the small farmer has only one animal to be tested it is likely that he will have to pay £8 for that animal.</P>
    <P>Because of the way the bovine tuberculosis offices and the district veterinary offices are placed, to a large extent they are unable to cope with the new traffic. Several farmers I met were unable to get their brucellosis returns back from the laboratory inside two to three weeks. That meant their cattle identification cards were not in their hands for three weeks, and they had to sell in the last week of the 30 days.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there are some people in the <Col N="994" /> House who know what I am talking about.  It could happen that they might be selling on the day of a bad sale and, unless they decided to take a bad price, they would have to retest after 30 days. The farmer might not be able to go to a sale again for the best part of six weeks. I would certainly recommend a 60-day test.  This would stop a lot of unnecessary trafficking around in cattle.  I would ask the Minister to review that situation. I compliment him on increasing the fines for people who are switching tags and generally messing.  The worst enemy a farmer could have is a man who messes around in cattle and spreads disease.  It should be easier to get a conviction than it is at the moment because so much proof is needed.  Somebody would have to be actually watching the operator switching the tags before he could be a witness in a court of law.  To cut out this malpractice some type of legislation must be enacted to enable convictions to be obtained more easily.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the relative values of livestock at the moment, the Government's payments on reactor animals are inadequate.  This has been the case over the years and, indeed, during the last year or two while the previous Government were in office the compensation was anything but good.  This Government actually increased it last year.  The problem is that the price of livestock has soared and certainly and a farmer who is caught with diseased animals in this herd is certainly in for a rough time financially. This is not so bad if your resources can stand it, but if medium and smaller type farmers have disease in their herds, it could mean almost ruination for them.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme as presently constituted is not working in the best interests of all Irish farmers. There is a certain category of farmers in the transitional stage who certainly need more help than they are getting. Whatever the EEC authorities might like, I have no doubt that the greatest number of people we can keep on the land of Ireland&mdash;provided they are active farmers and are interested in production&mdash;the better.  The farm modernisation scheme is not particularly helpful to part-time farmers in the west. <Col N="995" /> The new drainage scheme has brought a new ray of hope there.  As I understand it, irrespective of their sidelines outside of farming, anybody will be grant-aided for drainage.  I suggest that in the next discussion with the Council of Ministers of Agriculture in Brussels, the Minister should seek more aid for part-time farmers and for all other aspects of farming.</P>
    <P>I notice in the accounts that, under the dairy herd conversion scheme, the grant proposed was £185,000 and £144,000 odd was actually spent.  Under that scheme farmers who are in milk production would be paid an EEC grant to switch over to beef.  I am delighted that scheme has not worked, for the very good reason that no line of business is better from a farmer's point of view than the production of milk.  We are in a unique position in Europe in this connection and it certainly does not suit us to go out of milk production.  When that scheme was announced I was afraid many people might believe it was a good idea and go for it, but from all accounts it appears that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Department one cannot help thinking that the Land Commission are on the way out.  The amount of money spent on actually buying land has gone to an all time low.  Looking at land bonds accounts we get the real answer. All I have to say on this vital subject is that we are all awaiting the views of the Minister for Agriculture.  They have been promised to us for quite some time and, while we are waiting for the news, there are many injustices under the present law as far as land sales are concerned. Unless the Minister brings in new legislation very quickly, many people who now have farms will not have them under more strict type of regulation.  For the past six or eight months people have been slipping inside the regulation.  People were well aware that the Land Commission had no money to buy land and that the only thing they could do was to serve what is called a section 40 order on properties for sale.  What actually happened was that, if anybody within three miles was interested, irrespective of the size of the buyer, he got it, and many <Col N="996" /> small farmers with farms adjoining these properties were left out in the cold because there was no Land Commission intervention.  Financially they were not able to match up to the big man.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement pension scheme is a joke.  It was initiated in 1964 by the then Minister for Lands, Mr. O Moráin. It was a disaster then and it is now a disaster again.  What is necessary to make the farm retirement pension scheme work?  The mentality of many farmers of 60, 62, 63 or 65 years is that at that stage they are getting good.  On the other hand, there are many bachelors who are old and infirm and in very bad health, and there must be some financial inducement to enable them to retire in relative comfort in their own homes with their own gardens and release the land to an up and coming young farmer.</P>
    <P>A number of stumbling blocks have appeared over the past few years particularly in relation to social welfare.  I remember saying before that if one thing is near and dear to the heart of an Irish man or woman in rural Ireland, it is the thought of getting the old age pension at the qualifying age.  If anything happened to prevent them from getting the pension, they would be terribly upset.  On occasions it was moreprudent financially to accept the scheme and do without the old age pension but no, the mentality embedded in their minds over the years was they had a God-given right to the pension and it was only right that they should get it.  After all his years of toil if a farmer wants to retire there should be some provision in the social welfare code to allow him to draw the old age pension.  Over the years all the sociologists, farm leaders and advisers have come up against that.  I would ask the Government of the day and the Minister to see what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Whatever land policy we have, the sooner land bonds are forgotten about and scrapped, the better for all concerned. This is not a political matter. Successive Governments have had land bonds.  Whether they are good or bad value, they are represented in rural Ireland as being bad value.  People do not want to wind up with land bonds <Col N="997" /> whether or not they have a good redemption value.  They want cash in their hands.  Whatever land structure comes from the Minister for Agriculture in the next couple of months, that will have to be taken into account.  Whatever land policy is drawn up, I hope the Minister will take due note of the fact that the more people we have living in rural Ireland the better for Ireland.</P>
    <P>On forestry I notice that the total wage bill has decreased somewhat.  This would lead one to believe that there are fewer people involved in forestry, which would be a great problem and a great pity.  The grants to private individuals for planting were far less than expected. I wonder why.  Are they not attractive enough?  Is it a fact that as a nation we are not tree-growing minded?  There are vast areas in the more barren parts of the seaboard which could be planted. Every effort should be made to ensure that happens and whateverfinancial inducements are necessary should be provided.  The Forestry Division should have a clear-cut policy on what land is suitable for planting and what is potentially good agricultural land.  With our future in the EEC and withour ability to compete with our foreign colleagues most of the time, possibly some land is being planted at the moment which has a good agricultural potential.</P>
    <P>The whole question of game development is an important factor.  For the future of tourism, for recreation for our people, it is important that the Department concernedshould take due note of game development.  Every effort should be made, where possible, to ensure that the game councils have sufficient technical and financial aid to keep our game reserves at as high a standard as possible.</P>
    <P>We have the worsttelephone service this side of the Sahara desert.  The telephone service in Leinster House would not be tolerated in any country in-Europe. Senator Dowling said we have a very bad back-up service here.  I am not too sure what the answer is.  The internal disputes would lead me to believe that no matter how much money the Department of Posts and Telegraphs spend, <Col N="998" /> there is no goodwill on the part of the staff.  If the labour relations problem in the Department cannot be overcome, it is time to scrap the Department and hand the responsibility over to somebody who will take it.  If you pick up a telephone and get an answer from the local operator 35 minutes later, you are told the reason for the delay is that they are understaffed.  This does not add up.  If the Minister believes a better service would be provided if it were taken away from his Department, he should do that.  It seems that fiddling around with what we have at present does not give us the service we require.  There is no need to stress the importance to the industrial and commercial life of the country of a very efficient telephone service.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disasters in 1977-78 was the whole question of the £1,000 grant for new houses.  Two years ago a county council loan of £4,500 facilitated the purchase of a house costing roughly £8,000.  Now with a £9,000 loan the same house can be purchased for between £16,000 and £18,500.  The purchaser is expected to do that on an income of £3,500, or £6 to £7 per week. He is asked to repay £22 a week, and that is only on the £9,000.  He still has to get the bridging finance.  Where will the extra £7,000 be found?  I calculate that £22 per week is around 30 per cent of his gross earnings.  That is the repayment on the loan.  He still has to find a way of paying the bridging loan of the extra £7,000.  The Government want people to build their own houses and that is laudable by any standards.  If newly married couples and others have to make repayments under those conditions and, at the same time, face a wage freeze, the number of new houses built in the future will not be exciting.</P>
    <P>In the four worst years of recession the Coalition Government built 25,000 houses per year.  This was some record viewed in the light of the record in the past year-and-a-half.  Under this Government, half as many local authority houses will be built this year as were built last year.  House prices increased by 36 per cent.  The price of housing materials increased by 10.5 per cent. Who got the profit?  Not the small <Col N="999" /> builder, and certainly not the house purchaser.  It was the big builder, and he is on the gold rush again.  The lower income group are certainly paying for the new millionaires.  A certain number of the new millionaires were to the fore at the last election, and not on behalf of Fine Gael.  Sites costing £1,500 to £2,000 only two years ago are now costing £5,000 to £7,500.  Whatever Fianna Fáil might have, they have not a good record on housing.</P>
    <P>There is worse news for potential house buyers.  They will be paying 14½ per cent interest after the next couple of weeks.  That will certainly make the £1,000 grant sound hollow, the grant which was supposed to solve the problem before the last general election. What went wrong?  At the time we were told the building industry needed a boost.  That was all very well but the wrong people got the boost.  Of all the disasters in the manifesto the worst was the £1,000 grant.  The £1,000 grant in itself might have been all right but the net cost of the houses is much higher now than it was at that time.</P>
    <P>Only today we had a Bill before us for the abolition of rates on private houses. It is laudable in its own way but it means the end of responsible local authorities.  I believe history was made in this House today.  From now on county councillors will be no better than messenger boys.</P>
    <P>As far as the general state of the nation is concerned, robberies, as Senator Dowling said, are an everyday occurrence. Our industrial relations performance was never worse.  To further compound our problems they were in Europe last week negotiating our entry into the EMS.  We found that we did not have too many friends there either.  Whatever about the discussion today, the rumour around the House is that we will be members of the EMS tomorrow, but that is another story.  It appears that our colleagues in Europe are not too happy with our housekeeping.  They say that we put more than £800 million into the budget last year in an imprudent way. We put it in because Fianna Fáil had to live up to their manifesto promises which were far from beneficial.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Connaughton said in relation to problems in rural areas.  First of all, I should like to refer to ESB services in my part of the country.  It is unconstitutional that people living in remote areas will not enjoy rural electrification subsidies.  In areas where the ESB have an electrification scheme they are demanding large sums of money from young couples, in some cases up to £1,000, and that is very wrong because they are unable to bear the heavy burden of mortgages.  They are paying for the cost of the materials to bring the service to their homes.  It would be more just if the ESB charged a service fee rather than for the materials used.</P>
      <P>Some Senators referred to telecommunications. Most people living in rural areas endure appalling delays and bad service.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has injected £350 million into telecommunications in order to ensure that our system will be on a par with systems in other European countries.  Some of the materials used will become obsolete in a short time and I feel that a shrewd look will have to be taken at the system and the materials used if we are to improve our services.  If we use obsolete materials we may provide a service which, after five years, will not give the required standards. Now that we are in the European Community we need an efficient system in order to attract industrialists to establish businesses here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to suggestions by various Governments in relation to <Col N="1001" /> the provision of life-saving equipment along our western seaboard.  If any ship or aircraft is in difficulties along our western seaboard they have to await the arrival in daylight of a helicopter from Baldonnel which has to stop to refuel at either Shannon or Castlebar.  In order to provide proper life-saving facilities along our western coast a helicopter should be based in the western region to service the coastline from Donegal to Cork.  We must continue to appeal for this service for the western counties.</P>
    <P>Another great problem confronting modern traffic is the huge articulated trucks that travel our roads.  Money should be made available for the removal of obstacles such as railway bridges with insufficient headage for these trucks.  I am sure that most people who travel to provincial towns see chaos and traffic hazards as a result of these long trucks being jammed in narrow laneways in our towns.  The elimination of traffic hazards can be achieved by the removal of outdated railway bridges. Traffic fly-overs and automatic systems will have to be put into operation in order to carry these heavy trucks which are becoming more numerous.  Trucks of that size have to be used to compete in the European Community.  Most of these trucks carry produce to and from Europe.  Our roads should be reclassified. Some few years ago the then Minister for Local Government introduced a reclassification scheme.  In Mayo, Galway, Sligo and Roscommon we did not agree with the downgrading of some of our main roads.  I would welcome reclassification of our primary and secondary roads in order to bring them up to a fairly high standard for the articulated traffic that has resulted from our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture on his sheep marketing deal with the French Government.  Rather than bringing the purchasers of our sheepmeat to court, he spelled out the problems of our sheep-meat industry.  As a result, this year he got better lamb prices than we have enjoyed for many years.  I want to mention a certain type of lamb, the mountain lamb from the <Col N="1002" /> high black hills of the west.  Because of its conformation and grazing terrain it is not eligible for the French market.  This type of lamb must be catered for.  We must have a market for it if not in France then in the eastern European countries.  This market must be explored in order to facilitate the small farmers living in the hills of Mayo, Donegal, Galway and Kerry, who have mixed grazing and are unable to produce a lamb with the same flesh meat as our people in some of our better areas of this country.</P>
    <P>Recently, in the media the suggestion was made by vested interests that the real reason our meat factories are in trouble is that they have to compete with our livestock exporters.  I want to warn those concerned that I will oppose vested interests who try to do away with the live export of calves, breeding heifers and steers.  Over the years we have built up a market with Britain.  If live exports were not competing with the meat factoris, I can tell the farmers and the Senators that the price farmers would be getting for their meat would be very low. Remember what happened in 1974 when the factories had control.  It is because of poor management and outdated processing methods that we have problems in our factories.  The number employed in meat factories could be doubled if we had proper processing facilities.  We should be exporting our meat in a processed fashion in order to compete with the other members of the Community, and I hear rumblings from the Labour people in connection with this. There is much to be learned in this field. The only safety valve the farming community have is the retention of our live exports.  The day that legislation is introduced to extinguish live exports whether sheep or cattle, the death knell will be rung for the farming community.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the disease eradication scheme.  We must be cruel to be kind. That is my summing up of it.  There may be harassment to farmers in trying to cope with the 30-day test.  I want to say to Senator Connaughton that the 30-day test was not introduced by the Minister but by the chief veterinarians of his <Col N="1003" /> Department.  He gave them a job to do and a time limit in which to do it.  A scheme was prepared with their expert advice for the eradication of both bovine TB and brucellosis by 1982.  It is up to everybody to co-operate with it.  The Minister should not change the views of his experts in this regard.  The end product will be a disease-free herd by 1982.  That will enable us to export our cattle disease free.  It should also lead to a lucrative business in the export of serums for our pedigree cattle to the EEC and further afield.</P>
    <P>In connection with the drainage scheme Senator Connaughton said that Galway was not included.  His county was included as well as the 12 western counties.  If there is any political implication it is that we on this side of the House provided up to £20 million over the next five years to embark on a major draining scheme for the west.  I welcome it but I have reservations.  I am delighted that the Minister responsible for the board and the scheme is present to hear what I have to say in connection with a portion of the west extending from Cork to Donegal, which is not part of the area because it does not come under the Arterial District Drainage Acts, 1945. There are a number of rivers with definite outlets in the sea along the coast in the 12 western counties that are not in that catchment area.  As a result, the Board of Works have certain powers in regard to private fishing rights.  Farmers who are outside the arterial drainage system have not got any powers.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to extend the arterial drainage district immediately so as to ensure that the Board of Works have powers against objectors to this scheme.  As Senator Connaughton said, the only effective way to drain land is to drain the outfall.  The outfall and main arteries should be drained first to ensure the lowering of the water base.  It would give the land project people a better look at a farmer's overall holding.  I feel that the Minister knows what I am talking about and I hope he will look into this matter with a view to including it in the arterial drainage district.</P>
    <P>In connection with FEOGA grants, which are already paid to certain co-ops <Col N="1004" /> the tendency is to use plum areas for the implementation of various schemes.  The North Connacht Farmers' Co-operative and other big co-ops in Sligo, Roscommon and Mayo tend to give grants to farmers with 100 to 200 acres in plum areas.  Where I come from some farmers have only four acres, ten acres or 12 acres.  They do not want to know small farmers because it is no longer profitable for them to move in their machinery for a short time.  The remuneration from this type of smallholding would not justify the movement of large machinery.  The co-operatives should immediately select farmers in order to facilitate them with the 25 per cent grant that they are entitled to under the new regulation.</P>
    <P>I am as concerned as Senator Staunton is about equal rights for islands not in the Gaeltacht areas.  We have some of them off the coast of Mayo and Galway.  The Government are examining the position with regard to grants for non-Gaeltacht islanders.  I hope they solve the problem as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the decision of the Minister for Health that anybody who earns under £5,000 per annum will be entitled to free hospitalisation.  It was necessary to bring the ceiling up to £5,000.  The new scheme will include those who are unable to pay VHI premiums.  Recently I put down a motion at a Mayo County Council meeting that a land bank be acquired alongside our harbours and piers.  It is necessary for the future production of our fisheries and for the offshore exploration in the Porcupine and other places.  It is necessary for local authorities to acquire land banks in the vicinity of our piers and harbours.  If we find oil off the coast the magnates will move in fast and acquire land along our coast.  People in the fish processing business will not be able to get the capital for the acquisition of land. Local authorities should ensure that they have land banks for this type of development. Week in and week out people speak about the farmers' dole.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the reports in the media, it would appear that the farmer's dole is handed out in a casual way.  In the area I represent there are farmers with three acres, four acres, six acres, <Col N="1005" /> ten acres and 12 acres holdings, with valuations under £20.  Under the unemployment assistance regulations they are entitled to unemployment assistance, but it is now called the small farmers' dole.  Until some alternative assistance is provided, the abolition of the small farmers' dole will not be asked for in Mayo, Leitrim, Galway or in any other county where there are low valuations. They must spend a certain amount of time on their smallholdings in order to produce a few stock and rear their families.  Many people speak frequently and freely about the farmer's dole.  A capital injection in this field could mean the survival of this nation.  Any Government that moves in this direction will be thanked by those living in the western region.</P>
    <P>There is one type of individual who does not get any credit for his service to the nation.  Since I came to this House I am getting some remuneration for my services.  For 22 years I was an unpaid member of Mayo County Council.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to consider how much time and work members of local authorities give voluntarily and unselfishly to their local community, who never get any further than an urban council or county council.  As I said, they do not get any remuneration and are paid a very limited travelling and subsistance allowance.  I would welcome a review of their contribution to local authorities.  Some remuneration should be forthcoming for these people who have given their services diligently and unselfishly down the years.</P>
    <P>I am not aware, as a member of a county development team, of any curtailment of the duties or services mentioned by my colleague, Senator Staunton in connection with SFADCo. We are working in the usual way, making provision and selecting applicants for small industries in Mayo, as we did in the past.  I think we give and have given a great service over the years.  In conjunction with the IDA we have helped many small industries which would never have got to the IDA board rooms. Indeed, some of them went abroad to acquire capital.  They have returned to their <Col N="1006" /> own towns and set up small industries which give employment in their local area.  That is a great breakthrough. Rather than the immigration we had in the past, we now have some of our sons and daughters coming back to rural Ireland, giving employment and being provided with capital grants for small industries. I do not know what the Senator means when he speaks about SFADCo and the county development teams.  I would like to know more about that.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators I am very glad to have the opportunity of making my own contribution to what is essentially a state-of-the-nation review.  I hope not to go over again the ground which I have covered in the context of specific debates, nor to anticipate debates which, hopefully, will be coming up after Christmas.  In that connection, though I understand, of course, that the Chamber here has to be looked after and we are all concerned at the damage which must receive urgent attention, at the same time I would hope that repair work will not be yet another reason why we should once more delay the transaction of our business.  After all, if the Board of Works have to move in here for a prolonged period it should not be entirely beyond the resources of civilisation to arrange that we should meet elsewhere in this building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin by dealing with miscellaneous items of public interest before I move on to two or three more substantial regions of my own concern.  I see Senator Cranitch here and I am sure he will be interested in discussing the implications of the arrival on the scene of RTE 2 which was one of the big events in the history of telecommunications and which was duly ushered in, in Cork at least, with a great flourish of trumpets.  I have heard Senator Cranitch expressing his disappointment, indeed his outrage at the standard of the new service.  I must say I have considerable sympathy for him.  He and I share some views at least and I think I know what he is saying.  It is true that some of the programmes on our new service are quite stupifyingly banal.  On the other hand if we give RTE 2 a fair trial, not that I am particularly a television addict, I think we will find that <Col N="1007" /> the planners of the new service are trying to give us some programmes of excellent quality.  Of these, Senator Cranitch would say, and here again I would agree with a lot of his thinking, that is all very well but that RTE 2 is essentially not our service.  Perhaps a second television channel was not strictly speaking necessary: one television service is more than enough for a country of our size.  It is an open secret that the reason why we had to have RTE 2 was because of the geographical freak that Dublin and the east coast already had access to other services.  Hence the resultant clamour for either an extension of multichannel or at worst a second channel from RTE. Ideally we should take our standards in these matters from other small countries and not from the BBC which after all caters for a vast population and which has tremendous expertise in these matters. Nevertheless if there was to be a second channel then I think the thing to ensure was that above all we should not alienate that second channel to the control of another State.  That would have been tantamount to cultural treason. That is why I did my bit at the time when the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was aiming to do precisely that, to alienate a national resource to another State.  I did what I could to join with those who were opposed to his move.  More broadly I might say that I was opposed to the wider philosophy behind his move because he made no secret of that fact that he was opposed to cultural protectionism.  I hold it the solemn duty of any Government of a sovereign State to protect what is distinctive about the culture of that State. To an extent the battle was won.  We stopped the move to have the proposed channel alienated to the BBC and we kept it under our own control.  It was a victory of a sort.  Now that we have it under our own control it is not, perhaps, what all of us would like it to be, but at least it is in the hands of the RTE Authority.  For that reason I was somewhat surprised that on the night of the opening programme in the Cork Opera House, the place was picketed by Conradh na Gaeilge.  I thought this was unimaginative of them because they <Col N="1008" /> should have recognised that, while it may not be all that we desire, we can improve it since it is our own.  We have the power to improve it and let us hope that the percentage of native programmes and of Irish language programmes will be increased as resources permit.</P>
    <P>On an allied subject, I spoke publicly earlier this year on the issue of pirate radio.  I do not propose to repeat what I said then.  I am convinced that the radio service, of its very nature, should be kept under public control, perhaps not necessarily under the RTE Authority.  I must take the Government and the RTE Authority to task for not anticipating the quite genuine demand there is for local radio.  When that demand was finally articulated, the Government were equally slow in meeting the demand.</P>
    <P>This development should be hastened even now because the longer the pirate radio stations exist the more they acquire a customary right by their very existence. Therefore, it is important to do two things: to expedite the provision of genuine local community radio which will not be concerned with turning a fast buck but with providing a service, and at the same time to initiate quickly serious legislation against illegal broadcasting.  I think Senator Dowling made an essential point in the context of other areas of our life and society, that if the law is there it must be obeyed.  There can be no connivance at illegality.  In the area of pirate broadcasting this is precisely what has been happening.  These violators of the law have cocked a snoot at the law. They advertise their wares openly which I take it is itself illegal.  I am disappointed that Members of the Oireachtas have accepted invitations to speak and comment on these illegal channels of communication.</P>
    <P>I support everything Senator Robinson has said about the injustice in many areas of our legal system and the need for reform in these areas.  I think Senator Robinson, though she may annoy the Government side from time to time, has given unstinted service to the cause of law reform.  The issue of Loughan House came up in that respect and I was one of those, who after some misgiving, supported the opponents of Loughan House because I felt fundamentally <Col N="1009" /> that Loughan House was a simple way out of a complex situation. Senator Lanigan said that of course it was regrettable but that these children must be taken out of their environment for their own sakes.  Surely what we must do ultimately is to take that environment away from these children and away from society.</P>
    <P>One of the issues during the year has been the question of nuclear power and more particularly the controversy which has centred around the proposed erection of a nuclear plant at Carnsore.  This is an issue which has generated&mdash; generated is the <i>mot juste</i>&mdash;as much if not more emotion than Wood Quay.  In the long run, it may prove to be a socially more disruptive issue.  The concern about building a nuclear plant is, of course, shared world wide and we have examples of places such as Austria where the question has brought about a political crisis.  The main point I want to make is that I do not think the question has been debated seriously enough.  The Government have not given the lead in a public debate.  The Minister has set his face against a public inquiry.  I think a public inquiry is the only way we have to discover what we want, to discover what kind of society we want because the most crucial question behind nuclear energy is not, important though it is, the question of alleged dangers, physical danger and destruction of the environment, but the kind of society we really want.  Do we need this extra new power? Do we need an industrial society or are we content with some kind of pastoral arcadian society?  We need to debate what kind of society we want before we can say whether we want a nuclear station or not.  The Minister suggested that the matter was not a matter for public inquiry, as if people are not competent to discuss this vital question.  Yet people are trusted with all kinds of important decisions such as entry into the Common Market, choosing Governments and dealing with referenda on the Constitution. There is no reason why an intelligent electorate could not be trusted to debate sensibly this highly important issue.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers of the situation is <Col N="1010" /> that, by default, the Electricity Supply Board are being permitted to arrogate to themselves the field of nuclear policy. Members will know that I have spoken extremely highly of our semi-State bodies in general and of the ESB in particular. I am informed by a science colleague that the record of ESB engineers in generating maximum output with the greatest husbanding of resources, in other words avoiding waste, is second to none in Europe.  The question is whether the ESB for all their expertise are the body that should be allowed to take over a nuclear policy.  There is very strong case for a national energy authority not simply to direct the question of nuclear energy but the whole field of research, development and practice.  There have been only token gestures in these respects.</P>
    <P>On that energy authority we could have, of course, the ESB but also representatives from the world of commerce and from academics some of whom are doing extremely useful work on slender resources investigating the possibilities of things like solar energy and so on, and the authority should also include representatives from the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The danger of the present position is that the Minister's intransigent attitude will polarise debate, will put on one side those who say we must have a nuclear station and on the other those who are opposed to it at all costs.  There is no need for this polarisation of debate and if the Minister modified his intransigent attitude he could defuse the situation, a situation which needs to be defused even more than Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to certain aspects of the taxation question and I want to dwell on one greviously unjust area of taxation and that is the iniquity of the Pay-As-You-Earn system.  It continues to be a standing reproach to this Government as to previous Governments. There is industrial unrest in the country, we are all aware of that.  I do not think, by the way, that Senator Lanigan's conspiracy theory gets us very far except perhaps to divert attention from the real causes.  Much of this industrial unrest is related to an unfair <Col N="1011" /> system of taxation.  Certainly the increasing unrest in the public service seems to me to be linked with the uneven spread of taxation.  Reference has been made to tax evasion and tax avoidance, and it is customary in this country over the last few years to point the finger of tax evasion or tax avoidance largely at the farming community and there is much truth in this.  Urban-rural tensions have been noticeably absent in Irish history; in fact one of the great strengths of the land struggle was the identity of town and country, but urban-rural tensions have increased in recent years according as the prosperity of certain sections of the rural community is not reflected in the living standards of many urban workers, and those tensions will increase until the prosperous farming community pays its fair share of taxation and the phrase &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; should not mean what the farmers want it to mean.  Their spokesmen are frequently on record as saying, &ldquo;We will pay our fair share.&rdquo;  The suggestion is that they should determine what is the fair share. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>But we must remember that the fraud and scandal of tax dodging, whether it is evasion or avoidance, is practised by large sections of the wealthy self-employed, not simply the farmers, but many sectors of the professional classes and those in commerce and in trade.  The burden thus avoided falls all the more heavily on the shoulders of those whose salaries and wages are readily accountable to the Revenue Commissioners. No one should underestimate the bitterness and the cynicism which this injustice engenders not least when appeals are frequently made, and we can take it that they will be made with more frequency in the future, for restraint and moderation in wage demands.  On these occasions one would not blame the PAYE worker for saying &ldquo;certainly I will moderate my demands if I am not so unjustly taxed.&rdquo;  It has been argued that the administrative cost of catching the tax dodger, whether he is a medical consultant or a lawyer or a builder, would be enormous and would nullify the expected increase in tax revenue.  This seems to me to be an absolutely defeatist <Col N="1012" /> attitude and implies an inbuilt resistence to any attempt to improve matters.  It is an attitude which simply compounds the prevailing cynicism.  I think there should be a serious attack made on, say, one particular section of tax dodgers in a given taxation year and frighten the life out of them and really punish them.  If such an attack is backed up by the application of serious penalties, it would intimidate all tax dodgers into some sense of their civic responsibilities and would help to convince PAYE earners that some attempt was being made to lighten their own load.</P>
    <P>I have referred to unease in the public service, an unease which is daily increasing and in this connection I would draw the attention of Senators to a statement published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 18 November last, a statement from the Association of Telecommunication Engineers giving details of what they allege to be an alarming drift of professional engineers from the Post Office into private industry.  They claim that 31 experienced engineers resigned in this year up to the date of that statement, that is to say 31 experienced engineers from January to November last, compared to a total of 28 in the previous five years.  This represents a shattering collapse in morale.  Basically they say the reason is that P &amp; T engineers are 25 per cent below the salary levels of engineers in the ESB and elsewhere.  They further claim that recruitment is drastically down on previous years and this at a time when the number needs to be increased to implement the present five-year capital programme for the telephone service.  There is apparently the extraordinary situation where much of the capital investment earmarked for the expansion of the telephone service this year will not be spent, largely because of the shortage of professional engineers.  If this is true, in view of the shambles that is our telephone services, it can only be described as a crazy state of affairs.  I agree with Senators Connaughton and O'Toole that the most drastic measures are called for to deal with the sick joke of our telephone service.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to go on to another area of my contribution but I <Col N="1013" /> would, with your consent Sir, prefer not to begin now.</P>
