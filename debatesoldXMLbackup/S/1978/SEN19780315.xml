      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House about motion No. 11 on the Order Paper which is concerned with Northern Ireland.  I believe we should have a debate on it as soon as is practically possible.  When I raised this matter before I mentioned that there was a very good reason for having this debate at the earliest possible moment.  The parties are considering a review of Northern policy. There have been frequent calls, particularly from the SDLP, for the parties in the Republic to spell out what they mean by Irish unity.  Of course we all know about the <i>impasse</i> in Northern politics at the moment and it is our duty to have a debate on this topic in the Seanad.  We have had two extremely sympathetic and sensitive debates on Northern Ireland since the present troubles began.  I can understand the view that it is not an appropriate time to have this debate while the parties are in the middle of a review of their policy but as everybody knows, inertia is the enemy to progress in politics.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the parties will be stimulated into getting on with and concluding their review of Northern Ireland policy as soon as possible. Senator Eoin Ryan said on 22 February that in due course he hoped to take this motion.  I hope that it is of such importance that he will attempt to have this motion taken at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>It is a very brief statement. This matter has become more urgent since I put it down on the Order Paper because once again the motives of women's organisations have been impugned by a Minister of the Government.  Women's organisations have been accused of acting either from financial self-interest or political party motivation on a very important question of principle.  This accusation was made three times and the last time as recently as last Saturday.  I have been contacted by many women's organisations who are extremely anxious that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like Senator Hussey, I thought Senator Ryan was replying specifically to Senator West's question.  I should like your permission to make a very brief statement arising more generally out of what Senator West has said.  Hope was expressed on opening day and during the lifetime of this Seanad that the House would realise its potential as a deliberative Assembly.  Notwithstanding the frequent promises of the Leader of the House that we would be given an opportunity to debate Members' motions, the progress to date has been very disappointing.  It is a contradiction when the Leader of the House, on 1 March, column 634 of the Official Report, said: &ldquo;We may not have enough business to sit next week.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely the items referred to by Senator West and items like No. 9 on disarmament and No. 14 on school closures are pre-eminently the kind of business that profitably can be discussed in this House rather than in the other.  Yet the House did not sit on Thursday, March 2, and not at all last week.  I understand that the presence of Ministers is not strictly speaking necessary for debates on these motions, but if the presence of Ministers is necessary surely one Minister out of 12 or more could be found to listen to such business.  This is scandalous disregard of the House.  Either the Government spokesmen are serious about wanting to take these motions or they are not. If they are not, the acceptance, which has hitherto greeted Government business, cannot be guaranteed to continue.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1978: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the inability, through illness, of the Minister to be here.  He has asked me to deputise for him. This Bill is designed to implement the 10 per cent increase in the weekly rates of social welfare payments and other improvements in the social welfare code announced in the budget.  It also provides for consequential changes in the occupational injuries scheme, for increases in the contributions payable under the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes and for a number of improvements in other social welfare schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As usual, the Bill contains a number of rather technical amendments to existing legislation and, in order to clarify its provisions, an explanatory <Col N="755" /> memorandum has been circulated with the text.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to maintaining the living standards of social welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments at least in line with the cost of living. The 10 per cent increase provided in this Bill will more than compensate for the expected increase in the cost of living in 1978 and in fact represents an increase in real terms of some 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent increase and other improvements announced in the budget will involve a total cost of approximately £36.5 million in 1978 bringing the overall outlay on social welfare benefits and allowances to approximately £594 million.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the increases provided in individual payments. All weekly personal rates of non-contributory old age pension are being increased, the increase at the maximum rate being from £12.35 to £13.60 for persons aged under 80 years, with persons aged 80 years or more getting an additional £1.35.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under pensionable age is increased to £6.75 and the allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being increased from £6.90 to £7.60.</P>
    <P>The additions to pensions payable to pensioners with qualified children are being raised by 35p to £3.65 a week for each of the first two children and by 25p to £2.75 a week for each other child.</P>
    <P>The new scale of weekly means and rates of pension is set out in Table A in section 2.  Section 4 provides for increases in the rates of unemployment assistance.  The increase in the personal weekly rate of assistance will bring the maximum from £10.70 to £11.75 in urban areas and from £10.30 to £11.35 in rural areas.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £8.55 and £8.35 respectively and the rates in respect of dependent children to £3.65 for each of the first two and £2.75 for others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Means for unemployment assistance purposes, in the case of smallholders in certain areas, are assessed notionally by reference to rateable land valuation. Where the valuation is £10 or less the rates of assistance currently payable are those established in 1977 and payable to applicants generally and the new rates will be as I have just outlined. Those smallholders whose valuation is between £10 and £15 did not benefit from any increase in 1977 and are currently in receipt of assistance at rates established in 1976. These rates, however, are also being increased by 10 per cent and this involves the creation of a new schedule of rates which is set out separately in section 4.  Smallholders on the notional system of assessment whose valuations are between £15 and £20 did not receive an increase in 1976 or in 1977 and on this occasion also are, as announced in the budget, excluded from the 10 per cent increase, due to the continuing growth in farm incomes. Smallholders with valuations over £20 are, since 1977, no longer eligible to have their means assessed on the notional basis but these, and any smallholders below £20 valuation who feel it would be to their advantage, may have their means assessed on the factual basis which applies to applicants generally.  In that case they would be eligible to receive the current rate of payment appropriate to their means as so assessed.</P>
    <P>Increases in all rates of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are provided in sections 7 and 9 of the Bill, the maximum weekly personal rate of widow's non-contributory pension being increased from £12.35 to £13.60 and the amount for each qualified child from £4.10 to £4.50.  The increases in widows' pensions automatically apply to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.  The increase in orphan's non-contributory pension is from £8.05 to £8.85 a week at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>The allowances for single women aged between 58 and 66 are being increased in section 10, the increase at the maximum being from £10.70 to <Col N="757" /> £11.75.  Under section 12 the rates of supplementary welfare allowances are being increased.  The maximum personal weekly rate of the allowance will go up from £10.30 to £11.35, the rate for an adult dependant from £7.60 to £8.35 and the rates for dependent children to £3.65 for each of the first two and £2.75 for each other child.</P>
    <P>I now come to the increases in the rates of contributory benefits and pensions under the social insurance system which are set out in section 14.  The increase in the case of disability and unemployment benefit and invalidity pension is from £13.05 to £14.35 in the personal rate and from £8.50 to £9.35 in the rate for an adult dependant. Maternity allowance is also being increased from £13.05 to £14.35.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of contributory old age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 go up from £14.60 to £16.05 and for those over 80, from £15.50 to £17.05.  The addition to pension for an adult dependant is increased from £9.30 to £10.25 where the adult dependant is under pensionable age and from £11.00 to £12.10 where the adult dependant is aged 66 or over.  In the case of widow's contributory pension the increase is from £13.25 to £14.60 in the personal rate for those under age 80 and from £14.30 to £15.75 for those aged 80 or over. Deserted wife's benefit is also being increased from £13.25 to £14.60.</P>
    <P>The additions to widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for qualified children are being raised from £4.45 to £4.90 for each child.  In the case of other benefits and pensions, the corresponding increase is from £3.75 to £4.15 for each of the first two children and from £3.10 to £3.40 for each other child.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in section 14 for increases in the grants payable under the social insurance system. Maternity grant is increased from £4 to £8 and the maximum rate of death grant is increased from £35 to £50.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system the Bill provides in sections 19 and 20 for increases in the rates of benefit payable under the occupational injuries scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> In addition to the increases in rates of benefits the Bill provides for a number of other improvements in social welfare schemes.  The most significant of these, in terms of the costs involved, is the provision giving single women and widows full and unrestricted access to unemployment assistance on the same terms as men from October next.  This is done by section 5 which removes the present requirement that they must either have a dependant or have paid a certain minimum number of social insurance contributions.  This represents a substantial step forward in the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare code.  It is estimated that some 14,000 women will qualify for unemployment assistance as a result of this change.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables such women, from the date of enactment of the Bill, to apply for a qualification certificate. This certificate sets out the holder's weekly means and, though it does not confer entitlement to assistance, it is a necessary requirement for such entitlement. If the women concerned apply for this certificate when the Bill is enacted, the speedy clearance of applications for assistance from October will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for changes in the residence conditions for non-contributory pensions.  In the case of old age pension, the residence test in its present form is that the claimant must have lived in the State for an aggregate period of 15 years, at least five of them after attaining the age of 50.  People who have lived abroad, such as teachers, social workers and missionaries and who return home late in life have been prevented by the requirement of five years residence after age 50 from qualifying for pension and, to cater for these people, section 3 provides for the abolition of this requirement so that an aggregate of 15 years' residence at any time will now suffice.</P>
    <P>Applicants for widow's non-contributory pension must at present have at least two years' residence in the State to qualify for pension.  Application of the test has in some cases <Col N="759" /> caused hardship and section 8 of the Bill provided for the abolition of this condition.  The similar residence condition in the case of deserted wife's allowance, social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers and prisoner's wife's allowance is being removed by appropriate changes in the relevant regulations.</P>
    <P>Another important problem for which provision is being made is that which arises where a woman in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or deserted wife's allowance dies and her children, for whom she had been receiving increases in her benefit or allowance, are left with no income.  In some cases, the father may return home following the death of his wife but, in many cases, his whereabouts are unknown or he does not resume his responsibilities for the children.  In these cases, the children are effectively in the same position as orphans but, as the death of the father cannot be presumed, they do not qualify for orphan's non-contributory pension or orphan's contributory allowance.  Section 16 provides that these children will in future be treated as orphans and that orphan's pension or allowance will be paid to a relative or some other suitable person, thus avoiding the necessity of having to send the children to an institution.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends to supplementary welfare allowances a provision made last year in the case of certain other social welfare payments.  This provision related to increases of those payments in respect of adult dependants.  Such an increase could previously be paid to single men and widowers in respect of a woman looking after their children, and the 1977 Act provided that it could also be paid to single women, widows and deserted wives.  The benefits involved were unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit, injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme and invalidity pension.  Section 13 of this Bill provides, in the case of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which came into operation in July, 1977, for a similar extension of the adult dependant's increase.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that an old age pension may be paid, on a provisional <Col N="760" /> basis pending the formal decision of a pension committee where a social welfare officer is satisfied that the statutory conditions for receipt of the pension are fulfilled.  An arrangement of this nature has existed on an informal basis since 1973 and in all cases the subsequent decision of the old age pension committee or appeals officer supersedes the provisional payment. The reason for making a provisional payment in this way is to avoid the hardship to pensioners caused by delay in obtaining decisions from pension committees.</P>
    <P>Section 22 concerns the recovery of amounts of old age pension overpaid. Under existing legislation the amount overpaid may be recovered not only from the pensioner himself but it may be deducted from specified social welfare payments due to the spouse, widower of the pensioner or, if any other person so consents, from payments due to that person.  Section 22 abolishes the provision whereby recovery may be effected by deduction from benefits payable to other persons. The effect of this will be that recovery will only be possible from the pensioner himself or from his estate.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the rates increases and other improvements being provided for following the budget is £36.5 million in 1978.  Of this, social assistance accounts for more than £16 million, all of which is borne by the Exchequer.  The total cost in the case of the social insurance schemes is £20.44 million and this must be met out of the social insurance fund which is financed by contributions from employers and employees with an annual subvention from the Exchequer.  On the basis of a 20 per cent Exchequer subvention an increase of 82p in the ordinary rate of contribution would be required of which, on the usual 2 to 1 allocation, the employer would bear 55p and the employee 27p.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary, however, to meet an additional £10.4 million, which represents mainly the full year cost of the October 1977 increases, and to meet this, the ordinary contribution has to be increased by a further 52p.  This will be shared 35p on the employer and 17p on the employee, <Col N="761" /> bringing the increase of contribution to £1.34 broken down into 90p for the employer and 44p for the employee.</P>
    <P>The contribution for occupational injuries, which is borne in full by the employer, is being increased by 5p making the employer's share of the increase 95p.  In addition, under the provisions of the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1978, the health contribution which is normally borne in full by the employee will be increased by 11p bringing the employee's share of the increase to 55p.  Accordingly, the total increase in the overall contribution will be £1.50 of which the employer will bear 95p and the employee 55p.</P>
    <P>The full increase of £1.50, however, will apply only to workers earning £50 a week or more.  It will be remembered that, in accordance with the Government's election manifesto, contribution rates were reduced from January 1978 by £1 a week for persons earning less than £50 a week.  It is now proposed that a further concession be made in the case of these workers in that the increase in respect of them will not be £1.50 but rather £1.  Taking into account the existing £1 reduction, the contribution for lower paid workers will therefore be £1.50 less than the full rate, this reduction being shared £1.16 to the employee and 34p to the employer.</P>
    <P>From April 3 next the total contribution, including social insurance, occupational injuries, health and redundancy will be £8.68 for men of which the employer will pay £5.26 and the employee £3.42.  The corresponding rate for a man earning less than £50 a week will be £7.18 of which the employer will pay £4.92 and the employee £2.26.</P>
    <P>I should also mention here that these rates include the special increase of 31p in the social insurance contribution introduced in 1975 which is being retained for a further 12 months to help meet the cost of the high level of unemployment claims still being experienced.</P>
    <P>The cost of the additional concession to lower paid workers is estimated at £4.25 million in 1978 which will be <Col N="762" /> borne entirely by the Exchequer.  The total Exchequer contribution towards the improvements in social insurance will be £8.3 million and the amount to be raised from increases in the contributions of employers and employees will be £22.5 million.</P>
    <P>The rates of voluntary contributions are being increased to £1.46 at the low rate and £3.76 at the high rate&mdash;an increase of 26p and 66p respectively. The special voluntary contribution in respect of a certain category of insured persons affected by the abolition of the remuneration limit from April 1974, is being increased by 40p to £2.30.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in this Bill are due to come into operation from the beginning of April and I, therefore, commend and the Bill to Seanad Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill the Government are demanding from both employer and employee an insurance contribution increase which is approximately double the increase that was sought in 1977.  The employer will have to bear an increase of 95p which is a rather savage one and comes only a couple of months after we were told by the Minister for Social Welfare and Health that the reduction in the cost of the stamp in the case of employees earning less than £50 would be an incentive to employers to increase the number of workers in their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to look at this Bill in a rather cynical fashion because a 95p increase for the employer cannot be regarded in any context as being an incentive to take on additional workers.  The employee is also having to bear an increase which is approximately double the increase that was sought in 1977.  One has to expect increases in insurance contributions but it is only fair to look for commensurate increases at least in the benefits that should be given in return for such increases in insurance contributions.  A 10 per cent increase in the payments of benefits is not enough.  When one considers what that 10 per cent is on one sees how inadequate and how unrealistic are the increases in the benefits. <Col N="763" /> The social welfare categories such as old age pensioners, unemployed people, single women of 58 years old, and so on, are being given weekly benefits that range from £12 to £15 in many instances.  I say such an amount is an unrealistic benefit to be giving to anybody in this day and age.  I do not think that the basic benefit is sufficiently high on which a 10 per cent increase can be regarded as being appropriate and adequate to meet the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that there is no October increase envisaged at all in this Bill.  The Coalition Government from 1973 made this a regular feature of each year's increase in benefits and I think it is expecting too much that people who will receive the 10 per cent increase in April will be expected to face any further increases in the cost of living that will arise during the next 12 months without any further addition to their benefits.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper which was issued by the Government a couple of months ago one remembers the statement that cost effectiveness would be a very prominent feature of the Government over the next five years in regard to social welfare payments and in general to the social welfare system. One sees it certainly coming home to roost now that this Fianna Fáil Government are not as socially conscious as one would like them to be in regard to maintaining the standard of living of our less fortunate categories.</P>
    <P>Only a couple of months ago Fianna Fáil made great play about the reduction in the cost of the stamp for those earning under £50 per week and now they have increased that cost.  One wonders what the administrative work involved in both the reduction of the stamp in the first instance and now the increase in that stamp after only a very short period of two or three months, is going to cost.  Certainly I do not think the people who will be responsible for administering this downward and upward cost of the stamp in such a short period of time will look with any great favour on <Col N="764" /> what the Government have done.  One would have thought the Government would have come out quite openly and honestly and said, when they had got into power last July.  &ldquo;Look, we know we promised that we would reduce the stamp in the case of people earning less than £50 a week but we know we will also have to increase social welfare contributions in 1978, and we will make a net increase rather than reducing and then increasing the insurance stamp within two months of that reduction.&rdquo; It is no wonder that one is inclined to be cynical.  One cannot see how what was said to be an incentive to employers when the reduction was made two months ago can still be regarded as an incentive when one sees this increase by 90 pence per week for the employer.</P>
    <P>In the case of the employee a 55 pence per week increase is also a savage increase.  But that is what Fianna Fáil have done and I think that a large part of the promise which they held out to both employer and employee in their manifesto can now certainly be seen to be laid open in its brutal and, let us say, dishonest real viewing.</P>
    <P>Any social welfare scheme, of course, has anomalies and I think ours is no different from the schemes pertaining in any other country in regard to the number of anomalies which apply. There have been some efforts made in recent years to remove quite a lot of these anomalies but as one anomaly is removed somehow it seems to breed another in its place.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare has announced that he will be bringing in a new scheme of insurance contributions next year, whether that will bring for us a more equitable system of social welfare remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about certain aspects of the administration of the present social welfare system.  Where people have to appeal against refusal of benefit the delay in the processing of such appeals is an undue one.  There should be a speeding up in this matter.  After all, the person who is waiting is waiting for a benefit which cannot be regarded in any sense as either a large or a satisfactory <Col N="765" /> amount sufficient to keep him or his family in any degree of well-being. The Government should also look at the condition of many of the unemployment exchange offices throughout the country.  They certainly need to be modernised and a different status given to them.  There is a stigma attached to them.  Particularly in an era of such high unemployment as we have at the moment we should do everything we possibly can to put a different image and a different face on these buildings.</P>
    <P>This is a Fianna Fáil increase in social welfare contributions; as I said the increase in the benefits is not at all adequate for this year.  I wonder what will happen if towards the end of 1978 the cost of living increase is not seen to be of the small dimension as envisaged by the Government.  Will they then come along and give a further increase in benefits to the recipients?  One has to take into context with this Bill the Health Contributions Bill and where between the two Bills the overall increase in the contributions demanded is excessive, and the increase in the payments of benefits is not nearly enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House very long on this matter because I am aware of my lack of experience in dealing with this kind of matter.  I am aware also that there are very many Senators on both sides of this House who have a very fine record of involvement in all areas of helping people through the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trying to plough through a Bill such as this highlights the fact that a great many people are in a very weak situation in our society.  Therefore it is with a great deal of humility that I am making a couple of remarks about this Social Welfare Bill.  A sum of £36,500,000 is being dealt out in very small increases and this means that a very large number of people&mdash; many of them not very far from this House, others elsewhere throughout the country&mdash;are getting a little bit of extra money which, in fact, will come between them being hungry or being cold.  We should, perhaps, always remind ourselves of that.  I am sure I do <Col N="766" /> not need to remind anybody in the over-heated luxury in this Seanad Chamber of that fact.  I do not want to enter any discussion about whether the increases in contributions should have been announced in the budget. Obviously the money to pay for these increases has to come from somewhere and much of it will have to come from employers and employees.  I hope very much that the new system, the pay-related system, which has been mentioned by the Minister will not be long in making its appearance here for discussion at least because obviously this flat-rate system is not a good way to administer such matters.</P>
    <P>There are one or two categories which I would like to mention but I am aware that when dealing with the kind of misfortune which is implied in a Bill like this priorities are not a good idea.  There are three categories which need help over and above a simple increase which keeps things the way they are relative to inflation.  I would have preferred if we could have been improving very much the relative position of the old, the sick and the children rather than keeping them just about catching up with inflation or, indeed, limping behind it.  It is obvious that the old are particularly defenceless, just as are the sick.  We are probably finally beginning to realise in Ireland that if you treat the mothers of this country badly you thereby hurt their children.  This is becoming more and more obvious as we get these slightly improved benefits for widows, deserted wives and so on.  The House hardly needs to be reminded that until quite recently there was no such thing as a deserted wife in terms of social welfare because she got no assistance whatsoever except some niggardly help given out at the discretion of some person behind a glass case.</P>
    <P>On the question of giving unemployment assistance finally to single women and widows on the same basis as men this, of course, is a right which is long overdue.  In order to avoid delay in actually getting their rights the Minister says the women should apply for their certificate as soon as the Bill is enacted.  That is all very well, of course.  Generally, the kind of people <Col N="767" /> who are being instructed to apply for this certificate are, by reason of the very nature of the assistance, the kind of people who will not know about these things.  I would like to remind the Minister that there is an Employment Equality Agency.  There is a very efficient network of women's organisations throughout the country which should be used to inform women all over the country of this right which is finally being acknowledged as a right.</P>
    <P>Increases in social welfare payments will now be paid to single women, widows and deserted wives &ldquo;in respect of a woman looking after their children.&rdquo;  I object to the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; there.  Is it presuming that if a man is to look after their children he will not be eligible for the assistance as well?  Men are quite capable of looking after children, as I am sure all of you men here who are fathers know.  I hope this does not mean that where a woman goes out to work and a man is minding her children that she cannot claim that assistance.  I hope that will be clarified because as it stands there is far too narrow a definition. As I say, I did not want to say too much on this because I do not know a great deal about the social welfare area.  To reiterate one point, I would like to see an improvement in the position of the weakest rather than just keeping them in line with inflation. This is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing Bills of this nature it is very easy for us to be very critical of a government and to highlight areas where money should be spent.  The fact remains that social progress can only come as a result of economic progress and we must create the necessary wealth if we are to have a fair and progressive social welfare system.  Senator Markey said that this Government were not as socially conscious as he would like them to be. I would respectfully suggest to Senator Markey that it is only a government with a social conscience who would allow single women and widows to claim unemployment assistance on the same terms as men and thus eliminate <Col N="768" /> the disgraceful discrimination that existed in our social welfare code for too long whereby girls could not qualify unless they had a certain number of stamps.  It is only a government with a social conscience that would re-define the term &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; and would not allow children whose father may have deserted their mother, and in cases where the mother died subsequently, to be treated fairly and allow them some sort of income so that they would not have to be sent to an institution. Those are actions taken by a government with a social conscience and I hope it will not be too long before we have more action of this nature.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for us to praise the 10 per cent all-round increase given by the Government and I know that this represents a 6 per cent real increase which is greater than any of the increases given by the previous Coalition Government but I hope that the new Minister will look for some way of giving people with large families an increased children's allowance and I do not mean just an increase across-the-board. I hope that those that need it most will get what they deserve.  I think it is wrong that every family should get the children's allowance simply determined on the basis of the number of children they have.  There should be a means test for this and I hope that the new Minister will investigate that possibility and that it will not be long before parents and families who need it most will get a proper system of children's allowance.  I hope that that system, when it is enacted, will take account of such items as school books and school uniforms and the very large bills that parents have to pay in order to give their children a fair education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope also that widows in our society will be treated better in the future.  Most of us would agree that becoming a widow is a very strange and traumatic experience.  People need time to adjust.  A woman can find herself suddenly in the position where, instead of having £70 or £80 a week coming into a home the income is something like £15 or £16 in cases where there are no children.  Most people, no matter how strong they are, <Col N="769" /> no matter how capable they are of finding themselves a job, take time to re-adjust.  I would like the Government to see if a measure could be introduced whereby a widow could get something in the region of what her husband had been earning for, say, six or maybe three months, in order to give her the necessary time to make the re-adjustments which are so necessary at this stage of her life.  I know that in the case of an old age pension claimed by a couple&mdash;they have the same book as far as I know&mdash;when one of them dies the other person can claim the allowance of the dead person for six weeks.  I think something like this should be brought in in the case of widows.</P>
    <P>There are many other groups in our society that need to be catered for when we are looking at social welfare. I am pleased that the Minister has gone a long way to improving the social welfare system.  Obviously, it takes time to change, modernise and make it a more comprehensive and fair system but he has gone a long way in this regard.  I congratulate him on what he has done.  I know that before long, I think by April 1979&mdash;that was the target date he gave&mdash;he will introduce a more equitable system of social welfare payment whereby you would pay on your social welfare stamp.  The contribution will be related to what you are earning.  That is only fair and proper and I hope it can be implemented in 1979.  Of course, there has to be an upper ceiling limit on it.</P>
    <P>However, I do congratulate the Minister.  I urge him to look particularly at the case of widows and the large families to whom no children's allowance increase was allowed.  It is a pity but I do understand the problem and I hope when he is giving an increase, and it probably will not be very long before he does, he will not just give an across-the-board increase but give it to those who need it.  Some system must be introduced whereby children's allowances are paid to those who need them most rather than simply having an across&mdash;the-board allowance depending on the number of children.  That is not fair or proper <Col N="770" /> and is not something which we should encourage in this day and age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the welcome given to this measure.  We had a contribution from Senator Harney expressing her welcome and looking very objectively at what has been promised by the Minister in this regard.  Senator Markey was not as enthusiastic about the Bill as one might have expected. He concentrated a little bit more on the increased cost of social insurance rather than on the sizeable increased benefits that the Government, through the Minister for Social Welfare, are allocating this year.  We had to wait for Senator Harney to draw attention to something that I had stressed at the outset and that was the fact that this across-the-board 10 per cent increase in benefits that is being conferred on the various groups covered under the social welfare benefits and assistance, taking into consideration the expected increase in the cost of living during 1978, will mean an actual overall 6 per cent increase, over and above what the Government were committed to. As I said, the 10 per cent increase provided in this Bill will more than compensate for the expected increase in the cost of living in 1978.  In fact, as was stressed by Senator Harney, it represents an increase in real terms of some 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Markey drew attention to the reduction of the pound in the stamp contribution from the point of view of the worker earning less than £50 and asked why we should reduce the contribution in January and increase it again in April.  I would stress that the differential in rates of contribution between those earning less than £50 and those earning more is being maintained.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the actual differential now, where it was £1 previously, is to be £1.50 so that while the man on the reduced stamp, the worker earning less than £50, has to contribute more, he is now in greater benefit in so far as he has to contribute £1.50 less than the worker earning more than £50.  Senator Markey drew attention also to the social insurance contribution <Col N="771" /> increase.  This is double what it was last year.  The increase this year, as was stated in my speech, takes account of the full-year cost of increases last year but there was a carry-over.</P>
    <P>The previous Government announced that we were to have increases last October but made no provision for the payment of those increases. We have this Government honouring the commitment entered into by the previous Government.  Were it not for this carry-over of debt left in the hands of the Department the increase would be 82p rather than £1.34.  The real measure of the contribution is that the Exchequer contribution to social insurance is being increased from 19 per cent in 1977 to 22 per cent in 1978.  We have had on record a commitment from the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare that the amount of State involvement, the amount of State contribution, to the social insurance fund was to be annually a diminishing amount.  That trend has been reversed by this Government in that the proportion of State involvement in the overall last year was 19 per cent and this year is 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>That replies to the complaint from Senator Markey regarding no increase being provided in October of this year. We do not see the need for this because we are not caught up in the deluge of price increases that afflicted this country monthly over the four-and-a-half year period of Coalition mismanagement.  That was the reason why the Coalition when in Government annually built up this pattern of a two-tier increase, an increase at budget time and subsequently an increase in October.  The increase in October was necessary in order to catch up with the rapid inflation that had taken place between April and October of any given year but in view of the fact that the present Government through the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy have caught up on that spiral of inflation we do not see the necessity for making provision at this stage for an increase in October next.  This is so particularly in view of the fact that through the 10 per cent, we are <Col N="772" /> keeping 6 per cent ahead of the need for making that sort of provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey dealt with this question also.  She talked about the 10 per cent across-the-board as being not quite adequate for particular categories.  She drew specific attention to two categories in which she was particularly interested and felt that the 10 per cent did not cover the old and the sick but then immediately went on to the hobbyhorse of the widows and the deserted wives, leaving behind the two categories in which she said that she had a particular interest.  She also dealt with the statement in my introduction where I mentioned the necessity to get across to the some 50,000 single women and widows who were going to benefit under the provision of the budget that facilities, for which a demand had been made over a period, to bring them in line with single men were being made available for them.  Senator Hussey welcomed this provision and said she felt that there were women's organisations that could spread the good news about. Senator Hussey need have no fear in this regard.  The word has been spread. There was a consistent demand for this over a period but this demand had not been met until, in fulfilment again of a manifesto promise by the Government, the Minister for Social Welfare made provision for it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Although the difficulty of administration makes it impossible to make the necessary arrangements to pay this unemployment assistance before October next the Minister is encouraging women who will be anxious to sign on to sign from the time this Bill has been passed so the way can be cleared for those who qualify to draw the unemployment assistance as from the date from which it applies.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey said specifically that we should improve the position of the less well-off rather than keep benefits in line with the cost of living. There is a point of view that the 10 per cent across-the-board is not the ideal way to tackle this job but in view of the fact that it was so much ahead of the actual cost-of-living increase that we had committed ourselves <Col N="773" /> to the Minister felt that it was the more appropriate way to do it, especially, as Senator Hussey pointed out, since a comprehensive pay-related contribution scheme is to be introduced in April 1979.</P>
    <P>I will draw the attention of the Minister to what appears to be quite a legitimate request from Senator Harney, that is, that specific attention be given to the desirability of having a look at a means test in relation to children's allowances and to give preference to increased amounts of children's allowances to bigger families. There is favourable thinking in this regard.  The Senator mentioned also the special case of widows.  I will draw the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare to that also.  In general I want to thank the House for the reception of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Again, I must apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health.  He is ill and asked me to take this Bill on his behalf and introduce it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was made clear when the original Health Contributions Bill was being debated in 1971 that the rates of contribution would have to be increased as time progressed.  The rates provided for in the 1971 Act were 15p per week or £7 per year.  As Senators are aware, the rates have in fact been increased at intervals since then.  They were increased in 1974, in 1976 and in 1977 when the rates of contribution became 39p a week, or £18 a year.  The Bill now before the House provides for an <Col N="774" /> increase in these rates to 50p weekly and £24 annually, with effect from 1 April 1978.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill defines the groups of persons who are liable to pay health contributions and outlines the services to which they and their dependants are entitled.  Persons who hold medical cards are exempted from paying the contributions.</P>
    <P>The present system for determining &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; is a complex one which contains many anomalies.  In the couse of the Second Reading debate in the Dáil some Deputies were critical, for example, of the position of non-manual <i>vis-á-vis</i> manual workers in so far as eligibility for services is concerned.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister for Health has recently announced that it is the Government's intention to replace the present flat-rate social welfare and health contributions by a fully pay-related scheme.  The Minister hopes to put forward proposals at an early date based on a report from an inter-departmental working group set up to work out the details of such a scheme.  It is expected that the introduction of this new pay-related scheme should eliminate many of the present anomalies and should make it far easier for everybody to understand.</P>
    <P>Health costs are rising rapidly.  When health contributions were first introduced, public non-capital expenditure on our health services was £86 million, of which the Exchequer contributed £45 million.  In 1978 it is estimated that non-capital expenditure on health services will be of the order of £365 million, of which all but about £20 million will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Specific &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services are hospital in-patient and specialist out-patient services, maternity and infant care services and the drugs and medicines subsidy scheme.  The estimated cost of these services for 1978 is £265 million.  The total yield expected from health contributions in 1978, based on the increased rates provided for in the Bill, is of the order of £16½ million, or about 6 per cent of the overall cost of providing &ldquo;limited <Col N="775" /> eligibility&rdquo; services.  From the contributor's point of view, therefore, it is clear that he is getting extremely good value for money.</P>
    <P>The extent of the increase in the cost of hospital and specialist services must be a matter of serious concern and it is a problem to which the Minister for Health will be devoting close attention.  There are many factors which influence costs and, I think it appropriate that I should mention some of them.  They include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the inflationary effects of pay and price increases;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the extra demands for services arising from the increase in population and other causes;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the need to improve the standard of institutional care for the aged, chronic sick and the handicapped and the provision of homes for the ambulant aged to replace substandard accommodation in county homes;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the advances in medical technology involving more sophisticated techniques and equipment, more specialised staff and greater use of intensive care units;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the increases in the numbers of accidents;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the provision of improved care facilities for infants at risk;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the need to provide on an increasing scale services for persons suffering from illnesses caused to some extent by excessive drinking and smoking;</P>
    <P>&mdash; increases in the levels of hospital personnel so as to ensure that good standards of service will be available.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have explained some of the reasons for the increased rates of health contributions proposed in the Bill and I commend it for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>While much of what the Minister said in his statement is true, nevertheless one finds it difficult to welcome a measure of this sort coming at this time, in complete isolation from the budgetary provisions which provide the money <Col N="776" /> necessary for these services.  This tax, as we may call it, should not be seen directly in relation to the health services.  It is purely a measure of taxation levied against a particular group of people.  It is not related to the services given in return for the money spent.  In pointing out the facts and figures relating to the health services, the Minister pointed out clearly, in the sums he mentioned, how much out of tune this charge is with the cost of the health services. It is not, nor is it claimed to be, related to any inflationary trend, any increase in the standards of living, wages or anything else.  It is purely a measure of taxation, which is being used with other areas, where somebody decided we could safely levy a new taxation or increase an old one without attracting too much attention, something for which we could say a service would be rendered.  There is no indication of where one can reasonably associate this increase with the service given.</P>
      <P>We are talking about an increase of 28 per cent.  In money terms this is not a vast sum yet it is so out of tune with all other costs, expenses and increases that it must be regarded as an inflationary measure and one which will be, and can be, used, and rightly so, by people arguing for increased wages and services.  It can be taken as a guideline of the increases which the Government have in mind when they sit down to levy taxes. However, it is very far from the figure the Government concede people need to get by way of increased wages or social welfare allowances.</P>
      <P>It is a wrong system of raising money.  From the very start, I could never see much sense in it.  It is true to say that even the people who pay it do not get a return for their money. You are entitled to the health services whether you pay this money or not. On the other hand, if you pay it, as many people do, it does not automatically establish your eligibility for these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme was introduced without any proper machinery or means being established for collecting the money.  Throughout rural Ireland every <Col N="777" /> day we meet people who have health problems.  They go to somebody they think knows something about the matter and ask if they ought to pay the £12, the £18, or now the £24 &mdash; the amount changes so rapidly that people cannot even keep track of the figure.  They wonder if they are entitled to the services because they have not paid their contributions. Some people should have paid yet never got a bill or a demand of any sort.  Other people are getting demands while at the same time, their land valuation, means, or income puts them outside the group who are eligible for the services.  A large number of people who have got demands for this money consistently through the years have never paid it.  There is no proper machinery to collect it.  For this reason the whole idea of this comparatively small separate system of taxation should be looked at.  We have a Government abolishing some systems of taxation, for instance, the rates on houses and, at the same time, starting to build up another system which takes money mostly from the same people without having established any proper machinery for collecting it.  As time goes on the Government will have to face up to the fact that there is no alternative to the establishment of proper machinery for collecting this money.  It is going to cost money. I cannot see the justice in a system where one-third of the people in rural Ireland are liable to pay this but are not paying it, and have never paid it, and at the same time it is being demanded from many people who should not have to pay it.  For all these reasons it is not a good idea.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister conceded that the question of the manual and non-manual worker is going to change and that he is going to take a look at a pay-related scheme.  The question of manual and non-manual worker is already out of date and it becomes more out of date every day that passes. It is a carry-over from the days when there was thought to be some essential difference between people engaged in different types of work and when there was usually an important differential in pay.  That is an entirely wrong <Col N="778" /> concept on which to base any benefit, charge or tax.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's suggestion that the system of charge and eligibility is going to be replaced by some sort of pay-related system.  At a time like this, the whole question of how this money is being spent should come into question, but perhaps that widens the debate into a gereral discussion on the health services, which the Minister almost did here in his statement.  For the amount of money involved, the Department of Health and the Minister could spend the time and expertise required to solve this problem and the problem of collecting this money.  They should also make some effort to streamline the health services, particularly the general medical services where there is so much left to the judgment of the people on the ground and where there can be such vast differences in the amount of money being spent from one area to another and from one dispensary area to another. All that requires a great deal of looking at and a straightening out.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of money is being expended on drugs for medical card holders and people who are eligible to get assistance and free drugs under some circumstances, even people who fall into the category we are debating today.  A lot needs to be done to streamline this whole area.  It is not within the competence of the individual health boards to solve this probblem. It is a matter that must be looked at from national level, from the source where all the money is being provided, to see whether this money is being used in the best way and for the benefit of the people who are genuinely sick and requiring treatment.  There are so much abuses in all this area, so much careless spending while at the same time so many other services require to be strengthened and expanded that the whole question of the spending of the vast amounts of money in the area of health needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>One area mentioned by the Minister was the question of the care of the aged.  I would like him to bear in mind that in the past few years we got a rapid extension of the welfare home facilities, county home facilities and <Col N="779" /> geriatric hospital facilities, which provide for older people.  I would like to see more emphasis on day care centres and day hospitals where older people are brought in and given the medical services they require and the facilities of a hospital &mdash; day room, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, or whatever is available for that day &mdash; and then being allowed return to their homes.  As I go around the country and look at the welfare homes, I see too many people there who I honestly believe could live in their own homes, given the facilities provided by day care centres.</P>

      <P>The other point he mentioned was in regard to medicines and hardship.  I would like to draw his attention to the severe cases of asthma one comes across every day.  It is not a prescribed illness and should be included.  This was possibly recommended at an earlier stage in another debate.  The Minister made a brief reference to it in his statement.  Those are the remarks I would like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that we should have such a rapid rate of increase at a time when everybody is trying to attune the economy and people's thinking to lower increases in wages and a lowering of the rate of increase in taxation and when inflation is not as rapid as it was.  Now we introduce what is an inflationary trend of 28 per cent of an increase and seek to relate this to the sort of service that is being given when in reality it is just an ordinary everyday taxation measure which has nothing to do with the health services <Col N="780" /> and does not mean that people will get any extra benefit or any extra services of any sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat amused that Senator McCartin should open his remarks by protesting that this measure should be introduced other than at budget time.  I remember making a similar protest when the Coalition Government did it in 1974, 1976 and 1977.  I cannot remember whether Senator McCartin joined me in that protest.  I would agree with a lot of what he says about the collecting of this money.  I believe the Health Contributions Act 1971 was a very useful measure.  It eliminated a considerable amount of distress in that people qualified for specialist and hospital services who otherwise would have had to join the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I know from my experience as a member of the health board that even yet there are many people who pay this contribution through their insurance stamp and do not know the benefits they are entitled to.  I found this out particularly in the recent past when medical cards were under review.  I met many people who in that review lost their medical cards because their income had increased and they were of the opinion that they would now have to pay for hospital services.  The very fact that they are paying it through their stamp shows they simply do not take the time to study what they are entitled to.  Many of these people would be put to enormous expense had this Health Contributions Act not been introduced by Fianna Fáil back in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the method of collection lends itself to improvement, particularly in the small farming section. This money is collected by the health boards.  The method of collection may vary from health board to health board but in the north western region it is very unsatisfactory.  For example, people who may be substantial businessmen and who may have small farms as well will receive a demand for this payment.  Many of them in the past paid it in the belief that this would entitle them to hospital and specialist services for themselves and their families.  In paying it they did not <Col N="781" /> read the small print at the back of the demand note which stated that if their income was in excess of whatever it was at the time, even by paying the demand they were not entitled to it. In this way the health boards are protected. If a person receives a demand it is natural that he or she may believe that in paying it he or she is entitled to the service.  There is a considerable amount of small print at the back of the demand note and I would say very few people ever read it.</P>
    <P>Then we find people who have no income whatsoever receiving demand notes.  Small farmers on the dole and having medical cards year after year receive this demand note, receive threats to prosecute, and so on.  They do not understand what it is all about. Many of us meet these people from time to time.  These are not just isolated instances.  I would ask the Minister of State to draw the attention of the Minister for Health to this matter and to tell him that the method of collection of this contribution, in the farming section at any rate, is in need of immediate reform.</P>
    <P>As Senator McCartin said, there are many people paying this contribution who should not be paying it.  I have come across medical card holders who paid this demand because they felt that once they received it they should pay. I have come across business people, whose income is completely in excess of the standards, who have paid this demand in the belief that they were getting something for nothing.  Then we find there are many people who could avail of the service but who do not pay.  I also find that the bookkeeping for this particular collection must be very poor.  I have written year after year to the health board pointing out that certain people were in no way obliged to pay this money and I received replies that they would be struck off, only to find the following year that the demand was being sent out again.  It would be a very useful exercise on the part of the Minister for Health to institute an investigation into this type of collection and possibly co-ordinate it throughout the country. <Col N="782" /> The Minister mentioned the various factors which influenced increased costs today.  I agree that the aged could be card for without so much State investment, that more emphasis should be placed on the home, that the numbers of home helps should be increased and that the number of nurses from the psychiatric hospitals &mdash; and there are a number of them in each region visiting patients after they leave hospital &mdash; should be increased. There are many old people being looked after by their relatives who do not want them to go into welfare homes or other institutions but who receive no payment for them whatsoever. This should be investigated. These people should be encouraged to keep their aged at home.  They should not be discouraged to such an extent that they encourage the aged to go into institutions.  I realise I cannot develop this too far because it would not be relevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>One particular item which was referred to by Senator McCartin &mdash; I say that because he may not now tell me I am out of order &mdash; is the cost of drugs. That matter will have to examined.  If it was restricted it might not have been necessary to increase the contributions under this Bill at this stage.  In the North Western Health Board region alone the cost of drugs in 11 months was £1.75 million.  I realise that in fairness I cannot develop this matter too much but there is a lot that could be said about it and I hope that this is one of the many avenues which the Minister for Health will investigate in order to cut costs.  It is a pity that this increase has become necessary.  It is now £24 annually.  When one considers that the only alternative to paying this £24 annually, or 50p per week, would be to join the voluntary health insurance one must appreciate that there is a great saving.  It would cost a family at least three times as much money to join the Voluntary Health Insurance Boards.  For that reason I feel I must welcome the measure and certainly say that its introduction the first day has saved a considerable amount of money for a certain section of the community who will be caught very bady.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>At least in the case of the Social Welfare Bill which we have just discussed there were some increases in benefit payments visible in return for the increase in contributions imposed.  In this Bill there are no such increases in benefits and there are no extra services at all available for the contributors in return for what is quite a hefty increase.  While 50p per week and £24 annually may not seem exorbitant amounts, yet the increase involved in those new figures does add up in conjunction with the other increases already imposed in the ordinary insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, this increase from £18 to £24, and from 39p to 50p, does represent the largest percentage increase for any one-year period since the introduction of the Bill back in 1971.  After a four-year period the rate went up from £7 to £12 yearly in 1975, and from 15p, the initial rate, to 26p weekly after a four-year period.  In 1976 it went from 12p to 15p and from 26p to 33p and in 1977 the yearly rate went up by approximately 25 per cent in the case of the annual rate and roughly 18 per cent in the case of the weekly contribution, but now we have an increase in the annual contribution of 33? per cent and in the case of the weekly contribution an increase of 28 per cent.  All in all, the largest percentage increase for a one-year period since the scheme was introduced back in 1971.</P>
      <P>It is a taxation measure, pure and simple, a taxation measure to which there was no reference in the budget although there was reference in the same budget to increases in benefits under the Social Welfare Bill.  There was no reference whatsoever to the increase in the contribution that would be required either under the Social Welfare Bill or under this Health Contributions Bill.  This is something the Government will have to remember when they introduce future budgets, that the public will not be blinded to this deliberate failure to disclose increases in contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is high time that the distinction that exists in this Health Contributions Bill between manual and non-manual classes should disappear.  Such a distinction is neither appropriate nor <Col N="784" /> desirable in the times in which we live, and while the Minister places some hope in that the new pay-related scheme which he will bring in in April 1979 will go a long way towards eliminating many of the present anomalies, I would certainly hope that this anomaly, this distinction between manual and non-manual will disappear once and for all.</P>
    <P>In regard to the present administration of the Health Contributions Act, chiefly in the collection of the annual contribution, there is a big percentage difference between the numbers that are liable and the numbers that actually pay their annual contribution. The record of collections in this respect is not at all satisfactory.  In Louth we were informed recently that the rate of collection is only about 50 per cent; it could be even less.  The experience has been that in the case of many annual contributors such payments are not made until the need for obtaining the benefit under the schemed arises and then people are inclined to pay up and even pay some arrears.  Because the sum of £24, which I admitted earlier is a small amount taken in its individual sense, and certainly anybody faced with hospitalisation or any in-patient services is not going to opt out of the scheme which will only impose a burden of say £24 annually and even have to pay one or two years arrears as well, it is possible for many in the self-employed categories to defer making their payments each year.</P>
    <P>The fact that collections are not made each year, as was envisaged in the introduction of this scheme, means that the State is losing money and somebody else has to carry the cost of the operation of the scheme and the services which pertain to it.  This in the final result seems to be the weekly contributors who have little option but to pay in by deduction each week anyway.  The Minister should certainly look at ways to improve the method of collection.  There is an unfair system there at the moment and it should be determined as quickly as possible so that all people pay as they are required by the health boards and by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There have been hints in the past <Col N="785" /> of a greater share of the cost of health and social welfare services being carried in the future by the contributors rather than the Exchequer. The Minister has not indicated that such will arise in regard to his new pay-related scheme.  Perhaps he might be able to elaborate a little upon it. Those hints have been dropped and I wonder if they will apply under his new scheme.  It seems to me that an awful lot is depending on this new pay-related scheme in regard to abolishing certain anomalies which exist at the moment, both in regard to the Social Welfare Bill and also this Bill.  The Minister has made great play of the fact that what is being imposed now is merely a holding operation, as it were, until this new pay-related scheme comes in, and I certainly hope that all that we hope for will be in it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in regard to the operation of the health contribution scheme that there is wide confusion amongst contributors particularly as regards what benefits and services are available, and even as to the eligibility of the contributor under this scheme.  Paying the contribution yearly does not make one eligible for the benefits, it only places one in the queue for receiving such benefits and one's eligibility has still to be determined.  There is something wrong in this.  It would appear to me to be unfair to take money from people, and then perhaps at some future stage tell them that they are not eligible for the benefits.</P>
    <P>Certainly for the amounts of money which are involved in the limited eligibility services &mdash; the Minister has given an estimated cost for 1978 of £265 million &mdash; its recoupment to the order of £16½ million under this health contribution scheme does seem very small, and to know whether or not that very smallness will mean that there will be further contribution levies in the future we will have to await the new pay-related scheme.  I have no objection to the amounts that are being asked.  My objection is that there is an increase without any addition or extension of the services in return.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one point.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> I think the Minister is doing his best for the day-centres which, as was mentioned by one of the Senators, are so necessary.  He is fully aware of this and he has helped many such centres, as I know, in Dublin and County Dublin and, I am certain, throughout the country.  This is a very important point. I feel that 6 per cent is not very much, taking the overall figures that were given to us today. I should like to welcome this Bill and I think the Minister will certainly streamline the health services and will give a great deal of consideration to old people and sick children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief comment on a statement in the Minister's speech to the effect that the present system of determining &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; is a complex one which contains many anomalies.  Every Member of this House, every public representative and thousands of other people realise that &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; is a complex procedure and is one that causes a lot of misunderstanding and a great deal of annoyance.  We have now reached the stage when there should be a more standard procedure to determine this limited eligibility.</P>
      <P>This applies to people who are in the income group where they pay as much as they can and then, because of unforeseen circumstances or because of an extension of a period of hospitalisation or other unforeseen difficulties, they reach a stage when they are able to pay no longer.  There is not a sufficiently sympathetic approach to people of that kind.  Very often from the point of view of poor law valuation their annual income is only very little above the standard of people who receive medical cards.  Because they are even slightly above it they have to pay the cost themselves and they find that they run into something totally unexpected and something which is far beyond their ability to pay.  Very often it is a source of great worry, annoyance and disturbance to these people.  I hope that the process of determining this will be made more simple and that it will be done rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the increase from 15p per week in 1971 to 50p now, this constitutes <Col N="787" /> an increase of something in the nature of 233 per cent from 1971 to 1978.  The increase from £18 in 1977 to £24 annually in 1978 is an increase of 33? per cent.  In the opening sentence of the Minister's speech he said that it was made clear when the original Health Contributions Bill was being debated in 1971 that the rates of contribution would have to be increased as time progressed.  The House should have been informed as to how much of this increase would be due to inflation and how much would be due to the fact that more services were being provided.  It should have been broken down in that way.  People should be told that part of the increase of 233 per cent from 1971 to 1978 is due to inflation and part of it is due to the increased services provided. We have not been told that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the increase in the cost of drugs, as a member of the North Eastern Health Board I know that this phenomenal increase is a matter of grave concern at health board meetings. Various members of the health boards, professional and lay people, are of the opinion that some definite action will have to be taken by various Departments to ensure that there is a certain standardisation in the type of drug prescribed and that a constant check is kept on the increase because it is the one item in the health board expenditure that has gone out of control in recent years.  It is something that needs attention.  This is also a cause of grave concern in Britain.  It is something that calls for the closest scrutiny on the part of officials of the Department and of the health board and general help from the Irish Medical Association.  It is a matter of great concern to the members of the health boards.</P>
    <P>At a health board meeting in Kells this matter was discussed and the opinion was expressed by a number of people that drugs were prescribed much too freely and were being given in inordinate numbers.  It is quite a common thing for people to have a lot of drugs in the home.  They become ineffective and perhaps dangerous after some time.  This is something that calls for the closest scrutiny and <Col N="788" /> examination in order to slow down, if not eliminate, the vast increase in the use of drugs in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to join in a plea to the Minister that people suffering from asthma should be on the list of people for special treatment with regard to allowances and help.  Every Member present realises that there are asthma patients who suffer very great trouble and have the greatest difficulty in being able to provide for themselves and getting the treatment that is necessary to make life tolerable.  When one is familiar with what some of these sufferers from asthma go through it is difficult to accept that it should be ruled out time after time.  The North Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, made representations to the former Minister for Health to have sufferers from asthma included but without success.</P>
    <P>We had a long list of items at the end of the Minister's speech.  He said that the extent of the increase in the cost of hospital and specialist services must be a matter of serious concern and it is a problem to which he will be devoting close attention.  There are many factors which influence his thoughts.</P>
    <P>I realise that a great deal of progress has been made with regard to the treatment of aged people in geriatric units in latter years.  It is still a fact that there is a high percentage of aged and ageing people in the more sparsely populated and remote parts of this country who are sent into hospital and who would much prefer to be at home and live in their own environment.  What is needed to reduce the number of patients in these hospitals is a further extension of domiciliary care for people of that nature.  With more domiciliary care these people would be much happier in their own homes than in hospitals.  I do not want to be taken as saying that I am not very pleased with the improvement which is being made in regard to treatment of patients in the geriatric hospitals.  I do not think that there is a wrong emphasis and that there is far too great an inclination to send people into hospitals of this kind who could be treated successfully at home and who would live happier <Col N="789" /> lives at home and be much more contented with their lot than they are in these institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the financing of health services and State health services in general. As we have seen from information supplied to us the cost of medical services for 1978 will be something like £365 million and the contributions will amount to something like £16 million, which is a very small percentage.  The Exchequer, in other words, is covering the main cost.</P>
      <P>We have had much discussion over the years in this country about medical services but one thing that they learned in the UK is that if you go too far with them you end up with poor services.  My information from making inquiries from people in the North of Ireland is that we should not get over-involved in a free medical service.  I say this designedly because, through my work in the Dublin North-Central area and the inner area of the city where people are living very close to the poverty line and come under the impact of the social welfare benefits as a result of not leading a full and ordinary life because a lot of them are unemployed, I know that this is needed but I am just raising the <i>caveat</i> and saying that we should not go the whole way and some contribution for health services should come from everybody.  We should be seen to pay for it.</P>
      <P>The argument that went on in the Dáil about the percentage increase was a matter of playing with figures. We are talking about something like between 7 and 9 per cent of a low income.  What is more important, as I see it, is the way we spend this money. In fact, the Minister has given us a listing in his opening statement of where expenditure goes, and you yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, were tempted to have a long look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity on this occasion to draw attention &mdash; and I am here supporting the previous speaker &mdash; to the amount of drugs that seem to be in the system.  I visit a lot of flats in the inner city area as part of my constituency work and I must <Col N="790" /> agree that I have never seen so many bottles of drugs all over shelves.  I have seen the effects of it, which is worse.  One can understand that people get depressed living, sometimes, in the surroundings that they have to live in and without having the challenge and sense of achievement that having a good job and doing a good day's work gives a person, and that they would have resort to these things.  But I think it is a matter that needs very careful watching.  The older people, particularly, who are living very often in dread of their lives, sometimes in dread of losing whatever little property they have, resort to these as a means of trying to forget about their problems.</P>
    <P>This brings me to point out probably one of the worst problems arising from one of the worst drugs of all &mdash; drink.  The people of this area have nowhere to go to socialise and the obvious place is the pub.  I think the Minister might give some consideration to a much bigger campaign against the &ldquo;round&rdquo; system.  It seems to me that we need some motto like &ldquo;rounds are rotten&rdquo;.  They are rotting this country.  People who have a small amount of money are spending it continuously in pubs as a means of forgetting their everyday problems and finding some outlet.  That has to be tackled as well.</P>
    <P>In complaining about the increases, we talk about the problems of the detention centres.  I am not widening the debate too much but I see it every week and hear people talking a lot of social science clap-trap about the process of development of young people when it is really impossible to control them.  There is a hard core of people in my area who need to be detained. Any money that can be made available, however it is collected, should go to providing more detention centres.  Crash action of some kind is needed in that inner city area.  I get more depressed as I see the problem. Periodically I hear statements from Bishops about the Third World and about what money we are not contributing there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to the increases.  Most certainly I would have to go on record with regard to limited eligibility.  One of the most clearly marked international trends in the evolution of health services is towards access free of charge to health services.  Our own NESC report last July showed that the coverage for health services in Ireland is less comprehensive than that provided elsewhere in the EEC.  Indeed, the general plan in the Community has been towards total coverage for health services.  Belgium, France, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg achieved total free service in 1971.  In 1976 the Dutch made their health system comprehensive for all categories of risk, and that applied to all sections of the population. It makes Ireland as a member of the Community an exception to the general trend.  Our health services appear to be falling or at least remaining stationary.  Therefore, if you had a return to full employment it would reduce the percentage in receipt of benefits under full eligibility.  Changes in earnings and the failure to adjust income ceilings in line with increases would reduce the scope of the limited eligibility scheme.  That is happening at the moment and by next year I can well see that there will be many people who will not qualify, even under £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974, when the income level for insurance under the Social Welfare Act was abolished the income for limited eligibility for health services was also considered and the decision was only deferred, as I understand it, pending the completion of negotiations with medical consultants.  However, we got to £2,250 pending the completion of negotiations, and then the income level was raised to £3,000 in July 1976. Even though we welcomed it at the <Col N="792" /> time &mdash; I thought it was a move in the right direction &mdash; the flaws are beginning to show up now.  If you look at the figures, at present 35 per cent of the population are covered by the general medical service schemes and have full eligibility for health services, but there is great doubt about the extent of the availability of limited eligibility benefits.  The Department, I think, said earlier in the year that 50 per cent of the population were covered for limited eligibility.  This is not accepted in the trade union movement &mdash; indeed the Irish Congress of Trade Unions contradicated it because of the time-lags between the increases in income and the income limit being raised.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions pointed out that in 1958, 90 per cent were covered by free and limited eligibility as opposed to the current estimate of 85 per cent.  If that is true, it means that the remaining 15 per cent of the population are responsible for the full cost of any medical service they require and they can only insure themselves against costs through voluntary health insurance or private organisations.  It is an intolerable situation in this day and age, particularly in the light of what is happening in the other EEC countries, that workers should have to turn to private organisations to give themselves some protection, and they are not covered under VHI for the birth of a child, for example.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he is prepared to introduce a comprehensive pay-related scheme.  I will quote him:</P>
    <P>It is expected that the introduction of this new pay-related scheme should eliminate many of the present anomalies and should make it very easy for everybody to understand.</P>
    <P>Our argument is not that many of the anomalies should be removed but that they should all be removed.  I know it is not easy to do it but we have to go on record as saying that we believe it is a crazy situation.  The working party on the definition of limited eligibility were set up in January 1977 by the Department of Health.  They have not been able to resolve the problems in relation to the discriminatory element.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> I do not know how they can solve such problems in Europe and other places and we cannot.  This is a bit of a puzzle to me.  However, the only way it can be solved in my opinion is that the income that limit must be removed completely in the case of non-manual workers.  That would bring the non-manual workers into line with the manual workers.  To keep people pegged down to roughly £58 per week is not unfair in light of the fact that in the recent wage negotiations the Government themselves accepted a £50 level when dealing with the question of stamps.  To my mind it is not satisfactory.  It would be all the same if you took the limit off and made it £4,000 because you would have problems again next year.  The limit must be removed completely if you want to solve the problem totally.  I cannot lay enough stress on the question of the anomalies between non-manual and manual workers.  There are thousands of them in the private and public sectors.  If you walk into the bar here for a drink, the barman who serves you is not eligible or considered to be in the category to qualify.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the NESC report published last July, it refused the arguments put forward against the abolition of the income limit.  To some extent it exposed the absurdity of the distinction between manual and non-manual employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the doctors themselves, they seemed earlier to be making the argument that universal eligibility was being rejected by them because it would increase the demand for health services.  This is not experienced in other countries.  If it can be done in Belgium, Denmark, Holland and the United Kingdom then it must be possible to do it here.  The argument of the doctors appears to be contrary to the other health care systems throughout Europe.  The doctors determine the demand for the beds and so forth, and the indications there are that the system does not extend the demand on the resources, that it has its own way of levelling out.</P>
    <P>I should like to go on record as saying that I realise there is a problem of high administration costs.  There is <Col N="794" /> also a problem of administering the system because of its complexities.  If the limit was removed I feel there would be a substantial saving.  Apart from the fact that this complex programme is costing a lot of money, it is possible to make the argument, and I make it, that if the income limit was removed a lot of the complexities would be removed and the administrative costs would be reduced &mdash; that the total cost of removing the income limit may not be as substantial as was at first envisaged.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the debate that any measure that deals with social welfare or health benefits is not considered a suitable vehicle for scoring political points.  This is of course a budgetary measure and like other Senators I have done my sums. They are quite simple sums.  I will not blind you with statistics, but the rise in the consumer price index during the period 1975 to 1976 was 16.2 per cent while the rise in the cost of the stamp for the same period was 25 per cent. In the period 1976 to 1977 the rise in the consumer price index or the cost of living index was 14 per cent and the rise in the cost of the stamp was 18 per cent.  When we look at benefits given by the State in those two periods, and I will just mention one, the one with which I am most familiar, the children's allowance, we find that in July 1975 there was an increase of 5.3 per cent in children's allowances and in July 1977 there was an increase of 8.4 per cent.  This proves only the need for some sort of monitoring system which would ensure that increases in contributions and in benefits would bear some relation to the increases in the cost of living.</P>

    <P>This is an interim measure and we look forward to the new scheme that the Minister hopes to introduce this time next year, and we hope that it will do away with the anomalies and with the faults that exist at present. The faults that exist at present can be categorised under two headings.  The first is delay, and one must look under this heading at the appalling waste that occurs when somebody is sent into hospital for tests or for something else, and the delay that occurs when <Col N="795" /> he is left there for several days before somebody has any time to look at him. The second category is one of definition. In this we must include the confusion that seems to exist at present as to who is a manual worker and who is not.  Under this heading I agree with a point made by several Senators as to what constitutes a chronic illness and what does not.  Many children today suffer from asthma, a chronic illness and a very terrifying one for parents, and yet it does not come under the heading of eligibility as a chronic illness.</P>
    <P>Within these limitations I welcome this Bill.  I would also like to congratulate the Minister of State, who is standing in today for the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, on the excellence of his brief and to applaud his courage in coming into the Seanad on the Ides of March.</P>

      <P>It is an appropriate note to be coming in on, though I think it might have been as well if some other Deputy had to contribute because I do not quite welcome the idea of being a sort of Ides of March speaker.  However, there has been a useful and wide-ranging discussion on this measure.  From my point of view, standing here for the Minister and not being an expert on the subject, I quite honestly have learned a lot.  On the other hand, I have been a member of a local authority and am fully conscious of the many problems that a number of the Senators spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, most of the discussion was on the question of limited eligibility, and as we went on it seemed to become more limited.  We now have reached the stage that roughly 40 per cent of the people are on medical cards.  That leaves 60 per cent.  Senator Harte said that between medical cards and people on limited eligibility we cover up to about 85 per cent.  Roughly 45 per cent are covered by the term &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo;, and the number of people who have medical cards in 1978 as against the number of people who had medical cards in 1971 has been increased from about 30 per cent <Col N="796" /> to about 38 per cent.  The numbers of people covered under the &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; are that little fewer mainly because some of the people who were required to pay as self-employed or as farmers and the people who had to pay through the stamp, have been reduced by reason of the increased amount, that 10 per cent increase that has occurred in the number of people covered by medical cards.  Quite a number of views were expressed from both sides of the House on the non-application of health boards to the comprehensive collection of the health contributions from farmers and self-employed. A number of the Senators talked about the fact that there seems to be a degree of indecisiveness in the demands issuing from the various health authorities in so far as people who had medical cards were getting demands for contributions.  From that point of view I agree that there is the need for a lot of tightening up.  Senator McCartin opened on this.</P>
    <P>As I am deputising for the Minister for Health I have the responsibility of reporting on the proceedings to him. Of course, he will be able to read the content of the debate when it is printed.  It is quite obvious from the views expressed that there is a pronounced interest in the pay-related scheme which he proposes to introduce this time next year.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin described the Bill as a taxation measure.  That is one opinion.  I was interested in Senator Markey's follow-up in which he said it was the greatest single annual increase since 1971, from 18p to 24p, an increase of 33? per cent.  In fairness, I should point out that in 1975 the then Minister for Health, in introducing the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, imposed an increase from 15p to 26p in the price of the stamp, representing 73 per cent as against this year's increase of 28 per cent, from 39p to 50p.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it was the first increase in four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I thought the Senator would draw my attention to that fact, that that is why he spelled out that it was an increase <Col N="797" /> of 33? per cent in one year.  When the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office in 1973 there was only a two-year period between that and the time of the next increase.  I do not think the comparison stands Senator Markey in good stead because within a year and a half of the Coalition taking office that increase took place. Although I agree that it was the first increase since 1971, I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that it was introduced in less than two years from the time the Coalition Government took office.  That represented a 73 per cent increase on the stamp and it was a 71 per cent increase, from £7 to £12, in the annual contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the Minister accepts that it was a 73 per cent increase for a four-year period as compared with a 33? per cent increase for a one-year period, I am satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Government are concerned, it was a 73 per cent increase within a two-year period.  I suppose we can agree to differ on our individual approach. There were many references to the administrative expense at health board level and the overall pattern in which there may be neglect or otherwise in the different approaches to the collection of money from the self-employed and farmers.  In this context we are speaking of an estimated receipt during the year 1978 of £16.6 million, of which £14.3 million will be collected by way of the stamp, £1.3 million by the health boards directly from farmers and £.99 million by the Collector-General from the self-employed. Therefore, a more streamlined and convenient way of collecting that money must be found.  I know it is one of the proposals engaging the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators McCartin, O'Brien and Cassidy all spoke about the inclusion of asthma in the list of chronic diseases. I am conscious that it is a very distressing illness.  It does not specifically arise under the terms of this Bill but I will draw the Minister's attention to the views expressed by Senators on the desirability of having it listed as a prescribed illness in view of the undoubted <Col N="798" /> pressures it brings on individual patients and on parents because of its effects on children.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding acknowledged the Minister's interest in day centres, particularly in Dublin, and his unquestioned interest in old people and sick children.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien had much to say about limited eligibility and in that context I noted that there had been an increase in the percentage allocation of medical cards from 30 to 38.  He was supported in his argument by Senator McGlinchey in relation to observations on the cost of drugs, and Senator Mulcahy referred to the demand for drugs.  Various Senators had different approaches to this question. Senator Harte, speaking on his own behalf, and probably that of his party, said he did not have any objection to the increase in charges but had much to say on limited eligibility.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien and Senator Mulcahy spoke about visiting people's houses and seeing presses full of drugs.  I have always held the view &mdash; and I think it is shared by many people &mdash; that anything you get for nothing is not sufficiently appreciated. For the limited eligibility category the contribution is £24 for the self-employed and farmer and 50p per week as a contribution to the stamp. The overall cost of the health services is £380 per contributor.  People will value the service more if they have to pay some small amount for it, which is what happens in regard to limited eligibility.</P>
    <P>The people we are talking about are those who are entitled to the clinical service, out-patient and in-patient service, but they are not the category entitled to free drugs.  I take it that the presses full of drugs which Senator O'Brien and Senator Mulcahy spoke about belong to people holding medical cards.  Generally it is accepted that this is not a new development.  In the old days with the old dispensary system we had stories told about the housewife who used go to the dispensary weekly to have a chat with other housewives and who on her way home poured into a drain the <Col N="799" /> contents of the bottle she had been given.  The visit to the dispensary was only an excuse for a weekly meeting. I do not think we are as bad as that now.  The fact still remains that we have always appreciated something that little bit more if we have to pay something for it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien asked for an analysis of the reasons for the increase in expenditure since 1971.  He asked how much was due to inflation and how much was due to development of services.  It would be extremely difficult to analyse this since 1971.  There has been an increase of about 320 per cent in the cost of all health services during that period.  In the same period the rate of health contributions, and Senator O'Brien made reference to this, had gone up by 230 per cent.  So, we still have not caught up on the costs from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Apart from the wide use of drugs and what could loosely be described in some instances as the misuse of drugs, a number of Senators referred to the rising expenditure on drugs. This is an issue of great concern to the Minister.  It is one that he is endeavouring to apply himself to and in actual fact to the more responsible prescribing and use of drugs as such. Everybody will appreciate that this is a very complex issue and in any event the cost of drugs in the whole context of the health services is not as high as one would imagine.  Nonetheless they run at something less than 10 per cent of the total expenditure.</P>
    <P>There was the question of the difficulties in collection of contributions from farmers.  There are difficulties here particularly where a person has an income as well as the income from a farm.  There is also difficulty in identifying what farmers should pay and also in enforcing that collection.  Those are all points that, arising from an interesting debate here, the Minister can be looking into.  Overall, one of the things that emerges is a sort of a consensus that the amount of increase, while it can be criticised, is justifiable and that apart altogether from the varying views on this question of trying to iron out the limited eligibility <Col N="800" /> aspect, there seems to be general agreement that we are getting reasonably good value for money in this regard.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that when we adjourned on this motion I was addressing various questions on which I have some unease and was referring to the action or inaction of the EEC relating to those matters.  I was addressing the issue of the temporary employment subsidy grants in the UK and I was about to draw the House's attention to the fact that in the budget the Government had provided some alternative scheme to help people in certain industries and to maintain employment.  At the same time we knew that some moves were being taken in the EEC to restrict the temporary employment subsidy or grant scheme operating in the UK.  As I told the House before, <i>Eorascáil</i> is my source of information for a lot of the EEC matters.  I quote from the February issue of that publication:</P>
      <P>Tá an Coimisiún i ndiaidh rabhadh a thabhairt do rialtas na Breataine nach bhfuil a chóras fóirdheontas sealadach fostaíochta (&ldquo;T.E.S.&rdquo;) ag luí le rialacha an chómhargaidh agus nach mór é a athrú.  Rinne lucht gnó in Éirinn gearán leis an Choimisiún faoi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my surprise from the news today I gathered that the UK have gone ahead and extended the scheme for another year, albeit at a somewhat <Col N="801" /> lower level.  It is important to realise the level of subsidy the UK are giving in this, that they are reducing it from something like £230 million to £160 million &mdash; I am not sure of that figure because I just heard it on the news at lunchtime.  That means support for something like 300,000 employees which is more than the total employed in manufacturing in this country.  We have some alternatives scheme to offset that.  I am delighted to see the Minister here with us today and I am sure he will be keeping an eye on that in his trials and tribulations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The next item I would like to address is the question of youth unemployment. The EEC are giving a lot of attention to this at the moment and needless to say for obvious reasons.  Again, drawing on my source, <i>Eorascáil,</i> I see that the unemployment figure for young people has gone from something like 500,000 in 1974 to nearly 2 million in 1977.  It seems to me that this graph is rising at crisis rates.  There are schemes being advocated by the EEC for dealing with it but we seem not to be making as much inroad into it as we should.  We have the same equal proportional problem in this country.  If it is at that proportion in the EEC as a whole maybe something more creative needs to be done in relation to youth unemployment. The figure that frightened me as well recently was when I noted that those with third-level education were beginning to represent a higher proportion of the figures involved.  It is nothing new to us in Ireland to have problems about employment.  A growing cadre of young people who will not have had the experience of getting into normal kind of work quickly could mean for us all quite a problem in the next decade.</P>
    <P>The other area that I wanted to take the opportunity to mention to the House and the Minister is the whole area of export credit guarantees.  We know from the reports that the Commission have been concerned about this and obviously if some countries have better export credit guarantee schemes than others then they have a competitive trading advantage.  The position at the moment is that we are at <Col N="802" /> a disadvantage.  Those of us who are trading in areas like the Middle East are finding ourselves competing with countries who are providing superior credit schemes to their firms and enterprises originating in their countries.  My advice on this to the Minister would be to let us be the last country dragged screaming out of the ditch into the open because we have a lot to contend with and we have a lot of catching up to do and we must not tie the legs of our exporters together when they are looking after contracts in places like the Middle East and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Although the Commission are looking at the export credit guarantee scheme and the Americans are trying to bring some pressure to bear, it should not stop us ensuring that we provide the support that our businessmen need because as we all know exports mean jobs and that is the business we are in &mdash; the creation of jobs.  Needless to say, lest we forget about it, creating jobs is not something one does in a vacuum; one does it by creating enterprise and businesses and businesses will evolve from effective trading and that for us, given the rate by which our population is expanding, means overseas trading.</P>
    <P>The other area I want to refer to is the question of quality.  There are various Commission directives relating to products and consumer practices.  It is important that we should be very conscious and that the various Ministers would take any opportunity offered to them to encourage a higher quality of Irish goods for export.  I did mention to the House on an earlier occasion when we were talking about industrial policy that one of the secrets of the success of the Japanese trading was that they had a very tight control on the quality of goods exported and no new commodity could be exported from Japan unless it had received a certificate of acceptance which would come from a recognised testing laboratory.  Now that our exports are expanding at such a rate and also that our exports are growing in the manufacturing area, consideration should be given to tighter controls although some of my friends in industry may say &ldquo;Is <Col N="803" /> not life difficult enough for us besides adding that?&rdquo;  They might thank us in the long run because the quality of the goods will get the reputation we would like them to have across the world.</P>
    <P>This brings me to one other matter, although this may not be the right place to raise it.  Funds from the EEC are available for various purposes here. There is the social fund, the regional fund, and we are also getting loans from the European Investment Bank. Some money has been made available for community-type activities like that which is being made available to the poverty committee.  It has been suggested on a number of occasions that that scheme is not moving as fast as it ought to here.  I would ask the Minister that any EEC influence he has might be brought to bear on getting that under way.  There are too many local squabbles stopping progress.  The project being set up in the inner city of Dublin is needed badly and must be got under way.  The funds are there and it is regrettable that they are not being used.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator Conroy, when speaking on this debate a fortnight ago, referred to statements which the Minister made about our policy for NATO.  I thought I might just add something to those remarks.  Our whole policy on neutrality and our position in relation to NATO is a very broad issue.  I have always held the opinion, particularly having an engineering background, that our country was deprived of the spin-offs that one gets from military technology and from having people who work in it and who understand the principles involved in the complex circuitory electronics, radar, guiding assistance and so on.  We are deprived of contact with that technology.  While not wanting to advocate in any way that we move away from our policy we must remember that having gone into the EEC we have certain responsibilities and that in the event of a serious attack from, say, any source or from any quarter of Europe we would have no choice but to join in and play our part.  We could refer to Switzerland when we talk about that but Switzerland <Col N="804" /> seem to stay out of everything, so they are almost the exception that ought to be forgotten about.  In our case I just thought that the Minister might consider another way around it. For instance, if we could offer training facilities in this country without belonging to an organisation like NATO and if our people could be involved in the training we might get access to the technology.  We could do it on a sub-contract basis but it would not mean having to join NATO. It sounds like a contrivance but the Minister might have some views on it.</P>
    <P>I raised in my opening statements the whole question of the matter of European monetary union.  The Minister was not taking the debate at the time.  What is going on in the area of European monetary union is the crunch issue for the ultimate success of the EEC.  Since I spoke there two weeks ago more has happened and more water has gone under the bridge about it.  We must look at it very carefully and put forward a clear view and even though a small country give some leadership in the thinking about this.  We are such a small nation in relation to the others that the effect on us will be carried through anyway depending on what the big nations do, but we should be able to give objective advice about it.  There is a great opportunity there.  We have specialised experience because, for instance, in these islands we have a common currency. We have also in these islands different regional problems.  Scotland is a country within that group of islands yet it operates under the federal system as dictated from London.  There are lessons to be learned from how Wales and Scotland operate within a common economy and a common currency and also how Ireland operates in relation to the UK with a common currency but not a common economy. There is a model there and we could make a contribution to and give some visionary leadership in thinking about this in Europe.  We should continue to watch for developments.  I wish the Minister well in his struggles in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the discussion on these reports and indeed <Col N="805" /> general discussions on the EEC centre round the Regional Fund, that it is not only desirable but is absolutely essential.  It tends sometimes to appear as though we are just complaining that we have not been given enough out of the fund.  But whereas that is essentially true it is absolutely essential that we put this emphasis on it so that we illustrate the real problems which the fund and the overall policy are designed to allay.  We know that since the fund was established the gaps between the regions and the dominant centres have tended to widen.  Obviously, on that evidence alone, we have sufficient reason to return to this specific area of the fund and its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>There is a very important and readymade argument when we talk about the necessity of eliminating the regional imbalances which the fund is designed to achieve.  The point is being made, and well made, that the elimination of the regional imbalances is a prerequisite to advancing towards economic and monetary union.  That is a very logical argument.  It is a very strong argument to make in this context because economically the monetary union is an accepted objective at least by 1980.  It is also being established that the elimination of these regional imbalances is essential if we are to make any meaningful progress towards achieving EMU.  It is a very logical argument and it is a very strong argument.  However, I feel we should not make it the only argument because the case can and must be made for effective regional policy regardless of whether the question of EMU has to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About ten years ago the then President of the Commission referred to regional policy and said it should be as the heart is in the human body, that it should aim to re-animate human life in the regions which have been denied.  That still is really the essential heart of the matter.  It is the <i>raison d'etre</i> for regional policy and whatever funding may be devised to support it.  There was no reference there to EMU or to any other ancillary problem.  It was simply a question of regional policy for its own sake because <Col N="806" /> of the essential worthy objectives it was designed to achieve, that is, to ensure that all citizens throughout the Community would enjoy a common opportunity and be in a position to achieve their own potential in their own way and in their own communities.  Whatever about the necessity to eradicate these imbalances with a view to EMU, we should never remove the emphasis of our argument from the necessity of effecting and financing a regional policy for its own sake and for the sake of the people and the citizens of the Community in the regions.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;regional imbalances&rdquo; is a very neat and polite kind of phrase and in many circumstances no doubt it can be an appropriate phrase.  It can also be a glorious euphemism for very considerable strength in the economic sense and for very disproportionate weakness in the regions.  Here again we must question the concept of a fund which is dispensed, in part at any rate, on a quota basis.  This was debated many times in the early stages of the setting up of the fund but the regional policy and the regional fund are coming in for a great deal of attention now, not just in Ireland but throughout the Nine, and it is right to examine all the aspects and the mechanics of how it is effected.</P>
    <P>When a very high and significant part of the fund continues to be dispersed on quotas we have to be conscious of the problems that that presents. One of those problems is that to an extent we are taking a great chance on the effectiveness of what we are doing.  After all, we are concerned with eliminating imbalances.  If the Community disperse funds on the basis of national quotas and if what we are hoping for is that the problems exist in that same relationship and in that same ratio, we are taking a very long shot and one that is almost impossible of working out correctly. Even with an advancing fund in terms of the amount of money available, as long as there is this particular system of national quotas in operation to a significant extent, then to some extent the fund itself can be self-defeating.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Even at an accelerated rate, it will still be developing at a disproportionate rate to the rate at which the problems exist.  This is why I feel the Community are going to have seriously to question not only the fund but the basis of their allocation.</P>
    <P>It must be welcomed as a very definite step forward and as a very positive step that there are now two parts in the regional fund&mdash;the first part being on the basis of national quotas and the second part designed to alleviate problems in specific areas which include frontier areas.  I hope that we will be able to influence the disbursements from the second part of the fund to our benefit because we have very particular and relevant areas which this part of the fund is specifically designed to assist.  We have innumerable areas and opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.  With this type of backing from within the Community which the second part of the fund is in a position to supply, we also have a very definite opportunity from an economic and social point of view, north and south of the Border, of working together on the areas that unite us rather than sterile arguments on areas where we are divided.  I particularly welcome this development of the second part of the fund and hope it will continue to play an increasingly significant part in the overall fund because it is not designed to be disbursed on a basis of national quotas.</P>
    <P>We should be very alert from now on within the Community to see that the second part of the fund does not end up being disbursed on the basis of some unofficial type of national quotas.  It is absolutely essential that the Community deal with that fund in the way in which it was set up and that no element, unofficial or otherwise, of national quota thinking is allowed to creep into the way in which it is applied or in any way divert it from the objectives for which it was set up.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on a point made when we were debating these reports earlier.  Senator Keating felt that the strategy which the Government <Col N="808" /> had indicated in the budget speech could in some way &mdash; I think this represents his point of view accurately &mdash; militate in the long run against our ability to develop our own regions and also to influence our proportion of funds from the regional fund.  He felt that the emphasis on private initiative which the budget had given in a sense returned to some form of unbridled capitalism which would leave regions at the mercy of the market, and the market thinking would accentuate development in growth senses and neglect the regions.</P>
    <P>That is a highly superficial and a highly erroneous view of the budget. It is rather a grotesque extension of that to assume that anything done and the policy enunciated in the budget could in any way affect our regional plans and our regional policies.  The budget put emphasis on private initiative, but we still have a mixed economy.  There are many examples where economies which are based on very definite principles or ideologies take a shift in an opposite direction, and almost always for the same reason as we adopted the particular strategy this year &mdash; to get the economy moving again.  Communist countries have been known repeatedly to revert in part to private enterprise and to invite foreign industrialists into their countries to activate their economies.  It happened under the Communist régime in Russia almost as soon as the October Revolution had taken place.  The United States, on the other hand, is a capitalist economy.  Nevertheless in the depression years they resorted to a great deal of public expenditure and the type of economic policy we would associate with social democratic countries &mdash; again a shift in the immediate emphasis for the sake of getting things moving.  That is what is involved in our budget strategy and I cannot see how a policy which gets the country and economic activity moving again, which in itself is to the benefit of our regions, could lead or be thought to lead to an undermining of our regional development and of our ability to gain support from the regional fund in the EEC.  It is a highly superficial and simplistic view of what has been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> It is most essential in this discussion, when naturally a great deal of the comment is on the fund and the size of the fund, that we emphasise the necessity for an overall regional policy and overall regional thinking, in other words, all the activities of the Community, through all their policies, must have a regional aspect to them. The regional fund itself will not be able to undertake the problem of redressing imbalances if it is not supported by the general movement through the overall policies of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund has a very obvious and definite role to play in this.  The social fund also has a part to play &mdash; policies are emerging for reconversion where traditional industries have run into problems over the past four years. They all have a part to play in regional policy.  It is essential that we highlight that because if we are dependent on the regional fund itself to solve these problems we are not going to make progress to a significant extent on a quota basis and even then we are not going to make the type of progress we are looking for because of our real and genuine demands.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to problems in the Dublin area.  I very much agree with this because the whole of Ireland is regarded as a region from the Community point of view.  Naturally, and for very obvious reasons which we would all support, we tended to direct the support from the fund up to now to the west, north-west and south-west.  We should realise there are very definite and potential problems in the Dublin area which the regional fund and regional policy should be, and basically is, designed to assist.  Dublin has been particularly badly affected by the economic malaise and the stagnation of the past four years and the investments in job creation, housing and education, are going to need a fundamental economic dynamism in the city itself and in the overall region itself.  The type of support in infrastructural matters and in basic industrial development which the regional fund is designed to assist, has a very relevant and obvious outlet <Col N="810" /> in the Dublin area also.  I am not for a minute suggesting that we rob Peter to pay Paul.  What I am saying is that we must insist that there is an overall basic regional thinking throughout all the policies of the Community so that there is a meaningful and a real impact made in these areas, be they, in the case of Ireland, in the Dublin area or in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I should now like to comment briefly on another development which I think is very worth while and very important: the establishment of the court of auditors.  No institution can afford to continue for very long without effective, total and professional financial control, and also a financial control which is seen to operate, and operate effectively.  This new development and the additional powers which the court of auditors have, including their right of on-the-spot examinations, must be welcomed and supported as I have no doubt it is throughout the Community. Nothing undermines an organisation's credibility, standing or integrity more than even the suggestion that financial controls are not what they should be.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay on this point for the very good reason that I do not want to give it undue emphasis.  In the past there have been cases of financial manipulation which do not serve the policies which gave rise to them in the sense that the machinery for effecting these policies was successfully manipulated, and wrongly manipulated, by individual organisations or individuals in business.  It is absolutely essential that this type of emphasis be put on overall financial supervision and control and that it be done in a highly respected and professional basis.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it should be emphasised also that the existence of a court of auditors, no matter how effective or how good they may be &mdash; and no doubt they will be an extremely efficient and professional body &mdash; the policies themselves and the national agencies within the member countries with the responsibility of effecting the individual policies must implement the first financial control.  It is they we really look to to see that the finances of the Community are not in any way brought into disrepute.  It is after they <Col N="811" /> have exercised that control that we look to the court of auditors to provide the overall reassurance which their professional role can bring to the problem.  I do not wish to say any more about that because it can be wrong to give undue emphasis to matters that may have gone wrong in the past, because they represent only a tiny fraction of the total expenditure.  Of course, this should not be allowed to happen and, if it does, we must have adequate professional machinery for taking immediate corrective action.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should also like to make in passing in connection with the European Investment Bank, simply to highlight where I think national policy can complement very effectively Community policy.  The European Investment Bank are a very important source of long-term capital. Long-term capital is a very important and a very precious commodity, and is sometimes difficult to obtain.  Loans have been taken out from the European Investment Bank in this country in the past, but they tend to be borrowed more by State agencies than by private investment and commerce. There has been very good reason for that.  Exchange losses over the past three or four years have been at times of enormous proportions.  Some areas of Irish commerce and business have been savaged by exchange losses.  That savagery has been visited on State enterprises and private enterprises alike, which is a rather chilling illustration of the laws of economics having scant regard for the ideologies of man.</P>
    <P>However, I think the Minister for Finance announced an extremely sensible and creative decision in the budget when he said he intended to enter into discussions with the Industrial Credit Company to work on a scheme whereby business and industry might avail of lendings from the European Investment Bank with a guarantee against exchange losses, this guarantee to be worked out by negotiations between the Minister and the Industrial Credit Company.  This is an extremely sensible and creative way of eliminating artificial barriers to <Col N="812" /> funds which are available and could have been available in the past but for the very definite exchange risk problems which existed.  This is an excellent illustration of how national policy can complement and make much more effective, regional policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the area of foreign policy, European political co-operation and the frame work within European political co-operation. As I understand it, this is really an agreement to consult on foreign policy among the nine member states, but one step removed from the Community itself as such.  At the moment there are three applicant countries for membership of the Community.  I do not wish to discuss that now.  I should like simply to highlight the point that is in every country's mind in dealing with these applications: the desire to support democracy and, as is relevant in these cases, newly won democracies.</P>
    <P>The European Community is essentially a democratic institution in the strict sense of the term &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; It is a natural extension of that that in foreign policy our support will primarily go to and our preoccupation will be with extending the role of democracy and supporting fledgling democracies where they exist.  There is no more fertile field for exercising that type of influence than in the continent of Africa.  I am glad to note that the Community have supported the progress and the way to majority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this debate some weeks ago, several important points were made.  The last report was dated the middle of 1977.  Events may have overtaken it and to that extent we would be free to comment beyond that. Events in Rhodesia have certainly overtaken the last report.  It is an extremely difficult problem because there is no future in supporting, directly or indirectly, a political movement which is based essentially on warfare, guerilla warfare or any other type of warfare. I have a ready understanding of the political points made by the Patriotic Front in connection with Rhodesia, but of course I see no future whatever for their methods as they exist at the moment.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Senator not to dwell on the current situation in Rhodesia.  We must confine ourselves to developments in the European Communities in the reports we have before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my point and I will not develop it.  I made the point in relation to the comments in the reports in relation to South Africa and Rhodesia.</P>
      <P>I will conclude with this observation. Senator Murphy has made the point that, when it comes to consideration of European political co-operation he was inevitably drawn to questions of European defence policy.  This tends to happen frequently.  People who may have been opposed to our entry into the EEC tend to confuse our role in the EEC in some vague way with membership of NATO.  This flies against all the evidence of the case.</P>
      <P>If we take the example of France, who were founder members of NATO, they provided the headquarters for NATO in Paris, nevertheless they took the major decision to leave NATO, to remove the headquarters from Paris but, of course, continued as founder members of the European Community and to be very prominent and highly-influential members of the Community. Our traditional position of military non-alignment is, I believe, a very definite source of strength to the Community in that we continue to be evidence of the totally separate life, political and cultural structure within the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be, as has been said earlier in the debate, questions in the future of European defence.  As far as the Community are concerned, we must create something before we can even begin to think in terms of defending it.  Let us develop the Community, let us develop its democratic influence, let us develop meaningful policies through the regions, let us provide a cultural base and to cultural entity which we had in mind when we joined first and which we continue to support within the Community.  When we have done that, we will have created something which is well worth defending.  If, at that stage, there is a question of defence <Col N="814" /> then, and only then, I believe it is relevant to consider it.  In other words, as of now, it is by no means a priority.  There are many pressing and urgent matters, some of which would influence the very continuation of the Community itself, before we have any reason to confuse the issue by questions of defence and the entirely superficial and erroneous comparison with NATO.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch don Seanad as ucht an díospóireacht a bhí againn anseo agus is furasta a aithint ón méid Seanadóirí a thóg páirt san díospóireacht go bhfuil suim mhór ag gach éinne acu i gcúrsaí na hEorpa agus an páirt atá againne i gcúrsaí na hEorpa ansan.  Bhí mórán rudaí á phlé ag na Seanadóirí sa díospóireacht seo agus ní féidir liomsa freagra a thabhairt do gach aon rud a bhí ar siúl.  Tá nóta agam i dtaobh na rudaí is tábhachtaí, más féidir liom é sin a rá i dtaobh na ceisteanna a chuireadh san díospóireacht.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh seans agam freagra a thabhairt ar an chuid is mó de na ceisteanna sin.</P>
      <P>The Seanad will be aware that we are now debating the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth reports on progress in the European Community which take us up to July last year.  It is self-evident that we did not debate the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Reports when we should have done.  As I mentioned in the Dáil when producing these reports, it is my firm intention that henceforth we will not see a repeat of what happened over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the European Communities Act these reports are to be presented to both Houses twice yearly but sometimes they have to wait as long as two years before they are debated.  If the purpose of that Act is to be implemented, then obviously the House must have the opportunity of debating these reports as near to the appropriate dates as possible. For that reason I hope we will be able to correct that pattern and can be reasonably up to date.  It is fairly evident from the information I have <Col N="815" /> of the matters that have been raised in the course of this debate by the various Senators&mdash;as I said, I am very pleased that so many have taken part&mdash; that they are very much up to date as one would expect they should be on current issues in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that we are debating matters up to July 1977, I hope I can put these matters in their proper context and that my reply will not be too severely disciplined if I bring matters a little up to date, as most Senators did, although I will not deal at any great length with precise matters that have arisen since.  The Eleventh Report, I am glad to say, is due for publication very shortly, so I hope that when time allows in the Seanad and in the Dáil we will be able to come back here within six months at the latest and have another debate on progress in the period covered by that report&mdash;up to the end of 1977.</P>
    <P>Some Members of both Houses are constantly in contact and wish to be kept informed of developments in the Community.  I understand some questions were raised on the briefing of members of the European Parliament. I want to assure the House and Members of the Oireachtas generally that I have instructed our permanent mission in Brussels, from the earliest date in July, to ensure that every available facility is given to all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas in connection with their interest and obligations within Europe.  I have advised them to notify the secretariats of the European parliamentary groups and I trust this also has been brought to the attention of the individual parliamentary parties so that our representatives in Brussels will be able to inform Deputies, Senators and the members of the European Parliament as fully as possible on matters of our common national interest.</P>
    <P>Briefing is also available to Members of both Houses through the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation. I have no doubt the excellent staff of that committee will deal with all queries in an expeditious manner as they always have done.  On the last <Col N="816" /> occasion I was in this House we were discussing the re-establishment of the Joint Committee.  The only thing that has happened since then is that I have agreed to accept <i>in toto</i> the recommendations of the outgoing committee in order to ensure the more effective functioning of that committee which in return will guarantee the more effective functioning of both Houses in relation to our obligations and opportunities as members of the European Community.</P>
    <P>At the request of the committee, and assuming that the business of either House allowed it, I would be quite ready to have a special debate at special notice on particular matters of urgent importance which that committee would refer to the Houses and on which they would request a special debate.</P>
    <P>Putting all that in context it is obvious that we are very concerned to ensure that both Houses and the committee and the members of the European Parliament will have every opportunity of being fully briefed, fully informed and completely up to date with what is happening and will have an opportunity as simultaneously as possible of expressing their views and offering their advice to the Government and, indeed, to anyone else who is concerned about our membership of the European Economic Community. I want to make the point for those who would have the experience of previous years that it is a very significant change.  I hope it is a very welcome change.  I feel it is a very fundamental responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure, while much of his time will be spent abroad, that those at home who serve the national interest are kept fully briefed and are allowed the opportunity at all times&mdash; as a priority, I would say&mdash;to express their views directly to the Government, which in turn would guide the Government in the presentation of our foreign policy, either in the European Community or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I will take the points in the order in which they were brought up.  This is perhaps the best way when one is dealing with such a wide canvas as the European Economic Community.  Obviously <Col N="817" /> it brings up a whole range of issues, many of which will not be a matter of immediate responsibility for me but rather for other colleagues in their separate responsibilities.  There are some areas that obviously are matters of special responsibility for me and one is that to which Senator Donnelly was referring towards the close of the debate.  I gather that this was referred to earlier on in the debate. I am speaking of the process of European political co-operation.  I want to say in the first instance that this process of European political co-operation is not envisaged as part of the framework or obligation of the Treaty of Rome.  The Nine meet as a group of nine Foreign Ministers.  The purpose of the meetings is simply to consult and, to the extent that it is possible, to coordinate their positions on foreign policy.  Note I say to the extent that this is possible.  There is no binding obligation, as Senator Donnelly has rightly pointed out.  There is no binding commitment for the very simple reason that there is no binding treaty, no binding contractual obligation on which this understanding operates.  For that reason it affords the Nine Ministers, and through them their Governments, an opportunity of consulting together on matters that are of course of vital interest to all of us.  Senator Donnelly's point is well made.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that the members of the European Economic Community have in common, though this is not to claim any special virtue for them.  They are all, as he has said, democracies in the strictest sense of the word with all the imperfections a democracy has, but nonetheless democracies in the very essential expression or understanding of that term.  For that reason it is appropriate that they should consult together with a view not only to strengthening democracy within the Community but also, if possible, promoting if not democracy without the Community at least the standards that do after all bind us within the stated aims of the European Community, that is, the standards of justice, reasonably equal opportunity to the extent that it can be achieved and also opportunity to improve the lot of those parts of the world which certainly <Col N="818" /> are, by standards of the European Economic Community, deprived. For that reason the co-operation is generally based on the consensus that emerges from these processes of consultation.</P>
    <P>Let me be the first to acknowledge that obviously there will be different interests, different inherited attitudes, different priorities expressed by various Ministers in that process of political consultation.  Sometimes it will be that positions taken up whether on South Africa, Rhodesia, Zimbabwe or the Middle East will be somewhat behind what we as one nation could afford to say on our own and which we will still continue to say on our own to the extent that the opportunity will arise for us to do so.  Nothing in this process of political consultation in any way inhibits us or prevents us from doing just that, but the significant thing is that we now have an opportunity of having our views expressed and understood and we hope, to the extent that it is possible, implemented by a group of nations working together who, by virtue of being a group of nations&mdash; many of them more powerful economically and politically than ourselves, if not perhaps more powerful from the point of view of their particular moral conviction&mdash;can have a much bigger impact on the international affairs that concern us all.</P>
    <P>Without going into detail on this, I think it is true to say for that reason that the position taken up by the Nine in relation to the Middle East and the resolutions adopted by them have been certainly helpful in setting the principles which the Nine believe and which are generally acceptable now as being the basis on which the resolution of that problem should be approached. That is not to say that the Nine have the answer&mdash;far from it. That is a matter for those who are most directly concerned, but it is a position that I think should be expressed and has been expressed.  I do not wish to repeat it because otherwise I think we could get into a debate on the Middle East, but it has been recognised as being a very positive and helpful position.</P>
    <P>It is similarly true to say that in <Col N="819" /> relation to South Africa.  I think this comes within the period which we are discussing.  While I do not believe it is enough and I do not believe that anyone here would say it is enough, the code of conduct which has been drawn up as a first stage within the member states of the European Community for firms from the Community operating in South Africa is beginning to have some impact.  What is the test of impact?  Sometimes it may well be the manner in which some of the firms who have been operating there respond with impatience or irritation to the fact that this now imposes restrictions or disciplines on them to which they were not previously subjected. We have every reason to believe and to know that that is in fact the position.  No one can suggest that we have all the answers to the problems of South Africa.  No nine countries, no 29 countries for that matter outside of that region of the world can have the problems, but they can help at least to bring to bear on South Africa and the regime there a very deep conviction on our part that in the interests of not just black South Africans but of all South Africans this problem should be resolved peacefully and that the dignity of all South Africans should be respected.  Frankly I think it is now quite clear from the actions now being taken by the Community that that is far from being the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate particularly that this is not making a comfortable judgment from afar; it is always too easy to make that judgment.  It is setting for ourselves standards that may, at least for some members of the Community more than for us, involve some cost.  That in itself is the guarantee that there is now a degree of consistency under way.  There is no question of our losing sight of our national interest and in regard to South Africa and other questions of that sort we have pursued consistent positions.  I am not one to claim that I have been able to bring the eight around to my position.  I do not think I would ever claim that in any area, but I would like to think that I have <Col N="820" /> played a significant part in the consensus. In relation to attitudes and policies towards South Africa and even in the attitude towards Zimbabwe and the Middle East and many other areas it can be said that Ireland, not just during this administration but previously, played a very consistent role and one which is respected.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said that perhaps we have a very self-interested concern for political stability in South Africa. I do not know if self-interest, by definition, is something culpable but it is self-interest which is based on the recognition that the community about which we are concerned have a right that we are prepared to support.  There may be, if you like, more selfish self-interest but that should not exclude the Community from offering their recommendations and from bringing effective political pressures to bear on regional areas which can, potentially &mdash;let us look at it from this point of view&mdash;be areas of universal military involvement.</P>
    <P>I want to say particularly that the Community have always resisted and opposed any direct political intervention, much less military intervention, in any direct confrontation such as we have seen in Somalia and Ethiopia.  I wish that other major States, one in particular, would take note of this, bearing in mind recent experience in Africa.  I do not want to make any further comment now that there seems to be an end to belligerence in that area, but I hope that when peace is restored we will see the real impact of Community interest, in, for instance, that area.  Yesterday, at a joint meeting of the Council of Ministers and the Lomé countries, comprising 53 of the latter and nine of the Community, we had&mdash;this is a measure of how strong Community persuasion can be &mdash;the foreign ministers of both Ethiopia and Somalia.  It is significant that a request came to the Commission and to the Council for support in re-establishing normality in Somalia, now that the belligerence has ended, hopefully, to bring about a return to normal communications, normal industrial and agricultural activity.  That is the role which we all see the European <Col N="821" /> Community playing not a role of intervention in war but on the contrary, a role of guaranteeing the peace and supporting it.  I am quite sure that if a request came from Ethiopia, which was represented at that Council meeting, it, too, would receive the same ready and generous response as a request from Somalia.</P>
    <P>There is obviously this process of political consultation and there will be opportunities within the treaty and within the Lomé Convention, which is a contractual obligation on behalf of the treaty countries, the European Community, to prove their consistency. Lomé is a contractual obligation even though the balance of the contribution, or the majority of it, comes from the Community side.  It must be that way because of the inherited obligations of most European countries to the African, Pacific and Caribbean states. That is one of the very significant areas where our membership of the European Community has given us a new responsibility and a new role, one which I believe is greatly respected.</P>
    <P>Let me stress particularly that if we have an inherited goodwill in Africa, Asia or anywhere else, it does not derive from anything the present generation have done; it derives from the common sufferings of past generations. It is an obligation for that reason on the present generation to co-operate with these countries who are more than willing to co-operate with us.  They know we do not have any colonial or imperial pretensions; neither do we have the capacity nor the will for such. The development of our partnership with these countries through the Community and through the operation of our own development policies, which are really policies of co-operation, will over the next decade be an area in which Ireland's role, not a dominant, political role but that of persuasive force based on consistent attitudes, will be greatly developed.  I am quite sure, even from responses which were given to us yesterday for the contributions which were made from time to time and yesterday also, that we have a real opportunity not just of winning further goodwill for ourselves but, somehow, bringing these countries closer to the <Col N="822" /> Community to which we belong. Geographically, democratically, economically and politically that is the Community to which we are committed.</P>
    <P>Over the next few weeks it will be evident from visits to this country by Ministers from the least developed of the poorer countries of the world that they are aware of Ireland's special position, perhaps in a sense because of our common history but also because we are closer in terms of time and experience to the problems they now have.  Our success, relative though it may be, is a matter of hope and, perhaps, confidence for them.  That is where we and our State agencies, who, I am glad to say, have been doing this very effectively, can and will play a very significant role over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>With regard to defence commitments I want to say something which I seem to be saying all the time but I do so because people suggest otherwise all the time, although I do not know the source of these suggestions.  It is not for me to speculate why it is often being suggested that we are being pressurised to do this or do that in relation to NATO.  I have no control over what may be contributed in newspaper reports; I have no control over the people who may motivate some of the contributors to these newspaper reports but I can have control over the facts. I want to state quite categorically that there is no defence commitment involved in our membership of the European Economic Community.  That is the first point.  There has been no request to us at any time, unless something that happened over the last four years has been concealed to the extent that I cannot find out, at any Council meeting in any way to accept or take on any military or defence commitment within the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Before we joined the Community, after we had signed the Treaty of Accession, I was present in Paris when the former Foreign Minister, Maurice Schumann, stated, perhaps because of the occasion, that Ireland's membership of the Community proved beyond any doubt, because we were a nonaligned <Col N="823" /> country, that it was not a group bound by a common military pact, much less a common defence pact of any sort.  He welcomed Ireland's membership for this reason.</P>
    <P>There is no great credit due to us for that, but it proves that the Community, as it stands, is not bound by any defence commitment.  If Greece joins, for instance, she is not within the integrated military command&mdash; France is not either&mdash;and it will again mean that another member of the Community is not what I might call a fully integrated member of NATO.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, this is a matter for ourselves.  It is not being posed to us by anybody.  We have said it ourselves. The former Minister, now President Hillery, said it on the occasion of accession, as the late Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, said it before we ever joined.  This is not a response to any pressure.  It is a statement of our own obligation and of our own commitment. Should it happen at any time that the Community of which we are a member are under attack&mdash;hopefully we will not see that day&mdash;then, obviously, we as a member will help and contribute towards the defence of that Community.  That is not a statement in response to any pressure.  It was not such when Seán Lemass said it or when President Hillery said it, and it is not now when I say it.  I want to have it clear on that basis.  I cannot imagine that anything could be clearer than that position.  I hope we will not get any further queries from either east or west or north or south as to whether or not we are at present contemplating membership of a military bloc within the European Community or are being forced or pressurised to do so.</P>
    <P>A number of matters were raised relating to fisheries.  It is not at all related to the topic that I have been discussing, but I will take the topics as they were raised.  It is not for me to take on the role of the Minister for Fisheries, but I will make one comment, if I may.  Perhaps I will be forgiven for this.  The Minister for Fisheries and I are in very close consultation at all stages as to our mutual responsibilities in order to ensure that <Col N="824" /> there will be a coincidence of views and a parallel discharge of our obligations. It can be said fairly that this contrasts a little with the position that arose in the last six months of the previous administration and it is in our own interest that this consultation and co-ordination should take place.</P>
    <P>In that connection, as the Minister has quite consistently expressed, regional policy operates through many agencies&mdash;the positive agencies of contributions from the Community.  It also operates in another way in simply allowing each area of the Community, and particularly the peripheral areas, the opportunity to fully exploit and develop the resources that they have. We suffer&mdash;if &ldquo;suffer&rdquo; is the word&mdash; from certain natural disadvantages by being an island.  One is that we are further from the centre of the marketplace: it costs us more to transport to and from that marketplace and we must transport to and from because we are an open economy.  The extra costs are very considerable.  Those who are at the centre of the marketplace by definition are not surrounded by water but by people and they take the benefit by being at the centre of that marketplace. That being so for them, we are determined that we will take the natural benefit that accrues to us from being surrounded by water instead of people.</P>
    <P>That has been the consistent approach that we have been following and we have cast our position, in so far as my responsibility is concerned, mostly in the area of regional policy and, in consultation with the Minister for Fisheries, we have presented it consistently on that basis.  We are asking the Community on the terms of their own stated aims to acknowledge in their recommendations and to guarantee in their proposals that we will be allowed to develop to the maximum extent our own resources to compensate us, if no more, for the disadvantages that we suffer in some other way. The fact that that recognition has been given and has been acknowledged is the first step.  It is fair to say that the previous administration were also pursuing the same case.</P>
    <P>Both of us to that extent were pursuing <Col N="825" /> the first stage, a formal recognition of our special rights and this has been given.  Secondly, without getting into detail, we are seeking the right to ensure that, to the maximum of our capacity, we can exploit the waters within the 200-mile limit, which some Members of this House will recall were brought into the Community by order made by the previous administration here about 18 months ago.  Once it was then within the Community, by virtue of the order made here consequent on a decision of the Council of Ministers, then we had to take it as it was.  I can only assure the House that I believe what we will get in the final analysis and what our Minister will succeed in negotiating&mdash; and he has obviously a very difficult task in all of this&mdash;will be such as will guarantee within the waters contiguous to us, whether it be 30, 40, 50, or 200 miles, the maximum opportunity to be protected against the efforts of others and to be guaranteed the opportunity of exploiting our own resources.</P>
    <P>Obviously fishing plans, licensing arrangements and exclusive waters all very much come into this.  I have no doubt that the consistent and courageous position which the Minister has taken up is respected in the Community.  Equally, I have no doubt that the Commission and the Council are sympathetic to our position.  It is not just sympathy alone; they recognise that we have a strong position that they ignore at their peril&mdash;not alone their peril but the peril of the European Community.  I am quite sure that even if the maximum capacity of our fishermen were doubled they would not be able, at least in the first instance and perhaps somewhat later, to exploit the new opportunity and the new harvest that will be available to them.</P>
    <P>The contributions towards our petroleum costs and many other things will also be very significant in terms of the development of our shipbuilding and other ancillary activities.  One would hope to see the development of a fish processing industry of a kind that we do not have now.  I have said enough on an area that is not my immediate responsibility but one which, <Col N="826" /> by virtue of the national concern, is a matter of concern for all of us.</P>
    <P>The House might forgive me if I did not go into the area of common agricultural policy.  That would warrant, it is fair to say, a special debate here. We recognise that the applications of some of the regulations of that policy are obviously not tailor-made for the Irish agricultural structure any more than they will be for any enlarged Community&mdash;and I will deal with that later.  For that reason, one of the priorities of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; and I am quite sure of Members of the House and Members of the European Parliament&mdash;is to guarantee a re-classification of the category and qualification of development farmers and also to ensure that the farm retirement scheme and schemes such as that will be applicable to the maximum extent to our needs and opportunities and not just such as will fit into a grand European canvas which does not necessarily meet the needs or opportunities of the individual areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a general point.  We joined the Community for many reasons, but there was one cogent reason among those many reasons.  It was to give to the people on our land a proper standard of living and an opportunity, in accordance with our commitment and our Constitution, to live in comfort and with economic security on their own farms.  Before we joined the Community we were faced with the reality that we were having to subsidise to a very considerable extent our produce on the British market.  This meant inevitably that agriculture was underdeveloped and undercapitalised and also that the resources of the State were being directed towards simply subsidising agriculture to stay where it was at the expense of other activities and industries, social programmes and many other things.  We can recall the application by the last administration in social benefits in their first budget of the £30 million plus that was spared in agricultural subsidies in the first year.  All of us were happy to see the social welfare classes benefit from what had otherwise been demanded of the Government to subsidise our agricultural <Col N="827" /> produce in Britain to give a further guarantee of preferential treatment to the British consumer, who was also supported by imports from New Zealand and elsewhere around the world under the Commonwealth preference arrangement.  That day is over. Now, instead of subsidising others to eat our food, we are happily supporting our own farmers in developing their own industry.</P>
    <P>This year, had we still been doing as we were then, our contribution, taking account of inflation, if the subsidies were maintained only at the level they were, perhaps would be of the order of £130 million to £140 million.  Then we could all begin to say whether membership of the European Community had been a welcome development or otherwise.  They now have the opportunity, the level of incomes has increased considerably, and that is very significant.  In line with that a Government would obviously guarantee that agriculture as a very basic element in our national economic development will be promoted and encouraged further and the Minister for Finance and other Ministers concerned will take account of this in their approach to our fiscal policies, taxation policies and other social policies.  It is only reasonable and just that it should be so.  The first job is to create equal opportunity which was not there beforehand, and having done that to expect from each element in the community for whom this new opportunity has been created, an equal contribution towards national well-being and development.</P>
    <P>There was some concern expressed towards industrial policy in the European Community and I welcome the fact that this concern was expressed because it is a concern we, too, have expressed on many occasions.  There are obviously certain structural problems in the European Community of an acute kind for the areas to which they apply, acute by comparison with the previous security that these areas had from their industrial activity.  I am thinking of steel, shipbuilding and in many areas textiles, areas that hitherto enjoyed and knew only full employment. In Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, <Col N="828" /> Luxembourg, not to speak, of course, of Italy&mdash;it has never had full employment but the north of Italy had &mdash;now know what it is to experience unemployment because of the very serious position of the steel industry and shipbuilding generally.</P>
    <P>Our concern at this point is to ensure that whatever arrangements will be made within the Community by any section or any commissioner will not be such that will not take account&mdash;I think this point was rightly made by a number of Senators, Senator Keating among them&mdash;of the special position of Ireland.  If the Community are to apply rules across the board in the absence of recognition of the special problems or special position of certain areas, Ireland among them, then it is not even being a fair market, much less a community of nations which it is supposed to be.  Let me say particularly that we did not join a common market: we joined the European Economic Community, and according to the rules of a market the strong get stronger and the weak suffer on.  That is not why we joined, so we are not about to accept the application of regulations across the board for steel, textiles, shipbuilding or anything else in any other area, or even selected aids for industry, the same universal application, if it is that, particularly where there is no clear evidence&mdash;and this has been mentioned by Senator Donnelly in my own hearing&mdash;or regional policy to offset the application of these universal regulations. It should be much more than that.  It should be aimed at eliminating the regional imbalances that we hear so much about.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Government have consistently and very recently brought this point home very clearly to the Commission at every level and to the Council whenever it was appropriate. We are not going to have our hand out as mendicants.  We are not stretching the begging bowl for alms. We are simply reminding the Community what it is, reminding them of a protocol we have, Protocol 30, which recognises the special problems of Ireland in unemployment.  It also binds the Community to work with us and to apply the agencies and the instruments <Col N="829" /> of the Community to help us to achieve our targets.  Sometimes it seems that individual commissioners or elements within the Commission are totally unaware of the fact that this protocol was negotiated after a lot of very tough bargaining at the time, and if it was worth bargaining for over a long period then it is worth respecting when it has been put into effect.</P>
    <P>As recently as last week or the week before the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and myself brought home the point very forcibly to the President of the European Commission that we would expect each Commissioner in the Community, if not to have a copy of that protocol in front of him at least to be mindful of it.  It appears to us in some of their proposals and in some of their responses to our position that they have not been mindful.  We would expect the President of the Commission, as the <i>pater familias</i> of the European Community, to make sure that the individual commissioners are mindful of it and to ensure particularly that we will see an application of these regulations which are necessary, let us acknowledge, in certain structural areas to rationalise the industrial structure of the Community but nonetheless to ensure that areas such as Ireland, that have no real impact on the problems of Europe in any event, will not suffer simply because other areas have now to face problems that they have never experienced before.</P>
    <P>They have opportunities to turn to new technologies; they have opportunities to re-adapt to new industrial activities.  That is the kind of thing that the Community should look to.  I am glad to say that as a result of the last European Council meeting I believe that is the direction the Community are now facing, to ensure, not just for the sake of the Community but also for the sake of what is sometimes called the low cost countries, the people who work for starvation wages, let it be in India, Sri Lanka, Lesotho, Somalia or whatever, that those people will not be expected to starve or suffer simply because they <Col N="830" /> are offering goods on Community markets at a price much lower than the Community can put them on sale, for the simple reason that we demand more for our time and labour than those could ever expect.</P>
    <P>For that reason we have an obligation in the Community to fulfil a parallel role in regional policy within the Community and also one might say in global regional policy outside the Community.  That is the position that Ireland has been taking up consistently, at least from my experience, since we joined the Community and it is one that we have been reiterating very firmly in the last few months.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating expressed the fear that the Community would be seeking sovereignty over the oil and gas of our continental shelf.  It would not surprise me that some members might look with a jealous eye at the resources we have in our continental shelf.  As Senators probably know, the 200-mile economic zone is a concept which emerged after we joined the European Community.  I used to have this debate regularly with my predecessor, he implying that it happened before we joined and that we should have known about it even though it had not emerged at the time, but the facts speak for themselves.  That concept has now been accepted all but in the single negotiating text of the International Law of the Sea.  That simply means that coastal states, and we certainly are one, can generate their own economic zone stretching out to 200 miles.  The land-locked states have certain other advantages such as the ones in Europe to which I have already referred.  The coastal states of the World, South America, South Africa and many others, saw this was an opportunity for them to compensate for other disadvantages. That concept applied, speaking generally, to fisheries, to a 200-mile economic zone, to exploration, to environmental control and to some other pollution control.  Strangely enough, the Community, and we know this as a reality, got in on the act on fisheries by rushing through the Common Fisheries Policy in 1972.  It was, one might say, a bit of sharp practice that we had to face at the time.  It had happened before <Col N="831" /> the concept of the economic zone emerged but because they introduced a common fisheries policy they were able to argue and insist, as the previous Government will know when they responded to the direction of the Council to extend our to 200 miles for fisheries, that there was an obligation on us as a member of the Community to do just that and to extend out to 200 miles and then to share in our fisheries.</P>
    <P>But they did not have a common policy on exploration of our mineral rights.  They did not manage to rush that through beforehand.  It is not there.  I think Senator Keating is right in saying that there are some who look at us with a jealous eye there hoping to find that there is no basis in the treaty and that they can share these resources we have.  I am quite sure that our friends in the United Kingdom who are fairly jealous of their particular interests will ensure if the occasion should ever arise, which it cannot, that no one outside will have any share in North Sea oil.</P>
    <P>I want to talk generally on the Government's economic position and our economic programme within the European Community.  Far from reacting to any disciplines being imposed on us by the European Community, and far from complaining about demands being made on us for lack of national development programmes by the European Community, we are the ones who are pressing the European Economic Community to set guidelines first of all for themselves and secondly for each member state within which we can pursue our national development plans.  The former Minister for Finance asked in the House how can you plan in the middle of a tempest.  Even if there was a tempest we would still be planning to make sure we got out of that tempest.  For that reason, in the recent White Paper, we have presented to the European Community our general guidelines. This will be followed by another discussion Green Paper to be followed finally by a more detailed White Paper.</P>
    <P>That is where we are going.  Before that was published, by agreement of <Col N="832" /> the Government, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development attended with me at the Commission on at least two or three occasions to notify the Commission of where we were going in our national development programme and to ask them, now that they know where we are going, could they please tell us where they are going because we cannot plan in a sea that knows no limit.  We should like to know at least where are the bounds of opportunity and where exactly can we aim to go within the context of European Economic Community planning.  We should like to know the European framework within which our national framework can be constructed.  We invited the Community to state the discipline for themselves and for us.  This was reiterated by the Taoiseach at the European Council.  Once again he simply urged on the Community&mdash;as I am quite sure he will repeat at the next Council meeting in April in Copenhagen&mdash;to set these guidelines, not just to have a broad general debate which one has from time to time in the European Council, making high sounding statements, but to look to the last Council meeting, see what disciplines that suggested, see what programmes that suggested, and see what progress we have made at this one towards implementation of the last one.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union may well be a long-term ambition.  It may be so distant that we can hardly quite identify it, much less recognise it.  But, as Senator Donnelly or Senator Mulcahy said, even if we were not talking of economic and monetary union we are still talking of regional policy.  At the last Council of Ministers meeting, when they were drawing up the agenda for the general discussion on the economic condition of the Community, I was amazed, appalled, to find that there was no reference to regional policy or absence of it in that general discussion.  At my instigation it will now be included on the agenda. At least the Community will have to face up to reality.  Either they have not a regional policy and have no intention of having one, or else they have, and, if they have, let us see it.</P>
    <P>We had a statement at the last European <Col N="833" /> Council meeting, when we were arguing for a stronger regional fund, from one head of Government, who has to be nameless because the proceedings were confidential, asking how we could talk about a regional fund when we have no regional policy. People who could put that argument forward could forever delay the implementation of a regional fund because they could themselves ensure that the Community had no regional policy.  So we are pressing towards the regional policy.  We are also trying to ensure that the Commission, who have stated guidelines in this direction, will be strengthened in their resolve, and prodded where necessary, and pushed if necessary on other occasions to follow a consistent pattern.</P>
    <P>I think frankly that the Commission are at least aware of this need.  They are presenting to the Council a paper which I hope very soon will give details of current regional policy.  They are presenting discussions and policy decisions on economic and monetary union.  They must have determination to argue consistently in support of those positions.  That debate will be going on within the European Community in the next 12 months.  I feel fairly confident that our position in that, not just in terms of our national needs but of our potential to contribute to Community development, will be very significant and will be respected.</P>
    <P>On the regional fund, I agree entirely with what Senator Donnelly said.  It is a contradiction in terms to have national quotas for a Community regional fund.  That is what we have inherited: there are national quotas for a Community regional fund.  There may well be very soon a non-quota section, not significant, up to 5 per cent of the total fund, which will not be based on national quotas, which will be capable of dealing with particularly chronic problems, among other things frontier regions.  We will probably see a special interest here in cross-Border areas, certain infrastructural developments and communications which will be capable of application by the Commission without reference to national quotas.  We supported that proposal for a non-quota section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> For that very reason, in a sense in trust with the Commission, and on the other hand with the determination that if it is adopted&mdash;the next two weeks will say whether it will or not&mdash;we will be able consistently to press for the implementation of policies which will be consonant with the idea of having such a non-quota section.  It will be at least the first step on the way towards a real regional fund.  The fund we have at the moment is not adequate.  Let there be no doubt about that.  It is a lot better than it might have been, a lot worse than it should be.  I suppose, both in real terms and in monetary terms, it is more than was available in the last three years.  It is a step and I feel that the real test of Community commitment will come in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The House will understand if I do not deal with the special areas of transport and tourism.  There were some references to the development of proper transport services from the south-east and various parts to Europe.  I expect that the Minister for Transport and Tourism will soon be dealing at great length with that and will guarantee that the necessary port developments in the south-east and south coast of Ireland, and elsewhere for that matter, will be developed to ensure the greatest facilities for both passenger and freight traffic at our ports.  The potential is great.  Our tourism programme is developing considerably, and as a matter of interest the number of heads of state of the European Community who have visited Ireland for holidays is very considerable.  Some of them have spent unpublished holidays here within the last six months, and I think that is as it should be; they do not wish to breach the privacy we guarantee to them by making any announcements. Many of them are acting as very effective agents for our tourism promotion programme.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the increased tourism from Europe last year was very considerable and I have no reason to believe that it should be anything less than considerable this year.  That is, of course, unless as in some areas we ourselves or some sectoral <Col N="835" /> interests for one reason or another prove that we are determined not to allow the potential of this country to be exploited.  In relation to these areas, the interest in Ireland throughout Europe at the moment, by industrialists and others, is very considerable. Our growth prospects are higher than anywhere else in Europe. The degree of confidence in this country is higher than anywhere else in Europe.  All this is in our favour by any objective criteria, and what is apparently the ability of some sections in our community to understand that we have a common interest somewhere along the line.  Some sectoral interests sometimes attempt to show their own muscles without any regard to the cost to national development, and that affects people, and particularly the poor because it is always the poorer people who suffer most in any actions of this sort.  The comfortable ones and the rich will not suffer personally and it is well that people would recognise that the ones who will suffer, because they have no way out of it, are those who have no options but to suffer.  That applies to almost any action that is taken by a sectoral interest.  It is time that we faced up to the opportunities we now have and to the reality that it is only sections at home who can damage us and prevent us from realising these opportunities.</P>
    <P>There was some reference to our aid programmes through the European Community.  I do not think it is appropriate that I should deal with that here in detail.  I will make a reference to yesterday's meeting of the Lomé Convention and acknowledge that the role played by my predecessor at the last Lomé Convention was very considerable and was generously acknowledged to me yesterday.  I would only hope that it would fall to our Presidency at the end of 1979 again to have the Presidency at the conclusion of the negotiations on Lomé II.  From the responses that have been evident to us, particularly in regard to our personnel involvement, which is a real area which we must focus on because of the experience and expertise, there is a great opportunity for us to help <Col N="836" /> those who are very much in dire need of help.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers have unanimously and enthusiastically supported the applications of Spain, Portugal and Greece for membership of the European Community on a political basis.  Forgive me if I refer to Senator Donnelly so much.  I heard what he had to say because he spoke today, and most of it seemed to me to be sound.  To guarantee the development of democracy in these countries, the next stage is to follow through that political commitment to an economic commitment.  The political commitment that is not prepared to support itself by economic activity is no political commitment and for that reason we have thought it appropriate not only to reiterate at council meetings, which I have done consistently, but also to submit an attitude to the commission, which was done by our permanent representative, on my instruction on Monday of this week.</P>
    <P>The Commission are now in the final stages of drafting an overall proposal on enlargement which they will present to the Council.  We thought it appropriate at this time to contribute our thinking in this connection to the Commission, we have taken a very positive position.  Basically, we are saying to the European Community there are significant and obvious regional imbalances within the existing European Economic Community.  If that Community is to be capable of accommodating three new countries, nearly each one of which has even more severe problems than the obvious ones throughout the Community as a whole, the first step for the Community must be to look to the existing imbalances as a preparation for enlargement and as an earnest of their commitment to a regional policy in an enlarged Community. There is no point in talking in terms of an enlarged Community which will have no effect or benefit for the Greeks or the Spaniards or Portuguese. We have asked the Commission to propose that there would be a qualified assessment of the cost within the existing Community, and in line with that of the cost within an enlarged <Col N="837" /> Community.  That is an essential operation.</P>
    <P>We recognise that there are areas in the existing Community that have particular problems, in agriculture especially, that will in some sense be in competition with some of the produce of the new Community when one or all of the three applicant countries accede to membership.  That must be looked at.  We cannot recognise that that would be done at the cost of existing areas with regional problems within the existing Community.  There is sometimes an assumption which I have heard expressed at the Council that the difference between the position now with this enlargement and the last enlargement is that the last three applicants had generally the same standard of living, the same mixed developed economies, as the existing community of Six but these three together are very different indeed.</P>
    <P>If one talks globally that may be more or less true but in the last three &mdash;this is what we have been very anxious to remind them of&mdash;there was one area that was underdeveloped, and I mean underdeveloped in the real sense of the word, not poverty stricken but underdeveloped in the sense that there was a capacity which could be developed and which we are determined to develop.  It should not be assumed that because we happened to join with Britain and Denmark all was fine within all regions of those three and that we now have to look at the other three.</P>
    <P>We are determined that the cost of accommodating any one or all of the new members must not be at the expense of the peripheral regions of the existing Community.  We are very committed members, committed supporters of enlargement.  We were outside long enough ourselves and we would never attempt to say that now that we have gone in that is the end of Europe, that there are nine of us there now and it is nice and comfortable and the other three would be a bit of a drain on the Community, that if it comes to another three after that it would even be more of a drain.  We have no right to say that.  For that <Col N="838" /> reason we welcome the applications in the spirit of the Community.  We welcome them for a lot of historical reasons as well as for the reason that they have so much to contribute to the culture, not just now but for hundreds of thousands of years and that the Community will be richer for their membership.  I think the Greeks, the Spaniards and the Portuguese know our position there.  If there are preconditions in this regarding adequate resources, they are not preconditions for Greece, Spain or Portugal. If there is a slight change of emphasis between the position we have presented and that which may have been presented by my predecessor, perhaps what he said may have been misunderstood.  It appears that he was understood as saying that these were preconditions for the Spaniards or the Greeks or the Portuguese, and there was a reaction in those countries on that basis.  We have certainly made it very clear that there are preconditions for the European Community, not for the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I can say at this stage.  I want to welcome the opportunity of perhaps dwelling at greater length on developments in the European Communities than I have been able to do frankly at any stage since I became Minister either in this House or elsewhere.  It is a time when, because of our own confidence and our own determination, we can now very consistently show our priorities and demand of Europe that it shows its priorities too.</P>
    <P>I want to say finally that in anything I have said we want it to be clearly understood that we are very committed members of the European Economic Community.  What we are saying is not by way of criticism&mdash;far from it.  We are committed to that Community in a sense that is very well recognised.  I shall not comment on the position of other countries, but it can be said that Ireland's position within the Community is very well respected.  Sometimes we tend to applaud ourselves too freely, but that statement is true.  I am sure Senator Keating, as a former member of the Council of Ministers <Col N="839" /> and anyone else in close contact will agree.  We are determined to promote that position to show our commitment and to recognise that we have had benefits.  Let us face that.  We have had considerable benefits, such as those I referred to under the application of FEOGA grants and the common agricultural policy.  We have had also the opportunities for the diversification of our industrial outlets which perhaps has exceeded our expectations.  In all of this we have had considerable benefits.</P>
    <P>However, we are also committed members of a Community for a different reason.  We are pressing particularly for moves towards political cohesion in Europe.  The reason is that we cannot see any other effective way of guaranteeing regional policy, or any other consistent policy, unless it is on the basis of political commitment.  That can only be done as we move towards political cohesion.  Otherwise, the rules of the &ldquo;common market&rdquo; that we did not join would apply.  We are not interested in a loosening of the Community and we will not look to enlargement as an opportunity to loosen that Community.  We look to it rather as an opportunity to strengthen it and, in doing so, strengthen ourselves and the contribution we can make towards the development of the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> I should like to thank the House and I hope that I will be able to come back here, let us hope within four months, to debate the report due to be published very shortly.  Hopefully, that will be a consistent pattern for the future.</P>

It is particularly inconvenient to country Members to come up here for these one-day sittings and I would hope that country Members, irrespective of party affiliations, would agree with me on that point.  I see no reason whatsoever why it could not be arranged that we could go on tomorrow to take No. 5, which is Government business, or, if the Minister is available, to go on to discuss one of the numerous motions which are on the agenda.
