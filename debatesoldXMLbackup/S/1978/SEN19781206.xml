      <P>I have considered a request from Senator Murphy to raise on the motion for the Adjournment this evening the following matter:</P>
      <P>The voting of the Irish delegation at the United Nations on nuclear disarmament last week.</P>
      <P>I consider this matter to be in the area of major policy.  Such a matter is not allowed on the ground that under the procedure of Standing Order 25 the scope for discussion is very limited and no decision on the matter may be taken by the House.  It is, therefore, considered more appropriate for discussion on a substantive motion.  In the circumstances, I must rule that the matter of which Senator Murphy has given notice is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 in that order.  I <Col N="522" /> should tell the House that it is expected that we will be sitting tomorrow and that we will be taking Nos. 7, 4 and 8 tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Leader of the House for taking item No. 5, that is:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make an order to preserve indefinitely the Viking site at Wood Quay, already designated a National Monument, in view of the many other sites in Dublin available for civic offices.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my gratitude for this being taken but I wonder whether the Leader of the House could agree that it be taken at 5.30 this evening so that the three hours allocated to it could be completed satisfactorily on the same day, especially as there are two others ordered for tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also grateful for the fact that item No. 5 appears in the Order of Business.  We have gone over the reasons for its urgency and I would like to support Senator Martin in his plea that this item should be taken at 5.30 to give the full three hours today for its discussion. Perhaps if this is not possible the Leader of the House could give us an assurance that this motion could finish its full course tomorrow.  One hopes that in fact we will get to the stage of having a fairly substantial debate on item No. 5 today but if it has not entirely finished perhaps we could finish it tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I would like to support very strongly the request made by the Independent Senators that the motion on Wood Quay be taken at 5.30 in order to allow three hours debate today. This is an extremely urgent matter and like the Senators I welcome the fact that time is being given to debate it today because of the increasing alarm about and the seriousness of the situation.  We voted in the Seanad last week in an attempt to have it taken last Wednesday instead of today and I think it would be most helpful to Senators if we could possibly fix that time for having it this evening. Looking at the Bills which have <Col N="523" /> been ordered for today I think they are reasonably technical; some of them are Money Bills and obviously they would have a certain priority but if we are sitting today and tomorrow I think it would greatly facilitate Senators and it would allow us to ensure that we do contribute to the debate on this absolutely vital subject where the Seanad can make a very substantial contribution. So, I would very strongly support what I think is a very reasonable request and I hope the Leader of the House will accede to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in support of Senators who have spoken on this matter and say that provided the debate were completed tomorrow I would be quite satisfied.  I am sure the Leader of the House can make that arrangement but obviously if we had a fixed time for it such a cooperative gesture would be most convenient and it could certainly be completed tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I understand that the first three items are Government business of some urgency and I cannot agree to take No. 5 before them but I think it is more than likely that the motion will start this evening and will possibly conclude this evening.  All I can undertake to do is to ensure that the motion will be taken either today or tomorrow and if necessary we will sit late tomorrow evening to ensure that it is done.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last capital injection <Col N="524" /> in the air companies was made in 1969 under the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969 when an injection of £15 million was made then to assist the financing of their capital programme at that time.  Since then the capital structure of the air companies has been considerably altered.  Capital expenditure on new aircraft and other assets has continued year by year while over the same period severe losses on revenue accounts have been incurred.  These losses in the period from 1970 to 1977 amounted to £7.7 million or £14.4 million when provision is made for foreign currency losses and extraordinary items.  The result is that at 31 March last the shareholders' equity in the companies amounted to £20 million and loan capital stood at £46 million. The equity injection of £15 million now proposed will restore the gearing between equity and borrowing to a more normal ratio and bring it into line with competitor airlines.</P>
      <P>The years ahead will require a vast expenditure on new equipment.  Because of the age of many of the aircraft in the present fleet and international noise requirements, it will be necessary to replace much of the fleet, while it will also be necessary to expand it to meet growing traffic.  The companies estimate their capital requirements over the next decade at £250 million at present prices. It is necessary to put the companies on a sufficiently sound basis now to enable them to improve the present profitable trend and build up the necessary reserves to meet this expenditure.</P>
      <P>This equity injection and the increased profitability and confidence it will generate are very necessary to enable the companies to plan for future developments and expansion to meet the needs of our growing economy.  These plans indicate the generation of a very substantial increase in the number of visitors to Ireland with a consequent creation of a substantial number of jobs in the tourist industry and upwards of 1,000 new jobs in the airline itself.  A reasonable capital structure is vital for the proper development of the airline to meet these future challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this Bill it is appropriate that I should speak about the <Col N="525" /> performance and prospects of the airline. Senators are fully aware of how difficult a period the seventies were for all airlines, especially on the north Atlantic routes.  The main reasons for this adversity were the worldwide recession which caused a downturn in tourism and in travel generally, the sharp increase in oil prices, the steep rate of inflation, the disruptive effect of currency fluctuations, severe competition from charters, and the general over-capacity on the north Atlantic which led to an unremunerative fare structure.</P>
    <P>Additionally, in our case, the violence in the North had an adverse effect on our trouist traffic.  As I have indicated, the losses of the air companies totalled £14.4 million in the period from 1970 to 1977 including foreign currency losses. The turn around came in 1976-77 when a modest profit of £117,000 was made and the position improved significantly in 1977-78 when a net profit of £4.6 million was earned.  This is a very welcome development but this level of profit is quite modest when viewed in proper perspective.  On the gross turnover of the air companies of £160 million this profit represents a margin of only 3 per cent. In other words if there should be a downturn of as little as 3 per cent in the present bouyant level of the companies' activities the profit would disappear.  I have already indicated that capital requirements over the next decade will be of the order of £250 million.  For these reasons a greatly increased level of profits is required in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A further point I should stress is that the profits earned by the companies last year largely came from ancillary activities especially those closely related to aviation.  The ancillary activities proved very successful and profitable but continued heavy losses, though reduced, were incurred on north Atlantic operations while the short haul European network, inluding cross-Channel, was marginally profitable.  The ancillary activities are proving their worth in underpinning the air transport operations; they are providing a high level of skilled employment and earning substantial foreign exchange for the benefit of the national economy.  Indeed, without these <Col N="526" /> activities it would be difficult for the air companies to generate sufficient earnings from their air transport operation alone to promote an adequate reserve for the heavy investment which will be needed for fleet additions and replacements in the future.</P>
    <P>It is proper in this context that I should mention the question of the level of air fares.  A scheduled airline must provide a regular all-the-year round service taking the rough with the smooth to meet the on-demand needs of the business community and regular travellers. It must maintain a widespread sales network and, especially in our case, incur heavy expenditure on promotion of tourist traffic.  A schedule airline cannot just cater for the peak traffic when full loads are guaranteed and cost their operations and fix their fare levels accordingly. This would be creaming the top of the market and while there are carriers who seek to engage in this activity it would be entirely inappropriate for a publicly owned national airline with obligations to the community as a whole.  In this respect the north Atlantic is a source of continuing worry.</P>
    <P>The airline is still suffering heavy, though reduced, losses on the Atlantic due to the very uneconomic fares now obtaining in that theatre.  It is difficult to see an early improvement in the economics of transatlantic services because of the strong and rapid trends towards the dismantling of the regulatory framework and towards uncontrolled competition.  Fair competition can, of course, help to stimulate the market and promote efficiency but the airline industry, because of its capital intensity, seasonal and cyclical nature and its public service obligations, cannot operate economically in conditions of uncontrolled and excessive competition.</P>
    <P>Because of the present intention on the part of the US authorities to deregulate air transport, and the fragmentation of policy among western European states, I can at present see only a continuing price war on the north Atlantic. It is to be hoped that there will be a return to a more rational regulatory framework before too long within which the airlines can compete fairly, provide <Col N="527" /> an adequate and reasonably priced service for the travelling public and earn moderate returns.  This can be done only by international action.  There is little that a small state such as ours can do on its own.  We will, nevertheless, continue to do our utmost to secure a return to a more sensible regulation of the market.</P>
    <P>Encouraged no doubt by what has happened on the north Atlantic a demand is at present being widely made for a reduction of fares on the European network, particularly cross-Channel.  I know that Aer Lingus are conscious of the need to keep fares at the lowest possible level consistent with providing an efficient and viable service.  It must be borne in mind, however, that the Aer Lingus short-haul operations are only marginally profitable.  All applications for fares adjustments are examined in detail by me and I am concerned in considering proposed increases to ensure that the essential balance is kept between the natural demands of the travelling public and the need to meet continually rising airline costs.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus must operate commercially and must generate profits if it is to face future expansion plans with confidence. The company also has an obligation to provide a fare structure which will help to stimulate tourism; this it does by offering a range of special fares including excursion and advance booking fares as well as reduced fares for families, all designed to cater for the price-conscious traveller.  As Minister responsible for both aviation and tourism I am particularly anxious that services, including fares, offered by Aer Lingus do not act as a disincentive to tourism growth.  I am satisfied that at present this is not the case but I will continue to keep fare levels under review so that the air traveller may have the benefit of the lowest possible fares consistent with the economics of the airline and the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have dwelt at too great a length on the problems which arise in the aviation industry.  By and large it must be seen as a young but very vigorous industry and one in which, notwithstanding <Col N="528" /> temporary fluctuations, continued growth is assured.  Its importance to a small island community, such as ours, cannot be overstressed.  It plays an important role in the servicing of our industry, trade and tourism and, indeed, has provided important developments in our economy.  Our national airline plays an important role in our national development.  It provides an important part of the national infrastructure vital to the development of our trade and industry in general and tourism in particular. Its primary task of providing a wide network of air services is done efficiently and safely.</P>
    <P>Its work on behalf of other airlines, which earned revenue of about £23 million last year, is proof in itself of the airline's efficiency and good international standing.  Other measures of the airline's contribution to the economy include an expenditure of £7 million on tourist promotion, the provision of high grade employment for 6,000 people and a contribution of £60 million in foreign exchange earned abroad.  Our national airline has truly served us well in the past and the additional equity capital now proposed will provide a reasonable capital structure for it to continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my party are concerned this Bill is acceptable to us. We agree to the injection which is proposed of extra capital into Aer Lingus.  There are many aspects of the operation of Aer Lingus which will possibly have to be looked at fundamentally in the near future.  It is primarily an airline, but it is quite clear that any profitability that has been accruing to it has been coming primarily and principally from its ancillary activities in other fields marginally connected with its prime task of providing an air service. The dilemmas that face CIE are beginning to show themselves now in the context of Aer Lingus.  It may be time to look at the entire scene before those dilemmas become of the magnitude that now face CIE, the dilemma, for instance, of having to provide a service which is essentially apparently non-profitable in <Col N="529" /> the national interest and at the same time be expected to operate on commercial lines.  This dilemma comes out clearly from what the Minister has been saying to us.</P>
      <P>As far as the public are concerned the vast majority of people who use Aer Lingus use it on the short-haul routes and the majority of those use it on the London to Dublin route.  I make no apology to the House for raising a matter which has been raised frequently in the other House, and raised frequently at public meetings of emigrants' associations in England, and that is the level of fares between here and London.  There has been a call for a sort of shuttle service, as, for example from London to Glasgow.  It is now being introduced, I think from London to Belfast.  It is thought that we should have a service of that kind between London and Dublin. The calls are consistently resisted and the Ministers argument appears to be that Aer Lingus is a national airline, that it cannot engage in low-grade, commercial activities such as that, because it has an obligation to ensure that a certain standard of service is provided all the year round and that it cannot take the cream and leave the rest to be looked after or not looked after, that Aer Lingus must balance its operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be interesting to see if any projections have been made as to the financial implications of running the shuttle-type service between London and Dublin.  It is a very high density route. There is no question of the service not being availed of and there is a very high density level right throughout the 12 months of the year.  There would be no question of having it only for part of the year and leaving the route badly served for the remaining part of the year.  This particular route, I understand, has a density as high as any short-haul in Europe. We are entitled at this stage to have the facts and figures regarding the financial implications of changing the nature of that service now presented to the public so that they would know once and for all what the arguments are for and against the changing of that service.  A national air company has an obligation to provide as cheap a service as possible and if this particular route has the potential <Col N="530" /> for service to be provided at a much cheaper rate than is being provided at the moment&mdash;and a great body of opinion feels that it has&mdash;then it is for the national airline to ensure that the very best value is offered to the customers.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to put it to Aer Lingus to let the public know the situation in facts and figures, have a public debate, or arrange some sort of a forum so that the entire matter of changing the nature of the London-Dublin air service to ensure cheaper fares is fully thrashed out and that the public will be totally aware of the implications of it.  It is no consolation for people paying what they think are exorbitant fares on that route to know that they are keeping the national flag flying across the Atlantic. That is stretching the demands of patriotism possibly too much.  It is something that will have to be looked at to see if the cost of keeping the national flag flying across the Atlantic is now justified by the other benefits to the economy which the Minister mentions. Possibly it is so linked up with the other services which Aer Longus provide in terms of service contracts and charter work for other airlines that it cannot be avoided and has to be carried on even at a loss.  The whole thing is a complicated financial package of balance and counter-balance.  It is something that will have to be examined pretty fundamentally. Possibly the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies will be the proper forum for looking at the fundamental role of Aer Lingus and seeing whether that role has been substantially changed by reason of these so-called ancillary activities.  They could look at that role to see what is the primary duty of a national airline and try to resolve this essential dilemma of the commercial viability with the social service that is inherent in what the Minister said as being the role of a national airline.</P>
    <P>The arguments on both sides are very strong and it is a very difficult dilemma to resolve.  However, there is great confidence in Aer Lingus, in the expertise, the business acumen and in the general level of professionalism which that company brings to its operation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the general understanding and attitude <Col N="531" /> towards the company.  There is a feeling that money invested in the company which appears to be well and efficiently run is money that is properly invested.  I am sure the Minister is satisfied that that is the case.  The general public and we on this side of the House are satisfied, by and large, that that is the case.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the operations of this new body, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Semi-State Bodies, will give an opportunity to Parliament to probe more deeply into those areas so that we can be fully sure that we are getting full value for money from Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Cooney, welcome this Bill.  I am very well aware of the excellent job that Aer Lingus are generally doing on behalf of the State.  I would also like to compliment Aer Lingus on having the foresight, if you like, to invite Members of the Oireachtas last week to a briefing session in the Shelbourne to make us more aware of the problems and difficulties that they are facing as an airline.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kennedy, for the way he put the case and the clarity with which he put it.  Indeed, it was a very enlightening experience for all of us.  We recognise, of course, that in Ireland as an airline is a very essential operation we must at all times try to ensure that we are giving value for money.  Because of our island position it is one of the few ways in which our emigrants and others can come to visit us.  It is very important that the price structure of Aer Lingus be constantly kept under review and that the prices being charged are the most competitive and fairest prices that can be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather surprising, looking through the figures, to find such a poor return on capital investment.  For such an enormous turnover to have a return of only 3 per cent indicates in commercial terms a non-viable business.  But then we must look upon Aer Lingus as also having social obligations.  Their ancillary companies make a substantial amount of money and make the whole thing appear that much better.  We must, then, encourage <Col N="532" /> Aer Lingus to continue looking at their price structure and continue to give good value for money.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the news that they are establishing a factory for the overhaul of aeroplane engines which is going to give considerable employment in the Dublin area.  It will make them pioneers in this type of work.  Certainly, this shows the type of initiative and foresight that we have come to expect from Aer Lingus.  I am sure all Irish people are very proud of their airline and those of us who travel abroad are always delighted to see the Aer Lingus planes in so many airports throughout Europe, giving such a good service to the Irish community.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there are a few criticisms that I must make of Aer Lingus.  It is something on the lines of what Senator Cooney was saying, except that my concern is not with Dublin; it is with Cork.  I feel that we in Cork are not getting the type of service from Aer Lingus that we should be getting and that Aer Lingus are capable of giving us. We are looked upon very much as the poor relation and I must urge Aer Lingus to have a public debate as to why a diminished service is operating out of Cork.  I would question the latest price increases.  I wonder are they necessary, I wonder is it still possible to operate with profit at the old prices.  It seems as if there are commercial people available to undertake the enterprises that Aer Lingus have abandoned and indeed to continue to give the service out of Cork. I wonder why Aer Lingus will not allow this.  I would urge the Minister to look carefully into any proposals that come before his Department in relation to the provision of alternative services.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus do not want to operate certain routes, and if there are companies prepared to operate them, they should be allowed to operate them.  After all, our interest here as legislators and representatives of the people is to make sure that the people are getting value for money and they are getting the most economic air travel available.</P>
    <P>I know that there are commercial companies prepared to operate in and out of Cork who have been debarred from doing that.  I must protest in the <Col N="533" /> strongest possible manner at this debarring because it is not serving the country well and it certainly is not serving well the people of Cork and the people in the surrounding counties who would use Cork Airport.  I do not think we can take it that Aer Lingus have any monopoly rights, or should have any monopoly rights, in relation to air transport.  If there are Irish entrepreneurs prepared to come along and offer alternative services, indeed offer services where Aer Lingus have refused to provide services, then they should be encouraged and allowed to do so.  Rather than obstacles being put in their way they should be regarded as an asset to the State rather than a liability, as some people in the Department of Tourism and Transport seem to think.  We must have at all times healthy competition.  I am never satisfied with any company that has a monopoly of any product.  Equally my feelings are the same in relation to air transport.  If there are commercial enterprises available, with the necessary expertise, know-how and of course the quality aeroplanes to undertake the task, they should be allowed do so.  If they are not allowed to do it I should like to ask a lot of questions as to why they have not been allowed.  Like Senator Cooney I say: why not have public debate on the issue?  Why not create a forum to debate why these commercial enterprises are not allowed to operate?  It is very bad if we are seen here to institutionalise&mdash;if you like&mdash;a monopoly, to give it the backing of the whole weight of legislation.</P>
    <P>We are moving into an era in which efficiency will count more and more and there will be efficiency where there is competition.  Where there is not competition there will be inefficiency.  I will be asking questions in relation to the non-granting of licences to operate charter planes or regular planes on routes out of Cork.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of the fact that we have such an enormous amount of management expertise in Aer Lingus in that they are called on to transfer some of this expertise to other airlines in some of the developing countries.  I know that <Col N="534" /> is a profitable part of their business.  We must commend those who had the foresight to ensure that such a situation arose.  I would be mildly critical of the front-line operators of Aer Lingus.  Personnel at ticket desks and the hostesses on the planes generally are of a high standard.  However, in former years there was a higher standard; there was more concern for the welfare of the traveller than there is now.  Maybe it is the era in which we live.  Nevertheless one of the best selling points and strongest assets of Aer Lingus was in the charm of their personnel.  I should like to see that aspect re-emphasised and brought to its former pitch.  If that kind of service is provided, there will be more and more people travelling on routes where it can be seen that the operator cares about the welfare of the passengers. Generally, I am very much in favour of this Bill and welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, this is a Bill seeking an additional £15 million of taxpayers' money so that the Minister for Finance can take an additional stake in Aer Lingus.  The Labour Members of the House support the general thrust of the Bill, are confident that Aer Lingus are worthy of public support and ought be given the kind of confidence which this additional equity stake by the Minister would provide.  Nevertheless we are not happy about the details available to us in the Minister's opening remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Senators, I would like to put a number of questions to the Minister.  Although this Bill refers to a stake that will be taken by the Minister for Finance it is appropriate that the Minister in the House today is the Minister for Tourism and Transport, that he has in his speech at least in a very general way referred to the operation and activities of Aer Lingus.  Since we do not have many opportunities in this House to assess the performance of our national airline and to ask the kinds of questions which concern and occupy us I welcome this opportunity to put a number of questions to the Minister. Firstly, I should like to ask the Minister for a more detailed explanation of why the decision was taken to apply for a further £15 million in an equity stake in <Col N="535" /> Aer Lingus.  As I understand that, this would bring the stake of the Minister for Finance up to £35 million against a loan capital standing at present at £46 million. I deduce that from the figures given to us by the Minister.  He indicated that the companies estimate their capital requirements over the next decade at £250 million at present prices.  If it is over the next decade it may be more than that when we get closer to the actual tying of capital expenditure and re-equipping of Aer Lingus.  I would like to have a little relation between the sum of £15 million here and its obvious impact on the general balance and confidence to the company.  Why is there that figure and how is it proposed that this much larger figure of £250 million would be acquired, or in some way earned, by Aer Lingus over the next decade?  Even with this additional stake in the company it is very hard to see how the profit margin would rise from the present figure of 3 per cent of the £160 million turnover to a sufficient profit to allow the accumulation of revenue anywhere approaching £250 million.  That is the first major clarification I would seek from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the general profits earned by the companies during last year and stated that these largely came from ancillary activities.  He referred especially to those closely related to aviation.  This is very general and rather vague and does not convey anything to Members of the House.  I should like from the Minister a breakdown of the profits earned from these ancillary activities, of their scope in terms of the major activity of Aer Lingus to provide a national airline, a service to those travelling by air, and I should like some indication of the Government's approach to the various kinds of services and of the ancillary activities undertaken by the air companies.</P>
    <P>What are the standards which the Government deem to be appropriate for our national airline?  This is fundamental to our understanding, as Members of the House, of what we are being asked to do in approving a further injection of taxpayers' money to the sum of £15 million. <Col N="536" /> We are entitled to know to what extent the Government are in favour of an extension of these ancillary activities to which the Minister has referred as being largely accounting for the profits of Aer Lingus, or is there concern at too much diversification by the company?  Is the Minister in a position to give us a more detailed account of some of these ancillary activities?  For example, I became aware some time ago that Aer Lingus had acquired substantial property in Teneriffe.  I have never heard of anything being done about this.  It must have involved a very substantial expenditure of public money at the time.  Is there building going on there?  Is there a plan in process of evolution at present?  Is this something which it is anticipated might result in further profitability to the overall air companies or is it something that has not been so successful and from which perhaps Aer Lingus are thinking of disengaging or from which they have already decided to disengage?  These are the questions which Members of the House need to know in order to be able to approach this Bill responsibly and have adequate background information.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Crowley, I was invited to the briefing by the management of Aer Lingus recently.  Unfortunately, because of other commitments, I was unable to go.  In any case that must always be a background briefing which is not a substitute for having here in this House and on the record of the House the adequate information on which to base our evaluation of the figure sought in this Bill, of the Government's attitude towards the primary role of Aer Lingus, its ancillary activities and some assessment of what the needs of the company may be over the next decade.  For example, is this £15 million a request for public moneys now?  Will there be a further request within a year or so to enable Aer Lingus to commence this programme of re-equipment, this very large capital expenditure, or how is the company to re-equip itself if this is deemed to be necessary?</P>
    <P>In the same way, a better understanding of the situation would allow Members of the House to consider the very important matter raised by Senator <Col N="537" /> Cooney and Senator Crowley, the question of the air fares, particularly between Ireland and Britain.  Senator Cooney referred specifically to flights from Dublin to London.  Senator Crowley expanded this to Cork.  I would take in the whole spectrum of cross-channel air fares&mdash;from Dublin or Cork, or indeed other parts of this island, to the various cities in Britain where there is a substantial cross-traffic of our own citizens and where obviously we want to draw very considerable tourist traffic.  These are extremely important links, important from the economic point of view, from the point of view even of the family links between those living in Birmingham, in Manchester, in London, who have relatives here and who would very much like to, and in some cases need to, travel over and back, and not always for pleasant reasons, perhaps to come back for funerals, for family occasions or to help out in a particular difficult situation at home.</P>
    <P>I speak with the immediate knowledge of somebody who travelled back from London this morning on an Aer Lingus flight.  It did strike me that the £72 return fare to London is a dramatic increase in very few years from a return fare of approximately £35 to £37.  This is socially undesirable.  I am not satisfied with the references made to the need for minimum profitability, the very tight margins within which Aer Lingus operates.  I am not satisfied because I do not think we have been given a sufficient, overall picture in the Minister's opening speech.  We have not been given a sufficient indication of Government values in the matter.</P>
    <P>This leads me to what would be very much the approach of the Labour Party to the service provided by Aer Lingus. That would certainly be to try for the degree of profitability that was possible but also to emphasise the social service that must be provided, particularly for an island like Ireland, for a country that has such a high rate of emigration of its population, for a country so dependent on tourists coming from outside to generate the other jobs and economic security for our people generally.  We need a much better sense of the present <Col N="538" /> Government's attitude towards these problems.  It may be that Aer Lingus themselves would benefit from guidance in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is a certain conflict&mdash;if not conflict, certainly ambiguity&mdash;in some of the statements made by the Minister in his opening speech.  He referred to the hard times that Aer Lingus suffered during the recession, that it has come back now into a situation of profitability&mdash; marginal profits in 1976-77 and last year a profit margin of 3 per cent on a fairly substantial turnover.  This is a reasonably vulnerable position.  Obviously it has heavy local capital.  The question arises as to how far it should expand ancillary services which appear to be more profitable and by doing so subsidise to that extent the social provision of an airline service at a kind of cost which makes it possible for people to travel.  This is a very important value and is not one that is at all clear in the Minister's speech.  I would welcome his expansion on this point.</P>
    <P>It would be an important social service to our people to provide very accessible rates especially for cross-channel traffic, and to generate a greater density of traffic by so doing.  If one were to generate a greater density of traffic, then it would be possible to go a step further and consider the suggestion Senator Cooney made of having a shuttle service to cut down on administrative costs and overheads on the busier cross-channel routes.  I would welcome some comment by the Minister on this suggestion, on its feasibility, because undoubtedly there is an increasing contrast between the competitive rates that can be offered on other routes in other contexts.  I appreciate that some of these very competitive prices are offered by private companies creaming-off the peak times on a market.  Certainly I accept that a national airline like Aer Lingus must offer a balanced all-year-round service and must operate on the less attractive routes as well as on the more profitable ones.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Crowley I do not think the way to provide this necessary and vital social service to our people is to start licensing private enterprise companies to cream-off the peak periods and <Col N="539" /> make the situation all the more difficult for a national airline.  I agree with Senator Crowley that we need to have a much fuller debate and discussion and we need more evaluation of the various criteria.  In particular we need a better understanding of the Government's attitude and policy.</P>
    <P>From my experience of examining Bills submitted to the Seanad, there is none I dislike more to have to respond to and debate than this type of minimal, in the sense of minimal content, just a few short sections.  Bill seeking a set amount of further money by way of a grant or loan.  In this case it is providing a facility for the Minister for Finance effectively to put £15 million of taxpayers' money into Aer Lingus by increasing his stake in the company.  I dislike these Bills intensely. They come very rapidly from the Lower House to this House.  It is very difficult indeed to get adequate briefing in order to examine the implications. It is particularly unsatisfactory when the Minister, in his opening speech, states the position in such unclear and minimal language that it is very difficult indeed to relate the situation.  It would not have been at all taxing on the Minister to have supplied the Seanad with a basic, overall picture of the income-loan situation, profitability and expenditures of the air companies and the difference that this £15 million would make.  This could be done by way of graphs if necessary.  Certainly it seems to me to be the very minimum that Members of the House need if we are to fulfil our duty of examining responsibly what the Government have in mind and responding to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to make these matters very clear to the House.  For example, I would refer to a sentence in his speech:</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind, however, that the Aer Lingus short-haul operations are only marginally profitable. All applications for fares adjustments are examined in detail by me and I am concerned in considering proposed increases to ensure that the essential balance is kept between the natural <Col N="540" /> demands of the travelling public and the need to meet continually rising airline costs.</P>
    <P>That is not an arbitrary or unreasonable statement, nor is it a very revealing one.  It merely gives a very vague idea of very general criteria.  But it does not really tell us to what extent the Minister is concerned, as the Senators who have spoken so far are about sharply rising fares, particularly on the cross-channel routes.  It does not tell us how the Minister is prepared to evaluate the overall situation of Aer Lingus, or give an indication of the Government's approach to the priorities of the air companies which are basically those of providing the national airline services, freight services, and also various ancillary activities such as acquiring property, hotels and a fairly substantial property in Teneriffe about which I would specifically welcome some more information.  This is a pity because having asked a number of questions and sought clarification I should like to end on a note of approval&mdash;certainly from my personal experience, from an assessment, particularly of the problems in recent years&mdash;in general terms of the overall approach of Aer Lingus to its problems.  Unlike Senator Crowley I think the standard of service, courtesy and kindness to old people, or to mothers with young children, or to young children travelling alone, is quite remarkable on an Aer Lingus flight and is sometimes in striking contrast to the much colder, more sophisticated, more artificial attitude of some stewards and stewardesses on other airlines.  On that kind of standard the staff of Aer Lingus come out very well whether they are the hostesses on the airlines or the personnel staff in the airports.</P>
    <P>It is not enough just to say that. Indeed in a sense it is a subjective assessment. I believe we need a more public and open debate about the values underlining the fact that as a small country we have a national airline, that this does mean a very substantial capital expenditure and it means also very substantial employment, as I understand it, of over 6,000 people.  All these factors are important and related when it comes to <Col N="541" /> looking at a specific request for an injection of capital, the first request of that sort for almost a decade.  We cannot really do our job very well unless, in his opening speech, in an explanatory memorandum, or in some other way the Minister is much more open about the Government's attitude and provides the kind of information necessary for Senators to evaluate what is intended here and gives an indication, not just in a sentence that it is likely that, for example, for capital re-equipment a sum of something like £250 million will be necessary, but what the general pattern looks like for the next ten years; how it is envisaged that Aer Lingus will both expand its service, improve flights in and out of this country and re-equip with expensive new aeroplanes.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of facts and figures, the kind of basic information which will allow us to make sense of what is otherwise a very narrow and technical Bill which, on the face of it, does not enlighten Members of the House very much.  Senator Cooney referred to the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and it is appreciated that if the committee get adequate full-time staff and avail of personal expertise, then they may be able to do a much more substantial monitoring job and may acquire an expertise among the members which will allow them to make a much fuller evaluation of the various matters I have raised that were a long way from that.</P>
    <P>This committee is going to take a very substantial time to work its way through the various State-sponsored bodies that are within its terms of reference.  In the meantime, certainly for the next couple of years, it will be necessary on the floor of the House to try to examine and assess both the performance of a State-sponsored body like Aer Lingus and the allied air companies and also our own evaluation of what we want to see provided, where we want to see the priorities of whether or not this is the appropriate way to invest the capital expenditure and whether or not we want to see the kind of diversification that we have seen already and what has happened in relation to the ancillary activities <Col N="542" /> and, in particular, the Government's attitude towards the basic human complex of people with the air companies, the fair rate for the lines which carry the heaviest load of our own population and the potential for expanding tourism and drawing people into this country by viewing the provision of air travel to this country as less a purely economic and competitive activity and more an important social service both for our own citizens and to attract others to come to this country and to generate the kind of economic support and activity which are so necessary.  The responsibility is really on the Minister to provide us with this information and to allow us to evaluate in a more intelligible way the single proposal in this Bill looking for a further capital stake of £15 million in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LadyGoulding" hpid="Lady Goulding Lady Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual I shall be brief.  I do not want to go into all the figures, which I must admit I do not understand fully, but I want to tell the Minister that as a pilot&mdash;maybe there are other Senators who are pilots also&mdash;I very much welcome the injection of £15 million into Aer Lingus.  I would have welcomed also other Senators speaking and thinking a little more about the air crews and cabin crews as well as those who administer the money.  One thing that is very necessary for a pilot is confidence as well as skill.  In my days of flying skill was not really necessary but nowadays skill is of the utmost importance and anything that in any way lowers the confidence of pilots and air crews does great harm to our airline.  The very idea that Senator Cooney and Senator Crowley could both say &ldquo;Let us do away with London-Cork&rdquo;, will probably get headlines in the papers and the pilots will be reading these papers and they will be thinking: &ldquo;Good gracious, we are going to lose out on this.  They will not need so many pilots.&rdquo;  Aer Lingus has a great tradition of good pilots.  I do not think I have ever been frightened, and I have been frequently frightened when piloting myself, in an Aer Lingus plane and I have flown since 1939 on Aer Lingus planes.  I beg others who will speak to think of what they are saying and what will appear in <Col N="543" /> the papers.  The pilots need confidence. They have confidence now and they have confidence in the way Aer Lingus is being administered and run.</P>
      <P>One must bear in mind when one is talking about shuttle services that it is very easy to operate a shuttle service when you have a very large airline like British Airways with a great number of pilots to deal with the situation.  We must remember we are a smallish, although excellent, airline and a shuttle service would put a great strain on the pilots and the rest of the crews, cabin and air crews, I do not think just gaily saying: &ldquo;Let us have a shuttle service&rdquo; is going to answer the question entirely unless, as Senator Robinson said, you are going to subsidise heavily, even more than we are subsidising now.  In that way you could have a shuttle service but it would involve a very heavy subsidy indeed.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Robinson who talked about not spending so much money on new aircraft.  Say that to any pilot.  We must keep up with the times. We must have the same kind of aircraft that other airlines have.  You cannot expect pilots of today to rattle around in the old DC 3 when people are buzzing by in 747s.  That is just today's analogies&mdash;Senator Robinson is probably talking about ten years hence. When all other airlines will be having Concordes does she not want us to have Concordes?  I wish we had a Concorde now.</P>
      <P>I repeat: Think of your crews before you make statements that are going to appear in the press which will affect their confidence.  We have a great airline and I am certain that it will be one of the best in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to follow Senator Goulding.  I cannot take her point of view because I have piloted a plane only very briefly.  I think she has made a point that is worth making and I do not think that out of this sort of debate should come headlines which will cause our excellent air crews in Aer Lingus to lose any confidence.  I have been a Member of this House for eight years and there <Col N="544" /> have been frequent Bills of this type asking for injections of extra capital for semi-State bodies and never in all those eight years has one of those Bills been turned down.  I have never even known anybody to vote against a Bill of this nature.</P>
      <P>In a sense we are in a cleft stick position because we are unable as individuals, without a great deal of expert information which is not at our disposal, without a great deal of expertise which again is unlikely to be at our disposal, to make the sort of judgments which are needed to say whether this sort of expenditure is essential or whether it is not. We are essentially relying on the Minister and his advisers.  This is not a very happy situation to be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To do something about this the previous Government established a Joint Committee to oversee the operations of certain commercial semi-State bodies and this Government have continued that committee in operation.  I would argue that neither Government have realised the importance of such a committee. The committee at the moment are only being used to do a white-wash job but they could be doing a very important job and they could be filling a very important role because, in the case of bodies such as CIE and Aer Lingus, which need vast sums of public money to keep them going, it will be more appropriate that the sort of discussion we are having now about the actual operations, the balance of the social role <i>versus</i> the commercial role of companies such as Aer Lingus and CIE, should be discussed in detail in committee by this Joint Committee.  It is hard for Members to make anything other than general comments and one does not know if these comments have any effect.  In fact, one could expect after some experience they would have no effect at all.  They make no difference to the situation.  The only thing that makes any difference is whether or not at the end of the day we vote the £15 million and, because we do not have the information as to whether we should or whether we should not, we rely on the Minister and we end up voting the appropriate sum and the semi-State bodies go on their way regardless of <Col N="545" /> what is said here.  Maybe they are right because, as I said, most of us are not in a position to make any proper judgments on the actual technical operation or how the capital sum we are voting fits into the operation of the company.</P>
    <P>We are confined to making observations on the operations of Aer Lingus as it affects us.  Senator Goulding takes the view of the pilots and the air crew, which is, I think, a good thing to do.  It is useful to have someone here to give us that point of view.  I can only give the consumers' view and that has been given already.  I do not think in the present situation we can ask the Minister to go around licensing private companies to cream off the top of the market on the high density routes whether they be Dublin-London or Cork-London&mdash;I use both of them quite a bit.  This could be more effectively done if it were done by a Joint Committee who had more detail at their disposal and who were in a position to question the senior executives of the company in private session and get the relevant information.  Any body like Aer Lingus, which is in a monopolistic situation or a semi-monopolistic situation, is in danger of getting its head in the clouds, if that is not too unfortunate a metaphor, and can lose sight of the problem of the consumer.  I cannot accept Senator Goulding's argument that it would be difficult or impossible for Aer Lingus to run a shuttle service to London.</P>
    <P>I know that the Aer Lingus scale of operation is different from that of British Airways but the scale of operation on the Dublin-London route is already considerable and I do not see that it would require extra air crews or extra aircraft to provide a shuttle service.  I believe that British Airways are prepared to provide this service but Aer Lingus is resisting them.  It is important to maintain profitability but profitability could still be maintained if a shuttle service were introduced.  The fare on the particular route could be reduced because a shuttle service cuts down some of the ancillary costs.  I do not see that such a service is impossible and I would like to have a detailed argument from the Minister as to why it is not being introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> I doubt if the traffic density on the Cork-London route is sufficient to justify a shuttle service.  While I would certainly like to see fares reduced I cannot agree with Senator Crowley if his point was that a licence should be issued for another company to operate on that route.  On both of these routes there has been a joint scale of operation by Aer Lingus and British Airways.  It is a semi-monopoly because these two firms come together and they strike the rates.  There is a danger that they lose sight of the consumers' view.  Again, the perspective would be helped by a more serious and searching exploration of the operations of Aer Lingus by the Joint Committee. My own feeling is that the Joint Committee will not be an effective committee unless by some stroke of good luck a vigorous chairman gets a hold of it, takes it by the scruff of the neck, and then goes after the various Government Departments with which he has to deal. That would be quite a job.  It would be a big operation for anyone to undertake but, if it were to happen, then perhaps we would be able to get some feedback. At the moment the information on which we can make critical judgments is not at our disposal.</P>
    <P>This agreement between Aer Lingus and British Airways can be a bit too cosy and it can lead to a ridiculous situation, such as the one concerning the sale of APEX fares by British Airways.  If one goes into the British Airways office in Dublin and asks for a CA APEX fare from London to New York they say they cannot sell this because they have an agreement with Aer Lingus.  If one goes to Belfast or London one can, of course, buy it.  That sort of nonsense should be stopped.  The Minister should put a stop to it straight away.  Why British Airways cannot sell you an APEX fare from their Dublin office when you can write to their London office and get it by return of post I just do not know.  That is the sort of position that the semi-monopoly gets itself into. By cutting down the ancillary services in running a shuttle, particularly on the Dublin-London route, fares could be reduced and profitability could be maintained. If fares were reduced somewhat the overall traffic would go up.  After all <Col N="547" /> the cross-channel boat services have over the years been gradually reduced and the emphasis now is not on the ordinary passenger but on the car with passenger or on the driver and his pantechnicon. This is an important part of our commercial life and I am not criticising it but I am saying that cross-channel boat services are not nearly as attractive as they were ten years ago for the passenger travelling on foot.  Many of the boat services now do not connect with the trains&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that boats do not arise on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but disappearing boat services put the airlines in an even stronger position when it comes to the development of traffic.  This trend looks like continuing and it makes the case for more efficient air services more compelling. The introduction of a shuttle between Dublin and London should be looked at carefully.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the problem of training personnel, particularly in the sales department, it probably induces a certain flatness and leads to inefficiency if all the training is carried out in an area in which there is a monopoly or a semi-monopoly situation.  I should like to see senior people in the sales department of Aer Lingus going for training to the US where there is a highly competitive situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> selling air travel.  One of the pleasant things about travel internally in the US is that an air ticket is virtually equivalent to currency.  One can go in with an air ticket for a certain number of dollars and, without difficulty, make a transfer to another route without any problems.  The airline sales people recognise this as part of their commercial operation but, if one tries to do this on Aer Lingus routes, one runs into severe difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to get one's ticket refunded, then apply for a refund, which may take some time to come through.  Then one has to purchase another ticket.  The situation in the more competitive areas is something that could only do our staff good from the point of view of experience. <Col N="548" /> I would urge Aer Lingus to send more of their staff away for training into situations in which the monopoly that exists at the moment in travel between Ireland and Great Britain does not exist and where there is a more competitive air market.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make some comments particularly on the problem of shuttle, but my main point is that really we are not in a position to speak in any informed way.  Everyone believes that Aer Lingus is a good company and every Member believes the decision to start our own airline prior to the last war was the right one.  But all we can do now is make vague supportive noises.  If the Government took the Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies more seriously, then perhaps by way of feedback from that committee the Members here would be able to make more perceptive comments and a great deal of the work we are trying to do in a debate such as this would be done by such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>First, from the evidence that is before us we can say that Aer Lingus is an asset to Ireland.  It provides a service and, by providing that service, it creates employment and because it is an Irish company, it is creating employment in and for Ireland.  It has been one of the few companies which have published their plans for next year, plans which adumbrate considerably increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, Aer Lingus provides us with badly needed foreign currency. Thirdly, Aer Lingus has created a good image of Ireland abroad.  We have always known the safety record of Aer Lingus and we must also know the management record of Aer Lingus because services are now demanded in other developing countries to assist their management and develop their areas. We should congratulate the management on the diversification into allied industry because some of that has not alone helped in the economy of the country but it has directed trade to the airline.  The question has been raised: Can we really discuss this subject?  We can safely say in a period of inflation and when aircraft are becoming more <Col N="549" /> expensive year by year, it is quite obvious that Aer Lingus cannot develop its own capital.  Therefore we must accept that it is only correct that we should put more of our shareholding into Aer Lingus equity to reduce the loan capital. The question is whether £50 million is the correct amount.  I accept the Minister's view in this, because we have no right to amend the amount irrespective of what information we may have.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley mentioned Cork.  I would like to say a few words on Cork. A feeling has developed in Cork over the years due to various actions of Aer Lingus that they prefer to concentrate on Shannon and Dublin as they feel that some of the Cork activities cannot affect their profits.  That is a feeling that has developed in Cork.  This year there was concern in Cork because Aer Lingus announced they were cutting down services. There was quite an amount of publicity on this.  At one stage Aer Lingus stated that one of the reasons was because the runway in Cork was not long enough.  Aer Rianta countered by saying that nobody had ever questioned a longer runway.  Since then Aer Lingus has published an increased schedule for next year.  There is a certain amount of confidence in Cork in what they are doing.  But there are still reservations. Cork Airport is the entry to one of the great tourist areas that helps our tourist economy greatly&mdash;the west Cork-Kerry area&mdash;and it is felt that if the services through Cork are curtailed that will curtail the tourist traffic.  It is also felt that if you start services you cannot expect to build them up in one year, scrap them the next year, and come back.  There should be a period of build-up when we should be prepared to accept a loss on our airways for the sake of our tourist traffic.  Certain services which Aer Lingus have dropped have been taken up by foreign airways.  If they pay the foreign airways why is it they do not pay Aer Lingus?  This is the feeling in Cork at the moment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I think everybody has great confidence in Aer Lingus and when the Oireachtas committee on semi-State bodies meet they <Col N="550" /> should refer to all the comments that have been made here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill I have some mixed feelings.  First of all, the good points: nobody would cavil at either the quality of service provided by Aer Lingus or the provision of scheduled flights that are given by Aer Lingus. Recently I was astounded by the number of daily flights to continental cities which I did not think would have warranted daily flights, but apparently they do on a commercial basis.  That is what counts in the long term.  I have mixed feelings and, having said good things about the quality of service provided, maybe the service provided is not as good as it was ten or 15 years ago&mdash;but then neither is the service that one meets in shops and many public services.</P>
      <P>What gives me great concern about this measure is: where are we heading with the levels of public expenditure we are speaking of here?  The Minister said that Aer Lingus is faced with a capital investment of £250 million over the next decade.  That is very big money in present day terms.  The last injection was made in 1969.  It amounted then to £15 million.  The injection under this Bill is a similar £15 million.  Faced with the prospect of Aer Lingus having to raise £250 million over the next decade, I wonder if this £15 million is sufficient. Perhaps the Minister in his reply could give an indication of what this £15 is detailed for precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the profit margin shown by Aer Lingus and I would like the Minister to indicate whether a 3 per cent profit margin in the air transport field is a typical profit margin.  How do we compare with other countries in this regard?  Can we expect a much higher profit margin in the years to come, given enough boost in tourism earnings and all else that goes with the air transport business?  I am uneasy about the aspect that, because Aer Lingus is providing a social service, therefore the injection of capital is merited.  We have been through this argument in regard to CIE.  It is an argument that ends in a vicious circle.  It gets us nowhere in the finish&mdash;we just find ourselves pumping more and more <Col N="551" /> money into a service.  We eventually conclude that, once it is providing a social service, that is the end of it.  That is a wrong base from which to look at Aer Lingus.  It is a young industry, as the Minister has pointed out, and if at this early stage of its development we start talking about it as providing a social service and that is the end of it, it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>If we were not providing air transport to fly Irish people from Dublin to London or Dublin to New York, there are many other air companies willing to do so.  The Germans could come in and do the job for us and certainly some of the American air companies could do the job once the commercial loads were there.  I look on providing a social service more in terms of internal services within the four corners of the State, such as what CIE and other semi-State bodies provide.  When we go outside the boundaries of Ireland we must look at some criteria other than the provision of a social service.</P>
    <P>The ancillary activities that were referred to by the Minister are desirable, but I wonder whether we are going to depend on these more and more in future as a prop towards the provision of the air service itself.  It is a very desirable departure on the part of Aer Lingus to provide hotel and recreational activities and it will increase revenue.  By and large the image of Aer Lingus in the public mind will be still one of air transport between here and other countries.  This brings us back to the point of whether the profit margin of 3 per cent is a typical one in the air transport field or whether we can look forward to a greater margin in future.</P>
    <P>If other countries deregulate their air transport it means that we probably will have some difficulty.  I would like the Minister to tell us if anything is happening in this respect that would tighten up the field for us or would tighten the regulations and give us greater competitive ability in the field of air transport. If we are faced with the situation where other countries deregulate we will <Col N="552" /> find ourselves being very small fish in a very large field and may well suffer as a result.  I wonder if the Minister would tell us whether there is something being done at an international level to tighten up matters in this sphere.</P>
    <P>In the case of flights between Ireland and the UK particularly, there is a special case for something to be done in regard to the very high fares, I know the Minister is inhibited in this regard.  The figures are presented to him by the Aer Lingus authorities who probably present him with certain inhibiting factors saying: &ldquo;Look, there is no case to be made for a reduction in fares or a better deal being offered to people travelling between Ireland and the UK and <i>vice versa</i>&rdquo;.  The public mind has concluded that there is something wrong with the level of fares that operate for what is a very short journey between this country and the UK.  I would welcome anything that would provide for a reduction in fares.  There is no question of a better service being provided&mdash;there are many daily flights.  It is a question of the price of the flight and the public mind regards as necessary some reduction in that sphere.  We do not for instance, hear that a special case is being made for CIE services operating between Cork city and Dublin city, although Senator Crowley earlier made great play about Cork in the air transport field.  In regard to the air flights between Ireland and the UK there is a need for a reduction in fares.</P>
    <P>I do not cavil with the service provided by Aer Lingus.  I should like to know, however, where we are heading with the sort of capital investment that is going to be required in the next decade. The provision of new planes is a necessity. It is necessary not only from the viewpoint of image but also from the viewpoint of safety.  Anybody who has taken short hops in other countries&mdash;it may be only 50 miles or 100 miles&mdash;know the sort of planes that one can end up in.  I fear that any such situation would be detrimental and would be a horrible future for us to face.  We are committed to this sort of advancement and it is necessary for us to keep a very close eye on expenditure and on the taxpayers' money that will be involved in <Col N="553" /> keeping a very adequate and suitable air transport service in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  The money that is being injected is necessary.  We seem to be committed to that course and we must keep a much closer watch on this whole sphere in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá ar dtús ar an mBille seo gur dócha gur mhinic a bhrath daoine san Seanad nuair a bhíodar ag taisteal thar lear dá mbeidís san Róimh nó i bPáras, Londain, Meiriceá, nó pé áit, nuair a thiocfadh eitleán Aer Lingus ar aghaidh agus tar éis dul isteach ann agus suí san chathaoir, do bhraithfeadh éinne go rabhadar abhaile ag an am sin tar éis dul isteach san eitleán.  Is maith an rud é sin; sin é an saghas seirbhíse a thugann an Airlíne Náisiúnta atá againn dúinn.</P>
      <P>There are many good things that can be said about Aer Lingus and quite a few of them have been said already.  I would like to elaborate on one or two of them which may not normally be adverted to.  Most of the comments seem to be on the more regular and normal aspects of the Aer Lingus service as an airline.  Aer Lingus as an organisation has for many years given leadership in this country, particularly as a semi-State body, in the development of entrepreneurial behaviour.  We all agree that we need entrepreneurs in Ireland. Very often, a State operation is not the place for the development of entrepreneurs.  People like Dr. Dempsey and Dr. Dargan helped in an entrepreneurial style to develop the airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West mentioned training abroad and how important this would be for the sales people in Aer Lingus.  It was a very farsighted move of Michael Dargan's when he arranged that the present chief executive of Aer Lingus would be the president of Aer Lingus in North America for a period of time before eventually he came to the top of the organisation.  This is the type of management development thinking that I would like to see in semi-State organisations.  I just mention that as a particular facet of Aer Lingus which should get some attention. This comes out, of course, and it is <Col N="554" /> coming out now as has been said already, in the related operations and the related diversifications that Aer Lingus have indulged in.  These have helped in no small way to bolster up the profits of the organisation and make a contribution towards the airline itself.</P>
    <P>Another example of that is in the area of computers.  From the very beginning Aer Lingus employed people and provided development for people who specialise in that area.  They were instrumental in evolving novel schemes for the type of computer booking that we all take for granted when we stand in front of the desk and ask: &ldquo;Am I on the plane or am I not?&rdquo; They just have to run a few keys and whether it is in New York, Rome, London, Dublin, Cork or wherever your position is known because of a very complex network of communication and a very advanced computer system.  Aer Lingus have been able to sell that system to developing countries.  This has made a great impact, not only as far as Aer Lingus is concerned on revenue, but also on the standing of the country.</P>
    <P>It affects not only Aer Lingus but the products that our businessmen bring in to these countries when they find that Aer Lingus has that kind of standing in a fundamental matter of this kind.  I know that some difficulties have arisen in this area in another aspect of the Minister's responsibility in that the telephone strike caused problems there.  I hope that these are gone now and that that particular development can expand.</P>
    <P>Addressing myself to the monopoly aspect of Aer Lingus's activities&mdash;this might be slightly more negative than the positive things I have been saying so far&mdash;I would like to add my voice to what the Senator said about the London run.  The London run is a money spinner. It is very important that people who use it will get the same treatment as somebody who is going off on a trip to New York or any other continental country.  The frequency of the run and the more casual aspect of it should not be allowed to take from the very fine service Aer Lingus gives across the board. The London run is a money run and the frequent user of that run should get the <Col N="555" /> same service.  As an aside, I should say in that regard that the Minister should influence British Airways to carry Irish drink on their aircraft.  It is a bit of a nuisance when one cannot get Irish whiskey and has to put up with another product.</P>
    <P>On the other aspect of Aer Lingus monopoly, it has come to my attention that the air cargo freight rates will be going up shortly.  I am not sure whether these have been approved yet.  I gather that they probably will go up as part of the IATA Agreement.  It is essential that where a company is in a dominant position it will not introduce increases of this kind at short notice.  The shippers who are involved in this area should be given a chance to cope with them.  It is possible to take alternative routes through London because British Airways offer somewhat reduced rates.  We must help our businessmen to stay competitive. While we all know that the costs are going up, we have to be very careful about it.  I just mention that matter to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another area, going to the positive side of it again, that I would mention is that Aer Lingus has specialised in methods of training for years.  I would like to put it into the record of the House that some of the most advanced methods of management training, sales training and organisation development have been used by Aer Lingus.  Some of the staff of Aer Lingus have been able to transfer this knowledge over for use in other businesses in Ireland.  In fact, some of the people who left Aer Lingus and went into that type of a job&mdash;in other words, training&mdash;have made a tremendous contribution in that area.  Aer Lingus are way ahead of most airlines in the world in that field.</P>
    <P>One other positive point I would like to mention is the need to keep the confidence and morale of the pilots up, as mentioned by Senator Goulding.  It is fantastic to think about the way the pilots and senior staff of Aer Lingus rallied around during the strike and managed to make such an impact on the public while the strike went on.  The work they did at that time, getting close <Col N="556" /> to the public, serving them their coffees and so on, made a great contribution to raising morale in the organisation.  Certainly, I would not like anything that we might say today to detract from that, either at the level of the pilots and hostesses or at the level of the staff of the organisation right up to the top.  It was a tremendous achievement and obviously a great boost to morale.</P>
    <P>One negative point is the question of serving internally some of the needs of the country.  It is interesting that it took an independent company like Aer Árann to provide the service that the people in the west needed.  For many years there had been a demand for service to some of the islands.  Maybe there is a need for a complementary activity of that kind internally which can be provided by a more independent body like Aer Árann. Maybe there is room for it to be supported and promoted.</P>
    <P>I would mention, in terms of what the Bill is setting out to achieve&mdash;obviously I welcome it&mdash;the fact that it is £15 million now and that it was £15 million in 1969.  This means, in effect, that it is a much smaller amount when we take the value of money into account over that period.  Obviously, if Aer Lingus is going to go abroad and carry on the entrepreneurial activities that we have supported in this debate, it will need a balance-sheet which is healthier looking in terms of its financial gearing.  Obviously, this type of money will not provide that.  Even though we cannot go into all the details that would enable us to carry out an in-depth analysis in support of the Minister's view, it is very clear to anybody looking at the Aer Lingus balance sheet that it needs this type of injection, given the losses that it had to incur over a period of time.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling, when I look at those currency losses and at the Irish monetary system, that maybe all the fine work that has been done in the last year might not go astray.  Now that we have done that, maybe we could take a solid view about what happens in relation to being solemnly tied to the UK currency. A loss of £14 million was mentioned by the Minister.  I do not think that £14 million refers entirely to currency losses. <Col N="557" /> Possibly it refers also to extraordinary items.  However there was a fair amount of currency loss involved and it is terrible to have to put up with that.</P>
    <P>To sum up, my contribution is that there are a lot of good things to be said about Aer Lingus.  There are one or two questions which inevitably arise when you are dealing with what is almost a monopoly.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not here for the Minister's opening statement. But, reading over it very quickly during the proceedings, I am surprised that he does not appear to have made any reference whatever to the holdings of our air companies in the hotel industry abroad, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States&mdash;although he does refer to the value of the tourist industry.  Could we have some information about those holdings, the extent of them and their profitability or otherwise?  It appears to me&mdash;I am speaking from the top of my head as it were because I do not know a great deal about the financial position of Aer Lingus&mdash;that although our air companies have these holdings in the hotel and allied industries in other countries they do not appear to be interested in acquiring hotels in this country.  I am rather surprised at this because the hotel industry nowadays is a very profitable one.  Furthermore, I am advised that it is almost impossible to get accommodation in hotels in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and some other areas.</P>
      <P>I would welcome information about the extent of the holdings abroad, whether they are profitable or otherwise and why the air companies do not take an active interest in the hotel industry here.  They could quite easily have bought over the old CIE hotels when they were releasing them some time ago. In asking for this information, I want to make it clear that I join with Senator Mulcahy and other Senators in congratulating Aer Lingus on its tremendous achievements over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is very sensible and necessary, as is spelled out in the first <Col N="558" /> paragraph of the comprehensive and informative memorandum presented by the Minister when he introduced the Bill.</P>
      <P>Basically what is being requested is an injection of equity capital&mdash;in present day terms a relatively limited injection of capital but one which is very necessary so that the financial position of the company <i>vis-a-vis</i> equity and loan funding should be brought into an appropriate balance for financial purposes. I am delighted to see that this is being done in the manner which is proposed.  It is very pleasant to hear the many tributes to Aer Lingus, because Aer Lingus is one of the great success stories of the country, a success story which has not always been without its difficulties. I am glad that it has overcome these difficulties and that is now fully accepted on every side of the House as a necessary and integral component of our national life.  I join in the tributes which have been paid to the excellent standards of the air crews, cabin crew, management and all involved in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>We should consider the purpose of Aer Lingus, which, briefly, is to provide us with an essential part of our infrastructure for our development and prosperity; a part which, had it not been present, would have greatly hindered us in the progress that we have made and which, if not present for the future, would be a severe limiting factor.  It has been the custom in many countries to have a national airline.  For many of these countries it has been perhaps solely a question of prestige.  From the point of prestige we can be very proud of Aer Lingus, but that is not its only purpose. We are an island nation.  Fast, effective communications are vital.  Aer Lingus have done this in a most efficient and praiseworthy manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, would like to see lower fares on the London and other routes.  We must not fall into the trap of imagining that in some way or other Aer Lingus is a social service or should become one.  It must have a sound economic basis.  I do not doubt that if they can keep fares down they will.  Let us not put undue pressure on Aer Lingus to reduce fares below an economic level, however much we wish or desire it.  The success of Aer Lingus <Col N="559" /> has been based on the sound business, financial and economic principles on which it has developed.  Let us continue to keep it that way.</P>
    <P>One major aspect of Aer Lingus which has not been really touched on is that it is probably our major export earner of foreign currency.  The figure, for the last year for which figures were available, is approximately £60 million, an enormous earning of foreign currency and a very valuable aspect of Aer Lingus.  We think of Aer Lingus in terms of tourist trade and that is very important. They also played a major role in development activity.  They have made it very clear throughout the world that we have the technical ability to take part in any modern industry.  This has been an important factor for many foreign businessmen and industrialists in considering setting up industries in this country.  The very high technological reputation of Aer Lingus has been a key factor and one which we perhaps take for granted.</P>
    <P>There is a return cycle in airline financing which relates to the provision of new generations of aircraft, and at a certain stage in each cycle it provides all airlines with an immense burden on their financial resources.  Aer Lingus have done extremely well in that they have managed to balance the buying of their fleet and have bought aircraft which were proved to be extremely suitable to the routes Aer Lingus operate.  I do not doubt that they will show the same financial and technical aeronautical expertise for the future, but the costs involved are staggering.  At the moment the cost amounts to £65,000 per airline seat, and the figures which are given here would represent the cost of presentday replacement of the aircraft.  Due to this cycle which I just mentioned the replacement will probably be taking place over the next few years rather than immediately.  This may involve even larger sums than those mentioned here.</P>
    <P>There have been one or two comments on the ancillary activities of Aer Lingus, in particular, the hotel activities. These are more or less a routine function nowadays of international airlines.  They <Col N="560" /> are very necessary for various business purposes related to the airline.  They are a very valuable aspect.  Certain other aspects of the ancillary activities of Aer Lingus are rather more important: the overseas contracts which they have been so successful in obtaining and which have performed to such an extremely high level of competence, the trainee activities of Aer Lingus and, a very valuable aspect, the maintenance, repair and general engineering work which it now seems possible Aer Lingus will be able to develop to a significant extent. This is a tribute to us and to those working for Aer Lingus at all levels.  I mentioned air crew, management and cabin crew, but we should not forget the very rarely recognised mechanics, maintenance crew, engineers and technological people concerned with Aer Lingus.  It is their exceptionally high quality work which has been a vital factor in the extremely reliable service provided by Aer Lingus.  This has been recognised internationally by various other countries and airlines which wish to process either their work or training through Aer Lingus.  These people deserve our tribute.</P>
    <P>I know, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, you intervened when another speaker referred to boats but clearly there is some degree of a competitive element between the airlines and the shipping services and contrary to what one of the previous speakers said, I think Aer Lingus are, if anything, likely to face further competition there with the introduction of hydrofoil and other-up-to-date surface craft.  This will be an additional reason for ensuring that the new aircraft which are bought are aircraft which can be operated at efficient, economic level. From a national point of view it is very beneficial that we should have increasingly efficient and speedy transportation available to us either by air or by sea, but it will certainly provide increased problems for Aer Lingus, not decreased.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points which could be made&mdash;some were made by other speakers already&mdash;and there are many others which one would like to develop.  Basically in this very necessary <Col N="561" /> and timely Bill we are discussing a change in the equity capital and therefore I would like to restrict myself just to these general comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the complimentary remarks which were made about Aer Lingus but one area that has not been referred to at all during the debate is the industrial relations position in Aer Lingus which is very important. It is probably more important there than in any other industrial section in the country because of the effect a breakdown in industrial relations there would have, not alone on trade but on the transport of tourists in or out of the country.  I suggest that recognition be given to those people who are involved in the industrial section of Aer Lingus because of the few breakdowns we have had in industrial relations within Aer Lingus.  We all know how difficult it is and how important it is to have good industrial relations.  During the year there were breakdowns in other countries and because of the effect they had on tourism within this country and in the other countries it is important that we should take notice of the fact that we have had this type of industrial relations in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>In the event of a breakdown I would be sorry for people who have either gone abroad and are left stranded, or people who have come into this country and are left stranded here.  I do not know how we could get over that type of situation.  I would like to know how many unions are involved in industrial relations in Aer Lingus.  It is important that we have as few as possible.  The fewer unions involved in that field the more likely it would be that we would be able to solve the problems that would arise there.  I know the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are very interested in this area and they make every effort possible to ensure the continuation of the working of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bringing up these points because no one referred to them and they are important. I would like to congratulate Aer Lingus but I would like to say to those people who are involved that whenever there is danger of a breakdown, they <Col N="562" /> should negotiate to the very end to ensure that there would be no breakdown.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí go léir.  Is Bille fíor-thábhachtach an Bille seo.  Tabharfaidh sé seans do Aer Lingus forbairt a dhéanamh sna blianta atá romhainn, agus tá sé sin íontach tábhachtach, ní amháin ó thaobh Aer Lingus féin ach ó thaobh eacnamaíocht na tíre go ginearálta.  Tá áthas orm gur aontaigh na Seanadóirí go léir inniu leis an Bhille, go bhfeiceann siad an tábhacht atá ag baint leis agus tá súil againn uilig go gcuideoidh sé le Aer Lingus feabhas a chur ar an obair fíor-thábhachtach atá á dhéanamh acu i láthair na h-uaire.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my thanks to the Senators who spoke on this Bill for their general acceptance of it.  It is a Bill which is an important measure in that it is designed to put the air companies on a sound financial basis to enable them face the formidable challenges of the future and to continue their valuable contribution to national development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney recognised that the bulk of the profitability of the companies comes from their ancillary activities.  I think it will be accepted that considering, for example, the cost of aircraft acquisition to meet future growth we would all hope that the air companies' profitability would increase.  Senator Cooney referred to the possibility of reassessing the situation in relation to Aer Lingus and I detected perhaps a slight hint that he would be inclined in relation to the north Atlantic service to reduce it because it is losing money.  Of course, there is much more involved in the north Atlantic service than the fact that the service as such is losing money.  It is a fact that if we had not got our own north Atlantic service the number of tourists visiting this country would decrease very considerably because, with the type of fares which are being offered from the US at present planes would tend to overfly this country and we would only get the number of tourists who felt like coming back from London or some other destination to Ireland.  In our present circumstances, <Col N="563" /> because we have Aer Lingus servicing the north Atlantic, we are assured of not only planes landing in Ireland but also we are helped very considerably by the exceptional work which is being done on tourist promotion by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Might I just point out here, in answer to a suggestion made by Senator West that Aer Lingus should send some of their people to be trained in America in promotional activities, that in fact quite a considerable number of the airline staff are working on promotional business in America and they are competing very effectively with promotional people from other countries.  I doubt if they would have much to learn from being trained in America.  I might also add that, were it to happen that we were to make any dramatic changes in our north Atlantic situation, it could mean the release of 1,300 airline staff, many of them home-based. It would mean also the disruption of our airline with large-scale economies and loss of morale and, of course, in national terms it would be harmful to industry and trade and it would be a very considerable blow to tourism.  I hope that we never reach the point where we think that the north Atlantic service is not necessary.  I am not suggesting that Senator Cooney was proposing such a decision but I am saying this simply because I thought he felt that we were just keeping the flag flying by continuing the service across the Atlantic.  I hope I have demonstrated we have done much more than that.</P>
    <P>We also had suggestions about the possibility of a shuttle service on the shorter routes like the London-Dublin route.  The obvious advantage to passengers on a shuttle service is the availability of a seat at any time without prior reservation and this, of course, would be a particular advantage to the business traveller but I would like to underline the fact that a shuttle service would not in itself automatically mean a reduction in fares.  The potential advantage to the airline is a traffic increase but there would be quite substantially increased costs involved, mainly the cost <Col N="564" /> of providing a back-up service to cater for peaks of demand.</P>
    <P>In so far as the London-Dublin traffic is concerned, about two-thirds of traffic on this route is comprised of non-business passengers.  Many of whom use the existing special promotional fares and these would not fit in with a shuttle service.  A number of studies have in fact been done and these have shown that the introduction of a shuttle service on this route would not be an economic proposition nor would it be justified having regard to the fact that only a limited number of passengers would stand to benefit from the extra expenditure involved. Nevertheless, I would like to say to the House that Aer Lingus and British Airways keep this matter under review.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the fares between Ireland and the United Kingdom, particularly on the London-Dublin route.  It is quite natural that all of us would like to have fares reduced.  I, personally, would like to see them reduced.  I have no doubt that Aer Lingus would also.  But we must try to keep a balance in our minds in relation to the needs of Aer Lingus, not only now but in the future&mdash;the need it has for money, the need for a certain level of profitability and, on the other hand, the demands of passengers for lower fares. The fact of the matter is that, in so far as the short-haul services of Aer Lingus are concerned, they are only marginally profitable.  It is true to say that were it not for the cross-subsidisation by profits from ancillary activities, the fares would in fact be higher than they are at present. As I said a moment ago, I have already indicated that there is need for quite substantial profits in the years ahead to meet the cost of new aircraft.  In the circumstances, it should be recognised that there is not much scope for a reduction in fares.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that there are a number of different types of fares available on the Dublin-London route. There is the normal economy return, that is the £72 fare; there is the excursion fare of £60 and there is the APEX fare of £48.  Of course, there are also the low promotional fares, that is, inclusive tour fares and fares for special events <Col N="565" /> and for families.  If you compare like with like, these fares are among the lowest in Europe on a cost per mile basis.</P>
    <P>I know that those who are anxious to have fares lowered are not interested in cost per mile but an airline which is endeavouring to run on an economic basis must concern itself with this factor. The normal economy fares between Dublin and London and Shannon and London on a cost per mile basis are very considerably lower than the fares on the London-Paris, London-Brussels and London-Amsterdam routes and one could say that the comparison is similar in the case of other fare types on other similar routes.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the profits this year and, as I said, there were fairly substantial profits from the ancillary activities. The combined overall profit was approximately £4½ million in the year ended 31 March last and I do not have to remind Senators that this was on a gross revenue of £162 million.  This approximated to a return of only 3 per cent and, as I said in my opening speech, if there were a downturn of 3 per cent in gross revenue the profit would be wiped out.  This further demonstrates the need for higher profits and the need to recover increasing costs through air fares.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley referred to the situation in Cork as did Senator Jago.  There was a furore recently when there were reports of a withdrawal by Aer Lingus of certain air services out of Cork.  I would like to set the record straight in relation to this.  The services withdrawn consisted of no more than a once weekly night charter to Spain and a few <i>ad hoc</i> Dublin-Lourdes night flights, formerly routed through Cork.  The withdrawal, necessitated by schedule changes and fleet deployment problems, will however, as Senator Jago mentioned, be more than offset by the considerable improvement in the frequency of the companies' schedules services from Cork to the UK and continental Europe.</P>
    <P>In addition the operation of a frequent and improved Cork-Dublin connecting feeder flight, with onward connections to a number of holiday destinations on the Continent will give a much better service <Col N="566" /> to the Cork people than a once weekly charter to a single destination.  Overall, it is true to say that the level of Aer Lingus operations out of Cork is being increased, and there will be a very limited reduction in the charter area.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley also referred to what he termed a ban on air services other than Aer Lingus but the fact of the matter is that we have no application for services out of Cork to other countries.  It is open to other airlines to apply to me for permission to operate out of Cork, but we have no application for such a service.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at Senator Robinson's criticisms of my opening speech in that she suggested that the information I made available was meagre. I felt that I had given a very reasonable resumé of the Aer Lingus position related to this particular Bill.  She asked what was the purpose of the £15 million. The £15 million will restore the ratio between the equity capital and borrowing to about 1:1.  This is a normal ratio. The equity injection of £15 million will assist the airlines in their objective of building up reserves towards future capital requirements.  The companies will also be able to borrow on the basis of the improved capital structure.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also referred to the ancillary activities.  In common with quite a large number of other airlines, Aer Lingus in the early seventies decided to diversify into potentially profitable ancillary activities.  They were mainly aviation-related.  This was to endeavour to offset the cyclical swings to which the air transportation business is subject, to maintain employment and also to improve the overall rate of return on capital.  Their activities come under two broad heads, aviation-related and others. To date, the companies have invested about £2 million in activities related to aviation and about £17 million in non-aviation-related activities.  The aviation-related activities have not required heavy investment as they are generally integrated with the operation of the air services.</P>
    <P>I must say, and I am sure that the Seanad would agree with me, that I fully <Col N="567" /> support the diversification programme which has been very successful and has contributed substantial profits to the company.  The aviation-related activities consist mainly of services to other airlines in the fields of maintenance and overhaul of aircraft, in crew training and in advisory services.  Activities not directly related to aviation but with some affinity to it, include hotel investments which were referred to by Senator Kennedy and I would like to tell him that the investments in hotels that he has referred to are highly profitable.  I would also say that Aer Lingus has also got a minority shareholding in some hotels here as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson in referring to these ancillary activities particularly referred to Teneriffe.  The position there is that because of the downturn in the tourist activity on the islands, Aer Lingus has not so far developed the property in Teneriffe but the position is being kept under review.  In fact, the ancillary industries in which Aer Lingus are involved are now highly profitable in most instances, but one might expect that some might not be as profitable as others&mdash;but taking the overall picture they are and they have been profitable.</P>
    <P>Senator West suggested that Aer Lingus is in a monopoly position in providing transportation, but in actual practice of course it is in competition with surface transport and also with other airlines.  The shipping services have improved enormously over the last few years.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised.  Again I appreciate the approach of the Senators to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

      <Col N="568" /> That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    <P>Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972 (Amendment) Regulations, 1978,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 21st November, 1978.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion seeks the approval of the House to a draft of the Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972, (Amendment) Regulations, 1978, as required by section 41 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>The functions of Comhairle na nOspidéal, as provided for in section 41 of the 1970 Act, are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the draft regulations. That memorandum also details the legal background to the regulations and the necessity for them.</P>
      <P>The draft regulations now before the House provide for a continuance of the existing procedure whereby all the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal are appointed by the Minister for Health. The original regulations&mdash;the Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972&mdash; provided for such a method of appointment for the period ending on 31 December 1975.  The three-year term of office of members of the comhairle appointed in accordance with those provisions will expire on 31 December next.  It is necessary, therefore, to make, before that date, the appropriate legal provision to enable members to be appointed for subsequent periods.  This the draft regulations now before the House will do.  It would be my intention to continue the practice of appointing members for a three-year term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1972 regulations provided for the direct method of appointment of members only for the period ending on 31 December 1975, because it was considered at the time&mdash;and, in my view, rightly so&mdash;that consideration could best be given to the optimum method of appointing members only when experience had been gained for the actual working of the comhairle over a period.  I consulted a very wide range of interests, <Col N="569" /> including medical and nursing organisations, health boards and voluntary hospitals, before putting the present draft regulations before the House. Nearly all those interests favoured a continuance of the method of direct appointment of members by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, alternative methods such as an election procedure or on the basis of nominations from particular interests or organisations.  I am satisfied, however, that the majority view which I have mentioned is the right one and that adoption of any of the alternative procedures would inevitably lead to an unmanageable and largely ineffective body if the need for a balanced representation of interests and geographical areas were to be maintained. I should perhaps point out also that actual membership of the comhairle is not altogether essential for the purpose of securing a completely balanced representation of interests, since the comhairle is empowered to appoint committees for specific purposes, to which non-members may be appointed.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations before the House also provide for an increase in the total membership of the comhairle from 23 to 27, of whom 14 must, under the Act, be hospital consultants.  The views which, as I mentioned earlier, I obtained from a wide range of interested bodies indicated that some increase in the present membership of 23 would be desirable.  The increase of four members which is provided for in the draft regulations will enable me to go some way towards meeting the requests made by a number of those bodies for better geographic representation and for wider representation generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to express in this House, as I have already done in Dáil Éireann, my appreciation of the interest shown by the various bodies which I consulted and of the reasoned and constructive views which they put forward.  I am confident they will appreciate that, in an exercise such as this, it is not possible to meet in full the viewpoints of all interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> I should also like to avail of the opportunity to express my appreciation of the work done by the members of the present comhairle.  I know that they have worked diligently and conscientiously in the discharge of their functions and I am most grateful for the time and energy which they devoted to their task.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House approve of the draft of the regulations which is before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of these new Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1978 are necessary, as the Minister pointed out, because the period ends on 31 December in terms of the original appointments for three years ending on 31 December 1975.  To that extent we in Fine Gael support the regulations because of their fundamental necessity.  We have reservations for other reasons.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with representation which has been criticised and to which the Minister referred is the charge that has been made from time to time that there is not a sufficiently wide geographic representation on Comhairle na nOspidéal, that there is not sufficiently good regional representation.  The Minister, to an extent, acknowledges this.  He states that he is increasing the number from 23 to 27 partly for this reason, to deal with the question of better geographic representation.  It is fair comment to suggest that going from 23 members to 27 on a board such as this is not achieving the objective of getting a wider spread; the interests tend to be narrower, especially when one takes into account the fact that there is a very large and necessary medical consultancy representation, with which we do not quibble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the new membership of 27 the ruling will again be adhered to, that an excess of 50 per cent of members will come from the consultant medical profession, which means a membership of 14.  Whilst we support the view that strong medical representation is necessary on a board such as this, it means that there is a limitation to the extent to which adequate representation can be given to large community interests, to <Col N="571" /> medical and nursing interests, and the general public.  It was for that reason that in the Dáil yesterday our spokesman on Health, Deputy Boland, sought to introduce an amendment which was not acceptable.  Being a draft it was either a question of accepting it or rejecting <i>in toto.</i>  But he sought an amendment under which there would be substantial representation by the health boards in the form of their chief executive officers.  The reason for that was simply to get this better spread, to get a strong regional base in Comhairle na nOspidéal, to give stronger administrative representation and through the chief executive officers being members it would mean that they would reflect the views of their health boards which could result, perhaps, in a better approach, having regard to the whole geographic social aspect of medicine. The danger is that in a grouping of speci alist medical people, whilst the medical input is absolutely sound, there are many other factors which in certain circumstances may not be got right for different reasons.  I want to make the point again that the base is somewhat narrower, that we would prefer to see health board representation for the reasons I have stated.  I regret that that idea was not accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate Deputy Boland and the Minister had a verbal battle about the Roscommon issue.  It is merely one example of the difficulties we can run into. The Roscommon issue was not a question, as the Minister seemed to allege, of the Opposition making political capital of something.  What happened there was very simply a dispute within the Minister's party between the Deputies from that constituency and the Minister in regard to who said what.  To that extent it was a matter of the Government's, or the Fianna Fáil Party's own making if there was a problem in that area.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome these regulations and take the opportunity of congratulating the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal for the very considerable amount of work they do.  I do not think we fully realise the considerable burden which is placed on the members of this body, not only in terms of meetings of the full body and their sub-committees but also in terms of this very considerable amount of background work and research which a number of them put into their work in connection with Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It is indeed something for which we should be very grateful, that the members of this body discharge their duties with so much thoroughness and conscientiousness, indeed, with such a high quality of input into their deliberations, suggestions and conclusions.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with the small increase in numbers which the Minister is suggesting.  It is about the maximum; one cannot go very much beyond that sort of size before the body becomes unwieldy and inefficient.  Thank God this body&mdash;and this is the view of most of those involved&mdash;have been functioning very effectively.  This further slight increase in representation will enable them to discharge their duties, perhaps not so much better but will indicate just a little more than they are fully representative.  I welcome this very much.  They are a very necessary and sensible series of regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Seanad for the expeditious manner in which they dealt with this proposal of mine to reconstitute Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I would like to re-echo in particular what Senator Conroy said about the membership of the comhairle and the job of work they have done.  The fact that they may not always have won popular approval for their course of actions is readily understandable; anybody who sets out to do a good job in that sort of area cannot expect to be popular.  But that is not what matters.  What matters is that they <Col N="573" /> should endeavour to give us a structure of services, a staff structure in the hospital services which would serve the needs of the people to the best possible extent bearing in mind the various constraints we have upon us, financial constraints, constraints which are related to the scarcity of skilled personnel.  We want to avoid overlapping.  We want to avoid having serious gaps in the structure. All these things must be taken into account.  The decisions which are subsequently arrived at will not always necessarily be readily acceptable by those who will be affected.</P>
      <P>In the health services unfortunately, in the different areas many people want to have everything everywhere.  I have spoken about this before on a number of occasions.  It is not possible to have everything everywhere; one must have priorities and rationalisation.  One must have a distribution of skilled personnel to the best possible advantage.  We cannot have every specialty represented in every area in the country.  The general structure envisages the necessary specialties available throughout the country, and, on top of that, certain very technical specialties available at regional level and, finally, some particularly exclusive specialties available at national level only.  That is the way we have to proceed.  That structure predicates that there has to be a very great deal of thought given to the right disposal and dispersal of personnel throughout the structures.</P>
      <P>Bearing all those things in mind the out-going comhairle have done quite a good job.  Certainly, they have been very assiduous, dedicated and have put an enormous amount of time and energy into their work.  We are all very grateful to them for that.  It is my wish to get an incoming comhairle of a similar calibre, a comhairle which will devote themselves to the task with the same energy, dedication and enthusiasm of the out-going comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about having regional and area opinion reflected in the comhairle. On the other hand, we do not want to go too far with that process.  If this comhairle, at national level, are to do their <Col N="574" /> job properly they have to be impartial and very objective.  Very often&mdash;for the overall structure of the service&mdash;it will have to discount particular feelings for particular areas to the extent that the people of that area might wish. Whereas we would like to have all legitimate opinions coming before the comhairle, being expressed, and taken into account by the comhairle, nevertheless the comhairle to some extent will have to be removed, be objective and impartial and look at certain areas and regions as a whole, even look at the national picture as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in the Dáil made a case about not having the comhairle appointed.  Senator Staunton was inclined to reiterate that view here.  I do not want to be political about this, but I am afraid the Fine Gael Party in this regard find themselves out of step with the majority of opinion in this area. They are also out of step with their previous opinions, views and actions.  All my predecessors, looking at the thing in the round, decided that the only way to get the mixture, spread and representation was to have the Minister appoint the members of the comhairle.  Previous Fianna Fáil Ministers came to that conclusion, and a Coalition Minister came to that conclusion.  There are so many different interests who would like to be represented that the only final way of arbitrating on the matter is to have the Minister receive all the lists and views that people wish to put before him and then decide, from his central position, how best to reconcile and balance all the different interests involved.</P>
    <P>On this occasion a very wide spectrum of views, a wide range of bodies, organisations and institutes concerned in the medical and hospital world were consulted by me.  The overwhelming opinion is that, whatever are the disadvantages involved, the best way to do this is to have the Minister make the appointments, not because he is all wise or anything else but because of the multiplicity and variety of the interests seeking representation.  No other system will enable us to have a balanced comhairle which will represent, in the best possible way, the best <Col N="575" /> possible mix of these different and various interests.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the House for dealing with the matter so expeditiously.  I hope they will be able to approve the motion so that I can go ahead and proceed to appoint a new Comhairle na nOspidéal which I hope will be of great value in helping to continue the development and improvement of our hospital services.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1978: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill amends the existing provisions governing grant expenditure by the Industrial Development Authority in that it is proposed to raise the limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which can be made by and to the authority and to raise the limits, which may not be exceeded without prior Government approval, on various grants which the authority may make to an individual undertaking.  The Bill also provides for a minor technical amendment to empower the authority to operate a widows' and children's pension scheme.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development (No. 2) Act, 1975 raised to £400 million the limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which may be made by the authority, and the limit on the aggregate amount of grants which may be paid by the Minister to the authority for this purpose.  The total amount of capital issued to the authority to the end of 1977 was almost £317 million and the authority's capital allocation for 1978 is £69.75 million.  It is, therefore, again necessary to amend the statutory limits in order to enable the authority to continue to discharge their functions after the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA'S projected capital requirements for the three years 1978-81 <Col N="576" /> amount to over £270 million in 1977 prices; this expenditure is based on the level of IDA activity as set out in the &ldquo;IDA Industrial Plan 1977-80&rdquo;.  Having regard to the fact that this figure is expressed in 1977 prices and that the revised industrial plan, to be published in the New Year, will incorporate higher job approval targets, actual capital expenditure will be significantly higher than the projected figure.  Thus, to enable the authority to carry out their functions for a further three years or so, it is proposed to raise to £750 million the limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which can be made by and to the IDA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the limit, which may not be exceeded without the approval of the Government, on the total amount of grants which the Industrial Development Authority may make to a particular undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased and towards the cost of factory rents stands at £850,000.  In order to keep pace with the increases in fixed asset costs that have taken place since the limit was set at its present level in 1975, and to avoid the submission of an increasing number of what are only small to medium-sized projects to the Government for approval, the Bill provides for the raising of this limit to £1,250,000.</P>
      <P>The limit on the amount of grants which the authority may make, without prior Government approval, towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased by an industrial undertaking for re-equipment, modernisation or expansion also stands at £850,000 at the moment. It is proposed, for reasons similar to those which I have already outlined, to raise this limit also to £1,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1977, provided for a limit of £850,000 on the amount of training grants the IDA might make, without prior Government approval, to any individual undertaking. Prior to the 1977 Act there was <Col N="577" /> no legislative limit in respect of training grants.  Training grants now constitute an important component in the authority's range of incentives, particularly with regard to the authority's efforts to encourage suitable service industries to locate here, and will continue to be important in the years ahead.  It seems appropriate, therefore, that the limit on training grants should be kept at the same level as the limit applicable to capital grants.  Thus the Bill provides that the limit on training grants which the authority may make without prior Government approval be raised to £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, empowers the IDA to operate a staff superannuation scheme, subject to ministerial approval.  As the provisions of this section may debar the IDA from operating a widows' and children's pension scheme, the Bill proposed to remove this limitation on the authority's powers by the amendment of section 27.</P>
    <P>In the context of the present Bill, which raises the limit on financial allocations to the authority, the House will be pleased to note that on present indications it appears that the authority will exceed, by a significant margin, their job approvals target of 27,000 for 1978.</P>
    <P>A welcome feature of the high level of job approvals secured in recent years is the share of these approvals coming from within Ireland; in 1977, for instance, over 50 per cent of total job approvals of more than 24,000 came from domestic industry.  The authority's industrial plan, 1977-80, which aims at the negotiation during the plan period of projects with the potential to provide over 100,000 jobs at full production, also aims at maintaining the high level of job approvals coming from within Ireland.  As I have mentioned already, the plan is currently being revised and the revised version, to be published in the New Year, will incorporate even more ambitious job approval targets.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy feature of the IDA'S highly successful performance to date this year is the fact that the new powers afforded to the authority under the Industrial Development Act, 1977, have <Col N="578" /> contributed significantly to this performance. Senators will recall that the provision in the 1977 Act with the most obvious potential for employment creation was that which provided for a new kind of incentive to encourage the establishment of new industrial projects by persons having the necessary qualifications and experience but who would be unable to raise the necessary finance to put the project on a sound commercial footing.  The Enterprise Development Programme, as it is named, was launched by the IDA in January, 1978, and I am pleased to say that the response to date has been very encouraging. Nineteen projects with a total job creation potential of 850 have already been approved for grant assistance and worthwhile inquiries are continuing to be received at a steady rate.</P>
    <P>The promoters of the projects already approved for grant assistance come from a variety of backgrounds&mdash;from university, banking, manufacturing and semi-State&mdash;and having individual skills and experience in such diverse areas as management, production, finance, research and marketing.  From the response to this programme, it would appear that there are many enterprising people in this country who, with the assistance available under this programme, can set up successful manufacturing projects.</P>
    <P>Before closing I would like to say something about one facet of the IDA'S activities that has become increasingly important in recent years, the authority's programme of advance factory construction. In the current atmosphere of severe international competition for projects the advance factory has become an important element in the authority's overall range of incentives.  On 20 November the Minister announced details of the second phase of the authority's fourth programme of advance factory construction, which involves the construction of 31 advance factories and of four cluster units, at a cost of £9.25 million.  This intensive construction drive is testimony of the Government's commitment to assist the IDA in meeting their job creation targets <Col N="579" /> and, moreover, to advance the programme of regional industrialisation.</P>
    <P>Having described the provisions of the Bill and mentioned some noteworthy facets of recent IDA activity, I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Its provisions are important for the industrial well being of the nation.  As far as the financial assistance is concerned, it is only right and proper that, whatever else happens, the good work currently being carried out by the IDA is maintained and, indeed, accelerated wherever possible.  There is no doubt that over the years one of the better types of State-sponsored bodies has been the IDA. They have been extremely successful over the years.  However, I would like to take this opportunity of mentioning a couple of matters about which I am beginning to become seriously worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one views the good work carried out by the IDA in the field of attracting foreign industrialists to this country, I would like to make it clear that, particularly in the past two years, an idea has got abroad that we should not go overboard about attracting foreign industrialists to this country.  I do not know where this originated.  Maybe the Ferenka business in Limerick had something to do with it.  I believe it is very important to keep on attracting soundly based foreign firms to this country, because were one to take away the foreign industrialists who came in in the past five or six years our job situation would be far worse than it is now. The IDA are now coming to the stage where they are able to manage, on one hand, the large industrialists from foreign countries and, on the other, give suitable assistance to our own local industrialists, who for one reason or another are able to make a go of things. It does not necessarily follow in the context of what we are discussing that a firm can only be good if it is small.  I often heard it said, particularly in relation to racehorses, that a good big one was always better than a small one.  I would hope that the IDA would maintain <Col N="580" /> their momentum in the foreign market place to ensure that we get the right type of foreign industrialist.</P>
    <P>More effort could be put into the marketing of our industrial products abroad in so far as our offices throughout the world are concerned.  We could, in fact, employ more salesmen. By that I mean we should be always in the market place because we are as good as the next from the point of view of attracting industry here.  There is, however, one very serious fly in the ointment. I refer to the disastrous labour relations problem we have at the moment. I am very concerned about it.  A tremendous number of industrialists might well want to come to Ireland to occupy the 31 advance factories now being built but, if our industrial relations problem remains, I am afraid we may have a very big problem on our hands. In view of what happened in Brussels last night it is imperative we should generate a good economic climate.  Judging by what happened last night one cannot help feeling that the other countries do not think too much of us.  Everything possible must be done to solve our labour problems within the next few months or this very ambitious programme by the IDA may well become unstuck.</P>
    <P>There is another important factor in relation to this Bill.  It is that many of our raw materials have not been utilised to the full.  I will refer briefly here to a development in the west of Ireland at the moment concerning peat.  I am amazed that the, IDA have not become involved in this particular project.  Well and good, it is Bord na Móna that would have the overall responsibility for it, but down on the Galway-Roscommon border at the moment there is the possibility of a peat briquette factory being built with a total labour force of approximately 500 people. I have not heard any of the regional offices of the IDA or the county development teams say anything about it and I would take this opportunity to ask the Minister if the IDA have any plans for such a factory.  Were it a foreign industrialist who arrived in this country with a promise to create 500 jobs we would have jet planes to get him <Col N="581" /> here and red carpets laid down.  There would be a great furore.  We have over 20,000 acres of bogland in south Roscommon and north Galway and there has been no official announcement of any kind.  It may well happen that we will not get a briquette factory but I would like to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that there is a fair amount of disquiet that the IDA is not involved more in the utilisation of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the job approvals have topped the 27,000 mark.  This is a magnificent achievement.  I certainly hope that in the current year this figure will be maintained, if not surpassed. With the number of redundancies at the moment the IDA's figures will be slightly out but it is most important that the job creation programme goes ahead.  As far as I can see we are certainly in for more redundancies and, if our job creation targets do not keep pace with them, we will have a net loss worse than what we are experiencing at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear that the pilot project programme initiated earlier this year for the smaller type of industrialist has got off to a good start.  I would like to know from the Minister if it is intended to inject more capital into this in the next year and what type of prospects are there for 1979?  Usually with a scheme of this type you generally attract most of the people interested in the first or second year and thereafter it is likely to lag.  There are several areas, particularly in the designated areas, where the IDA could be even more useful than they are from the point of view of grants. I take this opportunity to ask the Minister again why is it the IDA are so very slow to grant aid to concrete and allied products?  We have a case in Moylough, in County Galway, where over 70 people are employed in a little village manufacturing cattle slats.  The slats were patented and still the IDA do not see fit to grant aid despite the fact that this manufacture is certainly not cutting across any other company in the west.  With that type of job creation in a rural areas it is hard to understand why there should not be some grant aid.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the <Col N="582" /> county development teams and the IDA at regional or local level?  Sometimes I think there is a fair amount of duplication. I would like to know the demarcation line.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome the advance factory programme.  I see there are four cluster units and 31 advance factories to be built right around the country.  What I particularly like about it is that a great percentage of the 31 will be based in areas which are not very big.  If we are to stabilise the population in the rural areas that will only be done with well-chosen and well-picked industries suited to the region and the particular area.  I believe the advance factory project is a good one.  It does not necessarily mean that if a small town has to qualify for an advance factory it automatically gets an industry, but it certainly is a fair bit ahead of a town that does not have an advance factory.  Besides that the IDA are extremely lucky&mdash;I suppose there is really more to it than luck&mdash;in that most of the factory units built in the last five years are housing industries that are good for this nation.  We will have failures.  We will always have some failures as far as industrial projects are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the regional offices of the IDA are given the type of autonomy necessary to enable them to carry out their duties properly.  There was a rumour circulating not too long ago that many of the regional offices were under the thumb of the central office in Dublin to too great an extent.  We asked the Minister to ensure that this was not over-emphasised because it is vitally important that the regional offices should have a fair amount of responsibility, a fair amount of control and are allowed to think and act in accordance with what is necessary in a particular region.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Bill.  I believe there is only one black cloud on the horizon and it is one which could upset the IDA in its efforts.  I refer to our labour relations problem.  I would stress on the Minister and the Government that everything should be done to ensure that this bugbear will not bring down the IDA as it has brought down many other things in the not too distant past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, and obviously I would want to support the extra powers in terms of borrowing and authority given to the IDA.  It is very satisfying to see that the allocation for the authority's capital in 1978 of nearly £70 million was £10 million up on the previous year and, as we can see from the Minister's figures now, the three-year projection of £217 million in 1977 prices implies a capital investment for the authority of an average of £90 million per year.  This, of course, is where we would like to see the money going into factories, because that is what produces the healthy jobs.</P>
      <P>I am stimulated to draw attention as well to the comments of the NESC on full employment, the Green Paper, where they show the implied capital expenditure of the Government running from £691 million in 1977 to £790 million in the current year and going in 1979 to £930 million and then £1,053 million in 1980.  Obviously they are not Government figures but they are figures in the National Economic Social Council Report in Table 251 which are drawn obviously from various statements and answers to questions in the Dáil.  That, again, is very satisfying, because it shows a 14 per cent increase in 1978, 18 per cent in 1979 and a somewhat smaller increase in 1980.  That shows that the Government are putting the money where the jobs are or can be.  The projection is healthy.  It is very satisfying to find that the Minister can say that the IDA expect to meet their job potential targets of 27,000 for 1978 and, when we hear all this talk about not creating jobs, we should highlight the duplicity of that. There are 27,000 potential jobs in the pipeline as a result of their efforts.  A very happy omen is the fact that in 1977 50 per cent of the total job approvals of the 24,000 that we achieved in that year were in domestic industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes the impression seems to go abroad, as a previous speaker said, that we are filling the country with multinationals and that local industry is doing nothing.  It is important to recognise that it is inevitable that we must have the multinationals.  We cannot be the <Col N="584" /> country that sits back and lets every other country look for the production units of the large multinationals.  Some of these companies have a turnover which is greater than our GNP.  If anything is going to be done about a restructuring of the power of multinationals it will have to be done on an EEC level and not at our level.  Why has Ireland always got to be the holy Joe?  If anything is going to be done in that regard let the larger units do something about it.  God knows, we have learned over the last couple of days just how much power they wield.  What we need are jobs.  I was looking at the latest statistics recently.  Our birth rate is running at 22 per thousand of the population and our death rate is 10.  That means we are increasing at 12 per 1,000 and we have a great potential in terms of being able to employ people fully in producing goods that will develop our economy.</P>
    <P>While saying some good things, I also have a few bad things to say, as the Minister no doubt is expecting, because, while I am very pleased to note in regard to the advance factories, which are a key arm of our industrial strategy and one which we have almost led the world on mainly through Britain and Shannon in the back end of the 1950s, that we have 31 advance factories and four cluster units under way.  What bothers me, however, as a Senator operating in the inner city of Dublin where the major unemployment exists is that I still cannot see this cluster down there.  I know that the clusters got under way in the Liberties. That is fine, but a year and a half has now gone by and I have yet to see one in north central.  This is worrying because it is the area of high unemployment and, despite the fact that I recognise that there are difficulties in buying land and so on, I am afraid that I must here express my disappointment that we have not yet got that cluster in that area.  It is badly needed, and all I can do is hope that the measures that I suspect are under way will come to fruition shortly and the Minister will be able to make some announcement about them.</P>
    <P>The problems are unique and special. They can only be solved by some kind of <Col N="585" /> priority treatment.  The Industrial Development Authority are there to provide employment. We have the situation where there are up to 60 per cent unemployed in the north central area. We have the situation where industry will not even reply to applications from people who make applications from addresses in that area.  Some of us have been trying to provide accommodation addresses in order to, at least, make sure that the applicant gets an interview.  I will not go too far down that line but, when I have the Minister here in a captive position in front of me, I want to make the point as strongly as I can.</P>
    <P>Irish industry tends to be divided into two kinds.  We have the new type industry and the old.  The old is still under competitive pressure and under pressure to increase productivity.  I cannot let occasions like this go without drawing attention to the fact that there are many Irish workers working in the newer type industry who are producing goods at a productivity rate which is at least equivalent to similar workers operating in other countries.  When we talk about the low productivity problems, it is important that every opportunity be taken to doff the cap to those workers who, with the right management and capital investment backup, produce at productivity levels which are equivalent to their counterparts in Germany and in the USA.  There is nothing new about this.  I said in this House before, when I was working in factories myself, particularly in the Shannon area, that we were achieving this all the time and took it for granted.  Some of the comments which were made only came home to me when I took more interest in public life as such.</P>
    <P>We have a growing new sector of industry which is as productive as its counterparts and, because that part is constituting a larger proportion of total industry, so productivity as a whole is growing.  One of the difficulties, of course, is that all industrial workers look for the fruits of productivity increases. They want to get them across the board even though the productivity may only be coming from one section.  This is a <Col N="586" /> difficulty and must be faced.  In fact, it may well be that bargaining at the level of the firm might be the answer to it, but this is not the place to cover that subject. Nevertheless, it is impossible to talk about industrial development without thinking about productivity.</P>
    <P>During the year, we have all noticed, from the accounts in the media, the IDA is coming under a lot of competition, and the Minister mentioned this in his opening statement.  It is coming under competition from similar bodies that have been set up recently in other countries and similar bodies that were there for some time but were not as active or as entrepreneurial as the IDA.  It may well be that the IDA'S own success has taught other countries how to go about doing the same thing.  We see them having greater competition.  All I can do is to wish them well and to say that it is up to them to be ahead of the posse all the time and in that way reach their targets.</P>
    <P>A somewhat disturbing trend which has already been referred to, is the differential aspect of the IDA offering packages of incentives which are now more or less similar across the country. There are problems, for instance, with companies like Gaeltarra Éireann where at one stage they had the differential and were able to have an edge in attracting firms to go far west.  Some of that has got fudged, and I find myself a bit schizophrenic about it because, on the one hand, I want to see lots of incentives given for the inner city of Dublin and, on the other hand, I would like to make sure that the incentives to support the Gaeltacht would have a bit of edge to them on average.  I do not know what the answer is, but the problem is there.  I suppose it is something that can be changed over time depending on where the shoe is pinching.  At the moment it is certainly pinching in the inner city, and we will have to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Another concern that I have in looking at industrial development and particularly job creation&mdash;I just throw it out for the Minister's attention&mdash;is that we have been, as a result of various policies and strategies last year, pushing employment under different <Col N="587" /> headings&mdash;the IDA, special youth employment schemes, the temporary employment scheme in the Department of Education, AnCO schemes and so on. I read the report recently issued by the National Youth Council of Ireland.  It indicates that maybe some co-ordination might be helpful in relation to all these projects.  Most of us want to see things tidy.  I do not care about things being tidy if the targets are met and the objectives are achieved, in other words, effectiveness rather than efficiency.  At the same time, maybe there is something in it and that some form of co-ordination of that effort is required, particularly given that maybe the youth employment operation at this stage is not as effective as we would like it to be.  Maybe the IDA, because they have so much expertise in this area, might take a look at it.</P>
    <P>I was jotting down a few figures under the heading of the temporary employment scheme regarding which I have been concerned in the inner city.  There was £50,000 of support from the Department of Education for various youth employment projects involving rebuilding youth centres, community centres and getting small furniture shops going to repair broken down furniture and sell it at a higher price.  The kind of money is only £16,000, £4,000, £6,000 per project, but it is very meaningful and it works.  It gets people interested in something that they can see as their own.  Maybe some of those projects are not getting enough recognition or attention. Something I have also learned from that is that it takes time.  It is not something that will happen in six months.  It takes time for people to grasp that they can do things themselves and can produce products of that kind themselves and there is support for them.  I hope that next year these projects will really take off and instead of having a target of something like 400 jobs for a temporary employment scheme, we might have double or treble that amount.  The IDA could have a look at that given all the expertise that they have.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the apparent success of the entrepreneurial scheme <Col N="588" /> which the Minister outlined in his introduction. It is very encouraging to see that 19 projects, with a total job creation of 850, have already been approved for grant assistance.  I have been watching some of these and know some of the people who have decided to go into these projects, engineers who have so-called safe jobs in industry or in semi-State bodies who have that yen to do something themselves.  It is very good to see even 19 getting under way.  I hope that this is a natural lag in the beginning of a new scheme.  It will take time for people to get to know about it, make application and break with whatever job they are in.  I hope that it will be promoted a little more.  Perhaps the IDA would put a few extra pounds into its promotion.  I do not hear enough about their project identification unit at the moment.  Perhaps the project identification unit might go into partnership with the entrepreneur development unit.  If individuals with a yen to have a business of their own who are willing to back it with their courage and time knew of the existence of certain projects then one might be able to match a project with an individual.  Perhaps a marriage bureau is needed between the project identification and the entrepreneur development scheme.</P>
    <P>With those few critical but mostly supportive words, I would like to welcome this Bill and to wish the IDA all the best in spending the money that we support them with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If neither the private nor the public sector can provide the means whereby Irish industry can be extended and expanded and job opportunities created, then we cannot very well complain if the IDA attempt to tackle these objectives mainly through offering financial and other inducements to the multinationals.  Consequently I do not oppose this Bill.  Most sections of our community would much prefer to see Irish industry completely controlled and owned by Irish interests, despite the fact that it is acknowledged that the motivation for investment, whether by multinationals, foreigners or Irish citizens is much the same, profit, and I do not use that word in the narrow class context. <Col N="589" /> Of course, anybody who invests money in industry is entitled to a fair return but Irish interests, to give them their due, would have a deeper sympathy with Irish industrial conditions and with Irish workers than the multinationals.  This is borne out by recent happenings.  When all is said and done, the multinationals come in here&mdash;we do not complain about this&mdash;because they are offered financial and other concessions.  They set up a plant and employ Irish workers in the main.  They have their own way of doing things, and in the last analysis, if things go wrong or if they find that the profit motive is not coming to the fore quickly enough, they pull out.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to Ferenka. During the Ferenka dispute it was alleged that Ferenka closed as a result of an inter-union dispute.  Subsequent events, especially the court proceedings, proved conclusively that Ferenka were pulling out anyway because of the financial position of the company.  If Irish interests had been involved in Ferenka I doubt very much that the company would have closed down because the Government, the IDA and other interests would be concerned about the closing down of such an industry and the disemployment of hundreds of workers.  Of course the best solution to this problem is not a battle between Irish investors or multinational investors, but the concept of the State taking over certain industries and expanding its sphere of influence in industrial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short while ago we had here a debate about Irish air companies, and while there were some differences of opinion on certain matters relating to that Bill, everybody agreed that our air companies have done a tremendous job through the years and should be congratulated. The same can be said about Bord na Mona, CIE, the Irish Sugar Company, Erin Foods and all the Irish State and semi-State bodies.  There are very talented people working there in administration. There are very good and productive workers.  Yet time and time again, the Government have refused to set up what the trade union movement would call a national development authority whereby they would be concerned at the expansion and extension of <Col N="590" /> industry in the public sector.  We feel, and many people agree, that our industrial problems and the expansion of industry in our country can be solved only by a much greater input by the State than exists at the moment.  Many problems will be solved, not through the multinationals or private interests in Ireland but through State Governmental decisions.  I suggest that the Minister should have another look at the possibility of creating a national industrial development authority which would examine the possibility and desirability of the State expanding and extending industry and job opportunities through the existing State and semi-State companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I am delighted to see that the limits for the capital side of the IDA'S enterprise and their grant-aid side have been increased. There is no doubt that in today's society the amount of money that is needed to start off a business is huge.  I do not feel at present that the IDA should be constricted by reason of the fact that they have not the proper facilities that they need in any particular case.  There has been a raising from £850,000 to £1.25 million in the case of loans which may be given without consulting the Government.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connaughton when he said that not enough use is being made of our own raw materials.  He instanced peat in the west.  One of our problems is that we have a raw material which is not being utilised to its fullest and, because of this, many jobs are being lost.  I refer to leather.  It is an offshoot of one of our most important industries, the cattle industry, which is allied to the agriculture business but which is also allied to the shoe industry.  We can produce the best leather in the world, yet we have a situation where this year more shoes will be imported than would fit every man, woman and child in the country with some left over.  That is a fact.  More shoes were imported than the population of the country this year, and that is a shame.  We are able to produce some of the best leather wear in the world and yet we have a situation where people are losing jobs daily in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> There is very little we can do, with regard to the EEC countries, to safeguard the jobs in this industry.  It is very hard to prove, if 30,000 pairs of shoes come in from England, that they are being dumped here and are being sold off by a subsidiary of an English shoe company before anybody has even copped on to the fact that they have come in.  Thirty thousand pairs of children's shoes came in this year and were sold before anybody copped on to the fact that they had come in.  They were dumped in here.  There is no question about that.  We can do something about imports of shoes from countries outside the EEC.  We should be doing what is done in other countries in which leather is an important by-product.</P>
    <P>Mexico has an advantage over us on the North American market, which is a very important market for Irish shoe manufacturers.  In Canada, up to this year, we had nearly 75 per cent of the market for men's shoes.  This is in jeopardy at present because of the Mexican dollar being tied to the US dollar. We are at a disadvantage in monetary terms.  Apart from the disadvantage we have in monetary terms, there is a disadvantage in the sense that Mexico will not allow one pair of shoes to be imported into Mexico.  They will not allow one piece of leather to be imported and they give tax allowances to their exporters. This leaves the Irish shoe manufacturer in a very bad position.  I know this because of the shoe industry based in Kilkenny.  I know that they have done a tremendous job on the export field.  They are probably one of the leading shoe exporters in the world.  The quality of their shoes is unbelievable and they are quite reasonable by any standard.  If we are going to operate in the world market let us try and operate on equal terms.  Let us stop the importation of shoes from outside the EEC countries where possible&mdash;it may not be possible.  If you want to send a pair of shoes into Taiwan you pay 90 per cent duty to get them in. Why can we not do the same with countries outside the EEC area?</P>
    <P>Argentina is another big manufacturing leather producing country.  Argentenian <Col N="592" /> leather comes in here and the exporter of that leather gets a premium on his exports from his Government.  He sends partly or fully finished shoes.  He gets a better tax concession for the fully finished shoes than for the partly finished shoes or the leather, but still the concessions are there.</P>
    <P>We must control imports in the leather and shoes industry.  Jobs are being lost daily.  The IDA need not get very involved in this if we put controls on. Possibly the Irish shoe manufacturers should be the ones to control the importation of shoes.  If they were, they would know the price at which the shoe was coming in, they would know where it was coming from and they would know the numbers.  In these three ways they would be well able to compete.  They would know the price and they would know whether they were being dumped or whether they were coming in under normal conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the IDA and, if we are discussing the IDA, the IDA'S job is to produce jobs for this country and the loss of jobs is something that the IDA should be very interested in.  For every job lost it costs this country a hell of a lot of money to reproduce it.  If we can produce jobs by controlling imports it is relevant to the Bill that we are discussing.</P>
      <P>A point was made about regional development organisations, county development teams and the small industry division of the IDA not working in cohesion.  There might be a lot of effort lost and the results of these efforts might not be too good because of the lack of cohesion.  The idea of setting up the regional development offices was a very good one but sometimes they can be used by the people as political platforms for themselves rather than places to extend the value of their own region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed that small is good and I am very interested in small industries.  We can get hung on the <Col N="593" /> major industry, but the backbone of this country, through the years, has been on the small industry, whether on the farm, in the workshop or in manufacturing. The small industry is one part of the industrial sector which has maintained its level of employment and has increased it.  In some cases it has increased it by 100 per cent by one worker to one.  It has increased it by 50 per cent by one to two.  When somebody can produce 200 extra jobs in a major industry in which there are 4,000, it is supposed to be a marvellous thing, but the jump from one to two is the hardest for the Irish businessman.  We should be giving the Irish small business man a lot more help than we are at present.  The man who is working in his own backyard workshop is providing a service for his own area. He will never be out of work because, if bicycles go out of fashion, he will repair fuel pumps; if fuel pumps go out of fashion, he will change again.  He will not be unemployed.</P>
    <P>In country areas, the Government should be helping the IDA by giving that sector of the industry which is not being helped at present a helping hand and, that is, the backup industry&mdash;the small country workshop without which the farmers could not remain in business because they do not stop work at 6 o'clock in the evening or at 12 o'clock at night.  They keep working while there is work to be done, whereas the big factory will close down at 6 o'clock, everybody goes home and nobody worries too much about it.</P>
    <P>The service industries are totally inadequately supplied with capital in terms of grants which are available to manufacturing industries.  They are also totally inadequately supplied with tax concessions.  These are the industries which, throughout the years, have provided the bulk of the jobs in this country.  We must have manufacturing industries and large scale industries, but we must look after the small ones.  The Kilkenny Design Workshops were viewed with a degree of scepticism by the locals but now we have a number of very small industries set up right throughout County Kilkenny and they are very high quality craft industries. They are providing jobs in small villages <Col N="594" /> in country areas.  Not alone are they providing jobs but they are training people in crafts which possibly would have been lost but for the setting up of the design board services.</P>
    <P>Have the IDA given enough thought to the use and the value of Irish emigrants in their search for jobs?  Often the IDA people when they go abroad tend to move in circles far removed from the bulk of our Irish emigrants.  They tend to move in the bigger industrial sectors. They do not move where the Irish are, in my opinion.  I just saw a case in point recently where a very small industry involved in seamless guttering in County Kilkenny was set up by two boys who came back from the United States.  They have two brothers in the United States who are helping them in their work here.  They are helping them in the supply of material.  They have now set up another company in England and they are sending material that is manufactured in County Kilkenny to England.  The people who are importing into England are people who had emigrated from Kilkenny to Japan. There are many instances where use could be made by the IDA of the fantastic energy and expertise of our Irish emigrants.  I hope that I am wrong when I say that I feel that our IDA representatives tend to go too much for the foreign person abroad&mdash;the native Americans rather than the Irish Americans, or the native British rather than the Irish in Britain or the native Canadian rather than the Irish Canadian. Similarly all over the world there is an untold wealth of expertise and energy to be tapped in these areas.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many people in this Chamber have heard of the product identification unit.  The first time that I saw it was when I happened to get the IDA monthly report.  I noticed they had a small little paragraph in which the product identification unit was mentioned and it was stated that they had given a grant of £250,000 to a firm in Dublin to set up a manufacturing unit for a product that was already being manufactured in County Kilkenny.  The firm in County Kilkenny was trying to get the money from them to increase their employment content, and here on <Col N="595" /> the other hand there was a product identification unit giving a grant to an English company to go into competition with an Irish company.  If the product identification unit is going to keep its identification to itself or to a select group it is not identifying, not doing the job for which it was set up.  Why is there not an advertisement in the business magazines? I have not yet seen an advertisiment in business magazines from the product identification group.  There are only two, I think, <i>Irish Business</i> and <i>Business and Finance</i>, and I have not seen any advertisement in those magazines that there is a product that has been identified that could be manufactured in Ireland and that there was potential in inviting people to come along and let them know it could be manufactured.  That unit must bear looking into.  I hope I am wrong in what I am saying: I am only giving my personal opinion on this.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Mulcahy mention the productivity of the Irish worker.  Too often we hear that the Irish worker is not productive.  If you give the Irish worker the tools he will do the job.  Too often when we hear complaints about productivity we are talking about people working in conditions that are not conducive to productivity and working with machinery which is possibly totally obsolete.  If you work with totally obsolete machinery you cannot be productive.  On this question I spoke to the German Ambassador and he said that after touring the German factories in Ireland he found that the productivity level in the general factories in Ireland was much higher than in any similar factories in the German area.  The facts are that we will and can produce if we get the machinery to do it.</P>
    <P>Since we are talking about jobs&mdash;and that is what the IDA are there for, the production of jobs&mdash;the loss of jobs worries me.  One of the causes of loss of jobs in manufacturing industry and in shops all over the country at present is the advent of roadside traders who swoop in on a town, a village or a city and in two days are gone.  You have very prominent people throughout the <Col N="596" /> country renting dancehalls, hotels and large buildings to groups who are coming in and advertising cut-price goods, whether it be porcelain, leather jackets, electrical goods or whatever it is.  They are using these halls to sell goods at what seem to be cheaper prices than are available in the market places.  There is no way in which they can be tested for quality: nobody knows where they are coming from and they are creating a job loss situation throughout the country.  It is estimated that every week £25,000 goes out of Kilkenny to these people. The public think they are getting bargains.  They may be getting bargains in the short term but when the husbands of some of these wives lose their jobs because of the fact that they are using these roadside traders then the penny may start dropping.  The sooner that legislation is brought in to deal with this matter the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and sincerely hope that with the extra amount of money that is being provided through the IDA our job creation problems will be solved, because if not we are all in trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill.  We are all aware of the part that the Industrial Development Authority have played in the industrial development of the country down the years.  We are conscious of that and we wish the authority well in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The vast sums of money to be made available to the Industrial Development Authority should mean that we would be given a much more comprehensive account of the working of the authority since they were established.  There have been some great successes and there have been some failures.  I thought that the Minister's statement would have been more comprehensive in that regard. Seeing that so much public money is involved and seeing to what extent our plans for the future depend on the success of the Industrial Development Authority, we have reached the stage when we need a much deeper, more comprehensive and analytical examination of the activities of the authority down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had reference to the number <Col N="597" /> of jobs created during the year, and I compliment the authority on that. Against that success we must take the figure of redundancies.  We should be in a position to examine whether these redundancies were due, in the first instance, to industries having been supported by an IDA grant, industries which even at the time of being set up here did not appear to be viable.  We know the cases of textile industries established in various parts of the country&mdash;many of these have closed down.  At the time they were established it was obvious, because of the trends and difficulties in countries that had a long tradition and a lot of expertise in this field, that there was not a bright future for that industry here.</P>
    <P>These things have happened in the past, and we should be given an opportunity of examining them so that we would know exactly the rate of success in particular fields and the rate of failure in other fields.  We should know when these redundancies are due to inadequate management, labour troubles and to what extent, they are due to obsolete machinery.  Were there any cases of redundancies or closures because the particular industry had difficulty in getting a grant to equip it with modern plant and machinery?  These are all matters that should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn from the Minister's statement of the success that has attended domestic industry.  It was felt at all times by a big number of people that in cases where an industry had been established here for a long time and had its roots in the country, where the management and the workers had proved their worth, the IDA should willingly help such an industry when it required further expansion.  I am glad to see that particular activity is successful and I hope that the figures relating to it will be an inducement to the IDA to devote more attention to the further development of industries of that kind, industries that have proved their worth in various fields, and industries that are rooted in the area with management and work force taking pride in their work and their achievement and whose hopes are built on further expansion.</P>
    <P>It is true, too, that we want greater co-operation <Col N="598" /> between local authorities and the IDA with regard to the road network.  In some areas there is great difficulty in having industry established because of inadequate roads.  In Killeshandra, where two of the most flourishing industries in the country are based, the road from Cavan town to Killeshandra is in such a bad state that it is an added cost on the industries there. There are many areas like that, but this is especially true of parts of the country not served by the railway.  There should be greater co-operation between the Department of the Environment, local authorities and the IDA regarding that matter.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that the regional development organisations which have done much useful work in assessing the capabilities and potential of industrial development in an area will not find their work restricted because of the lack of financial support from the Government.  I am a member of the North-Eastern Regional Development Organisation and we have found from time to time that much useful work that could be done with a view to preparing the way for further in-dustrialisation of that area has to be greatly curtailed because of shortage of cash.  The local authorities make their contribution and a further contribution is made from the Exchequer.  Unfortunately that has been so meagre in the past that these organisations cannot make the contribution towards our development and towards assisting the IDA that they would otherwise do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Our national development programme is based on a plan to create the maximum number of jobs.  All of these jobs will have to be created by the establishment of new industries or in the extension and improvement of existing industries.  Any Bill which strengthens the resources of the agency responsible for this task at national level is to be welcomed.  For this reason I join with the previous speakers in welcoming the Bill.  This is the second piece of legislation within 12 months to come before the Dáil and Seanad which strengthens the power of the IDA and increases its flexibility in dealing with <Col N="599" /> one of our most pressing national problems.  It is an indication of the Government's concern in this particular area, and it is an indication of their determination to come to grips with the problem.  It is also an indication of the Government's confidence in the agency which has been established, the IDA, to implement our national industrial development programme.</P>
      <P>It is important that as much of our available resources as possible are channelled into this area of productive investment. If we are to make any real progress with national development our efforts must be in the area of production. The greatest amount possible of our national resources will in future have to be channelled into production.  I believe that job creation, desirable and all as it is&mdash;and there is nobody in this country who would question the desirability of increasing jobs at the present time&mdash;for the sake of job creation alone, while it may be correct in the short-term, is not sufficient.  In the long term job creation will have to be based on production, because that is the foundation on which the economy will have to be built if we are to make any real progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often I am disappointed when I see people in influencial positions making references to and very often encouraging and inciting situations at national level, which is not in the best national interest.  References have been made here in this debate already to the very unfortunate labour relation situation which exists at present.  I do not think anybody in a responsible position in the Dáil or Seanad would want to say anything that would aggravate such a situation.  We have a position where those of us who are interested in national development must at least make a passing reference to this unsatisfactory situation. We are all serious in our attempts, and the Government are serious in their attempt; no doubt the Opposition parties are serious in their attempts to create jobs.  We are doing our best to encourage foreign industrialists to come into the country but any foreign industrialist, looking at the labour situation at present would not be very encouraged <Col N="600" /> by what they would see.  For this reason I believe that in this area the future is very much in our hands; we must make a responsible decision as to whether or not we are going to play the game as far as our overall national development is concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe a Chathaoirleach, that the establishment of new industries is something that is vitally important for us, and this point has been stressed by previous speakers.  In the early days of the establishment of the new industry there is an urgency and a need for a certain amount of flexibility; a certain amount of give and take, both from the point of view of management and from the point of view of workers.  The new industry needs to be nursed in its early years if it is to get the opportunity that it needs and deserves to get off the ground. For this reason all concerned&mdash;Government, trade unions, workers and management&mdash;need to have a commitment to ensure the success of our industrial programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to a situation which may not be directly concerned with the Bill before the House but which is one of vital concern as far as the proucts of Irish industries are concerned, and this is an area in which the Minister of State himself has taken a particular interest.  It is sad to go into some of the large stores in this city at present or to go into any of the chains of super-stores throughout the country and to find that some of them are stocking exclusively imported products.  Perhaps unconsciously they are doing this, but if they have any sense of national commitment at all they should recognise the fact that the more goods we import and put on our shelves in our supermarkets and shops for sale the more we are reducing the demand for the produce of our own Irish labour force and we are in the long term contributing to the very serious unemployment situation which we have at present.  It is short-sighted on the part of these stores to embark on such a programme.  While they might be benefiting in the short term they are in the long term undermining our efforts here to create jobs and I believe they are, to a certain extent, undermining the <Col N="601" /> progress of the industries in which they themselves are interested.</P>
    <P>Many foreign industrialists are exploiting the efforts of our &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign here.  I may quote, even by way of a lighthearted approach, something which happened to myself just a week ago: I went into a shop to buy a suit of clothes, and because I am conscious of the need to buy Irish goods and perhaps because I am conscious of the fact that I am a Member of the Oireachtas&mdash;and I certainly feel that Members of the Oireachtas should at all times set a good example&mdash;I looked quickly at the brand inside the coat and I saw the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and that left me happy enough.  I bought the suit, took it home, and when I went to put it on I discovered that there was another label on the pants which stated that the suit had been manufactured from good English yarn in Britain.  I had another look at the coat to see what had gone wrong and found that the label said the suit had been designed in Ireland.  I immediately conjured up the picture of somebody at a drawing board drawing a suit, and that was the total input of labour as far as Irish workers were concerned into the manufacture of my suit.  This is a dishonest approach on the part of some foreign clothing manufacturer who is conscious of our desire to buy the produce of Irish labour and who wanted to cash in on the situation by, in my opinion, misleading the Irish shopper who went into the shop.</P>
    <P>Due to the efforts of the Irish Goods Council many people are now more conscious than ever they were before of the need to buy Irish.  I would like to emphasise the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo; because due to the efforts of the Irish Goods Council and due to the introduction of the now easily recognisable Irish goods slogan, Irish purchasers can readily recognise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I fear the Senator is wandering from the Bill.  However, he has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I am, but the point I am making is that if we are to expand Irish industries, if we are to give employment to Irish workers, we will <Col N="602" /> have to become more conscious of the need to buy the products which they are producing.  It is in that context that I refer to it.</P>
      <P>No matter how much money we put into job creation, no matter how hard the Minister and the IDA may work in relation to the establishment of new industries, it will all be in vain if there is not a commitment on our part to make the programme work.  I see it as being the challenge which is facing the country, and it is in our hands as to whether we accept this challenge or whether we allow the clock to be put backwards in relation to our much needed industrial development programme. Much credit has been given to the IDA for their success, and there is no question about it this credit is very well deserved indeed.  Their record is there and their members are becoming more expert in relation to the tackling of the industrial development problem.  They are certainly very courteous and very approachable as far as local authorities and various development associations throughout the country are concerned. For this reason any credit that has been given to them is deserved and merited.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to note from the Minister's speech that the enterprise development programme, which was launched here inside the past 12 months, has been successful, resulting in the establishment of 19 new projects and the creation of 850 new jobs.  This bears out a view which I have personally held for a long time that we are not short of entrepreneurs provided the incentives and the encouragement are provided for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made by previous speakers to the need to maintain the small industries in our small rural areas. I certainly think that the IDA should give more thought and more consideration and greater encouragement to these small industries.  I say this particularly in relation to the so-called sensitive industries. Reference has been made to concrete products, and I would like to include in that timber products as well. There are in every county projects which could be got off the ground and which would give local employment if some <Col N="603" /> form of financial incentives were provided for them.</P>
    <P>I have said that credit has been given to the IDA and I want to join in those tributes, but I want to be critical in one regard: I am not always happy in relation to the IDA's selection of areas for industrial projects.  I say this particularly in reference to my county of Laois, where we have not got what I would consider our fair share of the projects which have been established all over this country by the IDA in recent years.  I can never understand why a town like Portlaoise, situated as it is on two major road networks, Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick, and which has one of the best possible industrial sites provided by the local authority has not attracted a major industry.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to and say thanks to the Minister and the IDA for the fact that we have now been allocated one of the advance factories.  From our point of view this is particularly welcome, but I do not see any real intent on the part of the IDA to locate in Portlaoise a major industry.  When I refer to a major industry, I mean an industry capable of employing 700, 800 or 900 people; an industry similar to the industries which have recently been established in Newbridge such as the Polaroid industry, or the one recently established in Kilkenny.  I want to state quite clearly that I have no objection to the industries which are being located in either of these two areas.  But, Laois is one of the most underdeveloped counties in the country; facts and figures are there to bear out my case.  It is interesting to note that the countries designated as underdeveloped a few years ago have a higher income per capita now than the County of Laois.</P>
    <P>Many Senator colleagues listening to me, who drive rather quickly through the town of Portlaoise, may find it strange that I have to stand up here and make a statement to this effect.  That is the reality of the situation.  Despite the best efforts of Laois County Council and our county development team we have not attracted the kind of industries which <Col N="604" /> other areas have attracted.  I wonder what these other areas have got that we have not got and in which they have been so successful.  If political muscle has been responsible for the progress in other areas we, in Laois, are now fast developing that political muscle.  The people of Laois have been very patient in relation to the industrial neglect of their county, but I do not think they will be patient much longer.  For this reason I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the case recently presented on three occasions to the IDA in relation to industrial development in that county.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another area of potential development as far as Laois, and perhaps part of Kilkenny, are concerned. Previous speakers referred to the need and the urgency to develop peat products and our boglands.  I want to refer to another area of energy or fuel resource, that is, the coal deposits which we have in what is generally known as the Leinster coalfield area which takes in part of Counties Kilkenny and Laois.  The Minister has in his Department a report which is not credible or reliable as far as the projected resources of the Leinster coalfield is concerned.  Quite recently I accepted an invitation by a small group of workers in the Crettyard area of County Laois to see an operation there, when, at their own expense they bored or dug a shaft down to an extent of 50 feet.  At 50 feet I saw they were mining a coal resource far in excess of that contained in the survey the Minister has in his Department in relation to the resources of that area, far in excess of the findings of that report.  They have proven beyond a shadow of doubt&mdash;with the high cost of energy at present&mdash;that it is an economic proposition, even from their point of view with very make-shift equipment, to mine and bring to the surface quantities of coal lying beneath the ground in that area.  This is an area at which the IDA, the Minister and the Government should take a serious look.  We are not asking anybody to take a shot in the dark because these people have proven that it is not necessary to do so.  They did so at their own expense.  Great credit is due to them.  Some of them were unemployed <Col N="605" /> and they availed of their unemployment to endeavour to prove what they believed, because they had worked for years in those coalmines.  They never accepted that coal resources did not exist there.  Rather they embarked on that project which has been unquestionably successful.  I urge the Minister to take a special interest in this development to ascertain whether, even through small grant assistance, these mines could be reopened even on a small scale from the point of view of providing local employment not to speak about the value of the fuel resource itself.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Bill.  I wish the IDA every success in their campaign for industrial development in the future.  I hope the next time I speak here in relation to the Industrial Development Authority I will be able to give them credit for having corrected the imbalance as far as my own county of Laois is concerned from an industrial point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long in regard to this matter of industrial activity on the part of the Industrial Development Authority.  In the recent past it appears that the Industrial Development Authority introduced a grant system and involved themselves in some commitment to industries which did not get off the ground successfully, which they had seen, over a number of years, to require further injections and into which they had reason to inject money for the purpose of maintaining employment.  With hindsight it appears that the Industrial Development Authority had been reluctant to grant aid to industries which have since proved to be capable of expansion and of producing a higher standard product.  I can bring the instances to which I refer to the notice of the IDA. Proof that the claims made by the promoters were genuine when they asked for grant aids and were refused still remains to be seen.  When an industry is seen not to get off the ground, when a party or firm with more expertise comes on the scene and injects its finance, such an industry should be grant-aided, even after two or three years of independent existence.  If proof <Col N="606" /> of such a case is sought I can give it to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In my county of Longford two major industries were sited there within the last two years since the initiation of the programme.  This will have the effect of creating considerable employment.  The circumstances of employment in Longford seem to be enhanced because there are good labour and management relations in regard to the operation of other industries at present, and, indeed, there have been such relations in the distant as well as the recent past.  The reality of the success of industries must be accepted as lying in fair production, fair recognition by management and a humane approach in regard to the fact that whatever is produced must bear a relationship to what is paid, and the other way round; that not more can be expected by way of payment to the producer or the employee than that which carries fair recognition of profit to the industrialist who puts his money into it.  I am happy to say that this sort of circumstance is recognised between the unions and industrialists in my county.  It is one of the greatest incentives to attracting industry into any area.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the Industrial Development Authority give grants proportionate to and in relation to the application of a production scheme that would enable workers to see that the more they did the better they were paid and that that, in turn, would reap greater profit for workers, industrialists and management.  That is the key to success in industry here.  If the IDA have difficulties&mdash;and I am sure it is not unfair to say that they have&mdash;in various parts of the country, very often it can be traced to unfair approaches in regard to either the amount expected by way of production in recompense for work done, or vice versa.  It is important that, as a nation, we learn the lesson that whatever is put into an effort must be respected and paid for, and that whatever comes out of it should not be begrudged to the people who had the genius and ability to create such employment and the opportunity to produce the particular goods involved.  This is an aspect of our life here that has proved, in part, our greatest difficulty in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> The Industrial Development Authority give grants to people who have presented a good case.  Such cases have been grant aided for industries with a potential which the IDA feel is proper. If the IDA do not give such grants, there is the CDC who are prepared to give a grant to somebody setting up an industry not grant-aided by the IDA.</P>
    <P>In the matter of cluster factories, mentioned here, it is difficult to see to what extent one can reconcile the provision of accommodation in a cluster factory for a firm or a person who is grant-aided and entitled to get floor space at a certain price, with the case of somebody else doing it the other way who will be provided with such a different rate.  This reconciliation as far as local authorities are concerned should be looked at by the Minister.  We should not have two sets of circumstances or anomalies in relation to the same matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I want to assure the Minister that whatever help and aid the IDA and he, as Minister, can give to industry in my county always will be welcomed.  I welcome also the major industries now being established there.  I hope that equal and perhaps larger industries will follow them in County Longford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to the Members of the Seanad who have contributed and to thank them also for the very warm welcome they have given to the Bill.  The welcome is reflected in that passage of my introductory remarks which referred to the fact that the IDA this year will exceed, by a significant margin, its job approvals target of 27,000 for 1978.  This is something that is obviously seen and been welcomed not only in the Seanad and Dáil but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The Senators who contributed made wide-ranging points.  I shall try to cover as many of them as possible in the time at my disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised by Senator Connaughton of the importance, when <Col N="608" /> attracting foreign investment, of ensuring that it is soundly based, that the factory will be suitable to the Irish climate and to our labour climate generally.  This has always been one of the cornerstones of the IDA's approach to potential foreign investors.  I can assure Senator Connaughton that the IDA are very conscious of the need and do also examine very carefully any project suggested for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned also the question of suitable assistance to Irish industrialists. This assistance can be seen to be granted by the fact that over 50 per cent of the IDA's job approvals for last year were in home-based industry.  Surely this is proof that the IDA consider domestic operators so important.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of greater efforts throughout the world are concerned, the IDA, over the years, have expanded their chain of offices and are prepared continually to further expand it if the need arises.  It is not merely a question of siting an office in a particular city.  I know from my experience of travelling with the IDA on a number of promotional tours and from the amount of promotional work undertaken by the Minister on behalf of the IDA that it is not just a question of siting in a city; the whole world is the market place of the IDA and they take advantage of that market place.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton, together with a number of other Senators, mentioned the industrial relations problem here.  I do not want to dwell at any great length on it here.  But it would be wrong to get the industrial relations problem out of context. In regard to foreign-based companies here, the record in subsidiaries of overseas firms in Ireland has been very good.  The vast majority of foreign industrialists who set up here have never had a strike.  That is not to say that there is not a problem.  I could do no better than to quote the Minister in his reply on the Second Stage debate in the Dáil when he said at columns 207 and 208 of the Official Report of 29 November 1978:</P>
    <P>Therefore it seems to me that when we have the opportunity, as we had today, to solve one of our greatest <Col N="609" /> national problems we are a very foolish and shortsighted people if we do not avail of the opportunity, if we do not so regulate our affairs that the chance that we have will not be thrown away.  If we throw away that chance by selfish or petty action on the part too often of small numbers of people for what too often would seem comparatively slight reasons, we will have a great deal to answer for to the up and coming generation.</P>
    <P>This puts in context the problems of industrial relations, how people must face their own consciences in any industrial dispute and how they approach it.</P>
    <P>As far as the good economic climate in the country is concerned, this Government were elected on a promise to improve the climate for industry, improving the situation, providing a climate for industry and for entrepreneurs generally to expand.  Again through the figures of the IDA's approvals this year it can be seen that this climate has been created.  I am very happy with the situation of IDA approvals for the year; it proves the type of economic climate that obtains.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton also, together with a number of other Senators, mentioned the whole question of raw materials.  For example Senator Lanigan mentioned the leather industry.  I was glad that the materials were expanded, not just from mining, because so often debate on raw materials gets caught up merely in the mining sphere. There are many other raw materials&mdash;grass and so on; also coal and peat&mdash;where there is potential for expansion.</P>
    <P>If I might mention the leather industry, I agree totally with Senator Lanigan on his remarks about the need for an expanded leather industry here.  I should like to expand somewhat on the problems we face in the leather industry at present referred to by Senator Lanigan, that is those created by the actions of other governments, in particular in South and Middle America.  Irish Leathers Limited have announced the proposed lay-off of about 400 workers because of problems created by the ban on the export of hides from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and the subsidy <Col N="610" /> being paid by these governments to their tanning industries.  The Government here have been very active at EEC level, to ensure that this unfair competition will be met by countervailing duties, by endeavouring to get the governments of the countries I have just mentioned to remove unfair subsidies and the unfair competition created for our leather industry. Senator Lanigan can rest assured that we are well aware of the problem and that it is being tackled as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>With regard to the peat briquette factory mentioned by Senator Connaughton, I am not familiar with the exact state of play on this project in the Roscommon-Galway area but I will have it examined.  There is one thing that I would like to mention to Senator Connaughton&mdash;and perhaps for the information of other Senators also&mdash;I deduced from him that he seemed to be under the impression that the briquette factory would not get grant assistance from the IDA.  That is not so.  State companies are eligible for the full range of assistance available to private companies.</P>
    <P>The question of redundancies and of job maintenance arose.  It was raised by a number of Senators.  Senators Mulcahy, Lanigan and Hyland mentioned it.  It was introduced under a number of headings, under the Buy Irish campaign and so on.  I could not agree more with Senators that obviously it must be a priority not only to produce extra jobs, but to maintain and preserve those existing at present.  This is very much part of the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>The enterprise programme was mentioned also by a number of Senators.  I am delighted, as were they, that it has been such a success, that there are already 860 job approvals for this year from 19 projects.  As far as the availability of extra finance is concerned, this will be made available, as required.  The suggestion was made that the enterprise programme was merely a flash in the pan, that there would be many applicants in the first year but that subsequently would drop off.  Experience will prove that the opposite will be the case.</P>
    <P>As far as the concrete products and timber area are concerned with regard to the grant assistance policies of the IDA, <Col N="611" /> I will have the IDA contact directly the Senators who mentioned these points.</P>
    <P>I was very grateful for the welcome given by Senators to the advance and cluster factory programme.  This has been, and continues to be, one of our greatest incentives for attracting industry into the country.  One suggestion was made that the IDA were lucky to secure such a high occupancy rate in these advance factories.  I can assure Senator Connaughton that there is no luck involved: it is a lot of hard work put in by the IDA, by the officers of the IDA, by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, by the Government and by all other agencies involved; it is pure hard work.</P>
    <P>As far as co-operation between various authorities at regional and county development team level the IDA and so on is concerned this is a matter on which the Industrial Development Consortium have been working very successfully.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the fact that the Government were putting such considerable sums of money into our job target.  As the Senator rightly said, the Government were elected on a commitment with regard to jobs.  The Government are now involved in meeting this commitment.  That is what this Bill is all about.  Senator Mulcahy and Members of the Seanad generally can be assured that the Government will continue to make even more intensive efforts to see that this curse of unemployment is removed from the Irish scene.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy also mentioned that the multinationals must be welcomed in here.  Of course they must be welcomed. While we would like to see all of our employment being created at local level, the facts of the situation are different; it cannot be done.  By and large, the multinational companies that have come into this country have been of tremendous assistance to us, not just in the job situation but also in the increased technology they brought in, the training they have given to their workers and the spin-off effect in the supply industries to these multinationals.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy in particular mentioned <Col N="612" /> the problem of advance factories in the centre city area.  He welcomed the cluster going up in The Liberties.  I want to assure him that the IDA are committed to the construction of cluster units in the north inner city and are at present negotiating the purchase of a suitable site which has been identified in the area. Small industry is seen as having a special role to play in the development of the inner city because of the difficulty and the cost of obtaining large sites. Therefore, the Senator can be assured that the IDA are doing everything possible to bring this factory to the north central area as soon as possible.  It has been identified but has not been acquired as yet.</P>
    <P>With regard to the very disturbing information Senator Mulcahy gave the House about industrialists who will not even reply to applicants from centre city addresses who apply for jobs, I would use this forum to appeal to all industrialists and all employers not to continue this bad practice.  I have no doubt they will desist from this.  It is an appalling practice and I hope it will stop.</P>
    <P>The question of the productivity of Irish workers was mentioned by Senator Mulcahy and by a number of other Senators.  The fact that the IDA have been so successful over the years is due to the fact that the economy is thriving. It is not just a question of management. It is also a question of the productivity of the workers, and I welcome the comments made by Senators about the level of productivity.  This productivity, of course, can depend a great deal on good management and good equipment.  As to the question of competition to the IDA from other countries which have a similar type of operation to the IDA&mdash; most countries have this, even the most developed such as Germany and America and this is an ever-increasing problem.  The IDA have constantly to review their grant structure and the incentives they are providing.  I can assure Senator Mulcahy and the other Senators that the whole grant structure is under constant review.</P>
    <P>In regard to compartmentalisation of the job creation programme as between the IDA, youth projects, temporary employment projects, and so on, Senator <Col N="613" /> Mulcahy seemed to infer a certain lack of co-ordination.  I can assure the Senator that, on the contrary, there is total co-operation and co-ordination at the top in this whole matter.  He also mentioned the success of the enterprise scheme and I thank him for his comments on that.</P>
    <P>The project identification programme was referred to by Senator Mulcahy and also by Senator Lanigan.  The object of this programme is to channel through Irish firms spin-off opportunities from major new industries and opportunities for the manufacture of substitute products for existing imports.  As far as the spin-off from major new industries is concerned, it has not been necessary to advertise the possibilities as they have been identified.  The IDA's approach has been to make direct approaches to the Irish companies which are known to have expertise in the various areas in question and, as far as the import substitution is concerned, the Irish Goods Council have been very active in the import substitution programme for the spin-off industries.  A number of exhibitions have been held around the country. The AnCO exhibition was held last February.  There was a similar project in Shannon, another in Athlone, and there are to be two further projects, one in the Sligo area and one in Cork.  The whole question of project identification and import substitution is very much in hand.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy mentioned the question of a national development authority.  The Government in their election manifesto committed themselves to the setting up of an industrial development consortium, and one of the aims of the consortium was to co-ordinate the activities of the relevant State agencies in order to maximise the contribution of these agencies to industrial development. I know that the Congress of Trade Unions have made various representations to the Government at different departmental levels, including our own, but while the case has been made the need has not been accepted yet.  The co-ordination and other work now being undertaken by the industrial development consortium are really what the national development authority, as envisaged by the trade union movement, <Col N="614" /> would be involved in, and really by setting up a national development authority all you would be doing is setting up one more semi-State body further to complicate the co-ordination and co-operation system.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to national resources, the raw materials, and the leather industry and so on and I agree totally with Senator Lanigan here.  In regard to co-ordination between the regional development and the county development teams and the IDA this is something that is going on and, through the industrial development consortium, I hope this will improve even further.  I could not agree more with the Senator when he says that small industry is good.  This is a very important concept. The small industry is a very important sector of Irish industry generally and SFADCo have been given responsibility for a pilot project which is at present under way in the mid-west region.  They have been given this pilot project responsibility to encourage the development of small industry, and, while it is a pilot project in the mid-west region, it is hoped that on the results&mdash;and the results so far have been very encouraging&mdash;it will be extended on a nationwide basis.  Senator Lanigan can be assured that the Government are very conscious of the importance of small industry. A small industry, if it goes to the wall, will have an effective five, ten, 20 or 30 people out of employment, and the effect in an area will not be as great as it would be in one of the larger companies, for example Ferenka, where 1,400 people were put out of work with the appalling overall effect that has in an area.</P>
    <P>The ideal situation would be a nucleus of small industries but experience has shown that an economy will not work like that.  But the Senator can rest assured that the IDA and the Government are very anxious to help small industries to develop.</P>
    <P>The service industry side was mentioned by Senator Lanigan.  The IDA have a service industry programme, but it is aimed at services such as computer services, engineering design, and so on, and is mainly aimed at the export market.  The type of service industries which Senator Lanigan was speaking <Col N="615" /> about, garages and repair workshops, are not eligible for IDA grants at the moment.  However, if any such projects involve an increase in employment they would be eligible for assistance under the employment incentive scheme which comes under the Department of Labour. This would be for additional workers.</P>
    <P>I was glad Senator Lanigan mentioned the Kilkenny Design Workshop and the work being done there to help industry and, in particular, the fact that they have succeeded in having a spin-off effect in the setting up of small industries in the villages around Kilkenny, and I would take this opportunity to congratulate the Kilkenny Design Workshop on the tremendous work they are doing.  I am glad it is appreciated.</P>
    <P>As far as the IDA's programme abroad in contacting Irish emigrants who &ldquo;have made it&rdquo; abroad, I will bring this to the attention of the IDA.  I am sure they are already very conscious of it but I will bring it to their particular attention.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the work of the Irish Goods Council, and I appreciate the compliments paid to the work of the Goods Council.</P>
    <P>With regard to roadside traders and the use of halls for selling imported goods and the effect that is having on job losses, I could not agree more with Senator Lanigan on this, and the Government have approved the heads of a Bill designed to control roadside trading and, as an interim measure, I will be bringing in, I hope within a matter of a week to ten days, legislation on the type of trading that has been going on.</P>
    <P>A number of other points were made by other Senators about industries in their own areas.  I can assure the Senators that I will have every one of the matters mentioned examined by the Department and by the IDA.  They can rest assured that every one of the problems will be examined and attended to.  In so far as the case made by Senator Hyland about Laois is concerned, Laois has a very soft spot in my heart, because my mother was born in Laois.  Senator Hyland can rest assured that I will have <Col N="616" /> the case of Laois, in particular, examined fully.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make an order to preserve indefinitely the Viking site at Wood Quay, already designated a national monument, in view of the many other sites in Dublin available for civic offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been hanging over Dublin for many years now and I hope that I will be forgiven if I refer to the fact that four years ago on the 10 April 1974 I raised this issue on the Adjournment Debate in the Seanad during the life of the Coalition Government.  On that occasion I raised a number of the issues I wish to raise again tonight because most <Col N="617" /> of those issues have now achieved an even sharper and more dramatic focus than it was possible to attribute to them then.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the motion is framed is important.  We decided not to make it just a vague motion but to concentrate on one aspect which has bedevilled our entire deliberations on the subject.  We decided to concentrate on the fact that civic offices can be built anywhere in the city which is free and appropriate.  In the four years that have since passed more and more valuable artefacts and discoveries have come to light on the site but, during that period, despite a series of temporary preservation orders, I have seen no sign at all from the corporation, or from either of the Governments, of any search for an alternative site to the site on Wood Quay.  That is a very serious matter.  We have not even the slightest evidence that any research has been done into finding an alternative site.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter back in April 1974, for instance, the cattle market site was vacant.  It was then the most grievous eyesore on the north side of the city.  At that time there was a great deal of talk about the development of the north side of the city which, I think, everybody agrees has been severely neglected.  That site has very many things to recommend it.  The very environment of the North Circular Road beside the Phoenix Park, that whole area was admirably suited and it could not be objected to by the Corporation employees because there were all kinds of advantages, as Shakespeare put it, &ldquo;to walk abroad and recreate themselves&rdquo; at lunchtime&mdash;much better than anything down along Wood Quay and the increasingly polluted air of the centre of the city.  It also had the advantage of being easy of access.  One of the implications of the siting of the civic offices at Wood Quay, and it is only one of the implications, is that people who want to drive in and get their tax discs, or whichever registration documents they need, are going to have to drive right through peak city traffic.  The old place in Coleraine Street was bad enough but Wood Quay would be absurd.  One could, of <Col N="618" /> course, do it by post, but it seems motorists prefer to go in personally and in their cars.  An obvious answer to that is that civic offices are not necessarily happily centred just in one area.  Several of the functions of the corporation offices, or civic offices, are quite diverse. They are not interdependent and they could be skilfully sited around the city. In fact, siting them around the city could lead to rescuing from the wilderness many areas which have now become gapped and mutilated by random development.  It is impossible to drive through Mountjoy Square without weeping nowadays.  Could not the facades there be restored?  Could not some civic offices be located there instead of four massive monoliths where already you have single line traffic along the Liffey and instead of having these monoliths so situated as to block out a great deal of one of the most beautiful and prestigious cultural possessions we have in Dublin&mdash;that is, Christchurch standing there magnificently on the hill?  Instead of having these offices sited there, would it not have been better to have spent some of the time of the four years that have intervened looking elsewhere for a site?  I want to stress that because it is the nub of the question.  What happened was that the Corporation held out firmly.  I was going to say stubbornly, but I do not wish either to attribute goodwill or strike an acrimonious note; they are doing what they think is right just as, I presume, the Commissioners think what they were doing is right, the museum think what they were doing is right, the Minister thinks that what he is doing is right.  I am not trying to ascribe bad faith to anybody in the matter.  But one of the things that they have been doing is simply waiting, waiting with the inevitability of bureaucratic power knowing that one of these days they are going to build there and there is no point in anybody thinking that they are going to do anything else.  I find that deplorable. Even if one had some signs of research for an alternative site one would be a little consoled.  I want to quote from the Minister for Local Government in that speech when he replied to me.  He replied with some acerbity to me.  I did not mind that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I deserved it, but I am still unrepentant.  At column 961 of Volume 77 of the Seanad Reports he ended by saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should say, Sir, that while I would myself have preferred if the offices were sited elsewhere, nevertheless, I am a democrat and the unanimous democratic view of the Commissioners in Dublin is that the revised development should take place.  Although I agree that eminent people have claimed that there are priceless finds still on that site other eminent people have said that that is not so.  I am not competent to say which view is correct but I gave permission to Dublin Corporation to build their offices after the frustrating experience which they have had.  I would be happy if we had built elsewhere but the decision has been made.  While I agree it is important that people should be on the alert to see that more of Dublin's past is not destroyed, but the time for people to come forward is when it is threatened, not when final decisions have been taken.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That reads interestingly in the perspective of history.  There are several emphases which are very interesting First of all, he is saying that some people thought four years ago that there were no other valuable artifacts to be found there.  Subsequent excavation has made savage fun of that prediction.  Anybody who said that then is certainly rebuked by some of the priceless finds that have been made there, not just the artifacts but the uncovering of a priest, the uncovering of houses, all the wattle and walls, the uncovering of the old city wall which is still there, and still rather threatened&mdash;that is the wall in stone&mdash;the discovery of boats, coins, skeletons, weapons, adornments, implements, factories, comb factories, all the kinds of things that show what an extraordinary centre of European commerce and culture Dublin was in those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So strenuous has been the excavation, and here one has to praise the work of <Col N="620" /> the archeologist of the museum, and so impressive the findings, that no less a person than A.R. Duffty, the President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, had this to say as recently as the 16 November 1978:</P>
    <P>We are convinced that the importance of this site is sufficient to justify every effort that can be made to ensure that it is investigated as completely as possible and, if at all possible, preserved for posterity.  We are the more deeply concerned about it because the significance of the find altogether transcends national boundaries so that the site may truly be claimed as the key one for the history of Western Europe as a whole.  The loss of evidence resulting from premature redevelopment of the site would be a cultural disaster of major proportions and the cause for widespread and lasting regrets and bitterness for which those responsible would incur censure from many quarters.</P>
    <P>I just chose that one.  There are several eminent people who uphold that view. What is under threat is uniquely valuable.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to admit that there is need for offices.  I want to admit also that one of the most distressing features is the fact that there seems to be no movement on either side.  Even though that area of the site between Fishamble Street and Christchurch has been designated a national monument the only concession to that is that, as a national monument in so far as there can be recovery excavation from it, ultimately it is to be built on.  I am not sure that the whole four acre site in Wood Quay should be preserved as an archaeological site.  I have no dogmatic or inflexible views of that kind.  I would find it acceptable, if it were put forward, that perhaps in that area of the site which is along the Liffey, and away from the place of prime importance between Fishamble Street and the cathedral, low, maybe three-storey houses were put up, or even offices. If some of the civic offices were sited there, we would have grounds for relaxing the tensions which have surrounded the entire operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> The saddest thing I see about it is that there seems to be no sign of a compromise. The buildings have been moved around a little bit on the plans but, apart from that, it looks as if these monoliths are going to be planted.  It looks as if the Friends of Medieval Dublin, who have extraordinary following and immense influence and who are tremendously dedicated to their task, may end up in a confrontation of academics, students, citizens of Dublin, citizens of the area and the bulldozers.</P>
    <P>One of the most unseemly confrontations imaginable in a city's culture could take place there.  I am pleading with the Minister of State, his office and the Corporation for some attempt to be made to break the deadlock.  What would be the ideal situation?  What are the things that are precious there?  Any citizen of Dublin, any Member of this House, would say that while the site is there unexcavated it must, of course, be fully investigated. Even the Corporation would agree with that.  That having been done what do you do with the wall, with the embankments, with these wattle barriers and screens which are to be seen with such symmetry at the moment?  Nobody really would want to destroy that either. On the other hand, can you have a compromise? People would like to get a view of the city as well.  The desirable thing is to get the artefacts, the really important ones, out.  Secondly preserve the unique contours of the streets as they are as far as is possible to do it.  Also do not let slip the unique chance of having that marvellous view of Christchurch and, finally, build on part of the site because it is perfectly acceptable that that can be done.</P>
    <P>If discussions could begin to take place along those lines it is perfectly possible that many of these civic offices could be sited elsewhere.  That is what I am urging on the Seanad today, a suggestion that premature action here will do irreparable and absolutely final damage.  An aspect of the damage is of course very marked.  It is just not the visual site.  It is not just the immense historical importance.  It is not just the artifacts.  There is an environmental absurdity in siting offices which are going to be inhabited by 3,000 motorised public <Col N="622" /> servants in one place in the city.  The pollution in that area of the city will be disastrous and monstrous.  It was understandable 25 years ago, when this plan was first mooted, why then it could be seen to be a useful and valuable plan.  In the 25 years that have passed since the decision to design civic offices for Wood Quay many things have happened, not just the discovery of the cradle of the city but the discovery that developments in the centre of the city are turning it into a wasteland, the discovery that at night, because people are no longer living there, it is a haunt of all kinds of cutthroat vandals and juvenile terrorists.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest problems facing a city nowadays is pollution from cars, the one kind of pollution that is the hardest to deal with, the invisible pollution of the air which affects buildings and every aspect of our lives.  These arguments are sensible arguments.  I do not think this is an academic argument.  Is it too late to think again?  Deputy Tully's last remark was: &ldquo;The time for people to come forward is when it is threatened, not when final decisions have been taken&rdquo;.  If the correct decision had been taken four years ago, the civic offices would have been built now, and would have been built elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That site could become quite remarkable in Europe.  It could be laid out in a manner that could be immensely attractive.  The old stone wall is there and could be preserved.  A museum could be provided for the artifacts.  The argument will be put forward that most of this building is in wattle and in mud. &ldquo;You are really talking about impressions in mud&rdquo;, some people say, and others have described it as a hole in the ground.  The biggest enemy we have here is the tension of those bulldozers looming over us.  The excavation is being carried out in a sense of desperate rescue. There should be a preservation order made on it until everything is investigated. It has been said that, in our weather, if you expose wattle and mud and timber beams they will disintegrate. That is not true.  They can be impregnated with plastic.  There are all kinds of ways to do this.  This is the time to turn to the chemist and say, &ldquo;Show us <Col N="623" /> how this can be done&rdquo;.  Let us have the time to look at it to see what can be done with it.  We have the exemplary situation in Copenhagen where they discovered a famous ship which was underneath the sea.  It was a unique medieval ship.  It was in a perfect state of preservation but they realised that if they pulled it up and exposed it to the air it would crumple.  So they slowly raised it, bit by bit, and put it in a tank.  It is engaged in about a 20 years decompression process until, eventually, it will, by a miracle of modern science, be able to stand up to the air. All kinds of things can be done with these Viking buildings.  The time to investigate and work at them, the leisure at which scholars and scientists investigate them, is completely at hazard because of the hand to mouth temporary preservation orders that have been placed on the site since 1973.</P>
    <P>It is a national monument.  If it is attacked it will be the first time in history that a national monument has been destroyed.  The trouble about the entire site is that all the archaeological excavations that have been carried on there since 1969 have been rescue operations conducted in emergency conditions.  A lot of this is admirable and very well done.  The museum has done its job extremely well.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we should take a look at the whole archaeological implication and potential of the site. Everything from now on should be looked at in terms of a long term programme with plans and detailed research and proper consultation with experts.  If these investigations are carried on in that way it will not be something that will just be interesting for scholars, it will be something that can be exposed to the view of the citizenry.  In many other cities over ten years you can see archaeological excavations as they proceed.  People may go to view them. You have a public manifestation of research scholarship and archaeological insight going on as a continuing operation in front of the eyes of children, adults, visitors and natives.  All of the significant structures have to be preserved, if possible <i>in situ.</i>  There is not <Col N="624" /> time to do this properly and the haste which has surrounded the full operation has been disastrous so far.</P>
    <P>Consideration should now be given to the form which the permanent exhibition demanded by the importance of the site, would take for the cultural enrichment of the Irish people and for all visitors to the site.  Some kind of mixed presentation of significant features on the whole site, in a series of pavilions or open spaces against the background of continuing excavation is highly desirable.  There could be an archaeological park on the lines of a botanical garden.  Some of it can be preserved in the open air.  Some of it has to be preserved in glass cases indoors in museum conditions.</P>
    <P>If the long-term plan is evolved, if instead of just another temporary stay of execution or a decision to go in and build now, the interested parties could talk sensibly to each other and not in the manner of confrontation which has bedevilled the entire enterprise since it began, there is still time to do an immense amount of good.  That immense amount of good involves, first, the most obvious thing that everyone dearly wishes for, the view of the cathedral; secondly, an attractive park sweeping down to the edge of the Liffey; an attractive layout of buildings with a proper sense of proportion of building to building, building to square, something appropriate to the environment and the buildings in that old part of the city; an open park where continuing excavation can go on; an indoor pavilion or museum in which the artifacts can be exhibited; a series of carefully laid out walks and tours which will unite that part of the city with St. Patrick's and Trinity College&mdash;that whole cathedral area which could be an incomparable tourist attraction; a reprieve for that part of the city from a monstrous invasion by motor cars and a geometrically increasing pollution hazard.  These are all at stake and they are very big issues. Above all, one has to see this in terms of the city itself which used to be such a beautiful city, a seventh city of Christendom, and which, every year, is becoming more and more disgraced, multilated and more and more the prey to greed through ignorance or bad sense <Col N="625" /> and above all, hand to mouth planning. It is a total shame to our sense of our environment of the future and what we wish for our children.</P>
    <P>That great march on Wood Quay of 20,000 people was a very important demonstration and one which the Government would be very foolish to ignore. A lot of them were not academic or scholars but ordinary Dublin people who love their city.  A lot of them had very ordinary Dublin accents.  It marked the first real coming to consciousness of the citizens of the country to the importance of environmental things.  Things come slowly in the growth of the community consciousness.  You cannot expect people in the hungry forties, for instance, to have worried much about matters of this kind.  The generation that is growing up now think very deeply about matters of this kind.  Unless we want our children to think very ill of us, we should pause at this because this is really come-uppance.  If Wood Quay goes it will be a very symbolic destruction. I would hate to be the Minister of State responsible for it.  I am not blaming the Minister of State&mdash;these are Cabinet decisions and are obviously communally taken decisions.  There is joint responsibility. I deplore the great deal of personal abuse that has been hurled.  I hope none of that personal abuse will surface in this House during this debate.</P>
    <P>I would appeal in the strongest way to the Government to think very deeply before anything irrevocable is done with that Viking site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very honoured to second this motion.  Senator Martin covered a great deal so I will be very brief.  Just because the whole business of Wood Quay has become a <i>cause celebré</i> it should not be allowed to be made into any kind of a political football or made into a matter of somebody's pride or bad feeling or the subject of some kind of gamesmanship.  It is far too important for that.  The organisers of that march of 20,000 people on Saturday, 23 September, have no vested interest in Wood Quay except in the preservation of what they see as an extremely important part of Dublin.  As Senator Martin <Col N="626" /> has mentioned, it represents an extraordinary illumination of the origins of the city of Dublin; an extremely vivid and dramatic exposition of the life both commercial and domestic of that time.  It should be preserved <i>in situ</i> and put on permanent display.  I would like to remind the Government at this point&mdash;this Government which makes such an extremely strong case for the preservation of the Irish language&mdash;that they should remember that the Wood Quay question seems to many people to be of extreme importance, no less than making a big effort to preserve our language.</P>
      <P>The disquiet about Wood Quay's destruction started a considerably long time ago.  As early as 1968 there were letters appearing in the national press and in many people's minds they were filed under the letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; for crank. People persevered and in 1969 the Dublin Civic Group asked that the archaeological significance of the site should be taken into account for the competition for civic offices.  This is not a new feature, but the perseverance of a lot of people has meant that it has arrived in this House in the form of a debate.</P>
      <P>There is a very strong international aspect attached to this whole question also.  Senator Martin quoted from the most recent edition of the <i>International Express</i> who have supported this cause&mdash;A. R. Duffte of the Society of Antiquaries of London.  I have here a letter from Professor Evans, the President of the Institute of Archaeology, University of London, where he states:</P>
      <P>The illumination of the Viking occupation of Dublin is of special significance, not only for the history of Ireland, but for that of Europe as well.</P>
      <P>He also goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Given the obvious importance of the site and the degree of interest it has aroused internationally, it might well be possible to raise funds for the purpose of preserving that site.</P>
      <P>He stresses the fact that time is absolutely essential to investigate every aspect of this.  He finishes his letter by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" />&ldquo;It is part of the European heritage which should not be lightly sacrificed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was dated 17 November.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin mentioned the view which has been opened up now of Christchurch Cathedral.  It is one of the finest views in this city.  It is the kind of vista which we have been deprived of and which should not be obscured by what he describes as the four massive monoliths.  To put that kind of towered block between the people and that view would be the greatest imaginable folly. We have already destroyed too many Georgian vistas in our unthinking haste to develop.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State a few questions which I hope he might be able to reply to in his speech. What advice has he received from the Statutory Advisory Body which is the standing committee of the National Monuments Advisory Council regarding the Viking site at Wood Quay?  I would like to know the answer to that question. Will the old Viking earthen defence works, which are over 1,000 years old, now being dismantled, be reconstructed as is the practice across this country at Tara, Newgrange and Knowth?  This is the normal practice to reconstitute these walls.  Is it intended to build on the site of these earthen banks?  Will the Minister be giving a licence to the builders because, since the site is now a national monument, the builders must get a licence from the Minister to build on it?</P>
    <P>It would be one of the most beautiful and dramatic tourist attractions in Europe if we were to develop that site along the lines suggested by Senator Martin.  This question needs a great deal of study which certainly should not be undertaken with a threat of bulldozers behind it.  One group of consultants were asked to consider this as a tourist attraction and came up with the figure of £156,000 a year from tourist earnings from a properly developed site, with a museum on it.</P>
    <P>I want to give Senators from both sides of the House every opportunity to join in this debate, which is the most important <Col N="628" /> that I have heard in this House since I came here.  I would like to remind Senators that in the winter of 1969-70, a group of architectural students occupied some houses which were almost down in Hume Street and they were fed and supported by a great many people from Dublin city.  I am happy to say that I was one of the people who brought in Christmas pudding and so on on Christmas Day.  Despite quite severe physical threats and intimidation in the middle of the night quite frequently, the students won their case.  A very good compromise was made from an apparently immovable position.  In November of 1970&mdash;later that year&mdash;the ESB offices in Merrion Street were opened.  The students occupying Hume Street that previous Christmas realised that people in responsible places like the Oireachtas might behave again about Hume Street as they had behaved in 1963 when the decision was taken to tear down part of Merrion Street and create that dreadful eyesore which is in front of us every day&mdash;not a stone's throw from this House.</P>
    <P>There were 20,000 people who marched on 23 September.  It was a remarkable demonstration.  I would agree with Senator Martin that surely, in this year, we can avoid that kind of confrontation. The Government surely are sufficiently in touch with the people to realise that they will not have destruction of this site.  I wonder will Christmas 1978 see 20,000 Dublin people squatting in the wet and windy environs of Wood Quay.  Are we going to have that kind of ludicrous display in front of the eyes of Europe?  I sincerely hope not.</P>
    <P>I hope the Senators will support this motion and show their concern for the safety of the heritage which we are talking about.  A real debate can begin then in peace and with time about the future of Wood Quay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many well-intended and informed people who have spoken on the Wood Quay issue.  For the purpose of the misinformed I am going to speak here tonight.  I and every member of my party are concerned with our ancient past and in ensuring that the relics of the past are collected and displayed. <Col N="629" /> Listening to Senator Martin, one would think that the Corporation were comprised of a group of vandals who were out to destroy what remains of our ancient past.  What is needed in this debate is a balance of information, which does not seem to be forthcoming. The media over a period have been very biased in relation to the Wood Quay situation.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record, as a member of the Dublin Corporation for 22 years, my interest in Wood Quay.  I did not discover Wood Quay four years ago. Wood Quay was discovered 25 years ago by the Corporation when they set about examining the site at that particular stage.  They moved in and demolished all the derelict buildings in the area at that particular time when nobody else was interested.  They exposed to the public Christchurch in all its splendour.  If it had been another developer, what would have happened? He would have demolished, moved in and rebuilt.  But the Corporation were a responsible body, more responsible than Senator Martin or other people give them credit for, because the Dublin Corporation spelled out in no uncertain terms the archaeological potential 11 years ago in 1967.  They spelled it out at that time and in 1969 they invited the National Museum to carry out examinations. That was not just four years ago.</P>
      <P>The Corporation have been acting in a responsible way over the years in relation to this ancient monument.  During that period, the Corporation complied with every single request for the continuation of work on this site.  At no stage did the Corporation impede work on the site.  One would think, listening to the people who are concerned about Wood Quay in the last four years, that a group of vandals were endeavouring to destroy something, with no consideration at all for the area or for what has been recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation have made a decision to erect offices.  Following the competition and the protests they changed the design of the offices in order to ensure that one would get a substantial view of Christchurch that did not exist before the Corporation demolished the <Col N="630" /> derelict buildings on the site.  They indicated that they would design a museum of 10,000 square feet which is no small area, to contain all the interesting finds, the artifacts, models, maps, drawings and the old city wall. These will be retained in a museum so that every citizen will be able to visit and examine them in great depth and detail. The Corporation were very responsible in their approach to this whole problem. It is pathetic to hear people, who claim to have vast knowledge of this subject, unaware of what did happen over the past 20 years.  Dublin Corporation can be proud of the part they played.</P>
    <P>Another question is, why do we not move?  Senator Martin did make one suggestion: that they should move elsewhere.  Where is elsewhere?  Does he know the technical problems involved? What would happen if the Corporation decided to move tomorrow and there were greater finds on the site, having spent another 25 years acquiring the site, having the necessary forms drawn up for its development and then find that they could not build there either?  The protests will do one thing.  They will ensure that, in this ancient city of ours, built mostly on reclaimed land, any developer in the future who finds items of historical value, and maybe greater historical value than the items that were found on Wood Quay, will disregard the situation and get the bulldozers in because he will not want to be impeded. There are many responsible developers who, like Senator Martin and others, are concerned about our ancient past and the relics of the past.  But there are problems.  One of the problems is protests.  We are threatened with protests.  I do not like to hear threats of 20,000 people and academics versus bulldozers.  Common sense will prevail when people understand what exactly happened over the period and know who the responsible parties were.</P>
    <P>A new site would mean a new design, new tenders, new contracts, and there may well be other finds on the site.  The other factor is that there has been a cost to date in taxpayers' money of £3½ million plus an additional £2 million which has to be spent.  This is all taxpayers' money.  If we were to move from that <Col N="631" /> site there would be the additional cost of doing something with Wood Quay, and who would foot the bill?  The Corporation feel that their solution is the best. Senator Martin said only part of the site can be developed.  The Corporation indicated that only part of the site would be developed, that there would be an open space park and a museum and offices, leaving an opportunity in the open space to continue excavations in the hope of additional finds.  The space in which the new offices would be built is on the rock base that is there at the moment where there is no possibility of additional finds.</P>
    <P>The Corporation development is in accordance with what Senator Martin has indicated.  There is nothing else there.  It is on a rock base, and that is the situation of the development.  Again, to meet his request, he indicated he would be happy if the whole site was not covered.  The whole site will not be covered.  It will be landscaped as a park and will have within it the museum, as I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Everything of value so far has been recovered.  There is no indication that there is any other item of value on the site.  Nothing of value remains, we are told, unless it is put back, and we can indeed put it back as they did at Tara and elsewhere.  The Tara situation is a different situation.  The Tara situation is away out in the country.  As I said before, they will be building on bed rock, preserving for posterity what has been recovered.  The people are entitled to see what has been recovered in a museum of the dimensions indicated, which would be catering for the nation as a whole.  It must be remembered that, if it was not for the Corporation, it would not be available at all.  In the Corporation's efforts, they have made a substantial contribution to history.</P>
    <P>Other people indicate that York and the old Roman site in London are sites that have not been developed.  Those sites have been developed following excavations. It is nothing new that, following excavations where all the items have been taken from the site, development would take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> When we speak about another site in comparison with Wood Quay where is the other site?  There are other sites in the city.  There is a three-acre site but the engineering and technical problems may be immense.  They have not been examined. Senator Martin suggested that if we divided up the corporation offices over the city this would be all right.  If we were to say we should divide up the university complex all over the city he would be telling us we should keep them together.  There is a problem in relation to the functioning of an authority, whether it is a university or a corporation. We are the largest unit in the country.  We have the highest number of units of accommodation.  We have the roads and all the other services.  This is quite necessary.  As a member of the corporation for a number of years, I know the problems of the city managers in having to send to Mountjoy Square for one officer and sending to Jervis Street for another and to Capel Street for another and to Thomas Street for another.  If that is what Senator Martin thinks would add to efficiency, he must examine the situation from a quite different base.</P>
    <P>No doubt some of these 20,000 people who protested are responsible people. Some of them were well informed, some of them misinformed and there were some sections that comprised of a crowd of chancers who did not even know where Wood Quay was.  Some people who took part in the march, only wish to disrupt authority on any occasion that they can get the opportunity and they latched on to Wood Quay just as they latch on to other issues.  If Senator Martin is going to lie down under the bulldozers, that is another matter, he may get some of these people to lie down with him.  If he examines the situation he will see that the Corporation have done exactly what he indicated he would like to see happening.  I do not see any reason for him to stay there during the Christmas period.  There will be no need to bring him in Christmas pudding.  I do not think he will be there anyway.  We can assure him that everything that is necessary has been done.</P>
    <P>In relation to Christchurch, the city should revamp Christchurch, clean it <Col N="633" /> up and let it stand out as part of our national past.  It is a historic monument. The Corporation or the Government should indicate that they are going to provide a sum of money to ensure that Christchurch is cleaned up and stands out in the manner we would all like to see to give us a glimpse of Christchurch as it was.  It is an ancient monument and it is one that I would like to see revamped.  I could say much more.  I took quite a number of notes in relation <Col N="634" /> to Senator Martin's speech.  Some of them I think are not worth commenting on.  I think that he has not had the opportunity of examining the Corporation's situation, because he seems to be devoid of the information that I have imparted.</P>
