      <P>On a point of order, this debate took place on the Order of Business last week and personally I am fed up listening to arguments and debates on the Order of Business about family planning.  The Government are pushing a Family Planning Bill ahead; we are ready for it and we will debate it when the time comes.  This is not the time for debating it.</P>

      <P>When Senator Mulcahy has had more experience in the House he may understand the rights of Members of the House.  The Labour group tabled a Bill which is No. 9 on the Order Paper today.  On the last occasion the Leader of the House referred to the fact that there might be a Government Bill in some weeks.  The Labour group are entitled to more information than that, or else we would like to see a debate on the Family Planning Bill, 1978.  I would like the Leader of the <Col N="332" /> House to indicate specifically whether the heads of a Bill have been approved by the Cabinet and whether a Bill has been approved by the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  We are particularly entitled to put questions of that sort because&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Chathaoirleach, the Leader of the House indicated on the last occasion that there would be, in his opinion, a Government Bill in a matter of weeks.  What I am asking is how specific can he be on that? The credibility of Fianna Fáil on this issue is very poor indeed.  The rather irresponsible attitude of Fianna Fáil Senators on this issue is revealed today. They do not want to know about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to remain in order, a Chathaoirleach, but I am being barracked from that side of the House and I would like the protection of the Chair.  The matter at issue is whether the Labour group again press for a debate on the Bill that is on the Order Paper and which was given a unanimous First Reading by the Seanad.  This Bill puts forward a framework and a responsible <Col N="333" /> method of amending the law relating to family planning.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to discuss the Bill.  I am trying to say that in order for the Labour group to take a decision as to whether to press this Bill today or any other day that the Seanad meets, they must know precisely what the Government have in mind.  They have been in office for 17 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Leader will be able to give a specific indication; he has a responsibility as Leader of the House, given that there is a Bill before this House, to ascertain precisely what the situation is.  The responsibility is to the Members of the House and to the political party in this House which has tabled the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on that matter.  I wish to raise one other matter on the Order of Business.  I hope the Leader of the House will give me the information that I have looked for as a responsible and serious Member of this House.  The other matter which was raised on the last occasion is a matter of great urgency and it is the question of the motion which has been tabled on Wood Quay.  This is of such urgency now that the Labour group would certainly be prepared to support any move to have that motion taken today or to sit specially <Col N="334" /> tomorrow in order to debate it.  We do not have a week to spare in relation to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 9 concerns itself only with advocating the use of contraceptives for all, regardless of age or marital status.  It does not concern itself with family planning, and this is an important distinction which must be emphasised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise on the Order of Business, item No. 23, that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make an Order to preserve indefinitely the Viking site at Wood Quay already designated a national monument, in view of the many other sites in Dublin available to civic offices, which is signed by myself, by Senator West and by Senator Hussey.  I do not wish to discuss the substantive aspects of this, but the temporary preservation order on the site expires on 6 December, which is next Wednesday.  If we do not discuss that today or tomorrow there will be no point in discussing it at all.  The bulldozers can roll next Wednesday if that temporary preservation order is raised.  I ask for the indulgence of the House on this matter.  There is nothing on the Order Paper at this moment that could call upon our sense of urgency more imperiously that this matter.  Last week Senator Cassidy very cogently pointed out that there is no point in having a debate on the issue if the site has been demolished.  I would make a very strong and respectful plea that item No. 23 on the Order of Business today be discussed today or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this plea in view of the fact that the Leader of the House has shown the most consummate courtesy and concern <Col N="335" /> for this matter because it crosses all party political issues and concerns all of us, the nation, and our heritage.  If this House suggests a debate on it, once the destruction has been wrought, we would be holding ourselves up to scorn, we would be making a mockery of the whole legislative process; we would be casting derision on the processes of this House.  This House is geared to discuss matters of cultural, historical and aesthetic interest, and if that occurs this House will have been robbed of an opportunity to make the kind of unique contribution it can make to the Legislature of the country and indeed to the cultural life of the nation.  In terms of urgency and priority, I beg the Leader of the House to allow the question of Wood Quay to be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business.  I support the plea for Motion No. 23 on Wood Quay to be taken and to be given the highest possible precedence.  The Fine Gael group have indicated to the sponsors of the motion that they consider it as having precedence over any motions in the names of Fine Gael Senators.  The urgency has been pointed out by Senator Martin and it is a patent urgency.  It is also, obviously and notoriously, a matter of great public interest.  For these two reasons it should be debated immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea that Motion No. 23 concerning Wood Quay be taken this week.  I thought there was an indication last week that this would happen. What is particularly serious is that if we wait a further week the whole position could have changed because the preservation order will expire on 6 December, which is next Wednesday.  If the debate was taken next Wednesday we could be in the position of actually debating a motion while the contractors moved onto the site.  That is not the situation into which the House should get itself.  I know there is urgent Government business to be pursued, but I do <Col N="336" /> not see any reason why this House should not sit longer than normal during this week.  I would urge very strongly that Item No. 23 be taken this week.  The sponsors of this motion appreciate the interest that the parties have expressed in giving prority to this motion, so that it is next on the list of Private Members' motions.  It is essential that we take it this week before December and before the stay on the site expires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Leader of the House suggested that the Wood Quay motion would be debated a fortnight from last Wednesday, I am sure he did not mean to indulge in any cynical exercise of having us debate something after there was a <i>fait accompli</i> destroying the monument.  I support my fellow Senators in suggesting that this motion be taken during this sitting of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>On what Senator Robinson said, I would add my voice to hers by asking the Leader of the House when the Government intend to bring in their own family planning Bill?  After all, it must be presumed that the Government spokesman knows whether this Bill exists at all or when it is going to be circulated. Senator Robinson has a very fair point here irrespective of any party considerations.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Wood Quay motion, I said this time last week that I hope to give time for it next <Col N="338" /> Wednesday, and I still expect that it will be possible to do that.  Any fear that the movers of this motion or those interested in it have that next week will be too late should be mitigated by reason of the statement which the Minister of State concerned made on the motion on the Adjournment of the Dáil last night. Nothing precipitate will happen, and discussion next week will not be too late.  In view of the amount of business that has to be done I cannot agree to have it taken today.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill I should like to indicate that I have ruled that the amendment standing in the name of Senator Murphy is out of order on the ground that it involves a potential charge on the public revenue. The additional amendment in the name of Senator Mary Robinson is out of order for the same reason.  The Senators have been notified accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Senator, we cannot discuss this now. The amendments have been ruled out of order and it has been the tradition of this House to respect the ruling of the Chair. If the Senator has any question afterwards, the Senator will be met courteously on it.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1 which is the essential part of this Bill I indicated in the Second Stage debate that I approved of the section as far as it went, but I would like the Minister's amendment going further.  I intended to put down amendments with this object in mind.  I tried very hard and had considerable cooperation from the officials of the House and it did not seem to me that there was any way in which I could put my objects into the proper legal framework.  Every attempt I made had already been ruled out of order in the previous debate in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are some points that could be made on this section.  With the general aim of ensuring that the local authority grants scheme has a wider field of application, particularly in view of the forthcoming NCEA Bill, perhaps the Minister could make clear to me the distinction which he alluded to in his second <Col N="340" /> reading speech of the eligibility for scholarships <i>vis-a-vis</i> the eligibility for grants which this Bill deals with.  I find it rather hard to set one against the other. It is very important, because one deals with the vocational education committee and the application of this section has a rather different range.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this when discussing this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the notice of the Chair's ruling that the amendment which I had tabled to this section was out of order.  I accept that ruling.  Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise yet again to the Minister, the dissatisfaction with the new power and control which he appears to wish to have and a new discretion in relation to the definition of approved institution relating that to universities and university colleges.  The amendment which I had tabled and is not acceptable because it might be a potential charge on public revenue would have substituted the following for the definition of approved institution.  It would have provided that approved institution means (a) a university or university college or any other institution of higher education for the time being approved by the Minister, for the purpose of this Act, in respect of its courses which, in the case of a university or university college, are declared by the university or university college to be of degree standard and in the case of any other institution declared by a university or a university college or The National Council for Educational Awards to be of degree standard, or (b) any university or university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration being a course or courses of which the Minister approves for the time being for the purpose of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that that amendment, if it could get past the technical problem of being a potential charge, is the power which the Minister seeks for himself in relation to the approval of courses.  But the present wording of the section gives him a new power for the first time in relation to the approval of university <Col N="341" /> courses.  I raised at the Second Stage, and I am still not happy about the position and I would welcome a clarification by the Minister, the question of why he has chosen to broaden his power in this matter.  I believe it could, in fact, erode university autonomy in a very significant way.  I believe this could be the case either because the Minister refused to approve a particular university course or just failed to approve.  If it is a case of a new university course, the Minister would have to approve it actively and if the approval was not forthcoming then it could put a university or university college in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>The separation of those courses which would be declared to be approved courses of approved institutions from the (b) category in the amendment, I think is legitimate in the case of a course or courses of not less than two years duration to allow the Minister to have a role and a function in coordinating through approving the particular courses and making them approved institutions for the purposes of extending the grants system.  I was not satisfied with the Minister's reply on this point at Second Stage.  I think this is a very narrow and minimalist Bill, but it does, in fact, give the Minister new power and it is not just filling in that legal vacuum that the Minister chastised me for criticising him doing on that last occasion.  Clearly, I was not criticising the fact that he wanted to bring in legislation to legalise retrospectively what was happening: it was the fact that he had chosen to do so little and had not decided to remove the four honours eligibility which would have been a genuine step forward in the access to higher education grants from local authorities which would have been much more compatible with the kind of course and the kind of standards set by the technological colleges themselves.  That would have been a genuine step to redress the imbalance and the present curtailing of expenditure in higher education.</P>
    <P>Since the Second Stage, my views in relation to the issues that I raised have been greatly reinforced by the very strong statements in the observations of <Col N="342" /> the Higher Education Authority on the relevant paragraph, paragraph 7.33 of the Green Paper on Development for Full Employment.  In that statement grave concern is implied by the Higher Education Authority about the possibility&mdash;more than hinted at in the Green Paper&mdash;of a substantial fees increase, and there is a reference also to the Local Authority Higher Education Grants Bill where the Higher Education Authority points to the fact that the investment in higher education in Ireland is much lower than in any of the other European Community countries. Paragraph 6 refers to the Green Paper. The principal theme of paragraph 7.33 is that means should be found to transfer some of the cost of providing third level courses in institutions funded by the authority to those who benefit from them.  This it is suggested could be achieved by charging higher tuition fees, but the paragraph also contains the statement that improvements in the higher education grants scheme could ensure that prospective students with limited means would not be affected. The Authority's view is that a deliberate policy designed to increase fees and to maintain them at a higher level must be accompanied by positive guarantees that the condition attaching to the higher education grant scheme will be kept under continuous review.  The means test regulations and the value of the maintenance elements in such grants must be linked to changes in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on this Bill in the other House the Minister referred to the question of the review of the higher education grants scheme, and I would be grateful if he could indicate what the present position is on that.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take up the point that Senator West mentioned in relation to the VEC scholarships.  I note that the Minister did supply some statistical information to Deputy John Horgan, the Labour Party's spokesman on Education in the Dáil as recorded in the Official Report 19 November 1978 at column 797.  He gave the figures of the provisional number of scholarship holders for the academic year&mdash;1978 to 1979&mdash;and I would like to ask the <Col N="343" /> Minister to assess the way in which figures for scholarships tally with the figures for the previous years.  How do these compare with the figures for earlier years?  It is my understanding that because of the severity of the means test the number of eligible applicants for scholarships has declined and that the scholarships are not, in fact, as adequate a support as the Minister was suggesting at Second Stage.  They do not compensate for the fact that the four honours eligibility criterion is retained in relation to local authority grants.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get detailed information on this unless the Minister himself is prepared to supply the information.  For example, in the same page of the Dáil Report Deputy Horgan asked the Minister the estimated cost of extending the higher education grant scheme to all persons eligible under the means test who satisfy the entry requirements and are acceptable to a third level institution for a course of degree or diploma level recognised or designated by him for grant purposes.  Effectively, that would mean what is the cost of removing the tour honours eligibility criterion for the purposes of the other approved institutions under this Bill.  The Minister's reply was that he had no information in regard to the number of students who would qualify for such grants under the means test conditions and so he was not in a position to calculate the cost of the proposal.  It seems to me that this is the kind of information that the Minister should at least be able to estimate fairly accurately if he cannot give a precise figure.  It would be both of interest and relevance to the House to know what the estimated cost would be of removing the four honours requirement for the other approved institutions, for the technical colleges, the RTCs.  I would welcome further clarification of the position relating to the numbers applying for and receiving vocational education scholarships and the possible cost to the Exchequer of removing the four honours eligibility and simply relying on the standard required of the particular institution itself for entry to that institution.</P>
    <P>I would also, on this section, welcome clarification of the degree to which this <Col N="344" /> legalising of the position is retrospective. Subsection (2) provides that this section should be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of August 1974, and we know that in fact this was the <i>de facto</i> situation in relation to claims made.  But what about students who would have been eligible but were not aware, were not in a position to know, that they could have claimed? Can they claim retrospectively now under this legislation?  Are they put in a position where they could claim that they followed the course subsequent to 1974 and, if they had been aware of the possibility, that they satisfied the test for eligibility and satisfied the requirement of the four honours?  I think the situation is potentially a somewhat arbitrary one in that it is legalising a <i>de facto</i> situation for those fortunate enough to be able to avail of it, but what about those who were not in that fortunate position?</P>
    <P>On the question of the emphasis in higher education, the Minister was very critical of some of the comments that I had made on Second Stage about the need for a very dramatic emphasis in expenditure at all levels of education and to redress the present decline in real terms in expenditure at the third level. Rather than trumpet about what Fianna Fáil did or did not do previously I think there is an immense responsibility on the Government in the unique situation in which we find ourselves as a country to forget the party political approach in a bitter and confrontationalist way, and the Minister for Education should rally some of the arguments to himself when he is competing for scarce resources within his own Cabinet and in the budget negotiations of the Government.  The Minister should, in a sense, welcome the very strong support that he gets, certainly from the Labour group, for a substantial increase in the expenditure in third level education and in particular for the need to redress the present definite pattern where the number obtaining vocational scolarships is declining, the number who are state aided is declining, the number who are fee paying&mdash;and therefore from the higher income groups&mdash;are the ones who are taking up the third level places in the institute of higher education.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation which <Col N="345" /> will get worse unless the Minister does bring the means test, the eligibility criterion, into line with the present cost of living and link it to the Consumer Price Index and also take the step that is very relevant to this particular Bill, and that is to acknowledge that the academic criterion of the four honours entry is not a rational or reasonable criterion on which to decide to provide grants for students applying.  The criterion is much more, that the student is acceptable to the regional technical college, that the student wishes to pursue a course of a technological sort.  That is the particular need in the community&mdash;this kind of expertise and this kind of third level education&mdash;and as a country competing with other countries for skills and technological expertise we have no choice but to expand very substantially in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is minimalist, and it gives the Minister a potential new power in relation to approval of university courses.  I was disappointed in the Minster's response at Second Stage to the arguments that were being put forward about the need for very radical concentration on the provision of new places in third level education.  Once again I think that the observations of the Higher Education Authority are very relevant here, because this is a body established with a particular jurisdiction and concern in the area of higher education. The Authority is very worried about the present trends, about the hint and implication in the Government's Green Paper, and is clearly publicising its observations before the White Paper is published because of grave concern which I know is shared by many people in institutions of higher education that the Government may be prepared to condone a sharp rise in fees which would worsen the present pattern of discrimination against less well off students and further cement in the privilege of access to higher education.  These are extremely serious issues.  The overall picture is not a satisfactory one, and I would hope that the Minister would be more forthcoming on the kind of review that he is engaged in at the moment of higher education grants and his policy as Minister for <Col N="346" /> Education in relation to access to third level education.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I made some points about this also.  As I see it, this Bill is not saying that the Minister will not in the future take action which will help in the case of some of the items mentioned by Senator Robinson.  I made some suggestions that the Minister might think of differential support.  I would prefer to see more of the available money going towards technical training and technological training rather than into art faculties.  To that extent, I am glad to see the Minister having power in relation to courses in the universities as well.  The Bill as it stands is not laying down what exactly is going to happen in the future.  That lies with the Minister, and I am sure that he knows what we all would like to see.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it was the Minister's physique that misled me rather than anything else.  I am puzzled about this Bill.  If it was considered necessary to bring in the Bill entitled &ldquo;Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill&rdquo; one would have expected it to be less of a Mickey Mouse Bill, so to speak, and more substantial: if indeed Fianna Fáil in fact intend to fulfil their election promises in the manifesto especially in respect of eligibility levels for grants it seems to me that this amending Bill would have been an ideal vehicle in which to do this.  However, my main point is that while I accept the ruling that my amendment was out of order I would nonetheless like to express the concern that lies behind my amendment. It seems to me that as Senator Robinson has said, this Bill gives the Minister, in theory at least, discretionary powers <Col N="347" /> over which courses will be approved and which will not be approved.  I know that the Minister is not likely to interfere in this way.  But once it is in the Bill, to a certain extent it raises the problem of interference with university autonomy. After all, if a university or other recognised higher institution is deemed responsible to handle courses then I think the question of approval should be left to them.  I am puzzled as to why there seems to be this further extension of ministerial powers to approving courses rather than the universities.  Suppose that the hairshirt becomes more irritable and that the national cake&mdash;to mix my metaphors&mdash;has to be rationed in a more strict way, what is to stop the Minister's civil servants advising him that such and such courses in the university are not really economically viable, or what is to stop the Minister's civil servants from advising him that there are too many going into the Arts faculties and that this does not represent the best use of public moneys?  Already there have been some suggestions that, in view of the diminishing number taking Ancient Classics, such small departments are not really worth the money being spent on them.  In all these areas then, I feel that if we have a move towards cutting down spending on the education sector, this section here might encourage, not perhaps this Minister, but maybe the Department of Education to interfere in areas which are properly part of university autonomy.  I would also support Senator Robinson in asking the Minister to clarify what would be the effect of subsection (2).  If students are otherwise qualified and meet all the requirements, and if they began their course in 1974 and finished two years' course in a proper institution in 1976, would they not have the right to apply for a grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Senators who contributed and to deal with some of their points.  Senator West asked for further clarification as to what I said about scholarships and grants. This is simply in the context of the people talking about the minimum academic qualification for a grant which is well <Col N="348" /> known.  The point I was making on Second Stage was that this qualification is not required for a scholarship and I went on to say that in fact the scholarship was of the same monetary value as a grant but that those who were availing of the scholarships in the regional technical colleges did not have to satisfy the same high academic standards as those who were getting grants for universities.  Since the purpose of this Bill is to extend the area where the grant may be enjoyed the point I made about the scholarship is relevant.  In other words, in a given RTC class you may have students who are enjoying scholarships under the vocational education committee of the full value of the grant and in that same class you may have, due to the extension of the grant scheme, people enjoying the grants. They are enjoying exactly the same amount of money but the standard demanded for the scholarship may be a great deal lower than that demanded for the grant.  That is the point I was making on Second Stage.  It is the local authorities who operate the grants scheme.  This may also cause some confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred, as did Senator Murphy, to my &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; powers and rightly so because in fact I am not taking any new real powers or any powers to extend the role of the Minister or his Department in third level education.  Senator Robinson talked about chastisement, about my chastising her.  I would not have thought that that was the appropriate word.  She said that one should not make a party political issue of education.  I agree with her.  In fact my remarks on Second Stage were purely in the context of Senator Robinson's very first sentence using the name of the Labour Party and stating that she was being motivated by the philosophy of the Labour Party.  I said I had been a voice crying in the wilderness looking for an increase in grants and eligibility limits for four and a half years almost and I got no support, no sustenance, no encouragement from the Labour Party.  In fact, when I had motions down in the Dáil on both grants and eligibility limits no member of the Labour Party turned up in the Dáil at all except ex-Deputy <Col N="349" /> Stephen Coughlan who turned up at the end of my speech to barrack me a little. Indeed, I was glad to see him because he was the only Member of his party who had the courage to come in.  It was in that context that I mentioned, in no triumphalistic way, what had been achieved.  There was no intention on my part to be triumphalistic about it.  As has been said by other Senators, we have limited resources for any particular Department of Government and we must try to deploy them as best we can. It is my purpose and my function and my intention to fight as hard as I possibly can to get as much as I can of what Senator Murphy called the national cake for education.</P>
    <P>By nature I am averse to hairshirts.  I just want to point out, of course, that in fact 84 per cent of the cost of an individual student in a university or university college is borne as of now by the State.  I agree with Senator Mulcahy and with the other Senators who mentioned the importance of technological education to our developing economy. Sometimes fashionable phrases like this become popular and people cease to examine the meaning of them and I would regret it if this happened.  It is important to develop the technological side whatever about the differential aid which Senator Mulcahy mentioned.  This would be difficult.  In what we are doing here and in the provision of the scholarships under the education committees we are in a sense directing attention to the technological sector.  This is the greatest growth sector in education at the moment mainly due to the building and placement at various points in the country of the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I did not at any time claim that this Bill was a major Bill dealing with higher university grants.  For that reason I would like to assure Senator Murphy that what I am doing here is simply fixing a puncture, not producing a new wheel.  The puncture is there, sizzling away since 1974, and the job had to be done.  He also referred to university autonomy.  There is no intention as I stated at the outset, of interfering with the universities or their autonomy; in <Col N="350" /> fact university autonomy is respected, I would suggest, in this country, north and south, far more than it is in most countries who pride themselves on their treatment of the universities.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I remember the chairman of the university grants committee addressing the National University of Ireland convocation in Dublin. He indicated that the disbursement of funds by the UGC was often used as an arm-twisting exercise to get universities to follow particular courses, establish new departments and so on.  Neither the Department nor I intend to interfere in that way with the universities.  I am precluded from discussing the amendments which were ruled out of order, but I might say that Senator Robinson's would have extended the application of grants to the teacher training colleges where they have a scheme of their own with which they are satisfied.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to one point in the Minister's reply to the Second Stage debate.  Again it is a point I raised and I tried to frame an amendment but my best efforts were defeated. It was an amendment that was out of order but it does, in a tangential way, concern the Minister's powers in relation to these grants and the way in which the grants system operates <i>vis-a-vis</i> the local authorities.  It concerns this case which I mentioned to him about the date of application for a grant.  I will not go into the case again, but it did seem that the Minister could direct the local authorities to have the application dates at the same time.  In fact he did reply to this and he did say that on the radio he had referred to this on one occasion, but it was not clear to me from his Second Stage speech whether he was actually thinking of giving a direction and bringing all the county councils into line <i>vis-a-vis</i> the application date.</P>

      <P>I can tell Senator West that the universal date is the 31 August. I did mention, either here or in another place, that the authorities had two weeks discretionary period&mdash;was it up to 14 September? &mdash;the first two weeks of September.  I knew that that was so for the scholarship schemes, I did not know <Col N="351" /> if it were so at that time for the grants but I believe so.  I am informed now that it is true of the grants as well.  The person who applied would now have to be very late indeed before he or she would be precluded for not applying in time.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister said about our standards of university autonomy and that we are relatively very fortunate in enjoying such autonomy.  I further accept that there is no sinister intention in section 1 of the amended Bill.  Nevertheless, the 1968 Act talks of an approved institution as a university or a university college in respect of it's courses which are of a degree standard, but the amending Bill speaks about an approved institution meaning a university or a university college in so far as it provides a course of which the Minister approves.  It seems that there is a significant difference in emphasis or nuance here, shifting the standard of approval from the actual institution to the courses.  Why is this so? Why is it necessary to make this kind of change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be undue sensitivity on it.  The actual formula was meant to cover the change and to exclude the institutions that I mentioned in my previous intervention.  I appreciate what the Senator said about the present position.  As he knows very well, that kind of autonomy is preserved by eternal vigilance, and I appreciate his remarks.  I contend that the amendment as it is here is in no way restrictive of the liberty or the autonomy of universities nor is it intended that it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to put the same question as Senator Murphy in relation to the wording of this section giving the Minister power to approve of a university degree course which would have got automatic approval under the 1968 Act.  I am still puzzled by the <Col N="352" /> Minister's response to this question.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that, in seeking a formula to extend the higher education grants to approved institutions, this was the only way of doing it. This is not the case, because in both Houses amendments were tabled which drew to the attention of the Minister that he was effectively terminating the automatic approval of university courses and giving himself a discretion in the matter.  I am not reassured by Ministerial assurances and good will in the House.  We have enough experience of the fact that Ministers come and go, Governments change, time passes, and we are conferring a new and potentially far-reaching power on the Minister in relation to approval of univesity degree courses.  The Minister has not satisfied the question as to why he changed the automatic exemption from approval of these courses in the 1968 Act when he was extending the scheme.  That has not been adequately explained.  If anything, the question mark has got a bit larger and slightly more ominous.</P>
      <P>I am also not at all satisfied with the Minister's response to a number of the other questions which I had raised on this section.  I had referred to the question of the vocational scholarships.  The Minister has emphasised on Second Stage and has emphasised this afternoon that the persons who are eligible for VEC scholarships, even if they do not satisfy the four honours eligibility requirement, this satisfactorily balances the situation and means that in his opinion it is satisfactory to retain the four honours eligibility criteria in relation to higher education grants from local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was seeking confirmation&mdash;and I referred to the figures he had given to Deputy Horgan in the Dáil&mdash;that the means test is so severe for applicants for the scholarship that a significant number of students cannot satisfy the criterion and, therefore, there is a decline in applications for scholarships because the parents are just above the £3,400 limit for eligibility.  I asked him for the figures for earlier years of scholarship holders.  I referred to the fact that he gave the provisional number of scholarship holders for the academic year 1978-79 <Col N="353" /> in the Dáil on 14 November and I asked for comparable figures for earlier years because it would be important to ascertain whether the numbers are declining on the two grounds&mdash;the very severe means test for eligibility and that these scholarships are competitive, there is not an unlimited number of them.  They are not, therefore, an adequate response to the question of whether or not the academic criterion of the four honours should be retained for access to the regional techs when these institutions themselves have accepted, or would accept, the candidate.  The whole emphasis on eligibility should be based on having an accepted place in the institution.  The scholarship system does not fill that gap. It does not cater for the significant number of students who are denied placed because of the academic eligibility criterion, or because they do not satisfy the means test.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not answer the request for more information on the present review of the grant system or give us any indication of present Government thinking, apart from a vague expression of his own personal commitment and goodwill in the matter.  This is the first legislative measure in the area of education that we have had since the Minister took office.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Government are failing to deliver, as is evident from the figures for investment in higher education, from the pattern of those who have access to education, from the failure to bring the means test and eligibility criterion into line with the cost of living.  Yes, the Minister did take some steps in that regard but they do not <Col N="354" /> in any way even halt the present drift in access to higher education.  I regret that the Minister is choosing to fight it out on past party political battles rather than trying to address himself and the attention of Senators to the present situation and to future demands.  It is the kind of challenge that deserves serious and conscientious treatment from us.  It is not enough to go back and fight old political battles and score old political points on the basis of it.  That is not a satisfactory response to the questions being asked by Members of this House, trying to elicit information on the background to this small and technical measure which has within it a new assumption of ministerial power which continues to worry some of us and which does not do what many of us would like to see, that is, to remove the four honours eligibility criterion.  The House is entitled to some indication of the Minister's thinking in the matter and of his attempts, as a matter of urgency, to redress the present pattern of accessibility to higher education, the present decline in real terms in investment in higher education.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Robinson because I have never before heard anybody, in any place, who can get away with murder to the same extent that she does.  Neither in the Act of 1968 nor in this amendment of 1978 is there any mention at all of one honour, two honours, three honours or four honours. She keeps talking on Committee Stage about something which is neither in the original Act nor in the amending Bill. The actual academic qualification is not mentioned at all in the Bill.  I understand that on Committee Stage of a Bill one confines onself to what is actually in the Bill, whatever open forum there may be is usually on Second Stage.  I congratulate the Senator on her ability to get away with that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator has asked for figures. The eligibility limits were raised substantially. I gave the Senator the figure of 29.2 per cent, if I recall correctly, of a rise in the eligibility limits at the maximum. In view of the fact, which is relevant when people are making up their minds whether they will go to a third level institution or not, that the actual <Col N="355" /> grants were raised as much as 66? per cent at maximum, I would think that more people would be enjoying grants and scholarships than have been hitherto.  Coupled with this is the quite significant factor that this has been done in a period when inflation has been dropping, when it has come down to between 8 and 9 per cent from a level of as much as 25 per cent at a period when absolutely no move was made to raise either eligibility limits or the value of the third level grants.</P>
    <P>If possible, I should like the quotation from the Senator on the subject of a review.  She said I had said something about a review.  Would the Senator care to give me the exact quotation?</P>

I do not recall having said anything about a review, so I am really in the dark with regard to what the Senator says.  Failing a direct quotation I would not like to make any comment.  Without having the figures available here, in view of the fact that limits have been raised, the value of the grants has been raised and inflation has been brought under some kind of control, my belief would be that the numbers holding grants and scholarships are rising rather than falling. They did take a dip around 1975 but I do not want to be specific seeing that I have not actual figures at my disposal at the moment.</P>

Does he dispute the table of figures which was compiled by the Union of Students in Ireland which, I understand, was submitted to the Minister?  These figures show a definite decline in the number of students receiving financial aid from the State in 1975, 1976 and 1977.</P>

      <P>As the Senator is aware, I took office on 5 July 1977 and the eligibility limits were increased by me to refer to the academic year 1977-78.  This is the second academic year in which they apply, namely 1978-79.  I accept that there was a dip and I submit that the cause of that dip was that no action had been taken on eligibility limits or amounts of grants.</P>

      <P>The figures compiled by the Union of Students in Ireland in assessing the decline in the percentage of students receiving financial aid from the State for higher education bear in mind the increases that were made in relation to the grants and the means test.  Following the table of figures there is a comment that may be of interest to the Minister.  The comment is:</P>
      <P>The most striking pattern which emerges is the overall decrease in State-supported students in the system.  The 1975 level is low by international standards but it is falling very gradually.  This is happening while the overall number in third level has been rising by small steps each year, from 29,600 in 1975 to 33,300 in 1977. There is an established pattern, then, of even slow growth leading to increased opportunity for families who can finance their own children through third level.  Adequate means tests and grant level revisions would be needed immediately to halt this trend.  Last year's increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>these were prepared in 1978 so &ldquo;last year&rdquo; refers to what the Minister is talking about</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" />&mdash;&mdash;in the means test will take three years to have an impact and by that time the measure itself will be substantially eroded by inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that reduction of the students simply proves my point that there was a valley period when nothing was done and we are seeing the effects of it in the figures given.  I still maintain that, due to the improvement, there will be an increase.  Of course, the whole situation will have to be kept constantly in our minds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill is a short one.  I regard it as a most important piece of health legislation.  It comes to the Seanad after a detailed examination on Committee Stage in the Dáil, during which it was amended and, I feel, improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the Bill itself was regarded by the Dáil as a necessary legislative instrument by which I and my successors in office will be able to prohibit particular kinds of advertising and sponsorship, to restrict expenditure in these areas, to control the form and content of tobacco advertising, and to prohibit certain sales promotion devices such as gifts and price-cutting. <Col N="358" /> These powers are contained in section 2 of the Bill, which also provides for the furnishing to the Minister of information necessary for the purposes of the Act. The remaining sections of the Bill contain the short title, definitions and provision for expenses and penalties.</P>
    <P>It was the manner in which I intended to use the powers in the Bill in the short term rather than the Bill itself on which the criticism of some Deputies focussed. They felt I was not going far enough.  I think I am, and what I propose to include in the regulations, which I will make immediately after the Bill becomes law, is a realistic and sensible balance between what it is necessary to do from the public health point of view and reasonable to do from the point of view of an industry upon which numbers of people depend for their livelihood and from the point of view of sporting organisations who are involved at present in sponsorship by tobacco companies.</P>
    <P>Accepting that precipitate action would have been inimical to the objectives which I have set myself and to those people who derive their livelihood from the manufacture and sale of tobacco products, I have decided in the medium term to proceed by prohibiting or restricting the promotional activities of the tobacco industry in those areas in which it seemed to me they had the greatest impact.  The introduction of these proposals will serve notice upon the industry that they cannot be permitted to undermine our efforts in the field of preventive health.  They will be quite clear that the era of unlimited promotional activities is over and that in the future they face more and more restrictions on their advertisements.</P>
    <P>When the regulations are made under the Bill, the only advertising media which will be left open to the tobacco companies will be the newspapers and magazines and internal advertising at points of retail sale.  In these areas there will be a limitation on the content of advertisements and of expenditure upon it.  Sponsorship will remain for a time but, again, expenditure will be restricted and advertising associated with it severely curtailed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Radio, television, cinema and outdoor advertising will be prohibited and the glamorous advertisement in newspapers and magazines will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I intend to strengthen the health warning on packages of cigarettes and on advertisements and to require that it be clearly displayed and not obscured as it is on occasion now.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion in the Dáil about the problem of sponsorship.  On the one hand some Deputies felt that I was going too far in controlling this particular activity of the tobacco industry, whereas others considered that what I proposed to do was weak and pandered to the tobacco interests.</P>
    <P>I have said, and I repeat now, that sponsorship is just another form of advertising.  This is particularly true of tobacco sponsorship which, in the main, tends to concentrate upon the spectacular super-event from which publicity can be widely obtained.  I intend, therefore, to curb its promotional content. Advertisements for the sponsored event in the press or magazines, for instance, or at the event being sponsored may not include any reference to a brand of a tobacco product nor any participants in the event be identified visually with a brand.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the tobacco companies will be restricted in what they spend. They will not be allowed to engage in new sponsorship activities without express approval, which will be given only in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>To prohibit sponsorship immediately would have been too precipitate and would have given little opportunity to the organisers of events to adapt themselves to changing circumstances. Not only that, but it would have been counterproductive in the sense that arbitrary action tends to alienate people who otherwise would be sympathetically disposed to our objectives in the preventive health area.</P>
    <P>Those objectives are essentially to encourage in the public an awareness of how much they can do to improve the state of their own health by adopting a sensible regimen of life, by taking a <Col N="360" /> reasonable amount of exercise and rest, by not eating too much or drinking too much and, above all, by not smoking.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that there was some pressure on me to require the tobacco interests to display the tar content of cigarettes upon the packets.  The proposition has some attractions, but there is the danger that if the companies were required to do so there would be an implication that there is such a thing as a safe cigarette.  There is not, and smokers are foolish if they delude themselves that there is.</P>
    <P>Companies will not, however, in the advertising media remaining open to them be prevented from indicating the tar content of the particular brand.  This will allow those who persist in smoking to choose a low tar brand if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill and the consequential regulations which I will make will enable this country to make a most significant effort in preventive health at the national level.  It is regarded in Europe as an important piece of legislation from the point of view of the spreading international effort to prevent death and illness from smoking related diseases.  This was very evident at the recent EEC Council of Ministers for Health in Brussels on 16 November at which the problems created by tobacco smoking were discussed.  I should also say that a a conclusion to the meeting it was unanimously recommended that the Commission pursue the question of establishing a common attitude towards tobacco advertising in the nine member states.</P>
    <P>It is in this spirit that I commend the Bill to Senators for a Second Reading, and I will be glad of their comments on its content.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not be able to say that we welcome the Bill as the ideal solution to the problem that the Minister is seeking to solve.  Nevertheless we welcome a number of comments that the Minister made and acknowledge that he is making an effort to awaken concern about what is a very serious problem, not only in this area but also as regards general standards of health and hygiene. The Minister, by his concern and dedication <Col N="361" /> to his ideals in this area, is making an honest effort to create an awareness of the importance of health and the factors relating to health which are entirely within the control of individuals.  The most welcome line here is the emphasis that has been laid on the fact that, for the future, the unrestricted right to advertise tobacco is a thing of the past.  I regret that the Bill has not covered a wider area.</P>
      <P>I feel that, for the protection of our young people, it is time that serious consideration was given to the sort of activities they engage in.  We have always coupled tobacco with alcohol.  I firmly believe that one area is as dangerous as the other.  We have at our disposal much evidence that health is being damaged by alcohol as well as by tobacco.  Statements by eminent psychiatrists in the recent past indicate that a very high proportion of people at present in some of our overcrowded mental institutions are there through problems of alcohol. The first observations of the development of bad habits in the young people leaving school is the cigarette in the hand.  Now I notice that the glass is first with a bigger number of them.  I do not know what the facts or figures are on this.  I have not any, but I believe that more young people put their health at risk by starting to drink and smoke too early.  I regret that the Minister did not take the two problems together, or make any reference in what he said to any ideas he has about coming to grips with the other half of what I consider to be more or less the same problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out, and it has been pointed out by others, that if we are to believe and place any confidence in what the medical profession have been telling us, there is an obligation on all of us to warn everybody we see with a cigarette in their hand of the dangers of smoking.  There is no question about it any more.  It is amazing the number of people who will say that they do not believe this and that there is no evidence to back it up.  A bigger effort should be made to educate people, particularly the young, about what is involved. There is also the problem of the example of older people.  I do not think <Col N="362" /> anybody enjoys their first cigarette.  I do not smoke any longer but I did for a period.  I did not enjoy my first cigarette. I smoked because I saw other people smoking.  Most young people endure the first 20 cigarettes they take just because smoking has been made to look glamorous on television or in magazines. They see other people smoking in what appear to be conditions of comfort and people give the impression that they get much satisfaction from it.  Older people who are hooked on the habit and find it difficult to give it up, or feel that their health and constitution is sufficiently strong to resist any of the dangers, should be encouraged through our educational system to smoke out of sight.  They should take themselves to some place where they will not be observed and will not pollute the atmosphere. In dancehalls and other recreational centres and in many meeting rooms people who do not smoke are forced to endure it.  Until we make an effort to educate our young people and warn those who are smoking of the effects of their bad example, any other efforts we make will not be effective.</P>
    <P>The legislation is, in a sense, slightly irrelevant.  It is more or less like setting up a commission of inquiry or having a study carried out.  None of us know what exactly it is intended to do.  Apart from the fact that the Minister said he intends, immediately the legislation is passed, to make use of it, we are not completely sure what exactly he intends to do. Furthermore, it places on the Minister, his Department and his advisers, a very weighty responsibility to pick the particular areas where they are going to first impose the restriction.  It would be a far better approach to make up our minds about what exactly should be done about the problem.  We should introduce clear, decisive legislation which would let everybody know what exactly we are doing so that there would be no misunderstanding about it, and no loopholes that could be used.  There would be no hope that, if a sufficient case was made action would not be taken.  This legislation gives no clear indication of what exactly will happen or how it will operate. There are a lot of questions to be answered.  The Minister will be subjected <Col N="363" /> to unnecessary pressure by people who do not know exactly where they stand but who know that in the Minister's two hands there exists the power to do this, that or the other.  That is a big deficiency which will exist even when this legislation has been passed.</P>
    <P>A lot of people expressed sympathy for the different areas of sport and loss of revenue for the advertising of events and so on.  For a long time we have had knowledge of the damage that was being done by cigarette smoking.  Therefore, the immorality of advertising it should not be short-taken by any legislation or orders which will be made.  Any genuine sporting body will accept that it is wrong to allow their sport to be used in this way.  They should have accepted a long time ago that this could not possibly continue indefinitely.  Some sports have become more than a sport.  They have become an industry.  People who are consciously trying to achieve one end and yet put people's health at risk should examine their consciences to see what direction they are going in.</P>
    <P>The question of revenue always arises when this subject is raised.  The majority of people believe that any Government cannot seriously tackle the problem of controlling the use of either alcohol or tobacco because of the amount of revenue that is involved.  Decisive calculations should be made by those whose responsibility it is.  They should make up an inventory of what is coming in from those areas.  By planning our programme for a healthier and more wholesome society we could set definite targets and objectives of what we hope to achieve over the years.  We could gear our budgets and economic policy to working out to where we eventually hope to find ourselves.  From the beginning everybody would know where the Government intend to go in this area and what exactly the finance involved means.  Short of working out this sort of programme, people will be convinced that no Government could be serious in undertaking this task.</P>
    <P>It is welcome news that, at European level, this subject is taken seriously also because of travel and the movement of papers, magazines and television <Col N="364" /> programmes across boundaries.  It is an area which can only be effectively tackled at European level.  As one of the richest areas in the world&mdash;the habits. customs and culture of which we expect to spread into other areas as they become more affluent&mdash;we have an obligation not to sell them this side of our culture which is not a healthy one. The advertising and selling of tobacco and alcohol cannot be controlled by any national Government working solely on its own.  It must be tackled at a wider level.  We should be conscious of our obligations to the world which looks to western Europe as an area where many of the better things in life exist.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not a solution to the problem.  It has not gone far enough and has left too many people wondering what is going to happen next.  The Minister will find himself in an awkward situation when he seeks to select the areas where he is going to introduce measures.  People who will be making provision for alternative sources of revenue and who may have to look for other jobs should know all this well in advance.  It should be clearly outlined to them exactly where we are going.  On the other hand, we welcome the Bill as a sign at least of the concern of the Minister who needs to do something in this area.  While it is not all that we expect, it is better than nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I had certain reservations about this Bill until I read the Minister's reaction to the Dáil debate and listened to his introduction.  The fact that he is conscious that we are not dealing with automatons but with human beings in trying to persuade the community to adopt certain courses is very salutary.  The Minister made the comment that he is proceeding wisely with a great deal of common sense and sensitivity. With his personal reassurance, as a Member of the Seanad who feels somewhat responsible for the health and education programme for the next generation.  I support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear the Minister assure us that he will be lenient towards the tobacco companies who are already involved in some worth-while sponsorships and that any decisions taken under the <Col N="365" /> Bill will not discriminate against the Irish manufacturer who is responsible for the employment of a great number of people.</P>
    <P>As a non-smoker I can speak objectively, and I would like to put forward points on behalf of the committed smokers who make up a fair percentage of our population.  Like many others, I am concerned that this Bill will be the first step towards the ultimate aim of completely banning the sale and availability of tobacco which, like any other satisfying habit, will produce its own backlash and black market.  Such action could produce a nation of neurotics unless it is accompanied by a very strong educational programme, particularly for the young, to influence them towards alternative outlets for their mental and physical energies.  For the not so young, I would be worried about the side effects healthwise of giving up smoking too rapidly.  It is an accepted theory that cessation of smoking leads to compensatory over-eating and probably to obesity and other worrying health hazards.</P>
    <P>There have been many generations of advertising and sponsorship which highlighted the habit of smoking as the key to success in any situation in which men and women found themselves.  It has established itself as the most sophisticated outward evidence of one's adulthood and maturity.  Moreover, the addiction is considered relaxing and enables some people to cope with the strains and stresses of life, to overcome shyness, embarrassment and insecurity and an easier way to cultivate business relationships and friendships.</P>
    <P>The most likely withdrawal reaction would be a build up of tension which is probably the greatest contributor to the cause of heart attacks.  As a non-smoker, the smoking habit has in no way affected my life.  Both my parents were more than moderate smokers and both of them lived until well over the age of eighty, Throughout my business and social life the most stimulating and enjoyable evenings have been spent in company with people who drink and smoke in moderation.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to reconcile the theory <Col N="366" /> behind this Bill with the flamboyant introduction of duty free facilities heralded as a bonanza to those who travel by sea and air, who can purchase drink and tobacco more cheaply.  I must admit that I also avail of this facility, as I cannot resist a bargain.  It seems a pity that drink and tobacco are so glamourised and that the monetary incentives are not extended to less controversial goods which could be sold, even less VAT, at our airports and on ships.</P>
    <P>Whether one smokes or not the growing habit of disregarding the mannerly etiquette of not smoking during meals, particularly at official functions and dinners before what used to be known as the loyal toast is to be deprecated.  I suggest to politicians on both sides of the House who give support to this Bill, that they have an opportunity to see that this formal procedure is re-established, so that people at official functions do not smoke before the toast of the President of Ireland is honoured.  I am sure that the Minister could request that menus in future would cover this reminder.  All of us have experienced the moment when one sits down at a dinner and someone says &ldquo;I hope you do not mind if I smoke&rdquo;.  Rather than lose a friend for life one mumbles a response which is immediately taken as assent.  Perhaps the Minister could bring out a voluntary code of manners to those committed to smoking which will help his longer term campaign.  I also suggest that a mass mediscan system should be extended to the new social welfare scheme as a form of preventive medicine.</P>
    <P>My most important suggestion is that the Minister, who has earned such a world wide reputation for his action in the promotion and encouragement of the arts, should convince his Cabinet colleagues that it is in the interests of our future well being to allow personal and business taxation incentives for greater sponsorship in areas of charity, culture and sport.  This gives me the opportunity to support the plea of Senator Alexis FitzGerald over the past year, that people should be encouraged to give money for good purposes.  With adequate taxation incentives, people could be encouraged to give up smoking and direct their savings to more salutary objectives. <Col N="367" /> This would also have the benefit of redirecting their energies to more active involvement in such good purposes.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the leadership he has shown in the meetings with the EEC Ministers.  The introduction of this Bill is proof that the Minister practises what he preaches and that we afford a very high priority to our positive health policy.  In this context I am glad that the Minister is aware of the overspill advertising, particularly in relation to imported magazines and newspapers. Even as a non-smoker I cannot help being mesmerised by the glamorous advertising in magazines such as <i>Time</i> which always contains at least two cigarette advertisements without a reference to the health regulations which are mandatory here.  The Minister is to be congratulated on his untiring efforts, through the Department of Health, to highlight the health risks and dangers from various quarters.  I wish them well in their continuous campaign against over indulgence in the habits which statistics have proved to be serious health hazards.  It is hoped that the whole nation will soon jog or walk tall towards fitness and health.  We certainly all need the physique and stamina to cope with the EMS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather difficult to make up my mind about the provisions in this Bill.  In general terms, some control of advertising on an even wider scale than this is necessary.  Will the statutory controls on advertising of certain products really be effective?  One does not know.  I advocated for some time that there should be an advertising council which would introduce some controls on the veracity of advertisements over the widest possible range.  It is rather a pity that we have not set up such a body. There is a difficulty when one tries to tackle a specific product or the product of a specific industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders whether the control of advertising will really have the effect of reducing the level of smoking particularly by those who overindulge.  Overindulgence is really the problem that the Minister is interested in getting at.  That is really the aspect from the preventive <Col N="368" /> medicine point of view that one wants to emphasise.  Could some statutory controls not be introduced to restrict smoking in certain public places where appropriate? I am not sure if any legislation refers to this, but that would be one of the ways in which one might produce a beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>I agreed with Senator Lambert when he referred to the need for an educational campaign connected with this type legislation.  An obvious contradiction has been pointed out already, where sporting organisations accept large quantities of sponsorship from tobacco firms, if it is clear that smoking affects one's level of fitness.  On has also to be careful, and think of the effect that a blanket prohibition would have on our behaviour.  When there was prohibition on the sale of alcohol in the US the consumption of alcohol did not drop, it stabilised or increased and the prohibition just produced an enormous black market.  One wants to be careful in these areas not to over-kill, because it produces a backlash.  The educational approach that one needs to adopt is to get the idea across that if one smokes too much it affects one's level of fitness. The campaign for a higher level of physical fitness should be linked carefully with the fact that smoking affects one's level of fitness and that this is something which impinges on the individual. I wonder whether this Bill will do anything more than prohibit the advertising of tobacco.  Will it affect consumption? It is hard to say.  I have no facts about the reactions in other countries where this sort of campaign may have been carried out.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to this if he has any such facts.  I am not sure whether the Bill will in fact produce the right effect.  The statistics seem to prove that there is a connection between smoking and lung cancer.  I would argue also that there is probably a connection between air pollution and lung cancer.  Statistics seem to corroborate this and it would be useful to have figures comparing the incidence of lung cancer in city dwellers with the incidence in rural dwellers.  High levels of air pollution from exhaust fumes or from industrial effluent may be a major factor in the causes of lung cancer.  That <Col N="369" /> is another problem that should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see if he can do something about the restriction of smoking in public places.  An ultimate prohibition would probably produce a backlash, and it would be better in this area not to take too big a step at once because it is very hard to foresee the effects either on the industry or on the health of the individuals of a restriction on advertising a product such as tobacco.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this very necessary Bill.  It is a timely measure which strikes the right note.  It is necessary that there should be a control of advertising, but to be too draconian about it at this stage, as Senator West and the Minister indicated. might have a counter-productive trend. It is nice to see that this is part of the concerted European Community effort in relation to smoking.  I am very glad that we are among the first off the mark in this very necessary matter.</P>
      <P>There is another major aspect of this Bill from a health point of view in that it is a significant contribution to preventive medicine.  For far too long we have perhaps devoted our attention to curing disease and stopping at that point.  What would be very useful would be if we could in so far as is possible prevent disease and give more emphasis to positive health and positive prevention of illness. This is a very worth-while step in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the ill-effects of smoking are indeed very serious.  Here I would differ slightly from my colleague, Senator West, because the situation has been very thoroughly documented over the years, two major reports in the early seventies, one commissioned by the World Health Organisation, by Fletcher from the Royal Post-Graduate Medical School, and Daniel Home who is Director of the US National Clearing House for Smoking and Health, and a report the following year by the Royal College of Physicians on smoking and health, all too clearly indicate the position.  It may well be that air pollution and so on are further contributory matters but there is unfortunately no doubt whatever now <Col N="370" /> about the association between smoking and lung cancer.</P>
    <P>That in itself would be a more than sufficient reason for the sort of measure we have in front of us, but apart from that there is evidence that any chest disease and heart disease can be made much worse by smoking.  Indeed, there is a whole range of illnesses in which the mortality rate, the mobility and actual degree of illness is unfortunately increased by smoking.  Perhaps another less widely known but also a very important factor is the association which occurs between smoking and a pregnancy. It seems smoking is likely to reduce significantly the likelihood of a mother being sure of having a normal baby. There are very many grave reasons why smoking has to be discouraged.  I have used the word &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; several times because, as has been mentioned, there is no doubt at all that for many people smoking is something which they very much like, and it is a habit which it is extremely difficult to break.</P>
    <P>There is also the aspect of the employment given by our tobacco manufacturers and so on, but taking all these into account, the ill-effects are so serious that unfortunately a measure such as this is necessary.  It is necessary in the context of generally trying to bring about a reduction in smoking by, perhaps, trying to discourage people from taking it up in the first instance, or by attempting to reduce the amount of smoking by those who are already confirmed smokers or, better still, by attempting to persuade them to give it up altogether.  Reduced smoking is not safer, it is merely less dangerous.  When one cuts down smoking, uses filter tips or changes to a pipe or whatever, one is reducing the danger and is not in any way doing something safe.  Just changing to a pipe and then inhaling the pipe as cigarette smokers will probably tend to do, is not really very much help at all.  It is less dangerous if people switch to filter tipped cigarettes or if they switch to low tar cigarettes.</P>
    <P>An unfortunate aspect is that very little progress has been made with attempts to introduce safer cigarettes.  It seems as though cigarettes involving tobacco, of necessity involve these serious effects which have been mentioned <Col N="371" /> to us.  Hopefully some day there will be progress in this direction but at present unfortunately it is very disappointing and the era of safer cigarettes is by no means with us and there is no immediate prospect of such.  It is merely a question of reducing the dangers by using filter tips or low tar content cigarettes.</P>
    <P>These attempts to discourage people from taking up the habit of smoking, trying to reduce, trying to use less dangerous cigarettes, or trying to give it up altogether will all be nullified unless a measure such as this is effectively enforced by the Minister.  The power of advertising has been demonstrated on many occasions and I have no doubt whatever that controlling this power is a very necessary measure even though it may be statistically very difficult to prove that one has had such and such effect, because one is trying to prove a negative.</P>
    <P>Control over advertising must be supported by positive measures particularly, the force of example.  Members of the medical profession have a particular duty here not to smoke if possible.  It is fair to say that smoking among the medical profession has fallen very dramatically over the last ten or 15 years.  They are one section of the population who have certainly heeded the warnings perhaps through their sad direct knowledge of the effects and consequences. They have a responsibility not to smoke in front of their patients, or in public.  Another group with this responsibility are teachers, who have a great potential for influencing health. One would respectfully recommend that teachers should if they can, possibly for their own health, give up smoking, and that they should also consider their pupils.  If they must continue smoking they should at least do it in private.  If parents set an example by giving up smoking not only for their own health, but for their children's health, they are more likely to discourage their children from taking it up.</P>
    <P>One group related to advertising in general and to which one would like to appeal in conjunction with this measure. are the people prominent in the entertainment <Col N="372" /> world who set an example for so many of our youth.  People in the entertainment world can set an example here, preferably from their own point of view by not smoking, but if they do smoke by trying not to smoke when appearing on television, on the stage or wherever.  They should try not to advertise that smoking is glamorous, but rather the reverse.</P>
    <P>The actual details of the powers given to the Minister in this Bill are just about adequate at this moment.  One small point here is in relation to the background advertising on which the Minister may be able to enlighten us. Advertisements for cars, for drink and for cosmetics, often include as a part of their background advertising for cigarettes. I would hope that it will be within the power of the Minister to prevent such background or secondary advertising of cigarettes or tobacco products.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the excellent work of the Health Education Bureau continues and that they will increase their positive advertising for health and against smoking. I wonder in this respect if it would be possible to show on RTE, or if it has been already shown, to repeat it, the Thames TV film which was so appropriately named `Dying for a Fag'. The showing of this on a couple of occasions resulted in a fairly significant drop in the number of smokers, perhaps up to 160,000 in the UK, which is a fairly significant percentage of people.  I hope that this film could be shown here. <Col N="373" /> Perhaps the Minister, through the Health Education Bureau, could encourage its showing on RTE.  This Bill is only half of the measures necessary. This Bill is the negative half to prevent advertising and encourage people not to smoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is clearly an attempt to prevent high pressure salesmanship and misleading advertisements to induce people to indulge in taking a damaging drug.  The Bill in itself will not have the necessary strength to put a real curb on the advertising habits of the tobacco industry although it may change them.  I know the Minister had a difficult task in this area, and I congratulate him.  I realise the problem in regard to employment and the question of how to circumvent the effectiveness of high pressure salesmanship.  At the same time the advertising people are in the business of advertising and they will find some way to advertise.  That does not take away from the fact that the Minister has had the courage to introduce legislation and I compliment him on it.  The Minister's Bill will probably not cause too much trouble for advertising companies.</P>
      <P>It might have been better in dealing with this question of health if the term &ldquo;misrepresentation Act&rdquo; were used as it is more appropriate than the present title of the Bill.  We are really talking about nailing offenders and this possibly might be the best way.  I use the term &ldquo;misrepresentation Act&rdquo; deliberately because the Bill talks about controls, but is limiting the Government to preventing advertising in one or two ways.  I do not think it will do enough to prevent the prohibition being overcome by other subtle means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the introduction of this legislation because anything which has adverse effects on the health should certainly be tackled.  Despite my welcome for it I have tremendous concern about where one stops when one introduces measures to control advertising. In a free enterprise society we are generally lectured on the value of competitiveness, freedom of choice and so on.  Where does one go in that respect? <Col N="374" /> Do we finish up having a look at a policy on corporation law to see whether that has some effect on how advertising comes across?  Do we eventually get into the area where the discussion takes on real meaning, for example, in the agricultural field about the effects of hormones on meat and the antibiotics injected into cattle?  Finally, we get some effective research demonstrating that people's health suffers as a result&mdash;do we then introduce some measure of control? If we do set about controlling it, does it mean that we are going to exercise a whole range of controls by a variety of different Departments?  The Department of Agriculture would have one form of control and deal with some problems but many others would be dealt with in a different way and under a different Department.  As we said earlier, we could well come to the point where we might be in trouble about the meat.</P>
    <P>There is a discussion going on now about the problems of the effects of anti-biotics injected into cattle and so on. Where do you properly begin&mdash;and end&mdash;in a society where there is freedom, where competition has been encouraged, where they are encouraged to bring it into our sitting rooms to bombard us and influence our children?  It worries me in another way: if we develop to the point where we are controlling something and somebody says that there is a lot of misuse of it somewhere else and there are health hazards involved and the dialogue begins in that area.  If people who are being, if you like, discriminated against in this case begin to make a case a Minister must listen to them.  He must listen to the objections of people in consumer associations and so on in the same way as he has to listen in this particular area and probably solicit some opinions.</P>
    <P>Where does it begin and end?  We live on the choices of values; because of advertisers we judge the value of what we consume.  I am a bit puzzled about it. I wonder if it is a wise comment at all to embark on controls.  I do not say it is not.  I shall not take on a man of the Minister's calibre in this type of debate. but I wonder is there any way that you can exercise control over one specific <Col N="375" /> thing, and then say that you will not introduce legislation in other areas.  If you do say that you will introduce legislation in other areas, what is the total effect of that on the freedom of competition and so on?  What is the possible effect on employment?  I have always heard in my time as a trade union official that competition and freedom of choice were always the best guarantee; they offered more protection than bureaucratic schemes of standardisation and control. I am a little bit worried about how far we can go in a competitive and free choice society.  Admittedly, where there is a health hazard there is a specific case, but if the health hazard crops up in some other area, in a vital industry like the agricultural industry, can we then say that we are going to exercise exact control to the detriment possibly of the agricultural sector?</P>
    <P>Can you really apply control in one specific area without having a global look at the whole question of advertising in the home?  For example, when we come to the question of drink, we shall have another problem in that particular area.  Both the tobacco and the drink industries have been wonderful sources of revenue to the Irish economy for many years.  It is worrying to think that in our bureaucratic approach to controlling standards we might affect employment in that particular area.  There is a great possibility of one thing leading to another.  Again, if you had a situation where you accuse the media of having influenced you or your children or someone else to become a drug taker, in the sense of using tobacco, and alcohol, would it not follow that the Consumer Protection Association would be entitled to take up time on television to explain all the hazards in the way Senator Conroy explained them a few minutes ago, and explained the other problems about agricultural products being injected with anti-biotics and hormones and so on?  Would that not have the same effect eventually?  Would it be counterproductive?  I would not like to be the Minister having to make a choice in such a field, but when he did I think he went about it the best way he could in regard to the employment situation.  I am <Col N="376" /> still not too happy about the overall question of protection because the goods are misrepresented to the public in a million ways.  We know the codswallop about washing powders, about nine different people using washing powder.</P>
    <P>Where do you begin and end?  This is the thing which has me rather worried about how to deal with it.  I have no objection to the sacred cow of advertising being attacked: by all means, attack it.  It is the problems that it may lead to that I am concerned about.  We live in an aggregate society.  We are all encouraged to be owners; even the fellow in the country likes to own his own ditch.  The minute we get to the point of owning something, somebody has to tell us it is either good for us or not good for us.  So, you come to the dilemna of the whole matter of advertising.  I would not like to see the advertising agencies brought into disrepute.  At the same time I think they have the subtlety to get over many of the controls brought in.  Perhaps in the whole matter we are all taking up attitudes of being overprotective and looking over our shoulder.  We may in fact affect valued industries such as Guinness, Bass, and Murphys and other people that are producing goods financing the economy and the whole agricultural sector could be affected.  It is time to consider this.  Apart from the idea of misrepresentation where you can actually nail down somebody within the terms of the advertising code, I believe a national consumers authority might be the way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be in the Minister's position.  I think he is a great man to take on this task and do it as he has done it. Clearly, he had regard to the question of the effects on employment and revenue because I remember getting a letter from him some years ago when we wrote to him about the taxation of beer telling me that the evidence was that it was very buoyant.  I know that he knows where the revenue comes from.  I would like to have some reassurance on this whole question: if you start controlling one producer even though it is for medical reasons, where do you end?  Is there any way in which you can say to the rest of the people in the country who live in a free society, who are urged to be free in <Col N="377" /> their competition, that you will control one and not another?  I meant to quote from Article 19 of the United Nations Charter but I forgot it and I cannot remember the correct wording.  It deals with the matter of putting across ideas in a free way.  Again how do you allay the fears of genuine firms, producers of goods who are doing their best to be as careful as possible about their advertising?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.  It goes a long way towards meeting the needs of people who do not smoke, who do not want to smoke, who know the effects of smoking and those who have suffered from the diseases which are caused by smoking.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about civil rights in this country but non-smokers are, in a sense, deprived of their civil rights in that if they go to a film, if they sit in a pub, if they sit in a public place they are deprived of the civil right of being able to sit there without being affected by smoke.  Senator West said that he was not too sure about the effects of smoke in the atmosphere.  A United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare document on the health consequences of smoking states categorically that tobacco smoke can be a significant source of atmospheric pollution.  Occasionally under conditions of heavy smoking, poor ventilation the maximum limit for an eight hour work exposure to carbon monoxide may be exceeded, the upper limit for carbon monoxide in ambient air may be exceeded even in cases where ventilation is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on to say that carbon monoxide at levels occasionally found in cigarette smoke filled environment has been shown to produce slight deterioration in some tests on psychomotor performance, especially attentiveness and cognitive function.  This is very relevant in a sense.  Many of us who have been subjected to a smoke-filled atmosphere for a long time have found that on leaving it and getting into a car our eyes are not as good as they were before we went into that atmosphere.  This could cause an accident.  I have felt it myself.  I have often sat at a meeting or having a few <Col N="378" /> drinks and I have come out afterwards and found that the signposts are a little bit hazy.  It is a fact that part of the problem has been caused by the smoke in the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not give non-smokers all the rights that they should have but it does go a long way.  In effect, it dissociates cigarette manufacturers and advertisers to a large extent from the benefits they are getting from sponsorship, particularly in sport.  For too long we have been watching sporting events being sponsored by cigarette manufacturers.  If these cigarette manufacturers are in the advertising game they are there to get the maximum benefit from the sponsorship, not to give the maximum benefit to the particular sport that they are involved with.  Too often we hear of sporting events which are not called golf events or hurling events or jumping events, or in soccer the league event; they are called by the name of the particular sponsor. Somebody ends up being the champion, with the cigarette manufacturer's name inserted.  The public, to some degree might think&mdash;and there are many people who would think this way&mdash;that if this person is winning an event sponsored by a smoking manufacturer, that it is all right to smoke because here are top athletes accepting sponsorship and competing in events which are sponsored by cigarette manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The benefits to the sport in many cases have been very few and the benefits to the advertiser and to the manufacturers have been great.  If you can get somebody to sponsor an event it makes people lazy: they do not have to do the work themselves.  In this regard sponsorships of all natures should be looked at in very great depth by people who are considering them.  After all, what is sport?  It is something from which we should get enjoyment: it is not something from which people should make money.  It is part of the philosophy of life that we should keep our bodies healthy by getting involved in sport, and if we get involved to the stage where sport becomes an advertising medium we must look very carefully at the effects of this.</P>
    <P>Somebody once said that smoking <Col N="379" /> should be confined to consenting adults in private, and I think there might be some truth in that.  The saying has been used in other contexts also.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here about the effects on our revenue if smoking is discontinued. I wonder if we could measure the amount of money that is spent in curing people who have been involved in drug-taking&mdash;which includes cigarettes, alcohol and whatever other type of drug that you care to mention&mdash;against the number of jobs that are being provided because of the manufacture of cigarettes. I feel that you might lose a certain amount of revenue on one side but the benefit to the nation and the lowering in the cost of our health services on the other side would be enormous.</P>
    <P>It was said also that cigarettes are a relaxant; that people feel relaxed when they take a cigarette, and particularly people who have been off cigarettes and go back on them.  People who have been on drugs for a long time, who have given them up and go back on them, find them very relaxing.  People who have been off alcohol and go back on it after a long time find it very relaxing.  One of the features of withdrawal symptoms is that you feel relaxed if you go back on to the particular drug.  I am not a doctor, but from talking to various people I think that there might be some truth in that argument.</P>
    <P>In a particular paper read at an international symposium on preventive cardiology in 1975 here in Dublin it was said that hospital physicians have a particular responsibility for smoking since about 4 per cent of hospital beds are occupied as a direct result of the effects of cigarettes, that stopping smoking is the most effective treatment of chronic bronchitis.</P>
    <P>This was stated at a symposium on cardiology by Keith Ball, London.  He began in his paper on cardiology by stating that the most effective treatment for chronic bronchitis is to give up smoking.  So, there is an effect, apart from the effect on the heart, on the lungs and on the breathing system.  I have never heard a doctor saying that smoking is of any benefit to anybody or that smoking is anything but a habit and that <Col N="380" /> it is detrimental to one's health.  At that particular conference on cardiology, it was said that 30 per cent with first myocardial infarctions will shortly develop new angina.</P>
    <P>Control of risk factors like the cigarette habit show that about half the major events of coronary heart disease occur among the percentage of the population who smoke.  Cigarette smoking also results in increasing heart rate and high blood pressure.  Throughout the symposium it was made clear that there are various other reasons why people get heart attacks and chronic bronchitis, but in each and every one of these papers there is one thing in common, and that is the incidence of cigarette smoking as a positive danger to health.</P>
    <P>A small town in the USA carried out a very major study on the incidence of heart disease amongst the inhabitants of that place and it showed that, of the people who did get heart disease, 60 per cent smoked.  It does not prove that smoking was the cause of them getting heart disease but it did prove that a big proportion of the people who did get heart diseases were smokers.  St. Vincent's Hospital has been doing research work since the early 1960s and it has been shown that coronary patients smoked more than twice as heavily as people in the healthy population and relatively few non-smokers and ex-smokers were found amongst them.</P>
    <P>This is far away from the Bill that is before the House but in fact it gives us an opportunity to talk about the effects of cigarette smoking.  There have been suggestions that we should ban the advertising of cigarettes completely.  If we were to ban cigarette smoking I believe you would have a situation similar to what existed in the United States in the 1920s where in a puritanical type state you had the introduction of a prohibition on alcohol consumption and you suddenly had people consuming alcohol because it was barred.  It led to the gang wars of the twenties and it led, I feel, to the Mafia of today because the successors of those people who began importing alcohol illegally into the States are there today in every area of life in the States, which is not right.  If we tell people that we are <Col N="381" /> bringing in legislation to stop them smoking, this could happen in a different manner here but the effect would be the same.  It would be totally counterproductive.</P>
    <P>Mention of alcohol has been made and there has been a suggestion that we should be treating advertising for alcohol in the same manner as we are dealing with advertising for cigarettes.  There might be a reason for doing something similar.  This Bill is a step towards taking away from younger people advertising which is injurious.  For some time we have had advertising on television prohibited, but if you are watching a golf match for three-and-a-half hours and it is sponsored by a cigarette company the effects of that advertising are much greater than if there were ten 30-second advertisements on in a particular night. As regards cigarette advertising on hoardings on the roadside, I see where Tony O'Reilly in his annual report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> states that the greatest increase in revenue they have had in the past 12 months has been from a company they have in Germany which is advertising on roadside hoardings and that it is found in Germany to be the most effective type of advertising and that is going to grow.  Some people treat these advertising hoardings on the roadside as not being of much consequence, but the effects of these are seen to be otherwise by the advertisers.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House any longer, but I am delighted that this Bill is going through.  It is a start on the road to stopping our younger people from smoking. I think cigarette manufacturers in Ireland are coming to the conclusion that at some stage in the future people may stop smoking, and these companies are branching out into other forms of industry and are spreading their wings. They would not be spreading their wings if they saw that their future lay in cigarette advertising.  I hope that this Bill speeds up the day that they will get out of cigarette manufacture altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. As a matter of fact some of our Italian colleagues say they will be telegraphic. That really means an hour when the <Col N="382" /> Italians say that.  I am disappointed that the Bill is not more comprehensive. Perhaps it is because the Minister has not the power to prohibit smoking in public places.  I notice, for instance, in Italy, it is not permitted to smoke in their restaurants or any public place; likewise in France, people are prohibited from smoking in stores and on public transport. The Government could have introduced prohibition on the public transport which, after all, the Government own.  In some of the taxis here in town there is a &ldquo;No Smoking&rdquo; notice in the front.  This is something that would be beneficial.  The only places that I know of in this country where people are not allowed to smoke are in the Dáil and Seanad chambers and in the churches. You can get away with it anywhere else you would like to light up.</P>
      <P>I do not like speaking of a measure of this kind because I do not smoke. Therefore, I could be accused of having a biased view.  Nevertheless many people like to have something in their hands or like to be using their hands: people who smoke pipes, tor instance, make great gesticulations in the art of smoking a pipe.  I would hope that the Minister's restrictions will not force people to go back to the old snuffing habit that I vaguely remember.  The medical people have never said anything about snuff.  I see it more and more in Europe.  Many of our colleagues have resurrected these silver boxes and I am not sure if snuffing will take on here again.  Some years ago many of the old people had that habit and you always knew them because there was a nice yellow streak down their lapels to indicate that they were not sparing the stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to have the Government focusing attention on this matter because, obviously, it is an educational problem and people should at least be encouraged to smoke with moderation.  I have read that some of the brands on offer have a very low tar content and therefore it is claimed they are not injurious to health.  As Senator Lanigan said, quite large numbers of people who themselves do not smoke yet are subjected to plenty of cigarette and tobacco smoke from other people.  The Minister should endeavour to ensure, certainly in <Col N="383" /> so far as public places and public transport are concerned, that smoking would be prohibited and that those people who do not smoke will not be subjected to the fumes.  I, too, very often emerge from a meeting&mdash;not merely political meetings&mdash;almost with tears in my eyes. I think I would be better off smoking than having to inhale everything else.  In many of the meeting halls throughout the country where there is what you could call inadequate ventilation it is quite a problem for many of us and it is difficult, especially if one is a guest in a place one cannot stand up and start cribbing about the atmosphere.  Perhaps you could get away with it but I would not like to try it.  I wish the Minister success with the Bill, but I would like to express dissatisfaction that he has not taken any practical steps to clear the air for some of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the first smoker in the House to speak on the Bill, what is there left for me to do but give it an unreserved welcome?  The Minister has gone as far as he possibly could in this legislation without interfering with our personal liberty to kill ourselves if we so wish to do.</P>
      <P>At the Minister's behest, amendments were added to the Bill in the other House.  As Senator Conroy pointed out, one cannot be too draconian in this type of legislation.  The Bill defines advertising and it empowers the Minister to control it.  I am glad to see that television advertising of cigarettes has disappeared.  In this consumer age many of us feel that television advertising is an unwarranted invasion of our privacy.  There is little the individual can to about it except to turn the set off.  One can also, as I do, resolve never to buy anything that is advertised on television.  But, unless that is done by sufficient numbers of people, so as to make an impact upon sales&mdash; manufacturers are very sensitive to sales figures&mdash;it is a rather futile exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which the Minister has quoted are frightening: 2,000 deaths per annum directly attributable to the effects of cigarette smoking.  There is a risk of respiratory infection, gastric upset, heart condition and the toxic effect on the unborn. <Col N="384" /> The Government's health warning on cigarette packets is not severe enough.  I would prefer, instead of the elegant gilt script on the side of the packet which tells me cigarettes can damage my health, something stronger on the front&mdash;perhaps in black lettering, the phrase &ldquo;smoking kills&rdquo;.  I do not advocate anything very dramatic like the skull and cross bones that used to appear on bottles containing poison, but I do think the health warning might be a little more definite.  It would benefit housewives particularly who are vulnerable, since smoking for us is a symbol of relaxing.  One feels that there is the occasional five minutes when one can put one's feet up and have a cigarette before all hell breaks loose and the children come home.  Many women who very sensibly give up smoking when they are pregnant go back to cigarettes when their babies are born.</P>
    <P>A recent study by a team of Boston researchers reported that amongst American women under the age of 50 who smoke more than 34 cigarettes a day the incidence of heart attacks is 20 times higher than among non-smokers. An estimated 40,000 out of 100,000 American women under 45 have heart attacks every year and 75 per cent of these heart attacks could be avoided by not smoking.</P>
    <P>I find that social attitudes to smoking are changing.  It is regarded as a rather anti-social habit when one is out at meetings.  I fear that smokers like myself will soon be driven to take refuge behind the locked doors of our bathrooms, which is something I have not done from the time I was about seven years old.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister to an historical precedent for his legislation. King James I of England wrote a pamphlet in 1604 which he called &ldquo;A Counter-blast to Tobacco&rdquo;.  He obviously did not include smoking amongst his bad habits.  He described it as a &ldquo;custom loathful to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, a branch of the sin of drunkness, which is the root of all sin&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very brave of Senator Cassidy to admit she is a smoker.  I do not know how she can <Col N="385" /> deliver that address with such sincerity and then go to her tea and have a cigarette afterwards.  I congratulate the Minister on this Bill, which is the first of this kind of legislation that I have had an opportunity to consider.  I hope it is the first of many such pieces of legislation on a wide variety of areas, because we have to get rid of a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude which has governed too many problems like this in the past.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I have to confess that I am a reformed smoker and I am well aware that there is nobody as zealous as the convert, so I must be very careful not to over-state the case.  It is very important that people who have given up smoking successfully should come out and say that it is not at all as dreadful as it might seem and that it is quite easy once you get down to it.  It would be nice to claim that I had gone through torment in trying to give up cigarettes as I was a heavy smoker, but, I did not go through any torment at all.  We have had lots of figures quoted.  We have all gone and searched for these horrific figures.  I have this terrible statistic in front of me here of lung cancer deaths in 1977 of 1,246. The link between lung cancer and smoking is established beyond all doubt and that figure signifies a most frightful amount of personal suffering by the victims and their families.  As has been mentioned, the work-days lost in the country from related diseases connected with smoking are incalculable and enormous. We must all be mad to be as calm and cool as we have been for so long about this habit.  There is all the difference in the world between alcohol and cigarettes.  There is no such thing as a healthy cigarette.  It is perfectly normal and healthy to have an occasional drink of alcohol.  We cannot go overboard on comparisons between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found some figures relating to the amount of money we are spending on tobacco.  We spent £150 million in 1976. Of that apparently&mdash;I find it almost incredible&mdash;£97 million of the £150 million went to the Revenue in tax.  The next figure I would like to throw out is that it cost £108.75 million to abolish car tax and rates.  If one does a very simple exercise one sees that had we made cigarettes so expensive that the habit became <Col N="386" /> impossible, thus losing £97 million in revenue, we would have £11 million left over to use to convince the people that they were better off without cigarettes and to accept not smoking.  We could have used a good proportion of that £11 million to provide employment for the people who had been working in the industry. That is a very simple way of playing around with figures, I do not for a moment accept that it is possible to win elections by promising to deprive the population of the main drug they indulge in.  Some simple comparisons of the kind of priorities that, as a people, we have had, bear thinking about.</P>
    <P>This Government have now got a very strong mandate from the people and a very big majority in the other House.  I would not keep away from or be afraid of draconian measures in the health area.  I hope that we will have more legislation like this coming before us.  As has been mentioned, we must come to terms with the nonsensical business of having cinemas so blue with smoke that you can hardly see the screen while at the same time, the Health Education Bureau have £1 million to cope with its programme of health in every area.  Its budget is £1 million for 1978.  I do not blame the Minister for such a small budget but, as a people, we will have to realise that our priorities are very strange.  I tried to find some estimate of how much was spent on the advertising of tobacco in this country for 1978 and I found it impossible to get hold of any figure.  But it is many times a multiple of £1 million.</P>
    <P>A lot of people have mentioned alcohol in connection with cigarettes.  It has been pointed out to us, and I am sure the Minister is aware of this, that we have a very dramatic problem affecting children, that is, the refined sugar intake of children which is extremely serious not only for their teeth but for their general health.  I do not wish to have an 1984 type of situation where we are restricted in what we can do.  If people are not going to be allowed to see cigarette advertisements because they are bad for them, sooner or later we must face the fact that little children who watch television programmes in the afternoons are being saturated with <Col N="387" /> advertisements for the harmful substance sucrose, 55 kilos of which we consume a year per head, which is one of the highest consumptions in the world.  One of the highest proportions of family budgets in the world go on sugar sweet soft drinks in this country.  This is the kind of area I am glad to see we are turning our attention to.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister with imagination and determination to cope with this kind of advertising and harmful trend.  As Senator Lanigan pointed out, it is very important that the manufacturers of cigarettes realise and admit that they are, in fact, in a business which kills. There is no simpler way of putting it, they must get out of that business very quickly.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I am always concerned when I see another bit of freedom disappearing. Every time we legislate on something like this another piece of freedom seems to go.  But we need legislation of this kind.  We are free to drive on the left hand side of the road fairly safely when we are using our cars only because we know that the people who are coming towards us are also on the left hand side of the road.  Restrictions provide freedom as well.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on tobacco manufacturers who provide employment and do a lot of good things besides.  So far in the debate they might come across as the robbers of society.  Some of these firms have made great contributions and not just to revenue.  We are attacking one of the dimensions of the marketing mix which is the dimension of promotion and advertising.  In the area of marketing, some of these firms have been instrumental in developing our marketing expertise in a way that was badly needed and in some cases, set up separate companies which provided the kind of marketing service that we did not have before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like the debate to be completed without showing that side as well. I hope that, in time, given that the correlation between tobacco and cigarette smoking and lung cancer has been completely determined, these firms will get <Col N="388" /> into other kinds of commercial activity which will keep up employment and enable them to continue contributing to the expertise that we require to gain the markets that are needed to support our growing population.  The Minister when replying might avert to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Seanad for the manner in which they have received this legislation. It is some considerable time since I have come to the Seanad with legislation which has received such a broad spectrum of agreement and has been so honestly and fairly dealt with.  It is very difficult for me, on an occasion like this, with the captive audience of Senators not to lecture or preach or avail of the opportunity to get across the particular message to which I am, as Minister for Health, rather passionately devoted.  I will endeavour to refrain from doing so. I will deal with the legislation more or less on its merits.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to mention a number of points which were made by Senators.  In opening the debate.  Senator McCartin made reference to one very important point, and that was the problem of alcohol.  The Senator regretted the fact that this Bill did not deal with alcohol as well.  There are two points I want to make in reply to that. The first was dealt with by Senator Hussey, who pointed out that there is a real difference between tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco is totally bad.  There is no way in which tobacco can benefit humanity. Cigarettes are deadly.  Cigarettes kill. Cigarettes cause illness.  Cigarettes cause hardship and suffering.  Alcohol may do that but it need not.  We have to have a different approach to smoking and drinking: to tobacco and alcohol.  We have to try to persuade the greatest possible number of people to stop smoking altogether.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to see as many people as possible not drinking at all.  On the other hand, we must all be sensible and mature enough to understand that alcohol can be one of God's gifts to mankind.  It can be something which is good and enjoyable if properly used. That is the fundamental difference.  I would immediately admit that alcohol is <Col N="389" /> grossly and seriously abused in our society.  I agree with all the Senators who have averted to this fact.  There is a very real social menace of excessive drinking by the young.  But let us not single out the young.  Every age group in our population abuse alcohol, drink to excess and turn what should be a benefit into a very serious abuse.  Without condemning the young specifically, we must recognise that, in their case, it is much more serious.  The abuse of alcohol is far more worrying so far as young people are concerned. We will have to turn our attention to the abuse of alcohol and to excessive drinking.  I am already doing that. So far, I am not doing it in a legislative way but I am, I want to assure the Seanad, very earnestly coming to grips so far as I can with this problem of the abuse of alcohol.  In fact I am meeting a section of the drink industry tomorrow to take the whole process of the control of drink advertising a step further.  While it is not in this Bill it is something that is very much present in our thinking in the Department of Health and in our programmes and policies.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of a total ban.  The attitude of the Seanad generally in this regard is very wise and mature.  Of course, we cannot have a total ban.  Senator Mulcahy mentioned a restriction of freedom but that is something that cannot be said legitimately in relation to this legislation. In this legislation we are not stopping any individual person doing anything that he wishes to do.  We are stopping other people putting pressures on them to do something.  We are removing, hopefully, a pressure of advertising, promotion and sales devices from individual members of the community.  We are giving them freedom.  We are trying to make them more free to decide things without the pressure of insistent, constant, glamorous advertising.  We do not want to ban tobacco.  That would be a serious interference with the freedom of the individual.  What we hope to do is persuade people not to smoke because it is not in their best interests to do so. After putting all the arguments fairly and squarely before them, if they still wish to smoke then we as a wise Seanad will say: &ldquo;that is your own affair.  We <Col N="390" /> have done our best.  If you wish to pursue this course we are not going to prevent you or attempt to prevent you by legislation or any other way&rdquo;.  That is the difference.  We are banning, prohibiting or controlling a particular form of commercial activity which, in itself, restricts people's freedom.  It crowds them, pressurises them and persuades them to take courses of action which are not in their best interests.  What we want to do is remove these pressures and leave the individual citizen, particularly the young person, free to make a sensible, balanced, rational and mature choice.</P>
    <P>The question of smoking in public places also came up for discussion, and it is very relevant.  I have taken the view that it is better not to have an incursion into the freedom of the individual by legislation in this regard.  If you had to prohibit smoking in public places by legislation that could be a curb or restriction or interference with the liberty of the individual to do as he wants to do. One could perhaps argue reasonably strenuously that, by smoking in public places, one individual is interfering, as Senator Lanigan pointed out, with the freedom of another.  We should try and deal with this problem by way of sensible voluntary regimes.  It would be very desirable if in public places smoking ceased.  We must try and work towards that.  Eventually it will come about. Maybe in ten or 15 years' time people will be quite amused that we were even talking about these things.  They will regard it as slightly ludicrous and ridiculous that we were going to the extent of having legislation and arguing about whether or not we should prevent smoking in public places.  For the moment, what we have to do is try and achieve results by persuasion, common sense and wisdom.</P>
    <P>A number of public authorities and companies are already active in this area.  Somebody mentioned CIE.  CIE are doing a very good job.  Aer Lingus are doing a good job.  Aer Rianta have now assured me that they intend to follow suit.  I hope that, throughout the commercial and industrial world, the example of these companies will be followed. The public authorities, the health authorities and the hospital authorities <Col N="391" /> are all now beginning to direct their attention to making more and more public places smoke-free.  Senator McDonald suggested that it should be done by legislation.  It is tempting, perhaps, to do so, but, on the whole, it is better to begin at any rate by seeking to have it done step by step and having portions of public places, in the first instance, set aside as smoke-free and then gradually extend these areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy gave a very good outline of the dangers involved in cigarette smoking and, as a doctor, he is in a particularly strong position to deal with that aspect.  I dealt with it in the Dáil at some length, and Senator Hussey quoted some of the more startling statistics which I gave in the Dáil.  It is interesting that people are prepared to grant the Minister for the Environment practically any powers he wants to stop drunken driving on the roads.  There is no doubt at all that cigarette smoking is a far greater killer than road accidents as a whole, never mind the number of road accidents which are caused by drunken driving.  We are quite prepared, as a community, as a society and as legislators to enact very restrictive legislation on the physical liberty of the individual as far as drunken driving is concerned.  If only people were as convinced and as alert to the dangers of smoking there would be no hesitation whatever in giving completely all-powerful legislation in the area of tobacco.  It has not come to that yet.  In pursuance of the whole general approach to health education, positive health and preventive medicine our approach in this legislation is just right at this moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte opened up a very broad question and I do not intend to deal with the very big, fundamental, philosophic type of issues which he raised. They are very relevant and are the sort of issues that increasingly in our society we will have to come to terms with. Many Senators know that there are an increasing number of people in modern society who are prepared to discard progress entirely because of the disadvantages that it brings.  An increasing <Col N="392" /> number of people are questioning the whole notion of development and growth economics, largely for the reasons that Senator Harte outlined.  Should we have a greater agricultural productivity if it is going to result in antibiotic-infected agricultural products?  They are very deep fundamental questions and very interesting. Perhaps some day the Seanad might have an opportunity of coming to grips with them in a composite and general way.  Perhaps we do, in some way, touch on these questions in this legislation.  I suggest at this stage we could perhaps proceed with this very limited measure without going into the very broad issues as to whether or not any restrictions on freedom of choice and so on are justified.  This is not legislating for the behaviour of the individual at all.  We are not restricting the freedom of the individual to smoke.  This Bill does not say to anybody, &ldquo;Thou shalt not smoke&rdquo;.  All it does is say to certain people in our community who are commercially motivated, &ldquo;Thou shalt not use persuasive techniques excessively to make people smoke.&rdquo;  I find Senator Mulcahy's defence of these commercial organisations interesting.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think that any normal person outside the halls of the Irish Management Institute would be inclined to put the health and welfare of the individual behind the importance of the development of management techniques&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and sales promotion methods.  Sales promotion and management development skills are important but we cannot permit them to be used excessively in promoting the sale of products which have now been conclusively established to be detrimental to the welfare of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I must resist the temptation to lecture and to avail of this opportunity to preach the positive health message, but I am very encouraged to find so many Senators convinced of the importance of positive health programmes and preventive medicine.  Without being patronising I take the liberty to say that this House is far ahead of the other place in wisdom and maturity in that respect. <Col N="393" /> One does have a great deal of sympathy for the unfortunate Senator who has to confess to being a smoker in this rarified atmosphere.  Perhaps we will be able to make another convert before the debate concludes.</P>
    <P>As a number of Senators have rightly said, this is only a step, but it is an important step because it demonstrates that we are serious about positive health. No matter how much money we give to the Health Education Bureau their efforts would be farcical if side by side with giving them a better budget and better staff we permitted the environment to be littered with persuasive advertisement for cigarettes and alcohol.  They would be fighting a losing battle.  In that context I should like the Seanad to look at this legislation.  It is just an earnest of our wish to be serious about positive health, in so far as this area lies within our control to deal with by legislation. There are so many areas in this field outside our control.  Whatever we may do by persuasion, education and encouragement, we cannot legislate for improvement in a number of areas, but this is one area in which we can bring about an improvement by legislation.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Seanad is so accommodating and so willing to give me these powers, because they are fairly draconian powers.  I have indicated that I hope to use them in a reasonable, sensible and graduated way.  Nevertheless, the powers in this Bill are comprehensive. They will certainly give future Ministers the power and the scope to do anything they want to do in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey said she hoped the Seanad would see many more similar pieces of legislation, which is my wish too.  A great deal can be done by programmes, policies and the expenditure of funds.  In a number of areas there will have to be legislation, and I am very encouraged by the reception the Seanad has given this piece of legislation and to know that if I do come back on another occasion with legislation directed to the same ends I will get the same warm welcome.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for a system of fully pay-related social insurance and occupational injuries insurance contributions to replace the existing mainly flat-rate contribution scheme.  Separate Bills will provide for pay-related redundancy contributions and health contributions.  When the new system comes into operation in April 1979, all of these contributions in respect of employees will be collected together as a proportion of their pay.</P>
      <P>Over the years there has been widespread criticism of the inequitable aspects of the flat-rate social insurance contribution system.  The new system is intended to redress this situation.  It will benefit not only employees but also employers as well as improving the system of collecting contributions for my Department.  Later I shall outline for Senators the effects of the proposals but first they may wish to have some background information on the Bill and the purpose of the changes now envisaged.</P>
      <P>The present social insurance system is based on the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which had been added to over the years to form the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1978.  Consolidation of this legislation is in hand but cannot be completed at this stage.  The present Bill takes the form mainly of providing for amendments of these Acts.  Because of this, it is somewhat technical and complex and details of the new scheme may not be readily apparent from its terms.  I hope that the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will be of assistance to Senators in this regard.  I shall, of course, be happy to clarify any matters on which further explanation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the present <Col N="395" /> social insurance system has two funds, the social insurance fund, out of which all benefits other than those related to occupational injuries are paid, and the occupational injuries fund which I will deal with later.  The financing of the social insurance fund is by way of flat-rate contributions, the 3 per cent pay-related contribution introduced in 1974, and an Exchequer subvention.  This method is, in the overall, regressive in its impact on contributors.  The flat-rate contribution, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total financing of the social insurance fund, is clearly regressive and the effectiveness of the present pay-related contribution in achieving vertical redistribution is limited by the comparatively low earnings ceiling of £2,500 on which the contribution is levied.  The maximum pay-related contribution payable annually in respect of any employee is £75, that is 3 per cent of £2,500, of which the employer would pay £50 and the employee £25.  The regressive nature of the flat-rate contribution, in which no account is taken of the ability of the employee to pay, means that, in the case of the lower paid employees, this contribution can be a considerable burden.</P>
    <P>In order to ease the burden on lower-paid workers, the flat-rate social insurance contribution payable for workers with earnings of less than £50 a week was reduced by £1 a week last January.  This concession was increased from April last, so that at present the worker earning less than £50 a week has his contribution reduced by £1.16 a week and his employer's contribution is reduced by 34p a week.  It was recognised when these provisions were made, however, that they were only a &ldquo;stop-gap&rdquo; measure pending the introduction of fully pay-related contributions. The new system will subsume these reductions and so consolidate the benefits given by them.</P>
    <P>The ordinary weekly rate of flat-rate contribution payable by employees, including the redundancy and health contribution, is £3.42 for men and £3.35 for women, less in each case £1.16 for those earning less than £50 a week.  Employees also pay a 1 per cent pay-related contribution <Col N="396" /> on pay up to £2,500 a year. For workers earning £25 a week, therefore, insurance contributions represent about 10 per cent of their pay, for workers earning £50 a week, 7.8 per cent and for workers earning £100 a week, 3.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The flat-rate social insurance contribution is also a heavy burden on the employer in the case of labour-intensive industries.  The weekly contribution payable by the employer, including that for redundancy and occupational injuries, is £5.26 for male employees and £5.21 for female employees plus 2 per cent of pay up to £2,500 a year.  As was mentioned in the Government's Green Paper on &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo;, the introduction of the new pay-related contribution system will, by reducing wage costs in labour-intensive industries, make a positive contribution to the achievement of the Government's employment objectives without involving additional public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It can also be said of the flat-rate contribution system that it is a somewhat inflexible method of financing the services. The income from contributions varies only with increases or decreases in the level of employment and there is no buoyancy of income where levels of pay rise.  Thus increases of income needed to pay increased rates of benefit can only be assured by increasing the rates of contributions.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main features of the proposals in the Bill.  The new system will commence on 6 April next though certain provisions of the Bill, such as those requiring confirmation or variation of rates of contribution before commencement of the scheme, will take effect from other dates.  It is intended that the new contribution will, like the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution which it will subsume, be collected for the vast majority of employees by the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE system of income tax collection. It is necessary, therefore, to start the scheme at the beginning of the income tax year.  Section 6 of the Bill will enable me as Minister for Social Welfare to assign all necessary functions relating to the collection and recovery of contributions <Col N="397" /> to the Collector-General of Revenue.</P>
    <P>I might explain for Senators the reason for the various functions that I may under the Bill assign to the Collector-General.  Though the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution provides a basis for the new fully pay-related contribution system, there is much more involved in the new system than a mere increase in the rate of that contribution.  The new system will see the end of the stamped insurance card. This removes the basic source of information at present on individual insurance records.  Though there are many problems and difficulties inherent in the stamped card system, it can be said that it provides a fairly efficient system of recording weekly contributions on which the social insurance system is based. With the abolition of the card, the main source of information available to the Department for the purpose of maintaining insured persons' records will be the data which employers will be required to submit to the Revenue Commissioners. The collection of this data by the Revenue Commissioners and its availability to my Department will be vital for the efficient operation of the social insurance code.  Without it, insured persons' records would be deficient, and this could lead to delays in payments and hardship to claimants. The collection of the information needed for the determination of claims to benefit will be as important a task for the Revenue Commissioners under the new system as is the collection of contributions. For these reasons, the Collector-General must be equipped with all the necessary powers to enable him to pursue the collection of contributions and to secure the prompt return of information relating to contributions and the duration of insurable employment covered by them.</P>
    <P>Employers will, under regulations, be required to keep records of their employees' earnings and duration of employment and these records will be open to inspection.  Also, information obtained by the Revenue Commissioners will be made available to my Department where required for the maintenance <Col N="398" /> of insured persons' records, the determination of benefit claims and to assist in any action by officers of my Department to ensure that employers are fulfilling their contribution obligations.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to discuss how contributions will be calculated I should perhaps refer to the position of those employees who do not come within the scope of the PAYE system, including employees of companies incorporated outside the State who are paid from outside the State.  These employees, relatively few in number, will pay a pay-related contribution under special collection machinery which will be operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Such special arrangements already exist in relation to those employees for whom the existing 3 per cent pay-related contribution is due.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, a contribution will be due on every payment of reckonable earnings made to an employee up to the limit of an annual ceiling.  A definition of reckonable earnings will be contained in regulations. These will be the same earnings as are used for income tax purposes and on which the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution is collected, that is, gross earnings in cash less approved superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>A ceiling to the amount of reckonable earnings on which contributions are charged is a feature of the present 3 per cent pay-related scheme, and it is being continued in the new system.  Benefits payable are for the most part flat-rate and, in the circumstances, it would be unreasonable not to have a limit by way of a ceiling on earnings liable to contribution. Among countries which operate earnings-related schemes, including those where benefit is earnings-related, there is a widespread practice of having a ceiling which is related to average earnings and is set at a level which ensures that the bulk of the earnings of the vast majority of workers is within it.  This practice was followed when our present pay-related scheme was introduced, and workers and employers are now familiar with it.</P>
    <P>The earnings ceiling of £5,000 specified in the Bill is intended, following <Col N="399" /> the international practice which I have just mentioned, to cover the bulk of the earnings of the great majority of workers.  It is, however, a provisional figure.  The level of the ceiling was determined having regard to the latest information available, at the time the Bill was published, of the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries. Power is taken in the Bill to enable the ceiling to be confirmed or recalculated on the basis of whatever later information becomes available before the scheme commences.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for variation of the ceiling from time to time as required and that, when a change is made, account would be taken of variations in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries.  For obvious administrative reasons the ceiling can only be changed with effect from the beginning of an income tax year and it would, of course, have to be determined in good time before that date to avoid inconvenience to employers who must operate the system.</P>
    <P>Before moving to other aspects of the scheme, I should like to explain to Senators how the ceiling will operate in the case of employees who work at the same time for two or more employers. For employees, the maximum liability for contributions will always be limited by the level of the current ceiling on earnings in a contribution year.  No contribution will be payable by an employee on any part of his earnings which exceeds that ceiling, even if these earnings are aggregated from different employments. In the case of the employer who takes on a worker already engaged in other employment, however, it is not proposed that earnings from both employments should be aggregated so as to relieve the employer concerned of the social insurance contributions which he would pay if he were the only employer. Accordingly, I am proposing in the Bill that such an employer should pay the employer's element of the contribution on all earnings paid by him up to the ceiling.  This proposal will ensure that it will not be more advantageous, in respect of social insurance liability, for an employer to take on a person already <Col N="400" /> in other employment rather than to engage someone on the live register.</P>
    <P>There will be a standard rate of contribution in respect of employees who are eligible for all social insurance benefits.  The effect of this will be to eliminate the present differential in the flat-rate contributions as between men and women and as between ordinary and agricultural employment.  These differentials, which have not been increased for many years and have thus become relatively small by reference to the overall contribution rates, were introduced largely to take account of the lower earnings of the workers concerned. In the case of women, account was also taken of restrictions in benefit entitlements which have now been removed except in the case of certain married women whose benefits in respect of sickness or unemployment are restricted.</P>
    <P>A fully pay-related contribution of its nature automatically embodies a differential between individuals or groups to the extent that their levels of pay differ. There is, therefore, no need for continuation of the existing differentials.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of social insurance contribution specified in the Bill is 11.2 per cent, of which 7.8 per cent is payable by the employer and 3.4 per cent by the employee.  The purpose of the Bill is, as I have indicated, to convert the present contributions to fully pay-related ones, and the rates of social insurance contributions have been calculated by reference to the most recent income distribution data and the £5,000 ceiling to yield approximately the same income as would have been produced by flat-rate contributions and the 3 per cent pay-related contribution.  At this stage the rates are provisional, and they will, like the earnings ceiling to which I have already referred, be reviewed and either confirmed or varied by regulations before the scheme commences.  This review of the rates will have regard to the most up to date information regarding income distribution and the income yields required for benefit purposes. The rates of 7.8 per cent and 3.4 per cent take account of the special increase of 31 p in the flat-rate contribution which was introduced in 1975 to help to <Col N="401" /> meet the cost of the high level of unemployment claims and has been continued on an annual basis since then. The need for further continuation of this increase will also be considered in the context of the review to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The new pay-related system of contributions will apply to all persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts. Employees in the public sector and other employees who are insured for a limited number of benefits of the social insurance system pay special reduced flat-rate contributions but do not pay the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution. Their flat-rate contribution will now be converted to pay-related contributions at reduced rates appropriate to the cost of the limited benefits for which they are insured.  The new rates in these cases will be provided by regulations under section 12 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>The present flat-rate contributions payable by voluntary contributors are similarly being converted into income-related contributions.  These will be collected directly by my Department as a percentage of the reckonable income of the contributor up to the ceiling of £5,000.  Reckonable income for this purpose is to be defined by regulations and will include earnings as a self-employed person.  Rates for each of the three classes of voluntary contributor are specified in the Bill.  These rates are made up of the elements of the standard rate for employees which are appropriate to the benefits covered by each category of voluntary contribution.  As with the ceiling and the standard rate, the rates of voluntary contributions specified in the Bill&mdash;4.4 per cent, 2.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent&mdash;are provisional at this stage and they will be either confirmed or varied before the commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>An outline of the situation in regard to tax relief on the new contributions would, I feel, be helpful as this is not a matter which needs to be provided for in this Bill though it is relevant to the rate of contribution.  As Senators may be aware, at present an employee can claim income tax relief in respect of the pensions <Col N="402" /> element of his flat-rate social insurance contribution.  As the contribution is flat-rate this is a fixed sum each year.  Under a pay-related contribution system, the amount of this relief could change with every payment of earnings made to an employee.  To avoid the difficulties that would arise in applying such a variable deduction, direct tax relief on the employee's social insurance contribution will be discontinued.  In compensation for the extra income tax thus charged on the employee, the overall increase in the amount of tax collected has been taken into account in calculating the employee's contribution and the appropriate reduction made in the rate of contribution.  If tax relief had not been taken into account in this way, the overall contribution would, like the existing pay-related contribution, be shared on a two to one basis between employer and employee with the employee's rate being 3.9 per cent instead of, as I have already mentioned, 3.4 per cent.  That is a reduction of 0.5 of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the rates of contribution are designed to replace the income which would have been raised by the existing contribution system, had this continued. In the calculation of the rates, it was accepted that the cost of the concession afforded in the employee's rate to compensate for the loss of the income tax relief will be met by an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Flat-rate contributions of 19p and 16p are at present payable for male and female employees respectively in respect of occupational injuries insurance.  These will also be converted under section 16 of the Bill to a pay-related contribution at the standard rate of 0.45 per cent of an employee's reckonable earnings up to the ceiling of £5,000 to which I have referred earlier.  As in the case of the new social insurance contribution, the existing difference in contribution for men and women will, therefore, cease to apply. This contribution is payable only by the employer and is paid into a separate occupational injuries fund.  In recent years, expenditure on benefits, which is growing each year, and on the administration of the occupational injuries <Col N="403" /> insurance scheme has exceeded income from contributions and the rate of 0.45 per cent is intended to ensure that the fund remains solvent.  So far as the occupational injuries insurance scheme is concerned, therefore, the proposals are more than a straight forward conversion of the flat-rate contribution since they are designed also to rectify the deficit situation.  The rate of 0.45 per cent will also be subject to confirmation or variation in the light of any new information on income distribution and benefit changes before April next.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the rates I have quoted include decimal fractions and the calculation of contributions by employers who do not have computerised payroll systems could pose difficulties. To facilitate such employers with their calculations, tables of contributions or ready reckoners will be provided.</P>
    <P>The changeover from a weekly stamped card system to one under which contributions are payable only on payment of earnings necessitates some additional legislative changes, the most important of which relates to the contribution conditions for benefit under the social insurance system.  These conditions require a specified number of contributions to have been paid.  At present, a contribution is payable for a person in respect of every contribution week in which he is insurably employed.  The number of contributions paid or the stamps on his record thus represents the number of contribution weeks during which he was insurably employed.</P>
    <P>Under the new pay-related system. contributions will be payable only when payments of reckonable earnings up to the ceiling are made.  When the ceiling is reached no further contributions will be due in that contribution year.  Also, in the case of a person who is fully employed throughout the year and is paid monthly, for instance, only twelve contributions at most would be due in the year but these contributions would represent 52 weeks of insurable employment. Thus, the number of contributions will not necessarily be the same as the number of weeks of insurable employment in respect of which they are paid.  It <Col N="404" /> is consequently necessary in the various contribution conditions to substitute for the number of contributions paid, the number of weeks of insurable employment for which contributions have been paid or would have been paid but for the operation of the ceiling.  This is provided for in section 13 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The new pay-related contribution system in terms of legislative provisions and administrative arrangements represents a major departure from the existing system.  To ensure continuity between the two, section 20 enables transitional arrangements to be made by regulations.  This provision will be availed of to ensure that the change-over is effected without any disruption in benefit entitlements.  It will, for example, be necessary to provide for special contribution and benefit year arrangements for disability benefit and unemployment benefit purposes to cover the period up to the year 1981 when the preceding income tax year will for the first time be the governing contribution year for benefit purposes for both men and women.</P>
    <P>These then are the main provisions being made in the Bill.  Before finishing I should like to talk about some effects which these proposals will have.</P>
    <P>To take firstly a specific case, female domestics in private employment are insured for all benefits of the social insurance system but are excluded from the pay-related benefit scheme at present because it was not possible to arrange for the collection of the 3 per cent pay-related contribution for them.  Because of a more comprehensive system of collection now possible, they will be included in the new pay-related contribution system and will then be covered for pay-related benefit for the first time.  The standard rate of contribution will apply to them.</P>
    <P>For employees generally the new contribution system will eliminate the regressive aspects of the present flat-rate contribution system which bears heavily on the lower paid worker and will relate the level of contribution to ability to pay. It will also remove an anomalous situation arising in relation to the present £1.16 reduction in the contribution of employees earning less than £50 a week. <Col N="405" /> A man earning say, £49.50 a week, is at present liable for a total social insurance contribution of £2.11 leaving his pay £47.39 net of that deduction.  If his pay were increased to £50, his contribution would go up to £3.27, leaving him £46.73 after deduction, which is 66 pence less than he had before his pay was increased.</P>
    <P>The new system, by scaling up the contribution directly and proportionally as pay increases, will prevent this happening. Employees on the higher pay levels will pay more under the new contribution system than by way of their present flat-rate and 1 per cent pay-related contribution.  However, the new pay-related contribution will not be charged on earnings in excess of the ceiling and they will gain in another way.  I propose by regulations to raise the ceiling applying to the pay-related benefit scheme from the commencement of the new contribution system from the present level of £2,500 to whatever ceiling is finally determined for contribution purposes and to maintain parity in future that is at present £5,000 per annum.  So the £2,500 for the pay-related scheme will be doubled to £5,000 provided that £5,000 is the figure finally settled upon. Higher paid workers would benefit from this proposal which will give them higher overall payments of benefits when they are sick or unemployed.</P>
    <P>With the ceiling and rates proposed, employees earning less than about £80 per week will pay less by way of social insurance contributions under the new system than under the flat-rate system. This will mean that, of the employees who will be paying contributions at the standard rate, about 500,000 will pay less by way of contribution under the new scheme while about 200,000 will pay more.</P>
    <P>For employers, the new system will provide a simpler way of collecting the various &ldquo;social&rdquo; contributions payable and will relieve them of the work connected with the handling and safe custody of insurance cards and stamps. The existence, since 1974, of a dual system of collection of insurance contributions, with flat-rate contributions being collected largely by means of the <Col N="406" /> sale of insurance stamps at post offices and pay-related contributions being collected in conjunction with the PAYE income tax system, has added to the expenses of employers as well as imposing an undue administrative burden on the insurance funds.  The new system will thus eliminate duplication of work and reduce costs.  It will also remove the complication and responsibility for employers of ensuring that the appropriate reduced rate of stamp is only used for those earning less than £50 a week.</P>
    <P>In respect of an employee earning less than about £73 per week the employer's social insurance and occupational injuries insurance contribution will be reduced.  How individual employers will be affected will depend on the numbers of employees they have whose earnings are above and below that figure.</P>
    <P>For my Department, the new system will, in addition to the reduction in administrative costs to which I have referred, eliminate certain problems and difficulties associated with the existing card stamping system, including the question of security and fraud arising from the theft, counterfeiting or re-use of stamps. It will also facilitate computerised methods being employed in the processing of information, leading to a more efficient records system.</P>
    <P>I should refer at this point to the effect which abolishing the present scheme will have for postmasters who are paid on the basis of the work which they do. About 60 per cent of income from flat-rate contributions is collected by way of insurance stamps sold at all post offices. Payment to postmasters at sub-post offices for this work now amounts to about £1.2 million a year and this is met from the insurance funds.  The proportion of any individual postmaster's income deriving from work connected with the sale of insurance stamps depends on the extent of such sales.</P>
    <P>This work will of course cease and its cessation would affect the remuneration of postmasters at sub-post offices.  The Irish Postmasters' Union has raised this matter with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and I understand that discussions are at present proceeding at the Postmasters' Conciliation Council which <Col N="407" /> is the agreed body for dealing with the remuneration of postmasters.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo; points out that the need for a tighter system of control of expenditure implies that social welfare schemes are designed in the most effective way to cover the contingencies for which they are primarily intended.  In this regard, as stated in the paper, a review of the existing provisions relating to exclusion from social insurance of subsidiary employments and employments of inconsiderable extent is being undertaken.  This issue is of particular relevance in the context of the new pay-related system.  The inclusion within the scope of the insurance system of employments of a minor nature on which the employees are not mainly dependent for their livelihood could result in a situation in which employees could work minimal hours and pay minimal contributions which would entitle them to flat-rate benefits on a par with full-time workers.  The review will be completed and any necessary amendments to the existing regulations made before the new contribution scheme commences.</P>
    <P>The outline which I have given of the proposed new system has of necessity been rather general.  This is because many of the detailed arrangements of the scheme will be made by regulations.  The working out of the finer points of a scheme such as this involves consultation between my Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and other Departments concerned.  Intensive examination of possible procedures and the requirements of my Department in operating the social insurance code is necessary to ensure that there will be no major teething troubles after 6 April next.  The consultations have been in progress for some months now and whilst some work still remains to be done, the arrangements will be finalised in good time to enable the preparatory work of instructing employers in the working of the new contributions to be completed and the scheme successfully implemented from 6 April next.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in this Bill represent a major development in the <Col N="408" /> modernisation and improvement of our welfare system and it is with great pleasure that I recommend the Bill to Seanad Éireann for its early and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has delivered a very lengthy Second Stage speech on this Bill and I am sure he felt that all 18 pages were necessary so that we would be fully conversant with the complexities of social welfare contributions. There is a good deal of historical data here and a good deal of information on how the old method worked and how the Minister expects the new method to be an improvement on it.  The Minister concluded:</P>
      <P>The provisions contained in this Bill represent a major development in the modernisation and improvement of our welfare system....</P>
      <P>and went on to say that he had great pleasure in recommending it to Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>As I followed the Minister's speech I endeavoured to establish which parties would benefit from the passing of this measure.  I got a clue in the second paragraph of page 1 of the Minister's speech where he said that it will benefit not only employees but also employers as well as the system of collecting contributions by his Department.  I accept that this is to benefit the system of collecting contributions for the Department. There are to be benefits also for the employees and employers, but these, if any, are marginal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By saying that this Bill represents a major development in the modernisation and improvement in our welfare system. the Minister conveys that there are benefits to the people who avail of the social welfare services.  That is not the case.  There may be benefits but they are marginal.  The major benefits in this Bill are administrative.  The Minister explained that under the old system there were two social insurance funds and there were three methods through which contributions were channelled to these funds, the flat-rate, the pay-related system and the occupational injuries system.  In so far as this Bill will tidy up this system of contributions it represents an improvement in the social welfare <Col N="409" /> system, as the Minister says.  But having listened to the Minister's speech and having read the Bill, it is clear that the major purpose of the Bill is to streamline the collection of social welfare contributions. I have no objection whatsoever to that and I have no reservations about it, but I have reservations about conveying the impression to the people who depend on social welfare, or the people who may be in receipt of social welfare, that there are major developments for them because of the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The collection of contributions by the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE system will enable revenue to be collected easier and faster.  By raising the ceiling to £5,000 per annum, more people will contribute and consequently more revenue will flow into this fund.  A provision to ensure that the contributions relate to the benefits that are available to people on social welfare is missing from the Bill.  This was an opportunity for the Minister to have looked at the question of revising the social welfare code and to avail of this opportunity to tie benefits to the level of contributions. The essence of any insurance policy is that benefits should relate to the premiums and to the contributions paid. The fact that the Bill does not go far enough in that direction is a disappointment to me.  The Minister should have availed of this opportunity to reform the social welfare code.  There are, as the Minister mentioned, inequalities in the social welfare code and there are certainly weaknesses in it.  The opportunity was there and for some reason it was passed up.</P>
    <P>I also got the impression from reading the Bill that under this Bill a substantial number of people, perhaps something in the region of 200,000, will find that they are paying more contributions for the same benefits that they enjoy today.  If I am wrong in that impression I will be happy to be corrected.  I understand that in the Bill there is provision to eliminate differences between the rate of contribution between men and women and between ordinary work and agricultural work.  I have no complaint about that but once that happened and they were all brought into line, it would have been desirable that the benefit would apply <Col N="410" /> equally across the board.  I do not believe that benefits will apply equally across the board.  For example, the woman who found herself unemployed would enjoy unemployment benefit for only approximately half the period a man in similar circumstances would.  I wonder why the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to eliminate that measure of discrimination in the social welfare code.  If this scheme was in operation for the past year, and a man was paying contributions on earnings up to £5,000 per annum, and he reached retirement age and qualified for the old age pension, despite the fact that he was paying contributions on a wage of £5,000 per annum, having gone over to the old age pension, would his benefit on a contributory pension still be in the region of £16 per week?  As I said earlier, there was an opportunity here for the Minister to review the social welfare code in general.  Improvements could have been made that are not being made. I accept that in so far as this Bill will streamline the collection of the revenue to the social welfare funds it will certainly achieve its main purpose.  We would be unfair to convey the impression to the people who may benefit from social welfare that apart from the advantage of putting the collection of the contributions on an effective and efficient footing, there are major improvements within this Bill for them, because there are not.  Its main purpose is to streamline the collection of contributions to the social welfare fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the mechanics of administration.  It changes the method by which the social welfare contribution is collected and it changes the amount to be paid by the employer and the employee.  It will be a fair system in that it relates the contribution payable by the worker to his ability to earn.  The lower paid worker will, therefore, benefit; he will benefit in addition to the benefit he already enjoys by the £1 per week reduction for workers earning under £50 per week which the Minister introduced last January.  It will be a more comprehensive system because it will do away with the cards which could, and did, get lost in transit and about which <Col N="411" /> many people feared there was the risk of abuse.</P>
      <P>I intend to be brief in my speech on this Bill because the Bill is comprehensive and deals with all aspects of administration. The Minister in his speech has also been most comprehensive.  It is not appropriate on this Bill to speak of social welfare benefits except in a very general way.</P>
      <P>In a general way I see the need for a system of monitoring increases in contributions and benefits, in so far as they relate to the rise in the cost of living.  In the period 1975 to 1976, for example, the rise in the consumer price index was 16.2 per cent while the rise in the cost of the stamp was 25 per cent.  In the period 1976 to 1977 the rise in the consumer price index was 14 per cent and the rise in the cost of the stamp was 18 per cent.  It is fairly clear that rises in contribution levels must relate to the rises in benefits, and both should relate to rises in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The welfare functions of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare overlap to some extent.  In these two key areas the face of bureaucracy should be seen to be a particularly benign one. Ignorance, in people who are not quite sure of the benefits to which they are entitled, often brings an aggressive attitude, whereas this needs to be dealt with in an understanding way by officials.  Many people, particularly old age pensioners, are confused and unsure of benefits to which they feel they may be entitled.  I had the experience recently of acting as the executor of the will of an old age pensioner who left an elderly widow.  As the House will be aware, one of the benefits to which old age pensioners are entitled is free electricity.  Old age pensioners do not get a bill, but in place of a bill they get a form which sets out the number of units to which they are entitled and the number of units which they have consumed.  Within a week of this man's death he got a bill with a demand for immediate payment.  I, as the executor of the will, had to get in touch with the Electricity Supply Board.  The official there told me that the reason the man got the bill was because he had <Col N="412" /> died.  While I applaud their faith in hoping to collect money from a dead man, I deplore this sort of crazy logic which insisted that until the claim of the widow, who would have been entitled to free electricity, was processed, they were obliged to send out this bill.  This is not a very sensible thing to do.  It creates a great deal of distress.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of this Bill is that I would have liked to see some encouragement to self-employed people to become involved in social welfare and health insurance. The self-employed, by the very nature of their earnings, find insurance of any sort a luxury which they very often cannot afford.  In that regard I would like to see some progress, and some encouragement being offered to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a step in the direction of rationalising the whole social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone to great pains to explain the nature of this new Social Welfare Bill, but as explained by the two previous speakers it is entirely an administrative organ dealing with the collection of the contributions from the insured persons.  It is very difficult to assess the financial advantages which would be minimal.  The contributions are never the great factor in an insured person's livelihood, or in his employment.  What the insured person always looks to is not his contributions but the benefits that the contributions entitle him to.  The matter of designating the level of these benefits is a matter more for the Minister for Finance than the Minister for Social Welfare, but the Minister for Social Welfare would have to be fully conscious of all the problems to which that category of our population have been exposed.  The previous speaker referred to a problem very prominent throughout the community. The old age pensioner and his wife had enjoyed free electricity but the moment the death of the old age pensioner occurs, because the other partner had not reached old age pension age, the free electricity is discontinued.  This is a matter that the Minister should look at, to see that something they enjoyed when <Col N="413" /> they had double income is something that should be continued when the income is reduced to half.</P>
      <P>Our social welfare image is not good in relation to international standards and I am sure the Minister is aware of this and will be doing his utmost in the revision of benefits to ensure that that image will be improved.</P>
      <P>There are a number of sectors which still have not been touched on such as the insurance of the self-employed. This is very important and I thought the Minister would have mentioned it this afternoon: the provision of an income-related pension scheme for industrial workers.  This is a very long overdue social welfare provision that should be applicable to approximately a half million of our industrial workers but which they still do not enjoy other than the flat rate of social welfare pension which bears no relation at present generally and particularly in the future will have no resemblance to the level of remuneration prior to retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that we are not directly entitled to speak in relation to the administration of the system here other than the mechanics of the collection of the contribution and there are some obvious defects that I would like the Minister to bear in mind.  One is the position in regard to appeals and I am particularly concerned with appeals concerning unemployment assistance.  There is very protracted delay, running into many months, after which the continuation of benefits has been decided on before such a person's appeal gets to decision stage.  Secondly, there is an aspect that I think the Minister should note: very many such people look for an oral hearing where evidence is taken on oath and they do not get this.  In the absence of that oral hearing the evidence of some person who is unknown to them and the circumstances in which he got his evidence is unknown to them should be made available to the person whose benefits are denied and discontinued.  I would ask the Minister to bear this in mind and to encourage the practice as far as possible that any person prepared to go in and have an oral hearing to defend <Col N="414" /> the continuation should be given the opportunity to do so before an appeals officer.  In the vast majority of such cases the decision is made without relevance to the person being present or the evidence he would have to offer.</P>
    <P>The other aspect is the protracted delay when disability benefit is terminated before a medical referee is called in.  Again, the benefit is discontinued and a man and his family are obliged to carry on for a substantial number of weeks before he is called before a medical referee and a decision reached. This is a matter which from a humane aspect should be looked at with sympathy to see if it can be remedied.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing today in streamlining the administration and the mechanics of collection, is expanding on the introduction of the 1974 pay-related system which for the first time brought the Revenue Commissioners into the collection system.  This was a long overdue benefit which has brought extensive dividends to those who are unemployed or on sick leave.  But I would pose one situation to the Minister where there is some dissatisfaction.  A person can go on in employment up to 66 years of age and then leave.  His only benefit is his contributory old age pension.  He may have contributed for a number of years to the pay-related system but he cannot benefit from those contributions within the existing structure of the contributory old age pension.  This is an inducement to such individuals to go out a year or 15 months earlier&mdash;because pay-related benefits extends over 15 months&mdash;in order to get what they would regard as a benefit for which they are eligible and which they have contributed towards over a number of years.  I would ask the Minister to examine whether there is any way of overcoming that shortcoming as regards contributory old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the position in regard to the distribution of the free butter to assistance cases and its denial to contributory cases.  No two pensioners living adjacent to each other in a housing estate can understand how one householder is entitled to it and the other is not.  The fact that they were contributors gives them the feeling that they have a greater entitlement to it than <Col N="415" /> those on assistance.  I feel it is necessary to bring these matters to the Minister's attention to ensure that he is aware of what we consider are very serious defects in the existing social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is welcome to both employers and employees.  First, the employers are relieved of certain administrative problems, of all the stamps they have to keep records of and, secondly, they are relieved of the danger of losing those stamps, the value of which can be very considerable.  Thirdly, there is the question of being able to employ a person for a very short period, one day or two days.  Today that is prevented by the cost of the stamp; the deduction from the employee leaves him too little for it to be worth his while and the deduction from the employer puts too great a cost on him for it to be worth his while.  By the deduction being related to the payment for the work done it is fairer and there is more possibility of employment.  In other words, the old stamp to a certain extent was a tax on employment which is now being removed.  Obviously, to employees, it is a fairer system because it is related to their capability of paying.  The more you earn the more you pay and there is relief on the lower paid workers which is also acceptable.  In the administration of it I do not think there will be any difficulty about the employer supplying the Revenue Commissioners with the information required because already employers are asked&mdash;as I envisage it will be asked for&mdash;the information in relation to the pay-related scheme.  They have to keep records to supply those answers.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of questions I would like to ask the Minister.  One, is that I am not quite clear on concurrent employment, how the employer knows the level.  He has got to stop it from the employee if he does not know the level of earnings with the other employer.  In the employer's case, he pays the full amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Once again, I am grateful to the Seanad for the objective way in which they have received this legislation and for the comments which they have made, all of which have been helpful and constructive. Senator Howard made the main contribution and I will deal with a couple of points which he made.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, this Bill deals with the collection side of things, with the contributions, the payment of contributions. It is not intended to deal with benefits.  The review of the benefits and their adjustment to meet changes in cost of living is a matter for the budget when the annual review takes place, and that will take place in the context of next year's budget, the same as usual.  This Bill is really concerned with the other side of the coin, namely the collection of contributions.  There are, nevertheless, a couple of important benefits for different categories of persons in this legislation, even though generally speaking it is intended to improve the collection side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, there is an improvement on the pay-related benefit side.  Senator Howard suggested 200,000 workers approximately would pay more and will get <Col N="417" /> the same benefit.  Now these 200,000 workers to whom he refers would be the higher paid workers and they will pay a little more all right under the pay-related provision.  On the other hand, they will gain very considerably on the pay-related benefits side.  The ceiling for pay-related at the moment is £2,500.  That will be doubled now to £5,000.  The pay-related benefits will be calculated on a figure from £14 a week to £100 a week instead of from £14 a week up to £50 a week as it is at present.  So there will be that very considerable benefit for them.</P>
    <P>There is another class of course which will gain and that is the female domestic employee.  At the moment they are excluded altogether from pay-related benefit and they will now come in for the first time.  Apart from that there is a very, very considerable benefit for a very large number of lower paid workers.  In fact, that is the main advantage of the scheme from an economic point of view and a social point of view.</P>
    <P>Across the board a very large number, half a million of lower paid workers, will gain by virtue of the fact that their contribution, their own personal contribution, will be lowered and the contribution which the employer will make in regard to them will also be lowered.  This should be a general boost to labour intensive industries.  I know that my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, has been anxiously awaiting this legislation.  He is very concerned with the problems confronting labour intensive industries which by and large employ lower paid workers.  He welcomes very much this legislation coming into effect because it will have a very good stimulatory effect in so far as labour intensive industry employers and lower paid workers will be concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard and Senator Moynihan made a reference to a couple of points which are important in regard to the existing benefit situation.  There are certain disadvantages in the existing scheme of things.  First of all, there is the vexed question of discrimination which exists against married women in regard to unemployment benefit and disability <Col N="418" /> benefit.  As you know, the Government are committed to a steady programme aimed at eliminating these discriminatory elements is so far as women are concerned in the social welfare code. We have already started with the elimination of discrimination in so far as single women and widows are concerned. That has been done this year. Now we have to go on to the next stage which is the discriminatory elements so far as married women are concerned. They consist of disadvantages for married women in the personal rates, the time and there is also a very considerable restriction on married women in so far as dependants are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senators may not be aware but we had a Council meeting of Ministers of Social Affairs in Brussels on Monday and at that a directive was adopted by the Council that now makes it mandatory on all the countries concerned, nine countries, to eliminate these final remaining discriminatory elements within six years.  The elimination of these things in the social welfare code is a problem for us.  It was also quite clear to me in Brussels that it was a problem for other countries as well, countries much richer than we are.  The Ministers were not prepared to settle for less than six years.  It gives Senators an indication of the fact that for all of them, and for us of course, the main problem is finance and cost.  Once you start moving, as Senators know, in the social welfare area, because of the numbers involved, costs are always very high.  We are committed. First of all we are committed in Government and we are now compelled by the EEC directive to move forward in this area and gradually eliminate all these final remaining elements of discrimination against married women.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised a point regarding a particular anomaly, which Senator Moynihan supported, and that was the question of the free electricity allowance where a contributory old age pensioner dies and is survived by a widow.  There are a number of snags of that sort which arise in the administration of different schemes.  The only thing we can do is to keep on trying to iron them out, particularly <Col N="419" /> ones that do not cost a great deal of money.  I will have to look into this particular point because there should not be any problem here.  If the contributory old age pensioner dies his widow should automatically be entitled to a widow's pension and this benefit should immediately follow.  There should be no interruption.  There may be, because of some administrative snarl up.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any unsurmountable problem there but we will see.  Senator Moynihan also mentioned a couple of points which, as he recognised himself, are more relevant to a budget discussion because they deal with the benefit side of things and the administration of the scheme generally. The points he mentioned are certainly things that crop up from time to time and about which we receive representations and which we will have to try to deal with as we come to them.  One thing that can arise is where you have an old age pensioner who, through no fault of his own, has been over-paid because his means have increased.  It very often can happen in rural areas that an old age pensioner on a non-contributory old age pension can have an increase in his means and not be aware of the fact that he should have disclosed this increase and later on it transpires that he has been over-paid his non-contributory old age pension as a result.  It did happen in the past that those over-payments were, on his death, claimed from his estate and the estate was deemed to include the pension payable, perhaps to his widow. So you have the situation where the Department would be reclaiming from the pension of the widow over-payments made in respect of the deceased husband. We have straightened that one <Col N="420" /> out.  It is the sort of anomaly that does crop up and arises from time to time through nobody's fault really.</P>
      <P>As these things arise we must deal with them and try to provide solutions for them.  In the same way I hope to be able to have an examination carried out of the points raised by Senator Cassidy and Senator Moynihan and see if we can provide reasonable and satisfactory solutions.  Nobody wants to have a sort of Scrooge mentality, particularly where old age pensioners and widows are concerned.</P>
      <P>I think the Seanad as a whole would strongly support action which we would take to eliminate fraud or abuse particularly on the unemployment side, but I do not think that anybody, my Department or the Department of Finance, want us to be miserly in our approach to the old age pensions, particularly non-contributory old age pensions.  Senator Moynihan raised the point of the delay in regard to disability benefit.  That delay is almost entirely due to the fact that we did not have an adequate team of medical referees.  For many years now we have been short of medical referees but we now have a full compliment.  We have now been authorised in my Department to provide a full compliment of medical referees.  They will shortly be coming on stream and we hope that all these disability benefit appeals will be dealt with right up to date when we get these referees fully active.</P>

    <P>Senator Moynihan also raised the question of the butter scheme, a very legitimate point.  It was I who went after the Commission to get this scheme inaugurated of subsidised butter for the assistance classes.  As Senators know, in previous years the subsidised butter was made available for the community at large and the social welfare classes just had to take their place in the queue and very often were not very successful in that process.  This year we took the initiative in my Department to get this subsidised butter made available especially for social welfare classes.  Unfortunately, the Community insist that it be confined to assistance classes.  We will keep on returning to that situation to see if we can get it extended, but as of now it <Col N="421" /> is a Community decision, it does not lie with us, and the Community have insisted that it must be confined to the assistance classes.  I appreciate the difficulty when Senator Moynihan is trying to explain to two old age pension households, one on assistance and one contributory, why one is entitled to get the subsidised butter and the other is not.  He will have some difficulty in explaining that.  At the moment the only thing he can do is to put the blame on Brussels.  To the extent that we can, we will continue to press to have it extended to the contributory classes, in addition. The existing scheme whereby the butter is made available to the community at large is also being operated this year but at least we have isolated a certain proportion of it for the welfare classes and that is, I think, a considerable improvement on previous years.  I do recognise that there is not much justification in confining it, certainly as far as pensioners are concerned, to the assistance classes.</P>
    <P>I do not think, a Chathaoirleach, that there were any other points raised by Senators but when I study the debate I will certainly take note of all the points raised and see what we can do about the different complaints and certainly try to improve the administration of the social welfare system.  The greatest improvement, of course, that we can make in social welfare is by giving more money, by increasing the rates.  Short of that, <Col N="422" /> there are a number of other little things that can be ironed out and it is always useful to have this sort of debate in the Seanad or in the Dáil because individual Deputies and Senators can give us the benefit of their own experience and draw our attention to particular anomalies or unfair practices which have crept in.  As far as these have been mentioned in the debate the Seanad can be sure that we will look into them all carefully and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for their approach to this legislation.  It is an important step forward.  It has a number of very definite administrative advantages both from the point of view of the Department and of the employers.  I think it also has a general overall economic advantage for the community as a whole, particularly in so far as labour intensive industries are concerned and it has a very important effect on the general body of workers in that lower paid workers will pay less and all workers will now pay in relation to what they are earning and they will not have this flat rate obligatory stamp no matter what their income is.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 November 1978.</P>
