      <P>I have notice from Senator West that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House this evening he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The problem of undue postal delays between Ireland and England.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered has been concluded.</P>

      <P>If the Northern Ireland motion is the only one being discussed tomorrow there is no reason why the time limit of three hours could not be extended.

At the most it could run to five hours.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on section 3 raises the question of the definition of a flat and whether a flat should be included in conjunction with the definition of &ldquo;dwellinghouses&rdquo;.  I undertook for the benefit of Senators Cooney and Molony&mdash;I think Senator Alexis FitzGerald raised it also&mdash;to indicate the reasons for the exclusion of the definition of the word &ldquo;flat&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the time the debate was adjourned on 1 June, the House was discussing the definition of dwellings and the question of the need for a definition of &ldquo;flats&rdquo; in connection with the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo; is defined so as to exclude &ldquo;a separate and self-contained flat in premises divided into two or more such flats&rdquo;.  Senator Cooney said that the difficulty could arise where a mews building had been converted into two residences under the same roof.  He argued that in such a case the parties concerned could be left in genuine doubt as to the effect this legislation would have on them in relation to the occupation of flats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Molony said that a lease expressed to be a lease for an apartment or, for example, a gate lodge could raise the same kind of difficulty.  The Senators mentioned various difficulties of determining if such leases could or would be void.  However, on examination it was found that that had nothing to do with the Bill, although it would have been a valid question to ask under the recently enacted No. 1 Bill.  The only significance <Col N="573" /> of the exclusion of flats from the scope of this Bill is that the lessee of a flat will not come within the scope of the special five-years purchase scheme proposed in Part III.</P>
    <P>Assuming for the moment that the lessee of a flat legally could purchase the fee simple, as I pointed out in the course of the last day's debate the expression &ldquo;separate and self-contained flat&rdquo; is used without definition in the various Rent Restriction Acts, 1960 and 1967, and as I understand it, the fact that the definition is not included in those Acts has not given rise to any difficulty.  This is a perfectly valid precedent because the rights of tenants under those Acts are if anything more important than the rights under Part III of this Bill.  Though it may not be strictly in order to discuss the exclusion of separate and self-contained flats from the No. 1 Bill, as a result of which such flats may continue to be sold by way of lease&mdash;this is essentially what the Senators appear to be worried about&mdash;to have prohibited the grant of such leases would have created serious problems because it is extremely doubtful if such flats can be sold in fee simple at all and such a prohibition would have presumed to settle that question.</P>
    <P>In this context the definition of separate and self-contained flats is considered to be not only unnecessary but also undesirable in the present state of the development of the flats market.  I think the Senators themselves will appreciate that point, being legal gentlement. This whole area has been referred to the Landlord and Tenant Commission and I understand it is also under consideration by a committee of the Incorporated Law Society in consultation with the Chartered Surveyor's Institute and the various lending institutions.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have said, it seems to me that the Opposition Senators may be mistaken in suggesting that the distinction is a vital one so far as the Bill now before the House is concerned. The significance of the distinction is that the lessee of the dwelling-house, depending on the kind of lease he has, may benefit under the new Purchase scheme proposed in Part III, while the lessee of the flat cannot do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The Bill does not purport to settle the question of whether there can be such a thing as a fee simple interest in a flat.  I remarked during the course of my contribution on the last day that this is, of course, a moot question.  The proposals in the Bill are designed to give the benefits of the new purchase scheme to the occupying ground rent lessees of ordinary dwelling-houses, and I appeal to the Senators to view this Bill in that light&mdash;that it is designed specifically for the occupying ground rent lessees of ordinary dwelling-houses.  However, in so far as any difficulty may arise in relation to the proposals in this Bill as to whether a particular dwelling does or does not constitute a flat, the Bill provides a simple and extensive remedy, that is, the lessee can test at arbitration the question whether he has the right to purchase the fee simple or not, and that appears to me to be an equitable remedy.  It appears to me to be a reasonable way out of the present impasse.</P>
    <P>As I have said&mdash;this was reasonably raised by Senators Cooney, Molony and Alexis Fitzgerald on the last occasion&mdash;I am not in any way trying to get around the problem.  I think I have met the problem with the answer I have given, and I hope the Senators will accept the explanation and carry on to the next section.  I have undertaken what I said I would do: I have given the explanation as I saw it and have outlined to them the exact situation as is intended in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony also raised the question of ejectment for non-payment of ground rent and I undertook to find out for Senator Molony when last an ejectment was ordered by the courts for non-payment of ground rent.  Arising out of extensive inquiries, I can indicate that such orders are still being granted fairly regularly.  One such order was granted quite recently.  It is not, however, possible to get figures largely because the court staffs would not be able to say in relation to orders granted some time ago whether they dealt with a ground lease or an occupational rent.  Enforcement, of course, is another matter.  The Dublin City Sheriff has indicated that he cannot recollect ever having to enforce an ejectment <Col N="575" /> order for the non-payment of ground rent.  That answers basically the principle of the Senator's question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for the consideration he has given to this point and for his explanation, which explains the matter, but he does not remove what may be a doubt in the future, but it is only a small doubt.  Is the Minister aware of any official reason immediately coming to mind for using the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  They always strike me as dangerous words to put into a definition section because by their very nature they open wide something that it is intended to be a tight difinition.  To put such general words in a general definition section seems dangerous because they open wide what it is intended to be tight.  It may be just a drafting precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the legal draftsmen have a precedent for it.  I am sure that the Senator, arising out of his own experience, will be aware of the existence of such a phrase in other legislation, and indeed in other definitions.  It is a drafting precedent, I would respectfully suggest.  I can see the Senator's point. &ldquo;Immediate lessor&rdquo; means the person for the time being entitled to the next superior interest in land held by any person whether under a lease or other contract of tenancy.  The Senator is suggesting that there should be a full point there and that the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; might be excluded.  It is a point of view, but I think the Senator can take it that in the circumstances there is a well defined precedent for the inclusion of &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  It is a matter that might be examined by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has the effect of excluding any Minister of Government, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Irish Land Commission from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed in the Dáil, <Col N="576" /> and I noticed that the Minister for Justice made it quite clear that he did not believe the State was being given any privilage in this regard.  I certainly would agree with him in that respect.</P>
    <P>I can understand that there are circumstances in which perhaps it would be economically very much to the State's disadvantage to bind it by the provisions of the Bill, but I feel that the section is very loosely worded to take in, perhaps, altogether too many leases granted by the State.  There are very many State agencies that would come under the section and would be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  I feel that it is wrong that these people, the lessees, should be deprived of the right to buy out a ground rent where the ground rent was analogous to an ordinary tenant in a housing estate.</P>
    <P>It also occurs to me that the State could purchase properties subject to the interest of lessees, and lessees who would previously have had the right to buy out the ground rent and acquire the fee simple of their homes would be deprived of this right simply because the State purchased the head interest.  The Minister said in the Dáil that a detailed study was being carried out at that time to look into this.  He said it would not be ready for Committee Stage in the Dáil but that he felt it might be ready for discussion in this House.  I wonder if the Minister could give us any views, or the results that survey came up with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a number of undertakings in relation to amendments that he would bring forward to the Seanad.  In the main he has discharged his promises in that respect, and a number of the official amendments proposed here by the Minister for Justice directly arise from the undertaking he gave in the Dáil.  In respect of the very proper point of view of Senator Molony, I should like first of all to say I thoroughly agree with him. The Minister also indicated in the Dáil that he would examine the prospect of putting the State in the same position as the ordinary citizen.  In a democracy that is the way it should be.  I would indicate to the Senator that the Minister, though stating that he agreed with the point of <Col N="577" /> view expressed by Senator Molony, said he would undertake a study of the problem.  Unfortunately, the study has not been completed and the effect of that is, of course, that the Minister cannot give effect to the undertaking he gave in the Dáil.  I assure the Senator that the matter will be dealt with in the third Bill which will come before the Dáil in the first instance and the Seanad subsequently&mdash;there is no reason why the Seanad should not take it first.  In the circumstances I think the Senator will have a second bite of the cherry and the problem he sees here arising out of what he says will be cured by the third Bill.  I assure him that there are certain administrative difficulties arising from the requirement to bring about the conclusion he wishes.</P>
      <P>I want to place on the record of the House the general view in relation to the special position of the State.  It was generally considered that the State was not bound by statute on the basis of the old British thing that the king may do no wrong.  I refer to statutes passed either before or after the Constitution of 1937, unless it was so provided by the statute in question, expressly or by necessary implication.</P>
      <P>No expressed provision was made in the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  Recently this view has been called into question and it has been decided accordingly that an expressed provision should be included in the Bill that the State, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and the Irish Land Commission as set out in section 4 will not be bound by its provisions.  The State under this Bill, as is the present position under the Landlord and Tenant Acts will continue to be entitled as tenant to the benefits of the legislation, which is also an inequity. On the one hand they are excluded and on the other hand they are taking the benefits.  This is one of the reasons for the delay in bringing about a resolution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the effect of the provision is that a ground rent tenant whose landlord is the State, the Commissioners of Public Works or the Irish Land Commission will not be enabled as a right to acquire the fee simple.  Tenants of the Commissioners <Col N="578" /> of Irish Lights and the harbour authorities are put in the same position under section 16 (2) of this Bill.  The main reason for exempting the State from the obligation to transfer the fee simple is that the State is not involved in the business of leasing land is a lessor only as an incidental aspect of holding land for public purposes, and that to enable the tenant to acquire the fee simple on such land would give him the freedom to engage in development which would be basically undesirable in relation to the public purpose for which the land is held.</P>
    <P>Whenever the State can divest itself of land it does so.  This is particularly true where the land is to be used for dwellings. The trouble, however, is that in pursuance of this policy the State has allowed some lands to be developed which would associate it with other State activities which in the public interest requires some control to be exercised over the use of these lands.  As an example, for the benefit of the House, these lands include Defence lands and airport lands. Sometimes the parties have entered into these arrangements on the clear undertaking that the State may repossess the lands if required for the national purpose.</P>
    <P>That is the other side of the coin.  The State has its responsibilities.  The land is held, by definition of State ownership, in trust for the people and consequently has to be very careful about its use.  In certain instances where, for example, the national interest requires it, where a national emergency arises, you might find people being deprived of their dwellings. That is the sort of problem that could arise.  I hope it never will.</P>
    <P>I accept, as I have already stated, that the State should not be given any privileges in this regard which cannot be fully justified in the public interest, and, as was indicated by Senator Molony without going over the ground again, the Minister gave an undertaking to introduce an appropriate amendment in the Seanad but unfortunately in the circumstances of the administrative difficulties involved in the extended examination, as Senator Cooney would know, other Departments would have a point of view on the particular subject. <Col N="579" /> Taking all these ingredients into account I can assure Senators that the matter will be dealt with&mdash;I do not want to give a political promise in that regard&mdash;in the No. 3 Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the report of the survey being carried out has not yet been completed.  This is going on for several months now and it occurs to me it cannot be that difficult to form a point of view.  I accept completely what the Minister has said, that there are areas of special interest and the State is in a special position either for security or other reasons, but I am particularly concerned because the State nowadays I think gets involved in many areas of enterprise that formerly it did not get involved in.  I would feel very hard done by if I were a tenant in a property and the Government purchased the property, and simply by the Government purchasing the property subject to my right, I lost a right to buy out my ground rent. That is something which would have no special public interest.  I would urge the Minister to see that this matter is looked after.  It could have been looked after in the present Bill.  I am sorry that it was not.</P>
      <P>I made this point on the Second Stage of the No. 1 Bill.  It is not good enough to give the answer to queries we might ask on this side of the House that &ldquo;We are looking into it and it may be included in the next Bill.&rdquo;  This is one good reason why all the Bills should come before us together so that we will know what we are getting and what we are not getting. The Minister has already given an indication in regard to an earlier amendment that it would have been more appropriate to the No. 1 Bill.  When we were dealing with Bill No. 1 we had no idea what was in Bill No. 2.  Now the Minister is telling us that something is more appropriate and perhaps will be considered under Bill No. 3.  It is a hotch-potch and patchwork system that is very bad and will produce bad legislation.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a small point, which is not really a matter for this House as much as for the draftsmen.  The side notice to section 4, &ldquo;Restrictions on application to State&rdquo;, is rather odd.  Whatever about a Minister of the Government or a Commissioner of Public Works I would not have thought that the Irish Land Commission were the State.  Perhaps before this Bill is printed as an Act somebody might look at this and see if it can be worded more lucidly.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us at what stage these regulations are?  The Bill cannot come into effect until the regulations have been made.  The regulations have to lie for 21 sitting days before each House.  Having regard to the fact that the current rumours are that the Houses will be up within the next three to four weeks how will the 21 days be achieved?

Maybe the Senator might indicate to me that he will give me the Committee Stage if not the whole Bill today. In relation to the next query, I understand that the regulations will come <Col N="581" /> into effect on 1 August.  The problem arises about the 21 days.  I assume they will come into effect as soon as we have an opportunity of placing them on the table of the House.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Cooney will forgive me for laughing because there is really nothing more amusing than the change of spots that comes upon the ministerial leopard when he goes into Opposition.  I am certain the Senator in another capacity brought in scores of Bills of this kind with provisions of this kind.  Every Bill passed, I should think, in the last 50 years has had this kind of thing.  However much one may regret it, one must accept that it is an inevitable part of modern legislation.

      <P>I think the Seanad is entitled to an explanation for this particular section:</P>
      <P>The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This is the provision for expenses and reenacts section 8 of the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act with drafting changes and one change of substance.  This is the reason I rise to put on the record of the House the change of substance.  The change of substance is that the provision for the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister for Finance or the Commissioner of Valuation in the execution of the Act has been dropped and the section now deals only with expenses incurred by the Minister bringing the Act in, namely the Minister for Justice.  That is basically it.  It is very uncontroversial.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) (a) deals with the condition that there are permanent buildings on the land and that the portion of the land not covered by the buildings is subsidiary and ancillary to them.  I am just trying to tie this in with section 15 (3) to deal with partly built-on holdings.  Section 14 is relevant as well.  I wonder if there is any need to allow specifically in this section for holdings where there is a large area of land but part of it may be non-subsidiary or non-ancillary to the buildings.</P>

      <P>Section 9 (1) (a) states that there are permanent buildings on the land and that the portion of the land not covered by the building is subsidiary <Col N="583" /> and ancillary to them.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator mentioned section 14 so it would clear up what he means.  The expression &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo;, as I understand it, is used in sections 9 and 14, as mentioned by Senator Cooney, in relation to land on which there are permanent buildings and which, when certain other conditions are fulfilled, attracts the right, as I understand it, to acquire the fee simple. The expression is also used in the existing law and its effect there is to deny the lessees whose unbuilt-on land is, to return to the expression &ldquo;not ancillary and subsidiary to the building&rdquo;, the right to acquire the fee simple.  The legal Senators would know that these are called partly built leases.  The only remedy available to the leases is to await the termination of the lease and then get an apportionment of the land into (a) the building plus the ancilliary and subsidiary land, and (b) the unbuilt-on land. The lessee is then entitled to get a renewed lease of the portion at (a) and consequently can also get the fee simple of that portion which, as I understand it, comes in under section 6 of the 1958 Act.</P>
      <P>It again comes back to Senator Molony's usage of legal jargon and its meaning in relation to what we intend it to mean.  I know that this is his particular hobby-horse and I say that with respect.  I think that he is right in relation to the drafting of legal documents, that they should be made comprehensible and understandable.  When one reads the expression &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; one will immediately go to one's dictionary to find out exactly what the words mean.  Nevertheless, there are precedents there again and the legal draftsman has an obligation to give effect to it as near the law as possible to ensure that people are not hurt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  There is a real problem involved <Col N="584" /> here, not so much because it is difficult to draft Bills but because it is difficult to redesign the country to ensure that every house that has a garden has it right beside it.  The definition of &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; is difficult The type of problem that one could run into is where, particularly in towns, people have their house in one place and somewhere else they have a garden which has been used as an amenity to the house but might not be said to be, in the legal sense, ancillary and subsidiary.</P>
      <P>I accept, of course, that it is hard to design a Bill like this for every type of situation.  I can see this arising as a problem.  It would be regrettable that the only way out of it would be for a person to divide his or her title to the property because a leasehold would include the house in one respect and a garden, maybe two doors down, in another respect.  Quite frankly, I do not know of any way out of it.</P>
      <P>There is a real problem involved here. &ldquo;Ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; is an expression that has been used for a long time in this type of legislation.  I wonder if the Minister's advisers could come up with some other definition that would take in the word &ldquo;amenity&rdquo;, perhaps, or &ldquo;usage&rdquo; by the lessees rather than looking at the buildings and referring to land that is ancillary and subsidiary to the buildings.</P>

      <P>Attitudes change, the demands of modern living change and consequently people's points of view change.  It is fair to say that expressions like &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo; are for past times.  They are not really relevant in the context of modern usage of modern English language.  In the main, they are pretty irrelevant.  Surely we could put something more meaningful in to express the intention?  However, I would like again to give the undertaking&mdash;I know Senator Molony does not like this fall-back position but it is something that arises out of what he said&mdash;that I will have the Landlord and Tenant Commission look at the matter with a view to updating the words.  I can go as far as that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) gives very wide powers to the person <Col N="585" /> described as the arbitrator.  It says that he may disregard buildings erected in contravention of a covenant if he is of the opinion that it would be unreasonable to order otherwise.  Obviously, the arbitrator, if he should so decide, can intervene between two citizens to change their relationship to each other in the matter of property, with serious property consequences.  I wonder if it is a bad principle to give such wide power to an arbitrator and take it away from the courts, or if it could be unconstitutional? That is my first point.  My second point is that I find it difficult to tie in the reference there to arbitrator with the provision in section 21 subsequently.  Is it quite clear in section 9 who the arbitrator is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that the arbitrator will be a responsible person.  He will have to judge each case on its merits.  While the problem Senator Cooney has raised may become a real issue, I think he can take it&mdash;the Senator would know this from his own experience&mdash;that an effort by the arbitrator to change the contractual relations between two parties might be a very dangerous thing to do.  I imagine that the expression &ldquo;if he is of opinion that it would be unreasonable to order otherwise&rdquo; would be used with a great sense of equity and justice.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 9 (5) corresponds to a provision in section 4 (6) of the 1958 Reversionary Leases Act and that gives the Circuit Court, as Senator Cooney knows, discretion to award a reversionary lease for good reason even though the buildings were erected in breach of the lease.  That is a fairly equitable, reasonable and just proposition, that in certain circumstances a reversionary lease will be awarded despite the fact that a convenant had been broken.  It seems to be a question of the degree of breakage.  In all the circumstances, it seems to be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example for the benefit of the Seanad might be a case where the building has long been in existence with the knowledge and consent of the lessor, or had been erected on foot of a separate agreement with the lessor not forming <Col N="586" /> part of the original lease.  That is a clear and reasonable example of where the arbitrator might be involved.  I know that Senator Cooney's point might not be adequately dealt with in my reply but I think he can take it that we just have to rely on the sense of reasonableness, equity and justice which resides in the person who is arbitrating.  I assume that there is a remedy from the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Deputy O'Keefe raised the question of giving such discretion to the arbitrator&mdash;as was again properly raised by Senator Cooney&mdash;in the course of the first day's Committee Stage debate on 8 March 1978, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 304, columns 1161 and 1162.  The Minister undertook on that occasion to look into the matter and to discuss it on Report Stage.  He indicated in the Dáil that the provision in section 4 (6) of the 1958 Act stems from a recommendation made in 1954 by the Rents and Leasehold Commission Report on reversionary leases under the Landlord and Tenant Acts and the discretion thus given has been part of the law for 20 years.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing against the merit of giving discretion.  I can see that there could be cases where a breach of convenant could be disregarded.  The point I am making is if it is safe constitutionally to give the exercise of this discretion to an arbitrator, particularly when I see the fatal words &ldquo;if he is of opinion&rdquo;.  I have a recollection from student days of a famous constitutional case in which the first Offences Against the State Act fell because those words were in it.</P>

      <P>The point about subsection (5) is that the arbitrator's discretion is limited to determining the question of the right to buy out only. This is a matter which I have not considered, quite frankly, and I do not know whether I am competent to give a proper reply to the constitutional aspect of the Senator's query.  I feel I am not but if I were asked to advise on the street, off the top of my head, I would say that there is no constitutional bar to the arbitrator's powers under this section. That is an entirely off the top of the head opinion and it might not have that much merit.  I think that if I pursue the matter further in the circumstances I will come up with the same answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This has to do with alternative conditions which must be complied with for those who would qualify to purchase under section 9.  This is just a query.  Perhaps I am being stupid about it, but I cannot see the reason in subsection (2) why such a condition should be complied with.  The first part is all right, &ldquo;that the lease is for a term of not less than fifty years&rdquo;.  It goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... and the yearly amount of the rent or the greatest rent reserved thereunder (whether redeemed at any <Col N="588" /> time or not) is of an amount that is less than the amount of the rateable valuation of the property at the date of service under section 4 of the Act of 1967 of notice of intention...</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say why such a condition would have to be complied with?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never accuse the Senator of stupidity.  I understand the <i>rationale</i> behind the PLV rent formula, landlord and tenant law.  The valuation/rent formula was first used in the landlord and tenant law in the 1958 Act.  As I understand it the situation is quite reasonable.  The whole purpose of the formula is to establish that the rent is small and compared to the bricks and mortar to which it relates.  It is an important element to establish this in deciding who owns the bricks and mortar interest, particularly in cases where it is otherwise impracticable to establish ownership. The yardstick of PLV/rent was first thought up by the Rents and Leasehold Commission which reported in 1954. They did not record their reasoning and it seems clear that they adopted this yardstick for pragmatic reasons.  Again, pragmatism has its merits and, in this instance, it worked, it did its job.  It could be said that there was no alternative since the only comprehensive register of property in the State is the valuation lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would agree that the only yardstick as to who owns the bricks and mortar of a house is the market price paid or, alternatively, whether or not the lessee built the house himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, to return to subsection (2), I understand that a new class of lessee is recognised as having the right to purchase the fee simple under <Col N="589" /> the conditions of section 10.  On the basis of the Landlord and Tenant Commission's second report, paragraph 68 and paragraph 120, subparagraphs 2 and 5, the lessee qualifies for the right to purchase his fee simple provided his lease is for a term of at least 50 years, at a rent below the amount of the rateable valuation at the date of service of notice, under section 4 of the Act of 1967, of the date of an application, under Part III of the Bill unless the landlord or, of course, a superior landlord, can prove that the buildings on the land were erected by him or his predecessor in title.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations refer to the date of the demise as the date for comparing rent and rateable valuation. The existing law refers to the date of commencement of the actual purpose of this comparison and the Bill proposes to relate the comparison to a current date. To refer to the rateable valuation in regard to the date of the demise could result in disqualifications of a number of lessees who qualify for rights under the law as it stands, particularly of those who by improving their property since the date of the demise have put the rateable valuation above the level of the rent.  In the circumstances it is not unreasonable. Senators Molony is right when he says that ownership can be determined otherwise than by reference to PLV/rent.  As I understand the reading of subsection (2) of section 10, what we are dealing here with is an additional class of lessee.</P>

It seems that there is not any necessity for complicated mathematical examination before the Minister can determine what the position is.  I am happy if the Minister is prepared to look into it and see what the position is.  There is just one other point that occurs to me.  In view of the fact that rates are abolished on private dwellings, will houses have a rateable valuation?  I assume at the moment that they have not.  How will this condition be worked out?</P>

For the Senator's information, I was approached by a number of people who expressed concerned in relation to subsection (2) and I recommended that they see the legal advisers of the Department of Justice.  They were satisfied in relation to the net points they raised with me.  I could not answer them frankly.

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 11 and 12 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This very properly seeks to protect the person whose lease expires within ten years before the commencement of this Act and the person under that lease is still in possession, whether as a yearly tenant arising by implication from the acts of the parties or under a statutory tenancy under the Rent Restrictions Acts or as a tenant at will. Then we have those fatal words again &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  The section could read &ldquo;where a lease expires within ten years before the commencement of the Act and the lessee is in possession otherwise than the ways set out there&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; could encompass a possession which would not be lawful.  He might be overholding, for example.  He would not then be the only tenant.  He would not be a statutory tenant overholding following a decree in a strict case where the Rent Restrictions Act did not apply.  He could have been out of possession and back in possession again. It seems that the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; could give rights to a person who would not be entitled to them and who was not intended to benefit.  That is the first point I want to make.  Those fatal words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; could lead to difficulties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is that in the case of the <i>bona fide</i> person who is <i>bona fide</i> in possession after the expiry of his lease as a yearly tenant.  His position seems to be more favourable than the yearly tenant dealt with by section 15.  Section 15 applies the Act to a yearly tenant who has been in possession continuously by himself or his predecessors for not less than 25 years. In other words, that yearly tenant has to have 25 years possession before he gets the benefit of the Act, whereas under section 13 one can imagine a case where a person, say, has a ten-year lease which expires and the person then continues as <Col N="592" /> a yearly tenant for two years and 12 years' possession entitles him.  I do not see the argument in principle that a person needs a shorter possession merely because his possession commenced with a lease than in the case covered by section 15 where a person just has possession as a yearly tenant.  Perhaps the Minister can indicate why the apparent difference between the two provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I will return to this question of &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  I take the Senator's point here.  As I have already said, it is my intention to have the matter raised with the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  As far as section 13 is concerned, I understand that a provision of this nature has been included in every Landlord and Tenant Act from and including the 1931 Act.  Its effect is that even where a lease expired at any time up to the number of years mentioned before the commencement of the legislation&mdash;in the case of the 1971 Landlord and Tenant Act the period was eight years and in the case of the earlier Acts it was five years&mdash;the lessee shall, during the ensuing 12 months, have the same rights under Part II of the Bill as he would have had if the lease had not expired provided that he is still in possession of the property at the date of the commencement of the legislation and has not entered into any new arrangement with the lessor by way of accepting a new tenancy or acquiring the lessor's interest.  The corresponding provisions in the earlier Landlord and Tenant Acts are section 47, subsection (4) of the 1931 Act, section 14 of the 1958 Act, section 3, subsection (6) of the 1967 Act and section 9 of the 1971 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am raising is that contrasting it with section 15, which applies the Act to yearly tenants who must be 25 years in possession as yearly tenants, section 13 allows the situation where the yearly tenant can have a lease with a much shorter length of time.  Is there any reason why the figure of 25 years is fixed?  Is it an arbitrary figure or is it a traditional figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert in these matters but to me it seems quite clear <Col N="593" /> what the reason is.  Section 15 deals with the situation where one is a yearly tenant and has a tenancy agreement.  This section 13 deals with various forms of tenancies arising by implication.  In other words, one stays on and the landlord does nothing about it and by implication one becomes a yearly tenant or holds one of the other forms of tenancy laid down in this section.  There is no specific tenancy agreement.  Where there is a specific tenancy agreement there is no great problem about having as long as period as 25 years.  Where it is by implication it would seem reasonable that there should be a lower limit and ten years is probably quite enough.</P>

    <P>In the course of Committee Stage debate in Dáil Éireann, Deputy O'Keeffe questioned the provision of section 16 (2) (c) of the Bill.  He wondered whether or not the intention underlying the provision would be satisfied if the covenant mentioned in the provision were &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; complied with rather than &ldquo;fully&rdquo; complied with as is the proposed requirement.  The Minister for Justice undertook to bring the point to the notice of the Landlord and Tenant Commission. The proposed amendment arises out of an <i>ad hoc</i> recommendation which the commission had made to him.  The commission remarked that the covenants are generally construed strictly against the person who covenanted to perform particular acts.  They also pointed out that covenants whereunder a lessee is obliged to build may take a variety of forms and that questions of construction depend upon the language used.  It appeared to the commission that a number of lessees who would seem to have a moral right to purchase would be excluded under the provision in section 16 (2) (c) of the Bill, as it stands.  They recommended that a fair compliance with the covenant to build would be ensured if &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; were inserted and &ldquo;fully&rdquo; were deleted.  The provision would simply require that the covenant <Col N="595" /> in question be substantially rather than fully complied with.  This is what is proposed in the amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment.  It brings flexibility into the situation.  It is no criticism of the legal draftsmen.  It is as a result of a commitment given to the Opposition spokesman on Justice in the Dáil.  It is fairly given and now fairly discharged here in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Section 17 sets out the provisions varying on the determination of the purchase price of the fee simple where that price is being fixed by the arbitrator.  Several of these provisions are based on the proposition that an expectant future income that will not begin to accrue for 25 years or more has no saleable value, that money will not be paid today for the sake of an income 25 years or more in the future.  Accordingly section 17 (2) <i>(b)</i> directs the arbitrator to take account of the rent, which will almost certainly be an increased rent, that would be reserved on a renewal of the intending purchaser's current lease but only where that renewed rent will be payable within 25 years.  Similarly, section 17 (3) excludes the benefit of the maximum purchase price under the formula in that subsection if the purchaser holds under a lease that will expire within 25 years, while section 17 (5) excludes the formula price if the purchaser's lease itself provides for payment of an increased rent within 25 years.  The provisions of section 17 represent the re-enactment of corresponding provisions of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  The 1967 Act provisions relating to this figure of 25 years in <Col N="596" /> turn were based on recommendations of the Ground Rents Commission.  The commission had evidence that the prospect of an increased rent after the period of 25 years or longer did not affect the sale price of the rent in question.</P>
      <P>The question was raised again in the course of the debate on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann of the appropriateness of the 25-year period.  The suggestion was made that present circumstances might indicate an adjustment of the period.  The Minister for Justice undertook to examine the proposed reduction from 25 years and this is the reason for the amendment before the House.  The Minister for Justice undertook to refer the question to the Landlord and Tenant Commission and this was done.  The commission have since furnished the Minister with a recommendation in the matter.  They remarked that when the report on ground rent was made in 1964, ground rents had a market value of 14 years' purchase representing a return on investment of 7 per cent and income to commence 25 years or more in the future had in consequence no marketable value.  The commission went on to compare that situation with current conditions. On the basis of a current minimum interest rate of 10 per cent, that is ten years' purchase, the corresponding figure is just over 14 years instead of 25 years and the reversion, that is the expected increased future income more than 14 years distant, is as unlikely to attract a purchaser on the open market as was the reversion 25 years distant in 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission have in consequence made a further <i>ad hoc</i> recommendation to the Minister that the relevant provision of section 17 should be amended by substituting 15 years for 25 years.  This recommendation is accepted by the Minister and it gives rise to amendments 2, 4 and 5 which are related to one another and the consequential amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8.  This matter was again raised in the Dáil on Committee Stage of the debate on the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill, and again the Minister gave an undertaking to have a look at it.  The time intervention between passage from the Dáil to <Col N="597" /> the Seanad gave him the opportunity to refer the matter to the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  They have taken all the circumstances into account and recommended that the 25-year period be reduced to 15 years.  That is the reason for the various official amendments proposed by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3: In subsection (2), page 10, lines 17 to 21, to delete paragraph (g) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) the price paid by the lessor in purchasing the land and the amount of the site fine paid by the lessee,</P>
      <P>( ) the number of years in which the rent has already been paid by the lessee,</P>
      <P>( ) the failure of the lessor to make any demand for payment of rent over a period of years,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In general I find it difficult to see this arbitrator as one who holds the balance of power between two contending parties making equal dispensations of justice in either direction.  I do not wish to delay the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I appreciate the way in which the Government have to some extent amended the Bill as initiated.  The purpose of this Bill is at the least to encourage tenants to buy their ground rents and at the best to abolish ground rents, and in view of what ground rent actually is and in view of the longstanding complaints against it the Government, if they are to fulfil if not the letter then the spirit of the manifesto, should weigh the Bill very heavily in favour of the tenant and encourage the tenant to purchase within the stated period.  It is in that spirit that I move the amendments and would ask the Minister again to consider these amendments which were not accepted substantially by the Minister in the Dáil though section (g) was slightly amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that paragraph (g) be deleted.  Paragraph (g) lists, as one of the considerations which have to be taken into account in fixing a purchase price, <Col N="598" /> the costs of expenses which would be reasonably incurred by the landlord reinvesting the purchase money payable in respect of the acquisition of fee simple.  What we have here is a proposal which runs counter to common sense.  We are talking about a transaction whereby what the landlord who is being bought out proposes to do with the money has to be taken into account in fixing the purchase price.  If this is a principle of law it is a very strange one.  Would it apply to things like selling motor cars or selling a house?  It seems to me to be a nonsense. Why should I worry about what my landlord proposes to do with the price he finally gets if I buy out the ground rent? It is none of my business at that stage.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; though apparently accepted by Deputy O'Keeffe in the Dáil does not really meet my objections or go any way to meet my objections because one assumes that the arbitrator would not take into account unreasonable expenses such as was illustrated in the Dáil, a voyage to China. I would move the deletion of (g) as being opposed to sound sense and I would like the Minister to elaborate on why the Minister for Justice thought in the Dáil that if one abolishes (g) one will in some way give rise to a constitutional objection that impinges on the landlord's rights.</P>
    <P>In suggesting that (g) be deleted I also move that the three subsections be substituted. These, too, have been discussed at length in the Dáil.  I do not propose to delay on them except to say it seems to me again that among the factors which should be taken into consideration, bearing in mind that the tenant has been the victim of oppression under the ground rents system, is how much the landlord originally paid for the land and the amount of the site fine paid by the lessee because the vast majority of lessees have paid the full market value for the site at the time they purchased it.  In most cases they paid more than the market value so there is a strong case for saying that the site fine represents enough compensation for the site.  It is germane to consider how much the landlord originally paid for the land and the number of years over which the rent is being paid.  Surely <Col N="599" /> there is a vast difference between the tenant who has been paying ground rent for only ten years and the tenant who has been paying it and whose parents perhaps have been paying it for 25 years.</P>
    <P>The last point which again was referred to in the Dáil is the failure of the lessor to make any demand for payments. The point there was that where no such demand for payment has been made for a considerable time the landlord must not think very much of the property concerned. I hope, if only that the scriptures in the manifesto might be fulfilled, that the Minister would reconsider these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent the arguments put forward by the Senator are somewhat confused.  He speaks, for example, of the tenants in most cases paying more than the market value.  If a majority of people pay a certain amount that is the market value.  One cannot say that most people pay more than the market value.  Perhaps one or two people do but not most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic objection I would have to Senator Murphy's amendment is this. The arguments he put forward were perfectly correct.  They were sound and acceptable except for one little point that he omitted to put, and that is that it is not a voluntary operation.  He is perfectly right when he says if I buy a house or a lease from somebody it is none of my business what expenses they may have in reinvesting it.  He is quite correct. This is not such a case.  This is a case where people are being compulsorily bought out.  I know Senator Murphy thinks in terms of villainous Cromwellian types who have slaughtered the local inhabitants and taken over the land and set up ground rents.  So far as there were such people, as indeed there were, that time is long since dead.  I prefer to think of the widow whose husband has died leaving her not very well off, probably less well off than many of her tenants, but at any rate she owns certain ground rents.  She has a certain income a year. She is compulsorily bought out.  She has to get an alternative income.  Obviously <Col N="600" /> she is going to start buying shares or investing. She is going to have expenses.  It would seem reasonable therefore that allowance should be made for this in order that she should be indemnified, allowing for the fact that it is not, as the Senator would be willing to suggest, a voluntary operation.  It is not a case where two willing partners are coming together to agree by themselves.  It is a case where somebody is being bought out.  That changes the whole thing.  The Senator himself takes the line that ground landlords are, <i>per se</i> objectionable, dishonest or whatever one might like to say and if one can kick them in the teeth one should.</P>
    <P>Then of course one would have a constitutional problem.  However objectionable certain people are one is not entitled to take their income away from them in this way.  There is very little doubt that if this amendment were accepted this section would thereby become unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the reference to market values was ill-chosen. As for the case of a widow, I do not accept that argument.  I do not know what the breakdown of ground landlords or ground landladies is.  I should be greatly surprised if the typical ground landlord was a needy and deserving widow.  Even if she is, let me say that she was badly advised in the first place to put her money into an unjust form of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate on the constitutionality of the section.  I would disagree with Senator Yeats because our Constitution lays a great deal of stress on the common good and on the restriction of individual property rights.  Our constitution was conceived very much in a Thomistic spirit and St. Thomas, if anyone is aware of that gentleman nowadays, greatly emphasised that property without responsibility, without personal involvement, was not moral and in that respect St. Thomas would probably agree with Proudhon's definition of property as theft and in my book property without responsibility is theft and ground rents are robbery.  If one went to the court on the constitutional issue one would get <Col N="601" /> short shrift from any judge who is properly aware of the common good and of the limitations on private property by the common good.  My last word is if he is not then it is time we changed the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that St. Thomas is widely known.  I do not know whether he is widely read or not.  I have heard Senator Murphy, the respected Senator for the National University, UCC, use St. Thomas in defence of his arguments before and I do not think they are any less valid or more reasonable because of the interjection of St. Thomas. St. Thomas was very good on the common good in my limited knowledge of him and I am quite satisfied that St. Thomas would be very anxious to ensure that the widows, for whom Senator Murphy does not seem to have too much sympathy, would not suffer any hardship as a result of this legislation.  There are quite a large number of widows in this community who have ground rent investments.  That is an ascertainable fact and I believe St. Thomas would, in all the circumstances, take into account the widow's common good and her place in the general commonality of the good of society.  She has a place there and we have to protect her against the type of thinking which is produced by Senator Murphy and backed up, according to him, by St. Thomas.  That is totally unacceptable. Without any shadow of a doubt, and I am sure the legal Senators in the Seanad would help me in this regard, if we were to produce the amendment as proposed by Senator Murphy, it would be damned unconstitutional.  It would have no relation to what the Constitution says, good, bad or indifferent, and the court would throw it out as quickly as the Government intends throwing it out.  What Senator Murphy was very careful not to mention was that this was originally a quadrupartite amendment and that one part of that four corners was actually accepted by the Minister in the Dáil and incorporated more or less as paragraph (h).  It was included by way of amendment in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy's whole proposition <Col N="602" /> is, in this instance, confiscatory.  In this society of ours landlords have certain rights and when we were, and when indeed the previous Government were, examining this whole area of ground rents we had to take into account the rights of the landlord as much as we had to take into account the rights of the tenant. One has to balance one right with the other and in the circumstances we came up with the proper formula.  If we were to include what Senator Murphy wants to include in this package under this section we would find ourselves in very serious constitutional difficulties despite all the usage of Thomism to back up his arguments.  I am not being disrespectful to the Senator in this respect but I find it very difficult to rationalise his dismissal of what he considers to be a few widows in our society who have actually invested in ground rents.  When we look at legislation we have to take into account our responsibilities to them in this society.  That is my attitude to the proposed amendments.</P>
    <P>The official attitude was articulated by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil and, as I have already stated, apart from one change, the amendment is similar to Opposition amendments that were moved both on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil and they were withdrawn following debate by men who are solicitors and who know the highways and byways of the landlord and tenant law.  They were withdrawn after reasonable argument.  If they could see their way to withdrawing these amendments on the basis of their experience, both current and past and, hopefully, future experience, then I do not see any reason why the Senator, in all the circumstances, cannot be prevailed upon to withdraw these amendments.</P>
    <P>As I have stated already, apart from one change the amendment is similar to that proposed by the Opposition in the Dáil.  The change is that the present amendment does not include one paragraph that was included in the amendment in the other House.  The substance of that paragraph was accepted by the Minister and has formed the subject of an official amendment that was agreed <Col N="603" /> to on Report Stage in the Dáil.  It is now section 17 (2).  However, the arguments against acceptance of this amendment are as valid now as when they were made in Dáil Éireann by both the Minister and by people speaking behind the Minister.  These arguments were accepted by reasonable people on the Opposition side of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 17 (2) provides that the purchase price of the fee simple shall be, subject to certain provisions contained in subsequent subsections of the section, the sum that in the opinion of the arbitrator a willing purchaser would give and a willing vendor would accept having regard to a number of considerations. These considerations are set out in a number of paragraphs in the subsection. They are only a guide to the arbitrator for settling the purchase price and they are not intended to be exhaustive as paragraph (j) makes clear. Again, paragraph (j) states that such other matters are in the opinion of the arbitrator relevant to the determination of the purchase price.  That is totally reasonable.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 17 (2) taken together comprise a package which was first set out in legislation in section 18 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act which was based on recommendations of the Ground Rents Commission, recommendations which were made with full regard to the constitutional issues involved and which were manifestly fair to all the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The answer to the query as to the constitutionality of the Senator's amendment is quite clear but if the Landlord and Tenant Commission accept the constitutionality of these it may be taken that the constitutional efficacy of what is proposed by the Senator does not bear examination.  The amendment seeks to do two things: first, to delete one of the considerations set out in the subsection, that is, that which requires the arbitrator to take into account the costs and expenses of the landlord in investing the purchase money and secondly, to add new considerations to the list as set out. Paragraph (g) in section 17 (2), which the amendment seeks to delete, was amended on Report Stage in Dáil <Col N="604" /> Éireann and the amendment excludes any possibility of unreasonable costs and expenses of investment being argued in support of an inflated purchase price. The amendment was moved by the Minister for Justice in response to arguments advanced by the Opposition on Committee Stage in that House and it removes whatever sound objections there might have been in the wording of the provision in paragraph (g) which, as has been indicated, originated in substance in a recommendation of the Ground Rents Commission and which has stood the test of experience since its incorporation in the 1967 Rents Act.  To tamper with the package represented by section 17 (2) so as to weigh its provisions unjustifiably towards a lower purchase price could lead to its being held to be confiscatory and this would immediately raise constitutional problems.  Deliberately to exclude paragraph (g) would be unjustifiable and would risk the consequences mentioned. On the other hand, no suggestions have come from any quarter that the corresponding provisions of the 1967 Ground Rents Act have led to any difficulty.</P>
    <P>As regards the additional paragraphs which the amendment seeks to insert in section 17 (2), the same argument, of course, continues to apply and so far as they would tend towards an unjustifiably low purchase price they would raise the question of confiscation and of constitutionality. Clearly the only possible effect the insertion of these additional paragraphs could have would be to depress that price unjustifiably.  What the lessor originally paid for the land and what the lessee paid for the grant of the lease have no justifiable bearing on the price to be paid for what has now been bought out, that is, the lessor's interest under the lease.  The number of years during which rent has been paid and the question of whether the lessor demands rent are likewise irrelevant to the determination of a fair purchase price.</P>
    <P>That, in addition to what I have already stated, answers Senator Murphy's query as to the constitutional effect of his amendment.  There is no doubt whatsoever but that the courts would adjudicate negatively, that, in <Col N="605" /> other words, they would find Senator Murphy's amendment to be unacceptable under the constitutional heading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two general points arising out of what the Minister has said.  I do not want to go back over the poor widows except to say that there are lots of widows that my heart would bleed for before I begin to bleed for widows who are in possession of ground rent.  The very fact that they are in possession of ground rent argues a certain financial privilege in the first place.  The other matter is the logic of the Minister's point that there are men skilled in the law on the Opposition benches in the other House who saw the Minister's point and that a <i>fortiori</i> I should see the Minister's point.  The logic of that is, of course, that no layman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>On some of the points that have been raised in regard to the constitutionality of these amendments I sympathise very much with what Senator Murphy has said generally.  Let me say very briefly that when I read the Fianna Fáil manifesto last year and saw that they were going to abolish ground rents I wondered what formula they were going to devise that could overcome the constitutional difficulties, but of course in the event in principle it is the very same legislation as we had before. The major problem we had when we were talking about widows or very wealthy speculators in effect does not matter because all the rights of private property are guaranteed under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred already to some of the comments made by ACRA and made in the Dáil and again made here by Senator Murphy on the question of what a judge should do in relation to the common good.  I do not claim in any sense to be a <Col N="606" /> constitutional lawyer but I see great difficulties for the adoption of these amendments so far as the ultimate Act would be concerned.  I believe that they would be found to be repugnant to the Constitution and I do not think there is any great wisdom in passing legislation that is bound to end up in the Supreme Court or in the High Court or in any other court and ultimately found to be wanting in that respect.  If we are going to get around this difficulty we will have to change the Constitution.  That is the reality of it.  Perhaps we should be discussing whether we should set about doing that because there is this conflict between the interests of private property owners, or speculators, or whatever, on the one hand, and the interests of justice to other people on the other hand.  One of the difficulties I suppose with a written Constitution is that you have this dilemma.  Having said that much I could not support the amendments.</P>
    <P>On a general point I would like to ask the Minister if he could give me a figure under the formula for working out the capitalised value of ground rents for a figure of, say, £20.  I do not know whether he can do that now.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, it seems that if the Constitution says that the State shall protect as best it may from unjust attack and so on the right, person, good name and property rights of every citizen is there not a strong case for saying that the property rights of a citizen who has been screwed for ground rent in perpetuity are violated?  Is not that far greater violation than the violation of the rights of a man who gives nothing in return for investment? However, there is no point in belabouring the issue and there is certainly no point in pressing the amendment so I beg leave to withdraw it with what grace I may.</P>

Anybody to whom Part III applies for the time in which Part III will be in operation can take advantage of Part III as well.

      <P>No: ACRA have been with the Minister for Justice on a number of occasions.  They are quite happy with the provisions of this Bill. Unless the Senator has an absolute quote I do not think that ACRA ever made such a far-reaching statement. When we were in Opposition a year ago we had many meetings with that very responsible group of people and we listened with great attention to what they had to say.  Much of what they brought to our attention then has now been incorporated in both the No. 1 and No. 2 Bills.  Naturally the Minister for Justice would be concerned to get ACRA's viewpoint in relation to the No. 3 Bill in time, and that is as it should be.  There should be continuing consultation between the State on the one hand and the representatives of the combined residents' associations on the other. Therefore, I do not think the Senator is right but if he can give me a direct quote I will do my utmost to reply to him.  I have a document from ACRA and I have no doubt that the former Minister for Justice, Senator Cooney, will be raising the contents of that document in due course.  I was looking through this document with great attention.  I was ticking off and comparing like with legislative like and was pleasantly surprised to see that much of what this document seeks has been provided for in this and other legislation.  The Senator might pick something out of the document which, by inference, would give substance to what he said, but I do not think he can substantiate it unless, of course, Senator Molony will produce the statement and then I am really in trouble.

      <P>The main points where the Bill falls short of ACRA's requirements are in the following areas:</P>
      <P>(1) No account taken of what the householder has already paid by way of site fine, ground rent, paid to date etc.</P>

    <P>The second paragraph does not seem appropriate to section 17 but the third <Col N="610" /> paragraph would seem to be relevant.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government scheme as we see it is only a purchase scheme and not one that leads to the total abolition of ground rents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 20, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section that limits to five years the opportunities that people will have to avail of the bargains as the Minister for Justice described them. There are a number of points that arise in this.  Our amendment is to increase this period from five to ten years.  There are practical as well as policy reasons for our thinking that this amendment should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place we did not produce the figure which was given by the Minister, that was, that there were potentially 250,000 tenants who because of the passage of this legislation would <Col N="612" /> have the right to buy out their fees simple. From a practical point of view if the Land Registry are to deal with that number of applications during a period of five years they will have to deal with an average of 1,000 applications per week.  Candidly if it happens&mdash;there are complaints about the Land Registry already because they are understaffed and inevitably slow in dealing with their work as a result&mdash;that there are an average of 1,000 applications per week during the next five years or during the five years commencing 1 August there will be, perhaps, a complete standstill in the operations of the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I accept the desirability of getting this done as quickly as possible and if it is limited to five years I accept the argument that people are more likely to be alive to the situation.  However, a five-year period is altogether too short for the job that will have to be done.  The second point that arises on a matter of policy goes to the root of the whole thing because if ground rents are to be abolished the reality is that you make it compulsory for people to buy out their fees simple.  The alternative to that is to adopt Senator Murphy's approach and that is throw the situation wide open but I acknowledge that there are constitutional difficulties involved here.  If Fianna Fáil are to be true to their promise and introduce a scheme that will lead to the abolition of ground rents they must ensure that at the end of this five-year period all ground rents have been bought out.  If you accept that and say that there are 250,000 potential applicants, a limit of five years is grossly impractical and will cause unnecessary and endless difficulties in the Land Registry. A period of ten years might not even prove to be adequate because in those circumstances the average number of applications would probably be 500 per week.  The reality is that it must be extended to at least ten years and possibly may have to be extended after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query on section 21(3) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Titles shall determine the application by arbitration.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell me who will pay the lessor's cost of contending in such cases of arbitration. Presumably this is a case where the fee simple cannot be vested by consent and the lessor is rejecting the application or querying the right of the lessee to have the fee simple vested in him and the matter as provided in the section goes to the Registrar of Titles for arbitration.  That could be a long procedure and there might be serious property rights involved. The lessor might decide to be legally represented.  The question then is: who pays the lessor's costs on the arbitration? I take it that it will not be the Registrar of Titles or the lessee because under this section the lessee's fee is confined to £12 in accordance with section 21(1).  The question arises: does the lessor have to pay his own costs on the arbitration? If so, does that not in effect represent a considerable reduction in the purchase price coming to his hands?  Is there not an element of involuntary confiscation introduced into the procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the point made by the Senator, in other words the suggestion of involuntary confiscation, was examined very thoroughly and it does not arise.  The advice is that the constitutionality of this section does stand up.  In relation to the net point, who pays the lessor's costs.  I understand that the lessor pays his own costs in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>It would be a matter for the reasonableness of the parties. In certain circumstances I would envisage that if there was an unreasonable attitude taken by one or other of the parties, the arbitrator would be bound to take note of the attitude of one or other of the parties and award costs.  The Senator's point is reasonable.  In circumstances he should appreciate that the section will be operated with a sense of proper justice to the individual case as it comes before the arbitrator.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long section and there are some comments of a general nature I should like to make to start with.  If the Minister has no objection there may be other points arising out of his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 introduces the idea of a vesting certificate.  This is a very good idea because it can cut out a lot of unnecessary investigation of tying up of intermediate and original interests in the title.  There is provision for a vesting certificate which will be issued by consent of all the parties involved.  That presents no problems.  There is then a vesting certificate which can be issued subject to arbitration, and which will be issued following arbitration.  So far as the giving of notice to people who have intermediate interests in a title is concerned, the only obligation is to serve notice on people who appear to have been the owners of an estate so far as is reasonably practicable. <Col N="616" /> Perhaps that is just about as far as one can go.</P>
    <P>My main concern is that there is no obligation on the holder of a vesting certificate to register that vesting certificate either in the Land Registry or in the Registry of Deeds.  Subsection (3) of section 22 provides an out for these people in that it declares that:</P>
    <P>The vesting certificate shall be deemed to be a conveyance on sale for the purpose of sections 24 and 25 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, and shall be deemed to be an instrument in the prescribed form for the purposes of section 51 of that Act (which provides for transfer of registered land).</P>
    <P>That, in effect, would absolve somebody from the necessity of registering their newly-found title, or this new branch of title, which goes to the very root of the tree, because in itself it will transfer to the tenant the fee simple.  I accept that it is sensible to find a way around the cumbersome and involved investigation and the bringing together of the various interests that may lie in the title, but I am very concerned about one point.  For example, if somebody is the holder of a vesting certificate and, therefore the owner of the fee simple, what is the position of someone who carries out a search in the land Registry or in the Registry of Deeds for a nonregistered property and discovers that the interest lies with&mdash;whoever it may be?  Presumably it will lie with the previous ground landlord.</P>
    <P>Provision should have been made to make the registration of vesting certificates compulsory, not so much to protect the tenant but to protect, for example, someone to whom the tenant owes a substantial debt.  He carries out an investigation in the Land Registry and discovers that such and such is the case.  Somebody may wish to see if, for example, I am a landlord and have an estate in this city where all the tenants have acquired the fee simple by way of this vesting certificate, but none of them has registered his vesting certificate in the Land Registry or in the Registry of Deeds, in the case of unregistered land. <Col N="617" /> If I tell someone I am the owner of X number of ground rents, or I am producing evidence from the Registry of Deeds that I am the owner of deeds, there is no change in the Registry of Deeds and the vesting orders being issued.  On Second Stage the Minister said that was desirable, but I wonder should it not be compulsory.  We have a system at the moment in the Registry of Deeds where you can rely implicitly on the results of any search carried out there, and the effect of this legislation will be to put in question the validity of searches in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Senator's concern.  On Second Stage I raised the very point the Senator raised and dealt with it adequately, I hope.  It is a reasonable question and therefore I would hope the reply would be equally reasonable.  I understand that in the event of the registration of title issue which might be raised, the following is the reply to the Senator's questions.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, the Bill does not compel purchasing tenants to register renewed titles.  He is saying that perhaps there should be an element of compulsion in the Bill.  However, I think he would agree that despite the fact that the title is not registered does not necessarily make the title useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It does the opposite, the title is guaranteed, I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a perfectly good title whether the house is built on registered or unregistered land.  Section 22 (1) says it will be a statutory title declared to &ldquo;operate as a conveyance free from incumbrances of the fee simple and of any intermediate interests&rdquo;.  In addition it is proposed to keep separate registers of such certificates and of arbitration. In these two regards the vesting certificate will be a better instrument&mdash;I think that is the point the Senator wishes me to bring out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we misunderstand each other.  I accept that the vesting certificate of itself will transfer the fee simple.  There is no doubt about that.  It <Col N="618" /> is a statutory title.  It is as sound a title as you will be able to get.  What I am concerned with is the fact that there will be loose ends left in the Registry of Deeds. Take, for example, the tenant in a house presently registered in the Registry of Deeds in a leasehold title, who buys out the fee simple.  There will be a register kept of vesting certificates.  I accept that but it is a bad principle to change the Registry of Deeds, on which for many years one had relied for a precise position on a title.  Now that will no longer necessarily be the case.  Nobody likes to make anything compulsory.  If anybody buys a fee simple property in the market today, his title is not guaranteed and he has not got priority over any other interest, until he registers it.  That system of registration has guaranteed not just the title but our whole system of conveyancing. The creation of a new register is fine in its own right, but I cannot see any reason why the issuing of vesting certificates should not or could not be registered in the Registry of Deeds.  Only by doing that will you ensure that the information presently available in the Registry of Deeds is complete.  Otherwise the information someone will get in the Registry of Deeds will not only be misleading but will be wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless in the circumstances it might be right that there should not be compulsory registration. A point was made that another purchaser&mdash;and perhaps this might answer the Senator's question&mdash;could acquire title to the property if the vesting certificate has not been registered in the Registry of Deeds.  That is an unreal proposition.  I do not think it could happen. There would be no question of the <Col N="619" /> second purchaser getting possession of the house which, of course, is not the landlord's to sell.  If only the ground rent was being sold to him he has no security for it, while the former tenant had his statutory fee simple.  Why the second purchaser should purchase such a property is beyond my comprehension in many ways.</P>
      <P>If registration were to be compulsory it could only be justified on the basis of giving the service free and this was fully considered both in the context of Senator Cooney's Bill, as I understand it, when he was Minister for Justice, and the present one.  I do not think it was ever the intention to give such a service. As pointed out some time ago, this Bill proposes a reduction to minimal proportions of the legal cost of purchase.  The Government's financial commitment is substantial and there can be no question of having the taxpayer also footing the bill for registration, either in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  The physical impact of having to register as many as 250,000 extra cases over five years could not be achieved.</P>

On Second Stage I asked the Senator to put down an amendment in the terms set out in his proposed amendment, and I did not have the courtesy to reply to him.  To be quite frank, the reason I did not reply was that my attention was distracted on that occasion.</P>

      <P>Section 22 provides that the vesting certificates shall be for all intents and purposes a transfer of registered land and it will be subject to compulsory registration.  I am wondering how the mapping problems will arise if the holder of the vesting certificate presents <Col N="620" /> it for registration.  To complete his title he must have it registered because it is subject to compulsory registration. What will the Land Registry say to him if he presents them without a map, or will the arbitrator in giving it to him provide for a map to be attached to it?</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) proposes that where a vesting certificate is issued in a county with compulsory registration, the registrar would initiate the registration of the vesting certificate. The subsection implies that the vesting certificate will not simply be given to the purchaser in those cases but the purchaser, besides complying with the other requirements of the section, will also be asked to lodge whatever additional documents are necessary to procure registration of the vesting certificate.</P>

      <P>Normally to register one lodges the transfer, and other documents arise only in the case of first registration or where equities are being discharged and earlier title has to be gone into.

      <P>On the registration question I wonder whether there should be any significant cost involved in this.  The Land Registry will be dealing with these vesting certificates.  Would it not be possible for the Land Registry to communicate with their own registration department and with the Registry of Deeds on the question of those properties or those tenants in respect of whom vesting certificates have been issued, and let the Registry of Deeds in their own time close off the history of title that exists in the Registry of Deeds or in the Land Registry?  I am very disturbed about this because people rely on these institutions and the information there is going to be misleading and wrong.  I would urge the Minister to consider that point and perhaps on Report Stage bring about a change.  It is a pity to see an institution like that being abused.</P>

      <P>Solicitors know their way around.  Every solicitor will know the moment this Bill is passed.  If you are selling a premises the solicitor knows all kinds of searches have to be made.  He has to see where the drains are, if somebody has a right to dig up the back garden or to lay a cable or something of this kind, or if there is a right of way.  He looks up those things.  If he does not he can be held for an action in negligence. After this, any solicitor buying or selling ground rents or similar leases knows he has to look in the registry and see if a vesting order has been made.  If he does not do that then his client can sue him for negligence.  I do not see any problem there.  That will be another chore for solicitors&mdash;perhaps another telephone call or visit&mdash;but it is not a very serious matter.  To require general compulsory registration at the expense of the taxpayer <Col N="622" /> would not be in order.  I do not think we need worry too much about giving solicitors more work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that Senator Yeats has made that point, let me say that a search is carried out at a cost.  This means an additional cost to every house purchaser or every person selling a house <i>ad infinitum.</i> Every time there is a change of ownership there will be a search carried out in this new register of vesting certificates.  This will mean additional work for solicitors, but there will also be stamp duty costs and a search fee cost which will be passed on to the solicitor's client.  I do not think that is a good enough reason to destroy the inviolability of the information one gets from the Registry of Deeds.  It is a pity to have a situation in which a search carried out in the Registry of Deeds may be imperfect.  I accept that it is largely solicitors you are dealing with and in that sense I do not think all our conveyancing is going to be turned upside down by this.</P>
      <P>I am approaching this in a practical way, and in a way that I think solicitors would like it to be approached.  Nowadays there are people who try to convey their own property.  Whether you are talking about a private individual, solicitors or anybody else, it is a general principle that the fewer institutions involved the better and the simpler the system the better.  We are talking about a very small cost&mdash;the cost of registration. The cost of a memorandum is £4. The cost of a search&mdash;it depends on the amount of searching involved&mdash;would certainly be £3 or £4.  It would be simple, practical and would maintain the reliance that solicitors and private individuals place on the Registry of Deeds searches.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 23.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an explanation from the Minister on this.  If the application of a person applying to buy the fee simple is contested by the ground <Col N="623" /> landlord the applicant, that is the tenant, has to pay fees of £17 to obtain his vesting certificate.  He now has his vesting certificate but that does not complete his title.  He has to register his title to comply with the provisions of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 because it is only on registration that his title becomes total.  He then has to go to the registrar to register this vesting certificate. I have no doubt that the first thing the registrar will direct him to do is to get an accurate map of the property, certified by a competent engineer and drawn to a sufficient scale to identify the property.  The cost of this map will not be less than £15 or £20 and it could go as much as £35.  We will take a mean figure of £20.  An extra £20 has to be added to the £17 he has paid for the vesting certificate.  In addition subsection (3) says that:</P>
      <P>With the exception of fees fixed in respect of the cases mentioned in <i>sub-section (1)</i></P>
      <P>that is, the £5 and £12</P>
      <P>  the fees shall, so far as possible,</P>
      <P>the fees to be charged by the registrar for registering the vesting certificate</P>
      <P>be so fixed as to meet the full cost of dealing with the relevant application.</P>
      <P>There is an unknown fee still to be paid by the person getting this tremendous bargain.  He is already liable for up to £17, £20 for a map, plus an unknown fee yet to be fixed.  In accordance with the normal practice of Land Registry law the Land Registry has to be self-supporting financially and it is provided in this legislation that that principle be continued and that the fees fixed shall meet the full cost of dealing with the relevant applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad to know if the Minister at this stage has any idea of what the level of fees will be for registering vesting certificates so as to complete the title of the people who buy out their ground rents compulsorily.  As I indicated, they already have had to pay up to £17 for the vesting certificate, plus £20 for the map, plus any other documents which may be required by the <Col N="624" /> registrar&mdash;I do not know what they might be but they could be expensive. He would also have to pay the fee to the Land Registry, a fee which must be the economic cost of that particular dealing. I would like the Minister to give us some idea what the level of these fees will be. The Minister indicated on Second Stage that extra staff have been, or are in the course of being, recruited into the Land Registry.  I would be grateful if he would tell us the number of staff involved, the annual cost of such staff and where they are going to be housed.  I do not think there is any more room in the Land Registry.  I may be wrong in that, but I understood it is already overcrowded. Are they going to be housed in the Land Registry or will they be in some other building&mdash;I recall that some parts of the mapping section of the Land Registry are already housed in other buildings&mdash;and if so, what will be the cost of these extra or new buildings? Then we will have some idea of the cost to the State of this new procedure.  That cost has to be recouped from the applicants. When the person's title is finally registered, this cheap scheme might not be as cheap as he was originally led to believe when the question of the simple £5 note was being dangled in front of him.  It was only the beginning of the story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already stated, the Minister for Justice in the Dáil and elsewhere mentioned that the fee to be taken by the Land Registry for the issuing of the vesting certificate under section 22 in cases where the applicant is in occupation of the dwelling-house will be £5, and for an arbitration under section 21 it will be an extra £12 where the applicant is in occupation of the dwelling-house and where there may be some contest over it.  In those circumstances the Minister for Justice described the fees and the general purchase of the ground rent as the bargain of a lifetime. This does not apply to Senator Cooney's point but I think it highlights one of the basic principles involved in this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, to buy out your fee simple it is £5 if it is uncontested and if <Col N="625" /> there is some question about it there is an additional £12, £17 in all, which I regard as an extraordinarily reasonable figure.  The fees fixed by subsection (1) are, as I have mentioned, little more than nominal and will involve support from State funds for purchasers in occupation who apply under Part III.  However, no case exists for extending that financial support to ground rent tenants of dwelling-houses who are not in occupation and who wish to purchase the fee simple.  Such persons in relation to the dwelling-house in question are in a position quite different from that of the ground rent tenant who is concerned to obtain the full ownership of his own home.</P>
    <P>The non-occupying ground rent tenant stands rather in a business relationship to the property and has the option of acquiring the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act procedure. It is of some interest in this connection that non-occupying ground rent tenants in certain cases are excluded from the right of purchase under the 1967 Act and are now being given the right under the proposals in Part II of this Bill.  The change arises from the deletion of section 3 (2) (d) of the 1967 Act that in certain cases the property must comprise a tenement. One of the requirements of a tenement is that a tenant is in occupation of the property.  This requirement in this instance is being dropped, and accordingly non-occupying ground rent tenants who apply to purchase the fee simple through the Land Registry should be subject to the ordinary rule that the Land Registry, as Senator Cooney quite properly pointed out, must be self-supporting in its operation.  Therefore, subsection (3) proposes in effect that the fees payable by such applicants shall as far as possible be fixed so as to meet the cost of dealing with the applications.  What that cost will be will have to be estimated to begin with and corrected later, if necessary, on the basis of experience.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) includes provision for fixing the fees and if necessary varying, so I cannot answer the Senator's question in relation to the exact amount of the fee that will be required.  That will be worked out, I understand, from the experience of day to day dealings between <Col N="626" /> the individuals concerned, but I assure the Senator that these fees will be kept to a very minimal figure in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the question of the number of additional persons who will be taken on to perform the functions of the requirements of the Bill.  He also raised the question of accommodation for those people and the cost.  I am not certain whether they are available but I assure him that in all the circumstances the number of people who will be inducted into the section will be adequate to deal with the number of applicants during the next five years.</P>

We believe we can achieve that perfection. What we are saying is that in the light of our experience we will adjust the scheme to ensure that every individual holder of a ground rent or applicant who seeks to buy out the fee simple will be notified. All we can do is to bring continually to the attention of the people, the public&mdash;the 250,000 people the Senator has mentioned&mdash;the proposals in this scheme.  There is no compulsion on the Government or indeed there is no requirement in the Bill to catch somebody by the neck and tell him &ldquo;Come on up to the Land Registry, get your vesting certificate and buy out your ground rent&rdquo;.  We cannot do that.  After the operation of the scheme for 12 or 18 months we will see how many people have availed of the opportunity of this bargain of a lifetime.  If those people can see that they are being given the bargain of a lifetime we will try to give it to them as best we can and we will try to give them the knowledge and the information they require to see the advantages of the scheme.</P>

The question is whether they should be in totally or not in at all.  My view is that if they come in it should be totally.  I reject the Minister's compromise as drafted in the Bill.  My amendment is drafted to clear the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not want to appear unreasonable to the Senator, and I agree that he felt that local authority tenants in all the circumstances should have the same rights as the citizen who owns his or her own house.  I do not want to raise that argument again.  In all the circumstances the amendment proposed is not acceptable.  The Chair has said that amendment No. 11 is consequential. As I understand it, Senator Cooney, speaking on the Second Stage of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1978 indicated that he did not agree with the principle of selling local authority houses in fee simple because of the cost to the community of the provision of such houses and the likelihood that they would pass completely from public control.  To say the least of it, it is unusual that this amendment should be raised in the light of the Senator's philosophy.  Senator Molony did not agree with Senator Cooney on that occasion.  This subsection as originally proposed provided that the 25-year period would be calculated from the date of acquisition of the fee simple by the purchaser.  It was proposed at Committee Stage in the Dáil and accepted by the Minister for Justice that the public interest could be satisfactorily protected by allowing the 25-year period to operate from the date of the original leasing by the housing authority rather than the date of acquisition of the fee simple by the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a significant and reasonable breakthrough.  The result of the amendment in the Dáil to that section is that the present owners of thousands of local authority houses will be able to obtain the unfettered fee simple <Col N="632" /> interest in the dwellings where the houses were sold by local authorities more than 25 years ago and payment of the purchase price has been fully discharged. I think that the Senators would agree that having regard to the cost to the community of local authority houses to which Senator Cooney previously alluded, and also the fact that because these houses are sold on subsidised terms to tenants, it is only reasonable that local authorities should be in a position to ensure that the houses will continue to be used as normal dwelling-houses and that a tenant purchaser does not resell his house at a profit and then apply to a local authority to be rehoused.</P>

      <P>The circumstances are that the local authorities should have the right to have a hold on the houses for the period suggested.  I should like to make it very clear that the proposal in the amendment by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil that the public interest could be satisfactorily protected by allowing the 25-year period to operate from the date of the acquisition of the fee simple by the purchaser is a considerable breakthrough.  It goes away basically from the intention of the Bill as originally drafted.  In the nature of things I do not think many tenants will be adversely affected by the section.  It is a principle that should be adhered to and I do not see any reason to depart from it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an enabling measure to raise the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund from £1,000 million to £1,500 million. The fund is simply a mechanism for channelling money to local authorities. Revising the statutory limit has no policy implications for the programmes financed through the fund; the financial allocations for these programmes are determined annually in the budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Exchequer loans are made through the fund to finance essential capital services of the local authorities, including health boards, vocational education committees and harbour authorities.  The Local Loans Fund Act, 1935 which set up the fund imposed a limit of £5 million on total issues.  The limit has been increased periodically by successive enactments and was last fixed at £1,000 million in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities have become increasingly dependent on the fund.  In 1977 more than 92 per cent of their capital expenditure was financed from that source, e.g., housing, sanitary services, vocational schools, hospitals, harbours and itinerant resettlement.  Issues from the fund have increased substantially in recent years.  The level of annual issues has risen from £112 million last year to an estimated £150 million in <Col N="634" /> 1978.  This reflects mainly the increased provision for the local authority house purchase loan scheme, the loan and eligibility limits of which were increased by the Government on taking office last July.  Extra funds are also being provided for sanitary services for the purpose of new housing development and to provide infrastructure for new industry.</P>
    <P>At 31 March 1978 total issues from the fund were £968 million, of which £485 million was for local authority dwellings, £255 million was for house purchase loans and supplementary grants and £153 million for sanitary services. The balance of £75 million was provided for vocational schools, hospitals, harbour works, libraries, itinerant resettlement, fire stations and so on.  At the present rate of issues from the fund the limit will be reached this month.  It will be necessary to raise the limit substantially to provide for estimated requirements over the next few years.  Accordingly a new limit of £1,500 million is proposed in the Bill which I trust will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House welcomes the Bill.  The increase of £500 million in the maximum available is an enormous increase.  If we take into account the effects of inflation it might not be as great as it appears on the surface. Nevertheless, it is an increase and we welcome it.  We hope that the moneys will be readily available to the local authorities, which depend to a large extent on borrowings from the Local Loans Fund.  We also hope that hints from high places of a cut back on public expenditure do not indicate that money to local authorities under this heading will not be readily available in future for the many schemes they might have in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large percentage of this money will, as in the past, be used to provide housing. I hope the local authorities will be encouraged and helped to apportion land and service it for the provision of housing sites.  Failure to do that in years past has meant that people who would normally be in a position to provide their own housing now find that the cost of purchasing a site, which in some provincial areas has gone as high as £3,000 to <Col N="635" /> £4,000, means that they cannot do so. This is something that has built up over the years and cannot be readily eliminated.</P>
    <P>The huge increase in the cost of housing sites and the fact that so many local authorities have done little or nothing to provide serviced sites is a matter of grave concern.  It is good business to help people who would set about providing their own housing as otherwise the State will have to do this.  I would recommend to the Minister that the local authorities be encouraged to provide serviced sites convenient to our towns.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil it was stated in February that the increase in the price of houses over the last 12-month period was about 19.2 per cent. That indicates the necessity for raising the limit of SDA loans.  Furthermore, a good case can be made for increasing the ceiling with regard to the salary of those to whom loans will be given.  At present, the maximum loan is about £3,500.  That is not sufficient to provide housing.  Even a modest house now costs over £10,000.  In some areas, because of the shortage of housing people are forced to pay between £25,000 and £30,000 for quite modest three-bedroomed houses.  Because of the shortage of housing we have people living in flats paying as much as £15 a week in provincial towns.  It was an old, rough and ready rule of thumb in regard to housing that when a house cost the family more than one-eighth of their income it was gone beyond common sense.  Far too many people today find themselves having to pay much more than one-eighth of their income to provide housing.</P>
    <P>The development of many small towns and villages is held up because of lack of water and sewerage facilities. There has been some improvement in water supplies in recent years because of the popularity of group water schemes. Sewerage schemes are a different matter. The lack of water and sewerage facilities results in planning permission being refused in these areas.  I hope that the increase in the Local Loans Fund will result in money being more freely <Col N="636" /> available to local authorities for developments of this kind.</P>
    <P>The development of the tourist industry is held up because of lack of water and sewerage facilities in small towns.  Quite a large percentage of tourists like the peace of rural Ireland but they find it very difficult to find accommodation in the small towns and villages convenient to lakes and rivers that provide fishing facilities.  Failure to develop these towns has not only aggravated the housing situation but is retarding the growth of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Health boards are often in difficulty when they set about providing hospital facilities.  I do not intend to go into that in a board way except to draw attention to one point.  Everyone in the House is aware of the inadequacy of accommodation for the treatment of mentally retarded and handicapped people.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that developments along those lines will be facilitated in every way by the ready availability of money from the Local Loans Fund.  In the years ahead, vocational committees will find themselves having to call for more and more help from this fund.  We must develop technical education.</P>
    <P>The ratio of pupils doing academic courses in the post-primary level compared with those doing technical courses is 3.1:1.  That is the exact reverse of the situation in the other European Economic Community countries.  I believe that it will be necessary, if we are to develop the industrial arm of our economy effectively, to provide more and more facilities for the training of skilled technicians.  A person in the academic field told me it was easier to provide the academic type of education that we give to the vast majority of our post-primary pupils than it was for the technical schools to provide the necessary equipment.  A notebook, pencils, a couple of gross of chalk and a blackboard is all that is really necessary for a lot of these subjects in secondary schools, whereas machinery, carpenters' benches and this sort of costly equipment is necessary to provide proper facilities for the development of technical education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> I can foresee in the near future a big demand on this Local Loans Fund to develop that form of education to put us in a position to develop industrially.  We have more than enough people with university degrees who are forced to leave the country, and at the same time a shortage of skilled workers to help to build up the country and to develop our industries. I can foresee, within the immediate future, a growing demand on the Local Loans Fund for that sort of development.</P>
    <P>We have nine regional technical schools in the country.  They do not, in my opinion, serve adequately the needs of the people.  It will be necessary within a short time to increase considerably that number and make advanced technical education available to a larger section of our population.</P>
    <P>In so far as help from the Local Loans Fund will assist drainage activities in this country, I do not have to emphasise the position there.  It is readily agreed on all sides of the House, and has been said quite recently during a discussion on the Shannon drainage that drainage is a problem in this country.  If we are in a position to tackle it adequately it could increase enormously our productivity.  It is to be hoped that as far as it is possible money will be available from this Local Loans Fund to expedite the solution of drainage problems which exist in many parts of the country.  I believe that with whatever funds we are able to get for development in that line from the EEC and help from the Local Loans Fund, many of the big drainage problems that have held back development since the State was founded will be tackled and we will be able to increase our potential as an agricultural country.</P>
    <P>I realise, of course, that the Minister and his Department will have to deal with applications from local authorities all over the country and that it will be their business to establish priorities.  I hope that the Bill is passed quickly.  I hope that talk about cutting back in public expenditure will not result in development by local authorities having to be slowed down.  That, in my opinion, would be false economy.  There is much to be done by local authorities.  They are conscious of their responsibilities.  In <Col N="638" /> many cases the plans are already made and submitted to the Department.  I believe that it would be a bad thing if there was any appreciable slow down in proceeding with this work.  I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister and his Department every success in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words of welcome to this short Bill.  All of us realise, especially those who are members of local authorities, just how important it is to have this Bill introduced and to have the provision of money monitored and expanded.  Local authorities need the confidence that when they are planning housing schemes, water and sewerage schemes and nearly all the works that are undertaken by them money will be available. This new provision helps local authorities to confidently look forward to planning schemes in each local authority area.  Certainly I would be very much aware of how important it is here.  Even though it looks quite a simple Bill, it is recognised very easily here that it is a massive increase of capital available to the Local Loans Fund of £500 million.  It is the biggest increase ever introduced and is very welcome.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be able to kill the fears that are purposely put abroad here to discourage people planning and developing, and restore confidence in members of local authorities.  All of us realise that the Local Loans Fund is the life-blood of the work carried out by local authorities.  I am satisfied that local authorities will now be able to plan extensively and extend their work programmes to include the very heavy backlog that we have in every county.</P>
      <P>In my own county we have a very large number of water and sewerage schemes.  We depend on the Local Loans Fund to finance those water and sewerage schemes.  We have a backlog of houses just like every local authority. We can now confidently look forward to loans being available from the central fund.  It gives me great pleasure to make my short contribution in appreciation of this measure to extend the amount of money that is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="639" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, welcome this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction. I note that there is something like a 40 per cent increase in the actual amount of money available over what was spent last year and what was spent this year. There is no doubt that the funding of local authority activities is a very important function in local government.  While I acknowledge that this increase is very important and substantial by any standards, we must view the increase in the light of what has happened in the last 12 months and then the startling increase might not be so dramatic.</P>
      <P>I should just like to refer to one important facet of local authority activity, the housing grant and the loan to ordinary individuals to build their own houses.  This loan was increased from £3,500 to £7,000.  Now we find that, while at the time that £7,000 looked extremely well, there is a tremendous shortfall in the price of a house anywhere in Ireland today.  Prospective housebuilders are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap.  However, I consider this a very good scheme.  It puts the initiative on the user of the loan to ensure that he supplies himself with his own house.  There is a lot to be said for it.  We hope that the standards applied by the local authorities will not be too restrictive so that more people will use this loan.  This is an important development. We hope that the day will not be too far away when that £7,000 will be raised again.</P>
      <P>While the reconstruction grants have been increased in the recent past, nevertheless the sum of £600 at the moment is not adequate for any type of reasonable reconstruction.  I hope that more money will be made available in the future for this type of programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem with sewerage in many parts of the country.  I am aware of countless numbers of small development committees in small towns who are very low on the priority list.  Perhaps the Minister and his Department could look at the idea that small communities or committees might be asked to contribute towards the provision of a sewerage scheme on the same basis as the group <Col N="640" /> water scheme, thereby enhancing their hope of getting a sewerage plant for their small town years in advance of when it would come up on the county council priority list.  This is holding back development in many of the small rural towns.  I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on the feasibility of such a development.  While most small town development committees would say that it is the responsibility of the local authority to provide sewerage for them I believe a stage has been reached where many of them are so annoyed about the time lag that they might form themselves into group schemes, pay a local contribution and see if it would get a reasonable response from the Department. There is a fair case for that, and I hope that the Minister will take that suggestion reasonably seriously.</P>
    <P>Another important factor with local authority involvement is the local improvement schemes.  At a time when everybody is currying around to increase employment I am amazed at the lack of activity in a number of quarters so far as the local improvement schemes are concerned.  I hoped that if there was to be an upsurge, particularly in the rural areas, it would be in this very important sector.  Local improvement schemes, by their very nature, are funded for a start from local contributions and then from the local authority. One assumes that this is the best way of marrying two schemes.  You have the local initiative, the local commitment and involvement, you are carrying out a necessary scheme and at the same time you are creating employment.  I am far from happy with the present day trend.  I am amazed at all the bog roads and substandard by-roads we have when there are so many people unemployed.  I cannot understand why people are not employed on such schemes.</P>
    <P>So far as drainage is concerned I am far from happy with the involvement of local authorities.  Under this Bill, some dramatic change by the Department will have to take place because we are now at a stage where we are looking forward to increased grants from the EEC for land drainage.  While we understand that that will be for field drainage and some <Col N="641" /> arterial drainage of a fairly major nature, there are vast areas, particularly in the north and west, which have what we call small streams, I have been involved with a number of those only to be told on an LIS application that it was outside their control, that they normally did not do projects of that size.  I am talking about four, five or six miles of a small stream into another tributary.  On the other hand, the Board of Works seem, most of the time, to have their head in the sand so far as this type of development is concerned.  We find that a great number of potentially good viable acres of land are providing nothing by way of return to their owners, or, indeed, to the national economy.  I should like to hear the Minister reply to this because I believe there is a certain section there in which the local authorities should involve themselves.  It would be involvement in the draining of those smaller type streams which do not seem to be in the sphere of the various organisations who carried out such schemes in the past. The local authorities are not carrying them out either.  We hope that that will be rectified.</P>
    <P>The group water schemes have been one of the more successful success stories in this country.  Since there was a change of emphasis on the regional schemes carried out by the local authorities some years ago, when the initiative and commitment was placed fairly and squarely on the people, they responded and we have now highly sophisticated machinery able to deal with group water schemes, but all is not well.  We have a problem in that the liaison between the local authority and the Department of the Environment often gives cause for much frustration and I would suggest, in the context of what we are speaking about this evening that the local authority be given more leeway.  After all, they are the people on the ground.  They have their staff at local level and are equipped with offices and so on.  Alternatively, if the Department of the Environment are to be involved at the same level as they are now, in order to speed up the process I would suggest that their inspectors around the country <Col N="642" /> be given greater facilities.  They have no offices or staff and they can be difficult to reach at times because of the amount of work that they have on their hands.  In the future this fund should cover the vast areas of the country that have not yet got clean water supplies.  I would hope that this situation would be rectified.</P>
    <P>As far as local authority houses are concerned, the qualifying standard applied by most local authorities is not correct. The people who are entitled to local authority houses, particularly people living in rural areas where a house can be built in the countryside, have to be so poor that they probably would not be able to run a house of that standard anyway.  Eligibility standards for such houses are too harsh and there are not nearly enough of these houses being built.  The applications are increasing all the time for houses in this category.  I would specifically state that this is a category that needs to be looked at very closely.  As far as I can see there is not enough progress being made in this area at the moment.</P>
    <P>Finally, taking into account the state of the economy and all the talk of the proposed cut-backs.  I welcome this Bill in so far as it goes.  I would like the Minister's views on the sewerage scheme and I would hope that through his good offices the question of drainage, opening, cleaning and widening of small streams will be taken under the mantle of the LIS projects.  I would hope that there will be no shortfall of money and if there has to be a supplementary for the year just because there is extra work being done, that that will be available as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Members of the House in welcoming this Bill. Because it has so much involvement with local authorities it will be wide-ranging in its effects if it is applied to the extent that the local authorities would wish.  This Bill is intended to provide money for the local authorities.  In my county we have a great need to get finance to provide additional accommodation for a vocational school at Granard where the students are living in what is now regarded as an out-of-date prefabricated wooden structure.  The sooner the vocational education committee, <Col N="643" /> or my council in Longford, are financed with a sufficient amount to enable them to replace this structure with a proper school, the sooner will everybody's mind be at ease.</P>
      <P>The local loans fund in the past has been providing finance to the local authorities to pay supplementary housing grants.  The Housing Act which is applicable as a result of recent legislation means that local authority supplementary grants are not payable generally on the structured house lines that we had in the past.  It is a matter of regret that we have not the opportunity of aiding the deserving person who needs finance to build a house with a grant which would be almost equal it what would be paid by the State.  It is true that State grants have been increased although over 12 months have elapsed since the departure from the older Housing Act, only one grant of £1,000 was paid in County Longford, according to a reply to a question in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that at present housing grants under the old scheme, which were provided from the local fund, are not being processed to the extent that is appropriate to the needs of the people.  I have information that people who had promises made to them almost six months ago that their houses would be inspected have not yet had those houses inspected.  If we come to the stage when such grants are no longer available through the local authority, some action will have to be taken by the Minister to ensure that a proper scheme of inspection will apply under the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have the Minister's approval of schemes for group water supplies. There is one area in north Longford which is carrying a FEOGA grant.  This scheme is approved but at present the Government cannot say when it will be implemented.  This is a situation where, if the loan to the local authority to supplement Government expenditure is appropriate, the Minister could give the county councils a substantial grant.  I am referring to the Lough Gowna scheme in north Longford.  It is a very extensive scheme.  If the Minister could make the necessary funds available to the local <Col N="644" /> authorities and to the relevant section of his department a considerable amount of employment could be given, a very considerable improvement in the standard of living of the people could be achieved and a very useful service would be provided by the implementation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>As far as drainage is concerned the local authorities have power under the Local Authorities Works Act to carry out the scheme.  This sort of work, while it may not be regarded as falling directly within the ambit of money spent under the local loans fund, could be brought into line by an advance from State funds on condition that the local authorities would meet it with corresponding figures as laid down, not only for the purpose of improving land drainage, but also for the purpose of creating employment.  That is something that is very much a matter of urgency at the moment.  There are over 105,000 people unemployed at the moment. This time of the year is the most suitable time for carrying out land drainage and we should be going ahead with it if we are going to tackle in a purposeful way the elimination of unemployment and the reduction of this large figure.</P>
    <P>Housing loans were made available up to a figure of about £4,500 under the old Act.  This figure was criticised in the last six or eight months of the former Government's term of office.  That criticism was on the basis that the amount that was being afforded was not sufficient to meet the then increase in cost of materials and so on.  Since then we have learned that the Minister has increased it to £7,500.  We do not welcome, and nobody in this House would welcome, the recent statements made that, while housing materials went up from 8 per cent to 13 per cent, the cost of houses in Dublin and in the country generally have gone up by 30 per cent.  I do not know whose fault it is. We are not debating the effectiveness of any policy at this stage.  We are talking about a loans fund.</P>
    <P>To apply an appropriate figure to a loan to afford finance to people building their houses, some of the strictures should be removed.  Take the case of a person in Granard who had a small <Col N="645" /> town commissioners' house that was built for the working classes.  In time, with the help of his son and other members of his family, he came to the conclusion that he should be able to build a decent house for himself outside the town.  He went to the county council to buy a site and he was told that because he had signed the form to buy out this little house under a vesting scheme he is not now eligible to get the £1,000 grant.  He is living in a local authority house which he might be able to leave available to somebody else but, in the circumstances in which he finds he could better his position, he is told that that grant is not available to him nor is it intended for him.</P>
    <P>When the new Government introduced this £1,000 grant we were not told that these restrictions would be imposed, namely, that if one was living in an unsuitable house, or in a two- or three-roomed house, one could not build a four- or five-roomed house because one would be deemed to have purchased a house already.  This is hardly a fair circumstance in which to find oneself.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence to remove these restrictions and to introduce terms at least as good as those which applied under the old Act.  A man who has worked all his life and lived in a house that had two or three rooms and eventually found himself for one reason or another, in a position where he was able to buy a site and build a house, should have the right to do so but this person is regarded as less than a second class citizen.  I appeal to the Minister to redress that situation and to alter the image of this Bill because it is not a gift of £1,000 to the newly-weds in addition to the ordinary grants that it appeared to be.  Many people read it that way.  We see now that it is not.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck with this Bill. I assure him that if he affords finances to the local authority to the extent that is planned at the moment it will be applied in full measure for both the relief of unemployment and for the improvement of the facilities at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I wonder if the increase of 50 per cent is <Col N="646" /> sufficient when one looks at the cost of housing over the past two years.  We were told quite recently that the price of houses had increased by 19.2 per cent. At that rate a house which cost £20,000 last year would cost £24,000 this year. This year it is estimated that the prices in the coming year are going to increase by 30 per cent.  No later than yesterday morning the price of cement was increased. With the increase in the cost of cement the cost of a tremendous range of commodities in the building industry, such as the raw material, blocks and so on, will be affected.  The manufacturers estimate a total increase next year of 30 per cent on building materials.  If that situation comes about, and I can see nothing to stop it, it will mean that the price of the £20,000 house, in a period of two years, has increased by £10,000.  I doubt if our increase of 50 per cent, £500 million in this case, is sufficient to meet the demand.  It is good thinking to increase it at this stage but I am sure we will have the Minister back again if he is to keep building at the standard it has been at and to maintain the number of houses built and keep the money flowing into the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The one point which has been overlooked by most local authorities and by the Department for the Environment, is the question of serviced sites to be made available in every town in the country because they can very often take financial pressure off the Department of the Environment.  This is because people who purchase this type of site are people who are above the income limit of £3,500 and therefore do not qualify for a loan from a local authority.  These people borrow their money from a building society when it is available and most times it is.  For that reason it is taking pressure off this fund which can then be used for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to have a number of people who cannot afford to build their own houses because they cannot rise to borrowing a loan for many reasons.  We are obliged from central Government as a local authority to provide houses for these people.  If we had more serviced sites available in every town we would have more money available from the <Col N="647" /> Local Loans Fund for building this type of house.  When one looks at increases such as we have had over the past 12 months there is not much point in talking about a loan of £7,000.  That figure will have to be substantially increased if we are to keep building going at all.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the point made by Senator Tom Kilbride about housing grants.  It is impossible to get a grant out of the Department of the Environment at the moment.  If the Minister does not accept that, I will post him a list of 30 people, some of whom have their houses completed since September, October, November and January and they have not been inspected.  There is something radically wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to look at the figures which were laid down in previous Local Loans Fund Acts as regards the limits of expenditure.  In 1968 the Local Loans Fund Act laid down a limit of £400 million.  In the Local Loans Fund Act, 1972 that had been raised to £600 million.  Only two years after that, in 1974, the new Local <Col N="648" /> Loans Fund Act raised the limit to £1,000 million.  That was an increase of 60 per cent in two years.  The Local Loans Fund Act, 1978 increases the rate to £1,500 million which is an increase of 50 per cent on the present figure.  Is the limit high enough?  Certainly from experience under previous Local Loans Fund legislation it would appear not to be high enough to meet the needs and the Minister says in a statement that local authorities have become increasingly dependent on this fund to meet their capital requirements.  The Government, in their recent White Paper, and this will probably be followed up in the Green Paper, have given certain hints regarding local authority housing programmes in the future.  There may well be a reduction in that respect.  If so, I do not know where local authorities will find the money they will need for their various water and sewerage works and other capital requirements.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, where they made application for the use of funds from the Local Loans Fund, have been refused by the Department simply because the request did not come within the confines of the criteria of the resources being given under the Local Loans Fund Act.  The Department should, perhaps, consider widening or extending the range of uses of the Local Loans Fund Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the fund is used to finance essential capital services of local authorities.  I would have thought that bringing roads up to modern standards under the local improvements scheme and perhaps certain amenity schemes are capital services when all is said and done and will give a very definite long-term capital benefit to areas and should be considered for resources of the Local Loans Fund.  A widening or extension of its range of activities to include this type of activity should be envisaged by the Department in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of £1,500 million which is envisaged is simply an illustration of the escalation of the cost of the provision of local authority capital services.  It also illustrates the effects of inflation and is a consequence of the delays which can take place in funds being made available to local authorities from this fund.  There <Col N="649" /> is a considerable annual issue and it has reached almost £150 million.  This is an amount on money which would justify debates on the whole Local Loans Fund matter more frequently than has been experienced in the past.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have experienced delay in obtaining the money and delay is one means whereby the Government of the day can go easy on the limited funds which they have at their disposal. It is regrettable that these delays can occur since there are so many plans for water and sewerage works lying on the planning tables with no work being done on them.  The rate of completion of new sanitary services works is not at all satisfactory.  There is a considerable backlog here.  I have no doubt that local authorities will increasingly be looking for extra moneys in future years under this heading.  Laying down a stipulation as to what the limit will be is one thing but actually releasing the money to the local authorities is another matter altogether.  I look forward to an improvement both in regard to the length of time it takes for local authorities to obtain the money from the Local Loans Fund and in regard to the widening of the range of activities which can be covered under the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill with the reservation that I do not think the figure of £1,500 million is adequate in the light of the experience under previous Acts and in the light of the considerable backlog of capital works which remain on the hands of all local authorities.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I am not in a position, although I am a member of a local authority, to answer all the queries that have arisen this evening. They are appropriate to the Departments concerned.  What I and the Department of Finance are concerned with here is making moneys available to finance the different services operated by the local authorities.  I was surprised that the debate went into such a broad field. The opportunity given to Senators where questions of local authorities, drainage, housing and so on are concerned, is on the Appropriation Bill.  I cannot answer for any particular Minister as to how he <Col N="650" /> administers the funds for his Department. I am directly responsible in making moneys available for the financing of the different services operated by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>We should keep in mind that this substantial increase of £500 million is given at a time when inflation is not as high as it was in previous years.  I am confident that we are making sufficient moneys available to local authorities to finance their programmes.  Some Senators were worried that we may not have sufficient moneys in this respect.  This can be reviewed at any time.  I hope that this matter will be reviewed in a year or two because we have noticed that it is in the last two years that there has been the greatest demand on the local loans funds.  We are making this assessment basing it, to a certain extent, on this demand during the past two years.</P>
      <P>Senator Connaughton mentioned local improvements and drainage.  That does not come under local loans but is a matter for the appropriate Department. Arterial drainage comes under my Department and I make my own estimate on matters of that kind.  The purchasing of land and so on is under local authorities and we are providing the necessary moneys to finance these services.  The delay in making moneys available or the payment of local loans to local authorities comes under local authorities, also.  Sometimes local authorities are at fault in not preparing proper plans.  However, it is not for me to answer that question.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their contributions in welcoming the Bill. I think it is welcomed all over the country.  It is now for the local authorities to prepare their own planning programmes and so on.  The money is available to them, and the levels can be reviewed, if necessary, at any time.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <P>Is chun Bord na Gaeilge a chur ar bhonn reachtúil atá an Bille seo á mholadh agam agus is é is feidhm don Bhord an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus, go háirithe, a húsáid mar theanga bheo agus mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide a leathadh i measc an phobail.</P>
      <P>Is iad Comhairle na Gaeilge, a ceapadh sa bhliain 1969, a mhol sa tuarascáil <i>Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga,</i> a foilsíodh sé bliana ó shin, go ndéanfaí &ldquo;feidhm ghinearálta na hathbheochana i gcoitinne a shannadh do bhord reachtúil&rdquo; agus tá buíochas ag dul dóibh i ngeall air sin agus ar na moltaí fiúntacha eile a tháinig uathu.</P>
      <P>Le breis agus trí bliana anuas tá an Bord ag feidhmiú ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i> agus ní beag an t-ullmhúchán atá déanta don obair mhór atá le cur i gcrích: tá ár mbuíochas ag dul do na comhaltaí dá bharr son.  Tá focal molta ar leith ag dul don Seanadóir T.K. Whitaker, céad chathaoirleach an Bhoird, a bhí ina chomhalta de Chomhairle na Gaeilge roimhe sin agus a stiúraigh obair an Bhoird go críonna stuama go dtí gur éirigh sé as nuair a foilsíodh an Bille seo. Ar ndóigh, tá Seanadóir eile, Noel Ó Maolchatha, a bhfuil dúthracht caite aige ní amháin mar chomhalta de Bhord na Gaeilge ach mar chathaoirleach ar Chomhairle na Gaeilge roimhe sin. Chomh maith leosan tá an Seanadóir Ruairí Brugha a bhí ina chomhalta de Chomhairle na Gaeilge.  Is léir mar sin go bhfuil daoine sa Seanad a bhfuil saineolas acu ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge agus beidh mé ag súil le comhairle ó na Seanadóirí uile a bhfuil spéis acu sna cúrsaí sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Obair ghríosaithe agus spreagtha is mó atá, agus a bheidh, ar siúl ag an mBord chun tuilleadh Gaeilge a chur á labhairt ag an bpobal.  Is beag duine sa tír seo anois nár fhoghlaim Gaeilge uair éigin ach, ó tharla nach mbíonn cleachtadh ag a bhformhór ar í a úsáid, cailleann siad a ngreim uirthi i gcaoi gur leasc leo í a labhairt.  Chun iad sin a mhealiadh ní foláir deiseanna taitneamhacha a chur ar fáil dóibh chun feidhm a bhaint as an teanga agus, de reir a chéile, tiocfaidh feabhas ar a gcumas labhartha i gcaoi nach fada go mbeidh líofacht acu.  Faoi mar a luadh sa Pháipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge sa bhliain 1965, caithfear an bhá atá go fairsing ag an bpobal leis an teanga, ach nach ndéantar beart dá réir go minic, a shaothrú ar dhóigh go mbeidh siad fonnmhar chun iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn aon mhíthuiscint a sheachaint, sílim nach miste a rá nach ionann an Ghaeilge a leathadh agus an Béarla a ruaigeadh.  Tá teanga idirnáisiúnta ag teastáil uainn agus tarlaíonn go bhfuil an Béarla againn.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh teangacha eile de chuid na hEorpa ag a lán againn freisin.  Ach ní bhaineann sé sin ón áit is dual don Ghaeilge&mdash;teanga dhúchais na tíre seo le cúpla míle bliain agus gnáththeanga fhormhór mór ár sinsear anuas go dtí an céad seo caite.</P>
    <P>Is tuar dóchais dúinne, ar mór againn ár n-oidhreacht dúchais, an dea-thoil don Ghaeilge atá chomh forleathan sin i measc phobal na hÉireann.  Ach teacht ar bhealaí chun leas a bhaint as an dea-thoil sin i ngníomhartha praiticiúla ní fada go mbeidh rith an ráis an linn.  Tá a fhios againn, ar ndóigh, nach bhfuil aon bhealach éasca ann chun an taoide a chasadh.  Is léir, áfach, go mbeidh géarghá le comhordú agus comhoibriú san obair a bheidh ar siúl ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Ní foláir do na dreamanna atá ag saothrú ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge tarraingt le chéile in aon mhóriarracht amháin chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Tá dualgas orainn uile ár neart a chur le chéile agus baineann sé sin leis an Rialtas, le Ranna agus comhlachtaí <Col N="653" /> Stáit, le húdaráis oideachais, le húdaráis áitiúla, le heagrais náisiúnta agus leis na meáin chumarsáide chomh maith leis na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge.  Tig le Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí go háirithe spreagadh agus dea-shampla a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom ar an ócáid seo an moladh atá tuillte acu a thabhairt do na heagrais éagsúla atá ag caitheamh a ndúthrachta leis na blianta chun leasa don Ghaeilge.  Beidh deis acu féin agus ag an mBord comhoibriú le chéile feasta d'fhonn gur fearr fós an toradh a bheidh ar a n-iarrachtaí chun na críche sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm féin go raibh ar mo chumas deontas £300,000 a chur ar fáil do Bhord na Gaeilge i mbliana le go bhféadfaidís clár fiúntach oibre a leagan amach.  B'fhéidir nár mhiste cuid dá bhfuil ar siúl acu a lua:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Faoi scéimeanna forbartha teanga tá sé cheantar speisialta roghnaithe d'fhonn an Gaeilge a leathadh i ngnéithe éagsúla den saol iontu.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Faoi phlean amarclannaíochta, a ullmhaíodh i gcomhar leis an gComhairle Ealaíon, tá compántas gairmiúil drámaíochta á bhunú d'fhonn a chinntiú go léireofar dramaí i mBaile Átha Cliath agus ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tá scéimeanna i bhfeidhm chun an Ghaeilge a leathadh i measc daoine óga.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tá dianchúrsaí sa teanga labhartha eagraithe, i gcomhar le Gael-Linn, do dhaoine fásta, go háirithe sna ceantair fhorbartha.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tá scéim ceadaithe i gcomhar le Cumann Lúthchleas Gael chun an Ghaeilge a neartú i ngníomhaíochtaí an chumainn sin.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tá dlúthchaidreamh i gcónaí le Radio Telefís Éireann agus le dreamanna eile d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus tá feachtas poiblíochta á ullmhú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na ceantair atá roghnaithe ag an mBord chun feachtas speisialta a chur ar siúl iontu, bhí deis agam féin bheith i láthair i gcúpla ceann acu&mdash; Caisleán an Bharraigh agus Ráth Cúil&mdash;nuair a cuireadh tús leis an bhfeachtas agus ba mhór an t-ábhar <Col N="654" /> sásaimh dom an tslí ina bhfuil tacaíocht an phobail le fáil d'iarrachtaí ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Ar ndóigh, níl sé sin ach ag teacht le torthaí an taighde a rinne an Coiste a ceapadh sa mbliain 1970 chun dearcadh an phobail a léiriú d'fhonn beartas a fhorbairt chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide i raon tábhachtach d'fheidhmeanna teanga.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille atá á phlé againn, is gnáthfhorálacha do Bhord reachtúil formhór na n-alt ann ach b'fhéidir nár mhiste aird a dhíriú ar na pointí seo a leanas:</P>
    <P>&mdash;suas le dáréag a bheidh ar an mBord,</P>
    <P>&mdash;tréimhse oifige nach faide ná cúig bliana a bheidh acu,</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceapfaidh siad foireann dá gcuid féin, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;féadfaidh siad aon ní is iomchuí leo a dhéanamh ag teacht leis an mbeartas ginearálta a bheidh údaraithe agamsa.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla go raibh an Bord ag gníomhú ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i> bhí deis acu dréacht den Bhille a scrúdú agus moltaí a dhéanamh.  Is dá bharr sin, mar shampla, atá cumhacht á tabhairt don Bhord foireann dá gcuid féin a cheapadh.  Is tar éis moltaí a fháil ón mBord freisin a cuireadh isteach fo-ailt (3), (4) agus (5) in alt 3.</P>
    <P>Is d'fhonn a chinntiú nach bhféadfaidh aon dream a rá gur ar an mBord amháin a bheidh an cúram ar fad&mdash;agus nach mbainfidh feidhmeanna i ndáil leis an nGaeilge leo féin feasta&mdash;a leagtar síos in alt 3 (5) go leanfaidh Ranna Stáit agus comhlachtaí eile d'fheidhmeanna a bhfuil siad freagrach iontu a chomhlíonadh; ní ag iarraidh baint ó chumhacht an Bhoird atáthar san fho-alt sin ná i bhfo-alt (3).  Comhoibriú, faoi mar a luaitear i bhfo-alt (4), a bheidh riachtanach chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Bhí ar intinn agam ó thús go bhféadfadh an Bord deontais agus iasachtaí a thabhairt agus, ar eagla nach mbeadh alt 3 (2) leathan go leor, d'aontaigh an Dáil alt 3 (6) a chur isteach.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Dáil leasú ar alt 3 (2) freisin: cuireadh &ldquo;agus mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide&rdquo; isteach i ndiaidh &ldquo;mar theanga bheo&rdquo;.  Is ar mholadh an Bhoird a cuireadh an leasú sin ar aghaidh <Col N="655" /> d'fhonn an Bille a neartú agus sprioc níos daingne síos.  D'fhéadfadh an Ghaeilge bheith ina teanga bheo mura mbeadh ach líon an-bheag daoine á labhairt ach níorbh fholáir líon mór daoine a bheith á labhairt chun go mbeadh sí ina gnáthmheán comarsáide. Agus, ar ndóigh, is é an cuspóir atá againn ná an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt go forleathan.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Bille á phlé sa Dáil thug an chaint tsuama tuisceanach ó Theachtaí éagsúla an-uchtach dom. Anois tá deis den saghas céanna sa Teach seo agus, faoi mar a luaigh mé chéana, beidh mé ag súil le comhairle ó na Seanadóirí uile a bhfuil spéis acu i gcúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Beidh an Bord ag brath ar chuidiú ón Seanad agus táim cinnte go mbeidh áthas orthu aon mholtaí a dhéanfar anseo a bhreithniú go cúramach mar ní beag an tógáil a bheidh le déanamh acu.  Cuireann an Bille seo an dúshraith ar fáil dóibh agus molaim don Seanad anois é.</P>

Ba mhaith liom freisin aontú leis an Aire nuair a thugann sé moladh dosna daoine a bhí ag obair i gComhairle na Gaeilge agus go háirithe an Seanadóir Whitaker, mar gheall ar an obair atá déanta acu cheana agus mar gheall ar na moltaí a chuireadar ar fáil dúinn uile agus a rá go bhfuilimid buíoch díobh mar gheall ar an méid atá déanta acu.</P>

    <P>Níl ceist agam ar an mBille seo ar chor ar bith ná aon rud atá ann.  Táimid go léir den bharúil gur cheart a leithéid seo de bhord a bhunú go reachtúil agus táimid sásta gach cabhair is féidir linn a thabhairt don mBord agus tá súil againn, mar adúirt mé cheana, go n-éireoidh go geal leis.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire a lán aire don cheist seo nuair a bheidh sé ag cabhrú leis na daoine a bhéas ar an mBord.  Tá súil agam freisin go dtógfaidh sé daoine go bhfuil spéis acu in athbheochain na Gaeilge&mdash;daoine go bhfuil sé cruthaithe acu cheana go <Col N="656" /> bhfuil obair mhór déanta acu ar son na Gaeilge, daoine go bhfuil sé cruthaithe acu go bhfuil suim mhór acu in athbheochain na Gaeilge, ina dteanga dhúchais; daoine go bhfuil sé cruthaithe acu go dtuigeann siad an cheist ó bhun go barr; daoine go bhfuil tuiscint ar leith acu ar ndeon na haoise óga agus daoine go bhfuil an féith iontu gur féidir leo daoine a treoiriú ar an mbealach cheart agus suim sa teanga a mhúscailt iontu. Sé mo thuairim gur neartú a dhéanfaidh an bord go mór ar na daoine a dteanga a mhúscailt iontu.  Sé mo thuairim go meallfaidh an obair a dhéanfaidh an bord na daoine a thógfaidh an tAire le cur ar an mbord.  Tá fhios agam go dtuigeann sé go maith an cheist seo é féin agus táim den bharúil gur cheart aire faoi leith a thabhairt don cheist sin agus go dtoghfaidh sé daoine mar mhuinteoirí náisiúnta agus múinteoirí gairmoideachais agus ceannairí eagraisí Gaeilge, mar adúirt mé cheana, go bhfuil sé cruthaithe acu go dtuigeann siad an obair agus go bhfuil an chaoi iontu é a stiúradh ar an mbeallach cheart.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire, agus aontaím go mór leis, go bhfuil a bheag nó a mhór de Ghaeilge ag an gcuid is mó de na daoine sa tír seo faoi láthair.  'Sé an rud a chuireann imní orm ná a laghad Gaeilge a labhartar.  Níl éinne sa tír nach bhfuil na beannachtaí coitianta aige agus is fior nach gcloisimid iad ó theanga na daoine chomh minic is a cloiseadh iad 50 bliana ó shin nuair a bhí Conradh na Gaeilge faoi lántseoil agus nuair a bhí sprid an náisúnachais b'fhéidir níos láidre ná mar atá anois.  Sin rud a chuireann imní orm.</P>
    <P>Níl aon dabht dá mbeadh sé ar intinn ag gach duine sa tír seo úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá aige, pé aca beag nó mór é, níl aon dabht ná go mbeadh dul chun chinn mór déanta againn in athbheochain na teanga agus sé an rud nach dtuigimid ná cén fáth nach bhfuil na daoine sásta úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá acu.  Is í an obair is mó atá os comhair an bhoird nua seo ná dúil i labhairt na Gaeilge a spreagadh sna daoine agus a chur ina luí ar gach duine go héifeachtúil gur mór an trua nach labhrann a lán daoine oiread is focal amháin Gaeilge ó éiríonn siad ar maidin <Col N="657" /> go dul ina luí dóibh 'stoíche.  Sin rud nach ceart a bheith ag tuitim amach.  Má éiríonn leis an mbord seo nó má éiríonn leis an Aire nó le duine ar bith an méid sin grá den teanga a mhúscailt i measc na ndaoine go mbeidh fonn ar gach duine úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá aige, ansin beidh dul chun chinn déanta againn.  Is mór an trua nach bhfuil an dearcadh sin againn faoi láthair agus go dtí go mbeidh an dearcadh sin againn beidh athbheochain na Gaeilge i gcruachás agus ní dhéanfaidh sé an dul chun cinn ba mhaith linn a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin a rá go bhfuil géar-ghá le téacs-leabhair spéisiúla, shuimúla a chur ar fáil dos na daltaí scoile, go mbeadh ceachtanna iontu a bhfuil baint acu le saol na ndaltaí agus leis na himeachtaí a bhfuil spéis ag na daltaí iontu.  Is fíor go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar na téacsanna sin le tamall beag anuas ach is é mo thuairim gur féidir i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh sa tslí sin chun suim a mhúscailt sna daltaí trí Ghaeilge a úsáid sna himeachtaí atá idir lámha acu agus go mbeidis in ann cómhrá a dhéanamh eatharthu féin ar chúrsaí spóirt, chúrsaí ceoil agus chúrsaí rince agus mar sin de, ar na rudaí a bhfuil spéis ag na daltaí sin iontu.  Dá mbeadh sé sin ann níl aon dabht ná go ndéanfadh athbheochain na Gaeilge dul chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil a thuilleadh le rá agam ach a rá go soléir leis an Aire go bhfuilimid ar son na hoibre atá idir lámha aige agus go bhfuil súil againn go n-éireoidh go geal leis agus leis an mbord atá sé chun a bhunú.  Sin an dearcadh atá ag an chuid is mó de mhuintir na tíre seo.  Tá áthas orm freisin a rá go bhfuilim sásta go bhfuil an t-alt seo i raiteas an Aire ina n-abrann sé nach ionann grá don Ghaeilge agus fuath don Bhéarla, más feídir liom é a chur sa dóigh sin.  Sin an rud ba cheart a chur ina luí ar a lán daoine, go bhfuil gá againn leis an mBéarla mar theanga idirnáisiúnta b'fhéidir agus go bhfuil gá againn leis an nGaeilge mar theanga dhúchais.  Sílim gur féidir an dá theanga a bheith ann, úsáid a bhaint as an mBéarla nuair a oireann sé dúinn i gcúrsaí idirnáisiúnta agus mar sin de, agus <Col N="658" /> úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge chun cruthú don saol mór gur cine faoi leith sinn, go bhfuil ár gcultúr féin againn, go bhfuil ár dteanga agus ár gceol agus ár rincí agus ár gcluichi féin againn.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an Aire agus go mbeidh rath Dé ar an obair atá idir lámha aige agus ar an obair a bheidh á dhéanamh ag an mbord nua.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas ormsa freisin fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo sa Teach seo inniu agus a rá gur chúis ríméid dom go bhfuil Bord na Gaeilge á chur anois ar bhonn reachtúil.  Ní Bille é seo go bhfuil aon chonspóid nó aon aighneas ag baint leis mar adúirt an Teachta Ó Briain romham, agus is dócha liom gur Bille é a ghlacfar leis go fonnmhar san Teach.</P>
      <P>Is fíor a rá, freisin, go raibh Bord na Gaeilge ann le trí bliana ach os rud é nach rabh an bord sin ar bhonn reachtúil ní mórán ar fad a d'fhéadfaidís a dhéanamh.  Ní hé sin le rá nach raibh daoine céimiúla agus daoine aithintiúla agus éirimiúla i mbun gnóthaí ach os rud é, mar adúirt mé, nach raibh an Bille ar bhonn reachtúil bhí uireasa ar an toradh dá réir.  Is mithid a rá freisin go mbeadh bord dá shórt seo ann le beartas a dhéanamh i leith na Gaeilge.  Is é an nós atá ann le fada an lá, nuair a bhí riachtanas áirithe in áiteacha eile i dtaobh eacamaíochta na tíre seo, cuireadh bord ar fáil leis na riachtanais sin a thapú agus a neartú agus a fhorbairt. Cuirimid i gcás Bord na Móna, Bord Sholáthar an Leictreachais, Bord na gCon, Bord na gCapall, an Bord Bainne agus na bord eile a chuireadh ar bun sa tír seo le tamall maith fada de bhlianta.  Is mithid, mar adúirt mé, agus is cóir go mbeadh bord ann anois a mbeadh cúram na Gaeilge ar leith air agus an cúram sin go speisialta á chur i bhfeidhme aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá anois gur mór agam an dréachtú simplí, so-thuigthe a rinneadh ar an mBille seo.  Tá a chuid forálacha go léir lántsoiléir, so-thuigthe don ghnáth dhuine agus is dóigh liom gur ionmholta ar fad an rud é sin.  Is cúis áthais, agus misnigh dom freisin tagairt do na haidhmeanna agus na cúraim atá <Col N="659" /> a leagan síos ar son na Gaeilge sa reachtaíocht seo.  Tá mé ag tagairt go sonrach d'fhorálacha ailt a 3 fré chéile agus tá áthas orm go ndearna an tAire tagairt don alt sin ina ráiteas féin.  Is breá ar fad liom an dualgas príomha atá thar a chur ar an mbord i bhfo-alt a (1) den alt.  Déanfaidh an bord an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a úsáid mar theanga bheo, a chur chun cinn.  Is dóigh liom gur simplí agus gur cinnte agus gur suaitheantasach an ráiteas é sin mar phríomh-ráiteas ins an mBille seo.  Tá sé ag teacht freisin leis an aidhm go díreach a bhí ag bunaitheoirí na hathbheochana ó thús, is é sin, an Ghaeilge a chur dá labhairt mar theanga bheo imeasc phobal na hÉireann.  Ach ní lú ná sin tábhacht na bhfo-altanna eile go léir, (2) go dtí (5), san alt céanna.  Ní gá dhom iad a aithris ceann ar cheann. Séard atá iontu i dteannta a chéile go dtugann siad ceart feidhmiúil don bhord féin comhairle agus cúnamh agus comhoibriú a lorg ar aon Roinn Stáit nó, comhlacht, a bheidh reachtúil ná eile, chun pé beartais ar a gcinnfear ar mhaithe le leas na Gaeilge a thabhairt i gcríoch.  Is léir go dtiocfaidh sé sin as comheagrú agus comhordú agus as comhaontas a bhí in uireasa le fada ar dul chun cinn na Gaeilge, fiú amháin ó bunaíodh an Stát.</P>
    <P>Bhí nós ag Ranna Stáit eile san am atá caite an Ghaeilge agus gach ar bhain léi a fhágáil faoin Roinn Oideachais. Beidh seans anois buíochas le Dia, faoi nósanna imeachta Boird na Gaeilge an folamhas sin a leigheas agus measaim gur íontach ar fad an dul chun cinn é sin. Ní miste a rá, freisin, go bhfuil na forálacha seo ag teacht go díreach le moltaí a rinne An Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge sa tuarascáil a tháing uaidh chomh fada siar leis an mbliain 1959.  I gCaibidil 34 den tuarascáil sin tá dhá alt agus measaim gur fiú agus gur cóir iad a léamh agus muid ag trácht ar an mBille seo.  Fotheideal an gchéad Alt: Beartas Comhaontaithe i Leith na Teaglan:</P>
    <P>Is beartas comhaontaithe a mholaimid i leith na Gaeilge agus is gá lántacaíocht na Ranna éagsúla Stáit agus na n-aicmí éagsúla den phobal <Col N="660" /> chun é a fheidhmiú.  Dá leigfé don iarracht chun an teanga a slánú tuitim siar, nó fiú dá bhfágtaí gan forbairt i gcúrsaí áirithe dhe le linn di a bheith á chur chun cinn i gcúrsai eile, is é a thiocfadh as go mbainfí go mór de thoradh an bheartais ina iomláine.</P>
    <P>De bharr an claonadh a bhí ann go dtí seo obair na Gaeilge a fhágáil de chúram ar cheann nó dhó de na Ranna Stáit go príomha, tuigtear do na Ranna eile nach bhfuil aon dualgas spesialta orthu i leith na teanga.  Ar an chuma chéanna, de bharr an claonadh a bhí ann dul chun cinn na Gaeilge imeasc an phobail i gcoitinne a fhágáil de chúram ar na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge, agus gan a ndóthain acmhainne a bheith acu chuige ní bhíonn teaghmháil ar bith ag mórchuid de na daoine leis an teanga tar éis dóibh an scoil a fhágáil.</P>
    <P>Measaim gur ceart, mar adúirt mé, an dá alt a léamh agus muid ag caint ar an mBille seo agus iad a chur san gcomhthéacs is dual dóibh a bheith.</P>
    <P>Ní le Ranna Stáit amháin is gá an comhaontú agus an comhoibriú seo a dhéanamh.  D'fhéadfaí an rud céanna a dhéanamh maidir le cuid de na heagraíochtaí deonacha atá ag obair ar bhealaí éagsúla ar mhaithe leis an teanga agus leis an gcultúr agus le cúrsaí náisiúta i gcoitinne.  Tá, cur i gcás, eagraíochtaí cosúil le Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, Gael-Linn, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Cumann Lúithchleas Gael, agus tuilleadh nach iad, ag déanamh a gcion go héifeachtach ar son na Gaeilge ach níl comhaontas náisiúnta eatarthú a chuirfeadh toradh níos fearr ar a saothar.  Cé go ndearnadh roinnt iarrachtaí trí chruinnithe idir na hoifigí agus na heagraisí a thabhairt le chéile féachaint an bhféadfaí an t-aontas agus an comhoibdiú sin a chur ar aghaidh, níor tháinig tada fónta fós dá bharr. B'fhéidir go bhféadfadh Bord na Gaeilge iarracht a dhéanamh anois féachaint chuige go déanfaí an comhoibriú seo agus go dtiocfadh dá thoradh comhoibriú idir na heagraíochtaí náisiúnta sa gcaoi go mbeadh an pobal páirteach i dteannta a chéile ar son na teanga agus an cultúir dhúcasaigh.  &ldquo;Ní ceart go cur le chéile&rdquo;, mar a deirtear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> Ba mhaith liom anois beagán cainte a dhéanamh faoi mhéid an bhoird, do réir mar atá leagtha síos nó molta sa mBille féin.  Aontaím leis an gcinneadh a rinne an tAire an bord a laghdú ó 20&mdash;mar a mheasaim a bhí ann i dtosach&mdash;go dtí 12.  Measaim, gur cumasaí agus gur éifeachtaí a oibreós an Bord le beirt duine dhéag nó le 20 duine.  Níl fhios agam an de chomhthárlú nó in aon turas a cinneadh ar an mbeirt duine déag, an beirt aspal déag a thabharfas mé orthu. Tá me sásta go dtogfar na baill go stuama, rianúil agus go mbeidh siad durachtach fadbhreathnaíoch ina mbeartais.  Guim gach rath ar an Aire agus orthu féin i dteannta a chéile.</P>
    <P>Ní miste anois ag an tráth seo dhom tagairt a dhéanamh do staid na teanga féin mar a fheictear dúinne é faoi láthair agus sinn ag obair ag saothú na teanga le blianta fada siar, sé sin an chuid againn atá páirteach i saothrú na Gaeilge agus á teagasc le blianta fada. Ba mhaith liom tagairt a déanamh dá staid i gcoitinne agus go mór-mhór sa gcóras oideachais.  Ag tagairt dá staid i gcoitinne is féidir a mhaíomh go bhfuil go leor deá-thoil imeasc an phobail i leith na Gaeilge, gur mian le tromlach mhuintir na hÉireann go gcaomhnófaí agus go slánófaí an Ghaeilge agus ár n-oidhreacht dhúchais uile, idir cheol, amhráin agus eile.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir, áfach, a rá go bhfuil staid na teanga sásúil, ach a mhalairt san uile shórt scoileanna.  Séard is dóigh anois go rabhathas ag súil leis an iomarca maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar bhunú an Stáit agus nuair a glacadh le moltaí le Comhairle Náisiúnta an Chláir Oideachais sa bhliain 1922.  Is ar na bunscoileanna is troime a thit an tualach mór, mar a thiteann fós, an uair úd. B'éigin do na múinteoirí an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim iad fhéin toísc gan í a bheith acu.  Is chun a chinntiú go mbeadh ar fáil go luath srathanna múinteoirí óga ag teacht amach agus an Ghaeilge ar fheabhas acu agus dúracht agus fuinneamh iontu chun an teanga a theagasc a bunaíodh na coláistí ullmhúcháin. Chuaigh an Ghaeilge ar gcúl, is dóigh liom, nuair a dúnadh na coláistí sin i ndeireadh na ndachaidí.  Níorbh mhiste, mar sin, na cúiseanna faoin ar dúnadh <Col N="662" /> na coláistí sin a phlé.  Is féidir a rá gur dúnadh iad ar dhá chúis.  Tháining brú ón phobal ar dhá bhealach.  Tháining brú ó dream amháin, na heolaithe oideachais a bhí ann ag an am ag rá gur mheas siad go raibh na daoine seo ró óg le stampa a chur orthu agus a rá ag aois trí bliana déag nó dhá bhliain déag go mbeadh siad ina múinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Mar sin a bhí ag tárlú i gcás na gcoláistí ullmhúcháin.  Bhíothas ag tógáil daoine sna coláistrí agus do b'ionann sin is é a rá go raibh na daoine sin le dul le múinteoireacht bíodh siad oiriúnach don ghairm nó don ghlaoch sin nó ná bíodh, agus tháinig an brú ón taobh sin. Tháinig brú freisin ó thaobh eile, taobh b'fhéidir nach raibh fabharach don Ghaeilge nó, don Ghaeltacht ná do chur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tháinig sé ó dhaoine a bhí ag gearán agus ag casaoid go raibh an iomarca áiteanna á chur ar fáil do scoláirí na Gaeltachta agus go raibh éagcóir dá réir á dhéanamh ar scoláirí na coda eile den tír.  An chríoch a bhí leis ná gur dúnadh na coláistí ullmhúcháin sa deireadh.  Ach cibí cúis gur dúnadh iad tháinig dá thoradh gur tháinig cúlú agus dul siar i gcás na Gaeilge agus i gcás theagasc na Gaeilge sna scoileanna de réir a chéile uaidh sin amach.  Níl aon amharas faoi sin anois agus tá a rian le feiceáil, tá faitíos orm. Gealladh&mdash;ní miste é seo a rá freisin&mdash; nuair a dúnadh na coláistí ullmhúcháin go gcurifi córas éigin eile ina n-áit, córas éigin a dheimhneodh go mbeadh ar fáil sraitheanna daoine a mbeadh an Ghaeilge ar chomhchaighdeán mar a bhí sí roimhe sin.  Bhí deacrachtaí len é sin a dhéanamh agus níor dearnadh é.  Dá bhrí sin arís chuir sé seo cuid mhaith as don Ghaeilge agus do chur chun cinn na Gaeilge san chóras oideachais.  I gColáistí Oideachais féin anois&mdash; colástí oiliúna a thugtaí orthu uair amháin, coláistí oideachais a thugtar orthu le cupla bliain anuas&mdash;ní mó ná sásúil atá an scéal ar fad.</P>
    <P>Ní gá anois do na habhair-múinteoirí óga leanúint don Ghaeilge san dara bliain nó san triú bliain dá gcuid scolaíochta sná coláistísin. beag ná mór.  Caithfear é sin a rá, agus measaim go gcaithfear é a leigheas.  Is cinnte gur buille mór in aghaidh na Gaeilge é.  Rud eile a chuireann cúis imní <Col N="663" /> orainn faoi láthair an méadú mór atá tagtha ar an líon daoine a gcliseann orthu sna scrúdaithe Gaeilge sna scoileanna iarbhunoideachais.  Cuirimis i gcás sna scrúdú meánteistiméireachta. Tá cúntas agam anseo ar an méid nó ar na céatadán ar chlis orthu ins an scrúdú Gaeilge bunchúrsa meánteistiméireachta le trí nó ceithre bliana siar agus is súntasach an léiriú a thugann sé dúinn ar an dul ar gcúl atá tagtha ar obair na Gaeilge sna scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Tagróidh mé i dtosach do na buachaillí.  Sa bhliain 1974 theip ar 17 faoin gcéad de na buachaillí i scrúdú buncúrsa na meánteistiméireachta.  Sa bhliain 1975 theip ar 24 faoin gcéad.  Sa bhliain 1976 theip ar 38 faoin gcéad agus sa bhliain 1977 theip ar 40 faoin gcéad.  Is mór agus is scanrúil an méadú agus is míchoibhneasach an méadú é sin agus is cinnte go bhfuil cúis éigin mar chúlra leis.  Seo mar a d'éirigh leis na cailíní.  Sa bhliain 1974, blianta céanna arís atá dá lua agam ceann ar cheann, chlis ar 9 faoin gcéad sa scrúdú sin; sa bhliain 1975, 14 faoin gcéad; sa bhliain 1976, 25 faoin gcéad, agus sa bhliain 1977, 30 faoin gcéad.  An patrún céanna arís an méadú ar an gcéatadánachas a theip orthu sna scrúduithe meánteistiméireachta ag na buachaillí agus na cailíní, gancás na gcailíní bheith chomh dona ar fad le cás na mbuachaillí.  Ní miste é seo a rá faoi sin. Má tá aon tátal le baint as na torthaí seo is é go bhfuil ísliú mór tagtha ar chaighdeán freagartha agus ar inniúlacht na n-iarrathóirí i nGaeilge le blianta anuas agus ní hionadh go bhfuil sin amhlaidh.  Caithfidh sé, mar adúirt mé cheana, go bhfuil cúis éigin leis agus go bhfuil laige éigin agus cúlú éigin tagtha ar chaighdeán theagasc na Gaeilge sa scoileanna le roinnt blianta siar. Caithfidh mé é seo a rá freisin, agus níl mé ag rá seo le polaitíocht a tharraingt isteach i gcás pléite na Gaeilge, ach is suntasach an rud é gur le linn réimeas an Chomh-Rialtais a tharla an méadú mór seo ar an gcéatadán ar theip orthu i scrúdaithe ar chaighdeán atá chomh híseal le bunchúrsa na meánteistiméireachta. Thit sé le linn na tréimhse sin freisin in ar cinneadh ag an Rialtas céanna nach mbeadh an <Col N="664" /> Ghaeilge riachtanach i scrúdaithe i meánscoileanna, nó sa tseirbhís poiblí uaidh sin amach.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil aon bhaint ag an dá rud le chéile ach tá sé ansin agus is iad sin na firicí agus sílim go bhfuil tátal le baint as na firicí sin freisin.</P>
    <P>In ainneoin sin uilig, agus in ainneoin a bhfuil ráite agam, caithfear a rá nach bhfuil cás na Gaeilge agus an chultúir dhúchais gan tuar dóchais agus deirim é sin go fírinneach agus le fonn.  Mar adúirt mé i dtosach, is cúis mhaoite é a mhéid daoine a bhfuil déanamh a ngnótha acu sa Gaeilge; daoine meán aosta atá i gceist agam agus ní daoine óga.  Ach, arís, fillfidh mé ar an rud adúirt mé cheana, is daoine iad siúd a múineadh go maith sa gcóras oideachais nuair a bhí siad ar scoil agus b'fhéidir gurb shin an chúis go bhfuil déanamh a ngnótha acu chomh maith sin, fiú amháin ag an tráth seo dá saol.  Luaigh mé freisin, ina theanta sin, an dea-thoil atá go foirleathan ag daoine fásta don Ghaeilge.  Níl aon amharas faoin sin, agus tá fonn ar dhaoine cuidiú leis an nGaeilge ar aon bhealach is féidir leo. Ná dearmadaimís anois an borradh agus an fás as cuimse atá tagtha faoin gceol Ghaelach, na rincí tuaithe, na hamhráin agus eile.  Tá spéis dáiríre tagtha iontu go léir ag óg agus aosta.  Sin é go díreach anois an áit as a dtiocfaidh an comhoibriú agus an comhaontas atá i gceist ag Bord na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Anuas ar sin ar fad, tá sé anseo le rá, agus arís ní polaitíocht atá i gceist agam anseo, tá sé seo le rá nach dócha go raibh aon Rialtas sa tír fós a raibh smacht chomh maith ag na baill ar an nGaeilge mar theanga labhartha.  Is fíor le rá, agus ní féidir é a shéanadh, go bhfuil smacht maith ar an nGaeilge ag furmhór mór na n-Airí Iáthair na huaire ar an teanga agus is dóigh liom gur cúis mhisnigh agus cúis mhaoite é sin.  Tá mise ag rá anseo tráthnóna inniu gur beag nach bhféadhaí cruinniú Rialtais a reachtáil ar fad trí Ghaeilge.  Is breá liom go dtáinig an saol gur fédir é sin a rá. Fáiltím roimh an mBille agus guím gach rath ar an Airt agus ar an mbord i dteannta a chéile san obair mhór atá rompu.  Tá go leor níthe nach ndearna mé aon tagairt dóibh mar tá fhios agam go bhfuil fonn labhartha ar a lán daoine <Col N="665" /> eile ar an gceist seo nó faoin mBille seo agus is doigh liom gur ceart seans a thabhairt dóibh.  Ach, mar adúirt mé, fáiltí roimh an mBille agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go maith leis an mbord agus leis an Aire sna cúramaí a bheith orthu faoin reachtaíocht seo.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos is cúis bhróin ar shlí é nach bhfuil i láthair ach seisear againn ag cur síos ar an mBille seo.  Tuigim, dar ndóigh, go mbíonn curamaí eile ar Sheanadóiri an tráth seo den tráthnóna agus is minic a bhíos féin as láthair, ach ní creidim, dáiríre, go raibh tinnreamh chomh beag san riamh sa Teach seo ón uair a tháinig mé féin isteach an fómhar seo chaite.  Ní turas dóchais é sin, caithfear a admháil.</P>
      <P>Fáiltímse féin, tríd is tríd, roimh an mBille, nó go mór mhór roimh spríd an Bhille agus déarfainn go bhfuil Gaeilgeoirí tríd síos sásta go gcuireann an Bille seo Bord na Gaeilge ar bhonn reachtúil agus go mbeidh sé neamhspleách ar Choimisún na Státseirbhíse ó thaobh cheapacháin foirne dhe, ach go háirithe.  Ní féidir a shéanú dhe, ach go raibh mí-shástacht ar Ghaeilgeoirí go dtí seo maidir le Bord na Gaeilge.  Cheap a lán daoine nach raibh toil agus fuinneamh ag gabháil leis an mbord agus, mar chomhartha ar san, féach nár chaitheadar ach leath den tiochóg nó den deontas a tugadh dóibh, agus do chuir sé sin íonadh ar an-chuid daoine.  Ar an ábhar sin, fáiltimíd go léir roimh an mbonn reachtúil atá anois don chéad uair laistiar den bhord. Cuimhnigí go ndúirt Domhnall Ó Corcora uair amháin ina leabhrán, <i>Fortunes of the Irish Language,</i>&ldquo;the State is now behind the language and everything will change for it&rdquo;.  Seo an chéad uair, ar shlí, go bhfuil an Stát taobh thiar den teanga, ó thaobh feidhm reachtúil a thabhairt do Bhord na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Mar sin féin, measaimse go bhfuil lochtanna nach beag fós ar an mBille seo agus déarfaidh mé tuilleadh faoi sin ar ball, go mór nuair a bheidh an Bille á phlé againn i gCoiste níos déanaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dtosach, ní miste tagairt beag a dhéanam don chúlra ghinearálta, gan dul isteach go leadránach sa scéal.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, an dtuigeann éinne go cruinn cad iad cuspóirí an Stáit an lá atá <Col N="666" /> inniu ann i leith na teanga Gaeilge?  Nó, go sonnrach, cad é cuspóir bunúsach Fhianna Fáil i leith na teanga anois?  Ní raibh aon amhras i n-aigne Eamonn de Valera agus é ag bunú an pháirtí leathchéad bliain ó shin: &lsquo;The restoration of the Irish language and the development of a native Irish culture&rdquo; adúirt séirt sé. &ldquo;Restoration&rdquo;.  &ldquo;An Ghaeilge a athbheochan&rdquo;, an leagan Gaeilge a chuireann an tAthair Pádraig Ó Fiannachta ar an abairt sin.  Seo preas ráiteas a dhein Eamon de Valera i 1926&mdash;Tá tagairt don abairt sin i mbeathfhaisnéis de Valera le Longford, leathanach 246. Ní raibh aon amhras in aigne de Valera maidir le cuspóir bunúsach Fhianna Fáil i leith na teanga.  Ach, anois, de réir dealraimh, tá port eile ag Rialtas an lae inniu&mdash;nó chun na firinne d'insint, ní féidir bheith cinnte cén port atá acu.  Dar leis an manifesto&mdash;leathanach 42;</P>
    <P>Dearbhaíonn Fianna Fáil gur aidhm bunúsach de chuid an pháirtí é beo-theanga Gaeilge a chur in úsáid ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Deireann an Bille seo:</P>
    <P>Déanfaidh an Bord an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a úsáid mar theanga bheo agus mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide, a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>In ainneoin réamhráiteas an Aire a fuaireamar ó chianiabh ní thuigim fós cén éifeacht breise atá leis an gclásáil nua sa Bhille, sé sin, &ldquo;gnáthmheán cumarsáide&rdquo;, conas a chuireann sé sin le héifeacht an Bhille?  Is mór atá idir athbheochan na teanga&mdash;faoi mar a húsáideadh i dtosach báire ag Eamon de Valera í, faoi mar a sheasann sí fós, chomh fada agus is eol dom, i móraidhmeanna Fhianna Fáil&mdash;agus an teanga &ldquo;a chur chun cinn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is é an brí a bhainim féin as an abairt &ldquo;teanga bheo a chur chun cinn&rdquo; ná gurb é toil an Rialtais go gcuirfeadh an Ghaeilge saghas dath nó blas ar shaol na hÉireann ach nach bhfuil sé i gceist in aon chor go ndéanfar iarracht dáiríre a thuilleadh ar an teanga d'athbheochan. Ní fédir an bhfuil an ceart agam sa mhéid sin ach, ar aon nós, tá éiginnteacht polasaí anseo.  Má theastaíonn unainn aon stádas ceart a thabhairt don teanga, caithfimid an chuspóir a árdú.  Is céim siar í, dar liom, bheith ag caint go <Col N="667" /> leamh ar an teanga a &ldquo;chur chun cinn&rdquo;. Mholfainn, mar sin, go ndéarfaimis go neamhbhalbh i mir a 3 den Bhille go ndéanfaidh an Bhord an Ghaeilge a athréimiú i saol na tíre.  Ní chuirrann sé seo isteach ar chearta Béarlóirí.  Tá sé leanbhaí a bheith ag, rá, mar a deireann lucht an LFM, gur bagairt ar lucht an Bhéarla polasaí athbheochain na Gaeilge.  Go bhfóire Dia orainn, tá an Ghaeilge ró-lag chun bagairt a dhéanamh ar éinne nó ar aon rud.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint dúinn ar cheist na teanga i láthair na huaire, tá idir cúiseanna éadochais agus cúiseanna dóchais againn.  Ar na cúiseanna éadóchais, do luafainn, cur i gcás, meath na nGaeltachtaí agus ísliú chaighdeán múinte na teanga sna scoileanna&mdash;ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon amhras faoi sin. Tá eolas ag na múinteoirí atá anseo i láthair ar mheamram nó questionnaire a chuir an INTO amach cúpla bliain ó shin, a chuir ceisteanna ar na baill cad iad na tuairimí a bhí acu ar chonas a bhí an curriculum nua ag feidhmiú.  Na freagraí a fuaireadar, cé go raibh andóchas ag múinteoirí as ghnéithe den curriculum nua, rud amháin a chuir díomá orthu ná cé chomh tubaisteach a bhí caighdeán na Gaeilge ag titim sna scoileanna.  Níl aon mhaiteas i cur-igcéill sna cúrsaí seo.  Caithfimíd é seo a admháil agus rud éigean a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Le déanaí chuir Liam Mac Aindreasa &ldquo;páipéir dubh&rdquo; amach, leabhair conspóideach is dócha, ach is é an port céanna a bhí ann&mdash;agus ní foláir nó, go bhfuil cuid den fhírinne ann ach go háirithe&mdash;go bhfuil staid na teangan sna mbunscoileanna go huafásach.  Mar chúis éadóchais eile, luaithim an titim tubaisteach atá tagtha ar uimhir na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha.  Níl na figiúirí ós mo chomhair amach ach tá líon na scoileanna lán-Ghaeltacha titithe go mór ar fad le deich mbliana anuas.  Sna coláistí oiliúna, tá lion na ndaltaí Gaeltachta titithe ó timpeall 14 faoin gcéad go 6 faoin gcéad.  Tharla an titim sin idir 1962 agus 1968: ní foláir go bhfuil sé níos ísle fós.</P>
    <P>Tá na hollscoileann ag gearáin chomh maith.  I gColáiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh tá líon na macléinn atá ag <Col N="668" /> tógaint na Gaeilge mar chéim don BA ag titim.  Níl ach dornán beag sna ranganna onóracha.  Fiú amháin ag leibhéal ollscoile, tá an caighdeán cainte go dona.</P>
    <P>Tá sé furasta go leor bheith ag tagairt d'árd-réim chúrsái ceoil i láthair na huaire agus tá áthas orainn go léir gurb amhlaidh atá.  Is furasta, agus admhóidh an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún é seo is dócha, spéis a chur sa cheol.  Mothúchán agus pléisiúr é seo gan aon bhaint faoi leith le deachrachtaí teanga.  Tá cúrsaí teanga i bhfad níos deacra ná an t-at-mosfaer taitneamhach a bhaineann le ócáideanna ar nós fleadheanna ceoil.  Tá go leor oibre le déanamh ag an mBord na ceisteanna seo go léir a iniúchadh.</P>
    <P>Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, tá tuaranna dóchais ann.  Deirtear go ndúirt Rí Searlais II Shasana fadó, nuair a bhí sé ag fáil bháis, &ldquo;I am an unconscionable long time in dying&rdquo;.  B'fhéidir gur tuar dóchais de shórt é go bhfuil an teanga Ghaeilge i bhfad ag fáil bháis agus nach bhfuil sí marbh fós.  Cinnte, tá dea-thoil ann.  Luaigh an tAire dea-thoil na ndaoine i leith na Gaeilge agus tá sé sin ann.  Ach cad is fiú dea-thoil gan iarracht éigean, gan éifeacht éigean a bheith leis an ndea-thoil?  Mar adrúirt an té an uair a cuireadh amach an suirbhé úd cúpla bliain ó shin, b'é brí na dea-thola go raibh 85 faoin gcéad den phobal sásta go labharfadh 5 faoin gcéad an teanga.</P>
    <P>Tuar dóchais eile Raidio na Gaeltachta.  Tá blas chomh nádúrtha agus chomh dúchasach ar Raidio na Gaeltachta nach foláir bheith ag smaoineamh ar chonas is féidir sprid Raidio na Gaeltachta a leathnú amach i dtreo is go mbeidh lucht éisteachta i bhfad níos mó ná mar atá i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Luafaidh mé mar chomhartha dóchais chomh maith gur mhúscail &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;&mdash;is minic a bhíonn daoine ag caitheamh anuas ar Liam Ó Murchú agus ar &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom speak&rdquo; agus ar an dá theangachas a bhíonn aisteach go leor uaireanta&mdash;ach ní féidir a shéanadh gur mhúscail an clár sin an-spéis sa phobal. Cuireann an clár sin an pobal ag smaoineamh maidir le deachracht na teanga a labhairt.  Is é an rud is mó a chránn daoine, déarfainn, gur <Col N="669" /> chaitheadar na blianta ar scoil agus nach bhfuil labhairt na teanga acu fós.  Ní gach éinne a bhfuil spéis aige sa cheol agus litríocht.  Sé a theastaíonn ó an-chuid daoine ná cumas teanga a bheith acu i dtreo is go mbeadh ar a gcumas a rá: &ldquo;Tá seo agam de bharr na scolaíochta.&rdquo;  Go dtí an lá atá inniú ann, ach go háirithe, ní féidir le mórán daoine é sin a rá.  Is beag a bhfuil acu de bharr a scolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá an-rath ar fad i gColáiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh ar chúrsa atá ar siul le tamall anuas ag Pádraig Tyers, fear stiúrtha na Teanglainne i gCorcaigh.  Is sár-mhúinteoir é, caithfear a rá&mdash;ach deir sé féin go bhféadfadh an-chuid múinteoirí Gaeilge aithris a dhéanamh air.  Tá ranganna ag Pádraig Tyers i gCorcaigh agus tugann sé líofacht dóibh laistigh de thréimhse an-ghairid agus éilíonn sé gur féidir é sin a dhétanamh tríd na tíre ar fad agus nach gá teanglann nó gléasanna costasacha ná aon rud mar sin.  B'fhéidir gur chóir don bhord dul i gcomhairle le Pádraig Tyers agus a leithéidí.  Comhartha eile dóchais, go bhfuil Coláiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh ag tosnú i 1977-1978 ar chúrsa iomlán sa Léann Dúchais agus ábhair ghaolmhara a thabhairt trí mheán na Gaeilge.  I láthar na huaire tá na ranganna beag ach bíonn gach tosnú lag. Ach is maith an comhartha é go bhfuil, don céad uair is dócha le 30 bliain, cúrsaí Gaeilge ar léibhéal dáirire arís san ollscoil sin, agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuilimíd buíoch do Bhord na Gaeilge as ucht gach cabhair a thabhairt chun é sin a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Tá spéis bheag faoi leith agamsa fhéin in imeachtaí Bord na Gaeilge chomh maith, mar táimse féin ar fho-choiste de chuid Bord na Gaeilge anseo i mBaile Atha Cliath.  Is breá liom go bhfuil réim ghníomhartha an bhoird chomh leathan san go bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an mbord i láthair na huaire foinsí na h-athbheochana a chur ar fáil, sé sin na doiciméid stáiriúla gur dámbarr a tharla an athbheochain agus táim ar fho-choiste atá ag ullmhú an bhailiúcháin úd.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mbord féin, is trua nach féidir leis seirbhísí an Seanadóir Whitaker agus an Seanadtóir Mulcahy a <Col N="670" /> choimeád.  Ní ró-mhaith a thuigim cé'n bac reachtúil atá ar bhaill an Oireachtais bheith ina mbaill de bhord mar seo.  Ní fheadar an féidir aon eisceacht a dhéanamh ina gcás siúd ach mar a deirim tá an-mheas agam ar an saothair atá déantha ag an Seanadóir Whitaker agus an Seanadóir Mulcahy ar an mbord agus is trua go gcaithfidh siad imeacht ón mbord nua.</P>
    <P>Nílimse sásta, in ainneoin sin is uile, go bhfuil cumhacht láidir go leor ag an mbord chun déileáil le ranna eile den Stát, go bhfuil fiacla láidir go leor ag an mbord faoi mar a sheasann an Bille.  Sé an saghas blas a fhaghaim as an mBille seo ná nach mbeidh de chumhacht ag an mBord ach comhairle a thabhairt do ranna eile Stáit agus ní leor san. Déanaim amach, chomh maith, gur chóir go mbeadh status faoi leith ag príomh-oifigeach an bhoird ach go háirithe, i dtreo is go mbeadh meas mar ba chóir air agus tábhacht ag baint lena chuid imeachtaí. Déanaim amach gur chóir gradam Rúnaí Roinne a bhronnadh air.</P>
    <P>Do mholfainn don bhord, chomh maith, féachaint ar an nGaeilge agus ar na Gaeltachtaí trí chéile.  Nílimid fós tagtha ar pholasaí náisiúnta Geailge, polasaí nach mbeadh ag féachaint ar na Gaeltachtaí mar shaghas &ldquo;reservations&rdquo; agus dearcadh eile aige ar na Galltachtaí. Tharlódh sé, an aimsear atá amach romhainn, gur mó an tábhacht a bheadh le Gaeilgeoirí san nGalltacht agus leis na líontí Gaelacha san nGalltacht ná na Gaeltachtaí féin.</P>
    <P>Is trua nach bhfuil fáil againn fós ar rud eile atá chomh tábhachtach le Bord na Gaeilge, sé sin Udarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá an gheallúint tugtha le fada go mbunófar an t-údarás.  Dar leis an manifesto i leathnach 43.</P>
    <P>Bunófar Údarás na Gaeltachta sula mbeidh bliain amháin caite in oifig againn.</P>
    <P>Níl sé bunaithe fós áfach agus d'ainneoin nach bhfuilim b'fhéidir in órd tagairt dó anois, ba mhaith liom rud beag a rá; tá súil agam nuair a chuirfear an t-údarás ar bun go mbeidh sé daonlathach agus go mbeidh sé cumhachtach, ar a laghad chomhachtach le comhairle chontae.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt anseo ó chianaibh don easpa comhachta atá ag an mbord, <Col N="671" /> faoi mar a thuigim an Bille seo, chun dul i bhfeidhm ar ranna eile an Stáit.  San geomhthéacs sin, luaim sa deireadh ceist ceartanna sibhialta a bheith ag Gaeilgeoiri.  Aris, san manifesto i leathnach 42,</P>
    <P>Beifear ag súil go mbeidh daoine ann a thogrós a saol iomlán a caitheamh tri Ghaeilge.  Beidh fáilte rompu in aon oifig Stáit nó os comhair na cúirte agus seirbhís ansan dóibh.</P>
    <P>Níl san fíor fós, agus b'fhéidir chun ceartanna Gaeilgeoiri a chosaint agus chun éifeacht Bhord na Gaeilge a chur anuas ar ranna eile Stáit, ní foláir sa deireadh Bille cearta don Ghaeilge a thabhairt isteach.  Tá sé ar intinn agam féin a leithéid de Bhille a thabhairt isteach sa Teach seo agus beidh mé ag súil le cabhair ó Ghaeilgeoirí ar dhá thaobh an Tí, daoine ar nós an Seanadóir Mícheál Cranitch agus an Seanadóir de Brún.</P>
    <P>Tríd is tríd, fáiltím roimh an mBille. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil Gaeilgeoir ar bith sa tír nach fáiltíonn roimh an mBille seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo agus guím rath Dé or obair an Aire agus an bhoird.  Ba iad na Ceiltigh a thug an teanga Gaeilge go dtí an tír seo.  Bhí an teanga Gaeilge faoi árd réim ar feadh breis is míle bliain.  Do shaibhrigh teacht na Críostaíochta an teanga.  Níor chuir ionsaí na nDanar isteach ar fhás agus ar fhorbairt na teangan ach ó tháinig na Normánaigh, d'fhéadfá a rá nach raibh agus nach mbeadh an tí iomlán ina Ghaeltacht a thuilleadh.  Idir chogaíocht agus géarleanúint agus cos ar bholg, ocras agus gorta do tháinig an meath diaidh ar ndiaidh ar an dteanga agus do chaolaigh ar an limistéar Ghaeltachta san tír go hiomlán.  Ansan mar bharr ar gach donas, tharla an Gorta Mór, 1847, agus go gairid ina dhiaidh sin, slán mar a n-instear é, d'iompaigh pobal mór na hEireann i gcoinne na Gaeilge. Chonacas dóibh nach raibh in-ann dóibh ach an bás dá leanfaí san Ghaeilge agus gurb é a leas cloí le Béarla chun slí bheatha a bhaint amach agus chun maireachtáil.  Buíochas le Dia go bhfaca <Col N="672" /> daoine áirithe an meas sin agus an tiompú sin, agus dá thoradh san bunaíodh Conradh na Gaeilge, Cumann Lúithchleas Gael agus eagraíochtaí eile ar an dul chéanna.  D'féadfaí a rá gur shábháil na daoine sin, daoine cosúil le Dubhghlas de hide, an pléamonnach agus daoine eile nach iad an teanga dúinne.</P>
      <P>Ansin chuaigh rudaí ar aghaidh.  I 1916 agus i rith Chogadh na Saoirse. bunú Shaorstát Éireann agus nuair a tháinig an deighilt le linn an Chogaidh Shibhialta d'fhéadfadh duine a rá le fírinne go raibh an dá thaobh, na Poblachtanaigh agus lucht an tSaorstáit, ar aon aigne go hiomlán i dtaobh athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Níl aon dabht ina thaobh san.  Tá an-chreidiúint ag dul do dhaoine mar Earnán de Blaghd, Risteárd Ó Maolchatha agus daoine dá leithéidí a dhein beart íontach chun an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt agus chun go bhfoghlaimeodh daoine an Ghaeilge sna laethanta tosaigh de Shaorstát Éireann.</P>
      <P>Bhí go maith agus ní raibh go holc. Ansin tháinig rudaí eile isteach sa scéal agus b'fhearr dúinn b'fhéidir féachaint mar atá an scéal faoi láthair agus cad na thaobh go bhfuil an oiread sin daoine anbhuartha i dtaobh na hathbheochana. Ar an gcéad dul síos, cad na thaobh gur main linn an Ghaeilge d'athbheochaint? Tá an-chuid cúiseanna leis.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, nach í ár dteanga féin í?  Bhíos ag labhairt le déanaí sa Tí seo, agus duine ón dtaobh eile den Tí, nuair a luaigh mé &ldquo;ár dteanga féin&rdquo; mar ainm ar an nGaeilge, ar seisean: &ldquo;Nach linn an Béarla leis?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá Béarla ag beagnach gach duine sa tir seo, ach maidir le Gaeilge, is í ár dteanga féin í.  Ní le héinne eile í agus í dar liomsa, an rud is saibhre dá bhfuil againn ón duchas.  Ansin san nGaeilge féin tá idir fhilíocht agus fhealsúnacht, agus ba mhór an chailliúint ar fad iad sin&mdash;cailliúint nó imeacht uathu.  Tá saibhreas agus áilleacht uathu.  Tá áilleacht faoi leith ag baint le fuaimeanna gach aon teanga faoi lui na gréine ach chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé linne, tá áilleacht ar leith agus binneas ar leith agus milseacht ar leith inár bhfuaimeanna féin de chuid na Gaeilge.  Ina theannta sin tá an Ghaeilge ceangailte den Chríostaiocht agus an Chríostaíocht <Col N="673" /> ceangailte den Ghaeilge.  Tá an dá rud ar aon dul agus ba mhór an chabhair ar fad an Chríostaíocht a shábháil ach an Ghaeilge d'athbheochaint.  I láthair na huaire níl an scéal go sásúil.</P>
    <P>Aontaím go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún nuair a dhein sé tagairt do chúrsaí oideachais.  Is náireach an scéal é le hinsint, ach tá an-chuid múinteoirí ag teacht amach as na coláistí oiliúna, mar a thugtar orthu anois, agus gan Ghaeilge acu.  Níl aon dabht mar gheall air, is féidir le duine an Ghaeilge a chur ar leataobh tar éis deireadh na céad bliana sa choláiste oiliúna a shroisint ach amháin mioncheachtanna agus mion-taithí anois agus arís.  Is mór an náire é sin agus is mór an difríocht atá idir an córas sin agus an córas a bhí ar siúl nuair a bhís féin san choláiste oiliúna.  Ba mhaith liom go ndíreodh an tAire a aire ar chúrsaí oideachais, ar an Roinn Oideachais agus ar na coláiste oiliúna.  Ba mhaith liom go ndíreodh sé a aire leis ar an dteilifís agus ar an raidio, agus bhéinn ag súil ar a laghad, má táimíd dáiríre i dtaobh athbheochan na Gaeilge, go bhfaighimís uair a chloig as Gaeilge ar a laghad gach oíche ar Theilifís i agus ar Theilifís 2.  Tá an méid sin ar a laghad ag teastáil má táimid chun an athbheochaint a dheimhniú.</P>
    <P>Rud eile dhe, rud a chuireann mistuaim agus caincin agus, féadfaimís a rá, fearg ar Ghaeilgeoirí na tíre ná an droch-fhoghraíocht a chloisint ar an dteilifís agus ar an raidió go minic. Bheimís cráite ar fad muna mbeadh Raidió, na Gaeltachta.  Tá árd-mholadh ag dul do Raidió, na Gaeltachta.  Ba bhreá leat a bheith ag éisteacht leo, na fuaimeanna go cruinn agus go blasta. Fiú amháin na páirtíthe polaitíochta, ní bhíonn siad saor.  Is minic a chloisimid faoi pháirtí éigin ar a dutgtar Pairtí &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo;.  Níl a leithéid de rud ann, faoi mar is eol do gach éinne anseo.  Is minic a chloisimíd faoi Pháirtí &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  Níl a leithéid ann ach oiread.  Ba cheart aon rud a thagann ón seirbhís teilifise nó ón raidió a bheith ina eiseamláir, ina dhea-shampla, don Ghaeilge ó, thaobh foghraíochta agus ó thaobh ceart na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mo bhuíochas mór le Dia go bhfuil furmhór mhuintir an Stáit seo&mdash;agus <Col N="674" /> cruthaionn an dá shuitbhé an fhirinne sin&mdash;an-fhábharach ar fad don athbheochaint.  Is leo an Ghaeilge agus teastaíonn uathu feabhas a chur ar a gcuid cainte, agus tá an méid so ar leathanach 2 d'óráid an Aire:</P>
    <P>Is beag duine sa tir seo anois nar fhoghlaim Gaeilge uair éigin ach, ó tharla nach mbionn cleachtadh ag a bhformhór ar í a úsáid, caileann siad a ngreim uirthi i gcaoi gur lease leo i a labhairt.  Chun iad sin a mhealladh ni foláir deiseanna taitneambhacha a chur ar fáil dóibh chun feidhm a bhaint as an teanga agus, de réir a chéile, tiocfaidh feabhas ar an gcumas labhartha i gcaoi nach fada go mbeidh líofacht acu.</P>
    <P>Tá sé sin thar a bheith fíor.  Muna mbíonn taitneamh ag baint le foghlaim teanga is obair in aisce é agus ní thuigim cad na thaobh nach mbaineann gach Éireannach sár-thaitneamh as foghlaim na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní hé amháin go bhfuil Gaeilge i gceist, ach mar gheall ar an substaint agus an mianach atá san Ghaeilge féin. im thuairim féin&mdash;agus is minic adúirt mé é seo cheana&mdash;do b'fhiú an Ghaeilge athbheochaint muna mbeadh inti ach na hamhráin.  Ina theannta sin tá an ceol. Gabhann na rudaí sin le chéile&mdash;an teanga féin, an fhiliocht, na hamhráin agus an ceol.  Ní mise amháin adúirt é seo.  Níl aon rud ar domhan, aon cheol traidisiúnta in aon tir ag baint le haon chultúr ionchurtha lenár gceol féin. Baineann an rud céanna leis an amhránaíocht agus tá sé sin ráite ag na ceoltóirí is mó ar domhan.</P>
    <P>Tá saibhreas againn.  Cad na thaobh nach dtógfaimís chugainn féin é go hiomlán?  Is mó duine a bhíonn an-chorraithe nuair a bhíonn baol go leagfaí tí mór a bhain leis an 18ú aois nó an 17ú aois, na Georgian houses agus íad sin.  Bionn siad an-chorraithe ar eagla go ndéanfaí smidiríní des na h-iarsmaí a bhíonn le fáil anseo agus ansiúd ar fud na hÉireann.  Ach is rud beo an Ghaeilge, rud an-bhriomhar, agus ba pheaca marbhthach an Ghaeilge a loit nó gan í athbheochaint.  Molaim an tAire as ucht an Bille sin a thabhairt os ár gcomhair; as ucht Bord na Gaeilge a <Col N="675" /> chur ar bhonn reachtúil.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis san obair atá curtha aige roimh an mbord.  Le cúnamh Dé, tiocfaidh an t-am nuair a bhéas Éire ar ais mar Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bille seo chun bonn reachtúil a chur faoi Bhord na Gaeilge, is fada atáthar ag thúth leis, agus molaim an tAire as é a thabhairt isteach nuair nach raibh ach trí ráithe&mdash;an ghnáth-thréimhse iompair&mdash;caite fós aige dá théarma oifige.  Tá mé anabhuíoch dó freisin as ar thug sé d'aithint is de mholadh do chomhaltaí an tseanbhoird, agus mé fhéin ina measc, agus do chomhaltaí Chomhairle na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Faoin Bhille seo, níl sé ceadaithe d'aon Chomhalta den Oireachtas a bheith ina bhall den bhord reachtúil agus ar an ábhar sin, agus ionas nach mbeadh bac ar bith orm mo rogha rud a rá, d'éirigh mé as bheith i mo chathaoirleach an lá a scaipeadh an Bille seo.  Ar ndóigh, ní raibh rún agam riamh fanacht i bhfad mar chathaoirleach. Níor mheas mé ó thús go raibh na cáilíochtaí nó an t-am agam chuige.  Bhí sé de cháilíocht agam, dar ndóigh, go raibh toil ariamh agam don Ghaeilge, ach mar sin féin ní thig liom a rá go ndearna mé riamh gaisciocht ar a son. Bhí mé dílis di ar mo dhóigh fhéin&mdash;mar a dúirt file de chuid na cathrach seo i mBéarla &ldquo;I was faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ar aon chuma, nuair a ghéill mé d'achaine an iar-Aire, Tomás Ó Domhnaill, an dualgas seo a thabhairt orm féin níor gheall mé dó ach fanacht seal gearr ann, fad is bheadh an bhunchloch dá leagan.  Níor shíl mé riamh go mairfeadh an tréimhse thosaigh sin trí bliana gan Bille a bheith rite fós le stadas ceart a thabhairt don bhord.  Ní raibh coinne agam ach oiread leis an deacracht, an mhoill, a bhain le foireann an bhoird a fhostú faoi scáth Choimisinéirí na Státseirbhíse, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur chúis dhíomá dom nach raibh dóthain comhair, dar liom, le fáil le mo linnse ón Roinn Oideachais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé ráite agam cheana go raibh cuid den mhoill a bhain le freagraí a fháil ar mholtaí an bhoird intuigthe agus in-mhaite ar siocair an olltoghcháin, ach <Col N="676" /> caithfidh mé a admháil go ndeachaigh sé rite liom ó am go am bheith foighneach.  Mar shampla, ní bhfuarthas freagra, nó flú cuireadh chun cainte, on Roinn Oideachaís ón lá ar cuireadh moltaí críochnúla chucu i dtaobh foilsiú táacsleabhra le haghaidh meánscoileanna. Cuireadh na moltaí sin chucu in Aibreán na bliana seo caite agus ní bhfuarthas scéal ar bith uatha ón uair sin go dtí an lá ar scoir mé le Bord na Gaeilge.  Is féidir go raibh aird á tabhairt acu ar ár gcuid moltaí an t-am seo ar fad agus go mbeidh toradh air i gceann tamaill.  Acht, más amhlaidh a bhí, ba i ngan fhios dúinn é.</P>
    <P>Ní bhfuaireamar ach oiread tuairimí na Roinne Oideachais ar mholtaí Chomhairle na Gaeilge faoin Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais, rud a d'iarramar tuairim is trí bliana ó shin.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to use the opportunity afforded to me to make a reasonably forceful protest at the marked deterioration in the postal services between the Republic of Ireland and the mainland of the United Kingdom over the past three to six months.  I want to exclude from my <Col N="677" /> remarks postal services to Northern Ireland because there are special difficulties there which we all know about and we can well appreciate the delays that take place in postal services to Northern Ireland.  In general terms they have not deteriorated, considering the difficult situation, nearly as much as one might have expected.</P>
      <P>During the past three to six months there has been a very marked deterioration in postal services between here and the rest of the United Kingdom.  Letter post is particularly badly affected and there is a lengthening of about two days in the time it takes a letter to get from here to England.  For example, whereas a year ago it would have taken two or three days and one could have been fairly sure of delivery in two or three days, posting here and arriving in England, now it is taking five to six days and this is a fairly consistent length of time.</P>
      <P>Without the technical information which the Minister should have at his disposal it is not easy for me to say where the fault lies.  There is a fault, and what I am asking is that the Minister would put his finger on this fault and eradicate it.  It became clear to everybody over the last quarter or so, during the period of the telephone strike, that we cannot now rely on telephones. But the post between here and England has got so unreliable that, if you post a letter, to make sure the message gets through within a week you have to make a phone call as well.  That is a ridiculous situation and I want the Minister to do something about it.  It may not all lie within his bailiwick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember well that when I was a student in Cambridge between 1960 and 1963 I used to get regular letters from my home in East Cork from a small sub post office and they took about four days.  That was because they came from a small sub post office in the country and not a main collecting area.  These letters took four days and it was a fairly consistent pattern.  During that period of time there was a go-slow in the British postal service that lasted for three to four months.  My letters from East Cork to Cambridge all started arriving consistently a day or two earlier than normal <Col N="678" /> during the go-slow.</P>
    <P>This was an interesting phenomenon and was worth investigating.  Of course. I found on a little investigation that what had happened was that the post from the Republic during the go-slow was being diverted away from the main sorting office in Mountpleasant in London and was passing through a smaller sorting office in Birmingham, and though the Birmingham postmen were on a go-slow like the London people the post arrived a day or sometimes two days earlier.</P>
    <P>It could well be that the fault lies partially in the United Kingdom.  In that case it is up to the Minister to do a thorough investigation of this and to apply pressure on his opposite number in the UK.  I am certain that if the reverse situation happened and if there was a serious delay here the UK Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be delighted to apply pressure on our services here. so I ask the Minister to find out where the fault lies.</P>
    <P>My guess is that it is partly the fault of our own postal service and partly the fault of our friends across the water.  The Minister should get together with his opposite number to eradicate these quite unnecessary delays.  It is ridiculous that letters going from here to London should take an average of five to six days.  That is the sort of mean delivery time that I seem to be getting.  A lot of my constituents have raised this problem with me.  People in business find that it is not enough to write a letter to London, to the south of England or to any part of Britain: you have got to make a telephone call as well.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it would have been more difficult to make this case.  That was at the time in which there was a spate of letter bombs being sent, regrettably some of them from Irish addresses. I think most from north of the Border, to well known people in Britain. At that time one just could not blame the British authorities for treating the Irish post with considerably more care than it was usually treated.  In fact, I think they just took in the post and let it lie around for a few days to see if anything happened. Of course it was checked and sorted much more carefully and, no doubt, lots more of the packages were <Col N="679" /> opened by the postal service.  Some of them probably were dipped in buckets of water if they looked suspicious.  Those days now, happily, are gone.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no reason whatever for hold-ups.  I think that in the circumstances the Minister should investigate his own service.  There was some time ago a story during the telephone strike of delays in our Sheriff Street sorting office. I hope that those problems have been sorted out.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, first of all, look at his own service and make sure that it is running at its maximum efficiency and then, if the fault is not seen to lie there or only partially to lie there, when something is being done about that situation, then he can say to his opposite number in the UK: &ldquo;Look, our post is suffering undue delay, the delay is not coming from procedures on our side of the Irish Sea.  Will you please get your situation sorted out and ensure that letters coming from this country to Britain or <i>vice versa</i> are not suffering undue delays up to a period of one to sometimes three days?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> I have listened with interest to Senator Trevor West and I share his concern as regards the inefficiency in the postal services.  In the world we are living in today communication is of vital importance whether that is in the telecommunications sector or in the postal sector.  In regard to any drawbacks which may have arisen over the past few months, as Senator Trevor West has indicated, every step is being taken to rectify this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I would like to make is that the postal service in general is very good and that a considerable effort is devoted to maintaining its overall excellent standard.  I think it is generally accepted that by even European and American standards we have an excellent postal service in this country.  The quality of service is regularly monitored by my Department, and any deficiencies found are followed up to ensure that they are corrected and that any improvements <Col N="680" /> possible are carried out.</P>
    <P>The volume of letters handled is very big, over 400 million a year or well over a million a day.  Even a very small percentage failure in handling would affect a very big number of letters.  Yet the number of complaints received is very small in comparison with the number of posted items handled.  I think it is generally accepted that we have this efficiency, and there is credit due to the postal sector generally for this high efficiency which has obtained in this country down through the years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point that Senator Trevor West has raised, the problem regarding the difficulties which have arisen over the past six months, I should explain that the second-class mail service between here and Britain, printed papers and the like, usually in unsealed envelopes, is conveyed by surface transport between here and Britain.  First class mail, that is, closed letters and postcards, are normally conveyed by air. Some of this mail is flown between Dublin and London but the bulk of it is disposed of by special night flights in both directions between Dublin and Manchester.</P>
    <P>This service has been devised jointly by my Department and the British Post Office so as to integrate the services on both sides to give the maximum service advantage to the posting public in each administration.  Of course the interval between posting and delivery of letters exchanged between the two administrations depends upon the efficiency with which each carries out its part of the operation, whether delivery or collection and onward despatch.</P>
    <P>The special flights are so timed as to secure delivery on the next working day after posting for most of the mail posted in good time in Ireland or in Britain. There is no difficulty regarding the flights which convey mail between Dublin and London.  However, air conveyance on the specially timed flights between Dublin and Manchester was carried out by the Irish airline at an acceptable rate of charge because it was possible for the airline to combine the carriage of mail on this route with other freight contracts.</P>
    <P>That position changed last year in circumstances <Col N="681" /> outside the control of the airline or the Department when one of the major freight contracts involved ceased to carry on business with the airline. This meant that a long-term reasonable rate of charge for the volume of mail carried could no longer be maintained. The mail-load is less than one-fifth of the plane's capacity.</P>
    <P>This change in circumstances was considered by both postal administrations, and it was agreed between my Department and the British Post Office that, if possible, a contract for the conveyance of mail between Dublin and Manchester should be placed with an independent air operator if a suitable one offered.  The fundamental consideration in this decision was that the independent operator would operate a suitable sized plane for the volume of mail to be carried and that his charge would be costed accordingly.  Bids were invited, and a new Irish company was offered the mail contract.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged that the new operations would commence at the beginning of the year.  Unfortunately, the company failed to get the operations started in reasonable time and it was necessary to invite fresh tenders.  These tenders are now being considered and it is hoped that it will be possible to arrange a contract in the near future.  As a temporary measure the mail continued to be flown by Aer Lingus up to the commencement of their strike on a basis that traditional standards of services are preserved for outward mail to Britain but with some unavoidable loss of service for inward mail from Britain.</P>
    <P>During the airline strike the first-class mail had to be carried by surface in both directions.  On resumption of operations the airline found that because of their other commitments they could not restore the temporary services which had been under discussion with Aer Lingus prior to the strike.  This has meant a temporary reduction in the standard of service for much of the mail between the two islands.  I might add that this position has only very recently emerged.  The extent of the loss of service, arising out of the conveyance problem should not exceed a working <Col N="682" /> day.  If delays in excess of this are encountered my Department would be most anxious to investigate them if particulars are provided.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that I am not referring here to items which have to undergo customs examination.  It will be clear from what I have said that the temporary reduction in the standard of service is attributable to an unexpected difficulty in arranging a contract with an independent air operator but it will also be clear that every effort is being made to restore the former standard of services. I should add that in the meantime all means of expediting the conveyance of first-class mail between here and Britain are being explored.  As the Senator will see for this first-class mail we have a special contract with the Irish airlines to carry it between here and Great Britain both ways.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are no small planes for the national airlines that would make it possible to carry our small volume of mail, which is roughly around 3 tons an evening.  The smallest carrier we can hire between here and the United Kingdom is roughly 14 tons, and they would charge proportionately on that type of conveyance.  It would not be possible for the Department to undertake these charges and to make the contract on that basis.</P>
    <P>We are negotiating at this particular time&mdash;indeed we have offered it for tender again and have received tenders&mdash;to see if we can arrange a contract with some independent airline who have a small plane which would be capable of carrying this mail to the two administrations.  I can assure the Senator that everything possible is being done to ensure that we try to restore the former standard because it was an excellent service. The Senator is right to raise the problem, which, especially since the air strike, has become more apparent.  Every effort is being made by both administrations at this particular time.  I assure the Senator that, hopefully, within a very short time we will be able to get back to our original service.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 June 1978.</P>
