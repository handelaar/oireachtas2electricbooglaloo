    <Title>Control of Imports (Amendment) Bill, 1964&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to secure amendments of the Control of Imports Acts which will provide greater flexibility in a situation arising from the gradual reduction of protective tariffs and the substitution of tariffs for import quotas.  The process of reduction of protection is designed to provide a spur to greater efficiency and competitiveness in industry and to prepare us to take our part in a system of freer trade towards which there is an international movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must, however, be adequate safeguards during this period of transition against the dislocation or deflection of trade and consequent loss of employment, which could result from uncontrolled imports of goods with <Col N="1302" /> which our manufacturers cannot reasonably be expected to compete. Indeed, the absence of such safeguards could militate against the speedy re-adaptation of industry to meet the conditions of freer trade, because manufacturers might be slow to rationalise their production if, by concentrating on certain lines, they were to increase their vulnerability to &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; imports.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Bill is designed to limit fair competition.  To do so would be contrary to the spirit of the reduction of protection.  The alterations in the procedure are sought only for the purpose of enabling ceilings to be imposed on imports in those cases where external costs of production are so abnormally low by our standards or by normal international standards that our manufacturers could not reasonably be expected to compete with them within existing levels of tariff protection.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Government may place a limit on the import of certain goods without the necessity for an apportionment among importers. This will enable open general licensing to operate within the overall limit and traders will not have to seek licences to import the goods.  Once the ceiling has been reached, however, the Revenue Commissioners will not admit further goods until a new Order has been made.  Senators will not expect me, because of risks of forestalling, to say what commodities are immediately in mind in this connection.</P>
    <P>Where quota protected goods are concerned, it is also necessary that the same power to impose ceilings in similar circumstances should exist. This is necessary not merely to facilitate the re-adaptation of industries now protected by quota, but also to assist in the transition from quota protection to tariff protection.  Under the existing control of imports legislation, there cannot be two quotas on the one category of goods.  This Bill provides for the removal of that limitation, so that a ceiling may be applied to imports from low-cost countries of particular goods already subject to an existing quota Order.  Where this is <Col N="1303" /> done there would, in effect, be a quota within a quota.  Both quotas would, however, be divided among importers as at present, and licences would continue to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. As I said at the beginning, its purpose is to tailor the Control of Imports Acts to the needs of a changing situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has told us, this Bill is one the primary object of which is to protect our manufacturers and workers against low cost countries.  It is merely an extension and a freeing of the machinery in the hands of the Minister to achieve his object. The main problem for the Minister in this case is to balance between protecting Irish industry from unfair competition and to ensure that efficiency will not be affected in Irish industry and that it will not lie down behind a wall of protection at a time when it is necessary to increase our exports.  This is really a balancing feat on the part of the Minister.  It seems that up to the present this has been rather successfully done, as we can see by recent figures that our exports have been very gratifying. That would indicate that our Irish manufacturers are keeping their price competitiveness in such a way as to be able to invade foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question is the one of our home market.  It is very important that our home manufacturers should meet competition in pricing, quality and design in our home markets because that is really the testing ground on which the goods we intend to export are originally tried out and, in fact, on which they are originally based.  It is important that in that market there should be reasonable and fair competition.  As a distributor, my own experience today is that there is a fair amount of foreign goods allowed to come in here and reasonably compete with our own industrialists, and I am glad to say that our industrialists are competing in the home market with these imported goods.  It is not, however, to be expected that they should be obliged to compete with low cost countries where wages are very <Col N="1304" /> depressed and conditions of employment are very low.  Therefore, there is a necessity for this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point, in connection with the Common Market of which we all hope at some time to be a member, that it is necessary for us to have certain bargaining points in our protection structure which we can use in the meantime to get better advantages in the Common Market countries and, indeed, in the other export markets as well.  If they want to get into our markets and we want to get into theirs we want to have some exchange in our protection pattern for favourable opportunities to be given to us in each other's markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been well covered in the Dáil.  I always think it is a mistake when we try to cover once more the ground that has already been covered in the Dáil, because we are a complementary House.  Anyone who read what appeared in the Dáil Report will feel that.  The points I would have raised on this Bill have already been raised and satisfactorily answered by the Minister in Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, I can say that I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill to my mind is necessary and I am glad that the Minister has introduced it.  At the moment the trade unions are cooperating with the employers and manufacturers in the readaptation of industry, but the trade unions have for some time been concerned that such adaptation would not lead to unnecessary redundancy.  We visualise the adaptation of industry here as something necessary in the long run if employment in industry is to be maintained and expanded.  We have gone from the old days when industry could exist behind a tariff wall, and it is necessary now to raise the level of efficiency to the point where not alone can industry compete against fair imports but it can also expand by finding outlets in foreign countries.  We have, however, always been conscious that the joint efforts of the employers and the trade unions in this matter can be thoroughly upset by low cost, unfair <Col N="1305" /> competition, and I am glad, therefore, that the Minister has taken the necessary power to give some protection against the unfair competition of imports from low cost countries.  I, therefore, welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to support the Bill briefly on the lines referred to by the two Senators who have previously spoken.  When a measure of this kind is seen in the papers or anywhere there is always a certain amount of worry in the minds of the people and, indeed, in particular in the minds of workers in industries producing goods because it is known that from time to time goods come into this country and I suppose into other countries too from long distances, travelling from places where conditions are not the same or anything like what they are here or in neighbouring countries, with nothing like the same conditions or rates of wages paid.  These goods can come into the market and undersell the native product.  We know that goods have appeared in the shops in this country from time to time and can be sold at prices far below similar goods produced here because of the low cost of production and the low rates paid to the workers who produce them.  I hope that we will safeguard ourselves in relation to any imports that would be a danger to the goods we produce here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question in order to clear my mind.  The whole basis of international trade is that you have different costs of production in different countries.  Countries with low costs of production then tend to export to countries with higher costs of production. That is the normal course and, generally speaking, is a useful development for the growth of international trade.  It reduces prices to the consuming public in the importing country. At the same time, I realise that during the period of transition some temporary protection is necessary.  The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;countries with abnormally low costs of production&rdquo;. I should like to ask the Minister how he judges abnormally low costs of production, and where the line is <Col N="1306" /> drawn as between low costs of production and abnormally low costs of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the welcome extended by the Seanad to the Bill.  That was as I expected.  Normally speaking, when a Minister for Industry and Commerce, for the time being, comes before either House of the Oireachtas with the usual renewal of the quotas Bill certain apprehensions are expressed from the point of view of the consumer, that the protection extended by the various quotas covered by the Control of Imports Bill would increase the cost of living for Irish consumers generally.</P>
      <P>Both Houses saw that this situation is not likely to arise, and definitely will not arise as a result of this Bill being passed.  The idea is to effect control only where the goods come from these abnormally low cost producing countries.  That is a relevant deduction in dealing with two of the remarks, one by Senator McGuire and the other by Senator O'Brien.  Senator McGuire referred to our hopes for entry to the Common Market and that this measure would enable our industrialists to rationalise and adapt their industry with some degree of assurance so that the ground would not be swept from under them by unduly low cost imports.  As I have mentioned the Common Market countries, it is relevant to say that the Common Market countries have quantitative restrictions in force against low cost countries. Low cost countries are readily recognisable and I think they are recognisable in particular when goods come into our market from these countries at a price which is lower than the cost of production here of the basic raw materials.  The finished goods coming from these countries are often lower in price than the price of the actual materials that make up the goods in this country; or indeed other countries, where similar conditions of employment, wages, and so on, to ours occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my answer to Senator O'Brien.  It is the most easily recognisable way of determining what abnormally <Col N="1307" /> low cost countries are.  In effect, as the Senator is aware, these low cost countries are usually countries in the Far East or the Middle East, where, for one reason or another, they procure their raw materials cheaply and for the same reasons they can finish the raw materials as consumer goods equally cheaply.  This is a measure which I think is necessary and one which I am glad to see the House welcomes.</P>
    <P>The measure, as I explained, will affect tariff protected goods and quota protected goods.  Tariff protected goods are protected by percentages or minimum specific protection duty, expressed in shillings or pounds per unit of these goods.  It often happens that the minimum specific protection duty is not sufficient without having a succession of new tariffs imposed with minimum specific duties attaching to them.  This quota, which will be a quantitative restriction with a certain ceiling, once reached will eliminate further imports of goods from these countries.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, our quota system is a global one.  Once the quota is appointed goods may come from anywhere in the world to fill that quota.  The danger would be that in our existing circumstances goods from these low cost countries could come in such quantity that the quota would be filled quickly by such imports.  While maintaining a global quota we can appoint a new quota identifying the countries from which the low cost products might be expected to come and ensure that a certain amount having come a greater quantity will not follow and do damage to our own industry.</P>
    <P>I refer not only to our producers in this respect but also to the distributive trade as they also need protection. Traders who support Irish manufactured goods are the people we ought to support and protect.  There is a tendency amongst some traders to get cheap goods in and undersell their competitors.  Therefore, this Bill is designed to protect the distributors as well as the industrialists.  I am glad the House has welcomed it as they have.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question on section 3.  Is the quota granted on any kind of national or regional basis, or is it a general quota and must regions get in as best they can?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a general quota with a money ceiling.  In other words, the ceiling will be determined in relation to the value.  The ceiling might be £100,000 worth of goods, and there will be no restriction as to which country they come from.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point I should like to make.  The non-necessity for the register of countries in this case seems to me to do away with the abuse under which people sell to one another.  Under this system there will be a global quota in respect of which licences will not have to be issued.  In the past when people had more quotas than they needed, they sold them to other people.  I take it the Bill will do away with that abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will do away with that abuse.  There will be two strings to our bow.  First, tariff protection.  If we appoint quotas in respect of goods on which tariffs are in operation, there will be no restriction of importers.  It will be global in so far as the people will be entitled to import the goods <Col N="1309" /> which are concerned.  In the case of existing quotas for goods for distribution the quota licences will be issued on much the system as at present. To repeat what I said to Senator Stanford, a person would not get much for the quota licence he might try to sell as a result of the introduction of this new system of quotas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a question in regard to paragraph (iii) of the section.  At the end of the paragraph it is stated that &ldquo;it shall be lawful to import, without a licence under the Principal Act, goods to which that quota order applies&rdquo;.  How would the public and those considering importing be aware of that?  Would it be published in some way?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1964: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide relief for the policy-holders of the Equitable Insurance Company Limited.  As Senators are aware, I presented a petition to the High Court in May last year for the winding-up of this company on the ground that it was insolvent; shortly afterwards the necessary winding-up <Col N="1310" /> order was made by the court.  Although the preparation of the Bill was prompted by the failure of this one company, Senators will observe that the arrangements which it is proposed to set up by enactment are of a general and continuing nature, so that there will also be suitable machinery for the relief of policyholders in the case of any future insurance insolvency.  I need hardly say that at present there are no indications whatever that any other insurance company will become insolvent.</P>
      <P>The legal position in relation to certain liabilities and assets of the Equitable Insurance Company is not clear and for that reason the liquidator of the company is unable to give any reliable indication of the sums of money required to meet claims under the various classes of policies.  Very roughly, however, he feels that the net liabilities may amount to some hundreds of thousands of pounds.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau, which is representative of all companies doing motor business here, will, under a longstanding agreement with the Minister for Local Government, meet certain liabilities under motor policies, but this will still leave a substantial amount of claims unsatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When news of the failure of the Equitable came to hand, it was hoped at first, that the other insurers would take over some, at least, of its liabilities, and I had discussions with the Irish and British companies with this end in view before I presented the petition for winding-up.  The Irish companies indicated to me that they would contribute one-third of the amount needed to meet all debts in full, provided the balance was contributed by the British companies and/or the Government.  The British companies refused, however, to make any contribution. These companies enjoy full facilities, on the same basis as our own native concerns, to conduct their insurance business here.  In fact, they are to a certain extent shielded from excessive competition by virtue of the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1936. They take about 80 per cent of the non-life business arising here, as compared <Col N="1311" /> with 20 per cent for the Irish companies.  Despite all this the British companies made it quite clear to me that they would not, in any circumstances, voluntarily contribute one penny towards meeting the claims on the Equitable.  The explanation they gave me was that they are opposed in principle to any arrangements for bailing-out any company which gets into difficulty, as this might lead in the future to the adoption of reckless practices by other insurance companies and intermediaries.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from approaches which have been made to me and from appeals made by members of the Oireachtas that unless some special steps are taken the failure of the Equitable will give rise to serious hardships for its policy-holders, particularly in the case of persons who were insured with the company under employers' liability policies.  It is clear also that the failure of an insurance company to meet its liabilities differs in many ways from the failure of an ordinary business concern.  It is no secret that insurance companies act in concert in many matters, including the rating of risks and the determination of premiums.  They all work on much the same principles, and exchange information one with the other.  They are, furthermore, in a privileged position in that the insurance market here in Ireland is, to a large extent, reserved for the companies operating here.  It must be borne in mind, too, that the law has, for many years recognised that the insuring public are deserving of special consideration and protection, within the limits of a free enterprise system.  Taking all these matters into account, I have come to the conclusion that since the insurance industry itself will not voluntarily come to an arrangement under which the policy-holders of the Equitable can be assisted, then it will be necessary to impose such an arrangement on them by legislation.  It also seems to me appropriate that any machinery provided by law should not relate specifically to the Equitable but should be available to deal with any other insurance insolvency situation which <Col N="1312" /> may arise, no matter how remote the possibility of any further failure may be.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British companies have informed me that they are opposed to the introduction of legislation on these lines.  For the reasons I have already given, however, I feel that it is right that, having failed to procure a voluntary scheme, I should introduce this Bill providing for a statutory scheme.  I am satisfied that there should be no difficulty in so operating the proposed scheme, that in any given year the financial burden by way of contributions payable by individual companies will be quite small, and I believe that the arrangement envisaged by the Bill now before the House will not cause any serious financial problem for even the smallest company.  I think it only right to say that I have a feeling that the insurance companies are not violently objecting to this Bill and I expect that in due course they will come round to the view that it is a necessary and reasonabe enactment.</P>
    <P>I have been pressed with the contention that it would be unfair and illogical to require the insurance companies to meet claims under workmen's compensation in view of the decision in principle taken by the Government some time ago to expand the social insurance scheme by providing for payments to persons injured in the course of their employment.  Although this decision has not yet been translated into legislation proposals, I feel that there is some validity in the point put by the insurance companies, and the Bill, accordingly, provides for a State contribution which will be roughly equivalent to the workmen's compensation liabilities of the Equitable.</P>
    <P>The main features of the scheme as envisaged by the Bill are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  All non-life licensed insurance companies will contribute to the fund in accordance with their premium income.  A non-repayable contribution of £30,000 will be made to the fund by the State with the object of covering the Equitable's workmen's compensation liabilities.</P>
    <P>(b)  The fund will be available to meet claims under policies issued by <Col N="1313" /> any insolvent insurance company which is being wound up by the High Court; the eligible classes of insurance will be those for which a licence is needed under the Insurance Acts, other than life; creditors other than those claiming under eligible policies will not have access to the fund.</P>
    <P>(c)  As the annual contributions envisaged will not be sufficient to discharge the liabilities of the Equitable within a short space of time, the Minister for Finance will make loans to the fund to enable it to cover all outstanding claims without delay; these loans will be repaid to the Minister for Finance in due course.</P>
    <P>The insolvency of the Equitable Insurance Company prompted members of the Oireachtas and other persons to ask questions about the degree of protection afforded by the existing law for policyholders in this country.  We will in my view, answer those questions most effectively by providing suitable statutory arrangements for meeting unsatisfied claims on insolvent insurance companies.  As a further safeguard, however, I think it is desirable to revise the present statutory requirements in relation to the deposits made by insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions require that a deposit of £15,000 must be made in the High Court by each company doing motor business and a deposit of £20,000 by each company doing any one or more of the other controlled classes of business, except life and industrial business, where the deposit is £20,000 in respect of each.  All authorities are agreed that these figures which were fixed in 1936, are now too low.  The Bill provides, therefore, that a deposit of £100,000 shall be required from each insurance company, no matter how many classes of business it carries on.  The share capital requirements set out in the Act of 1936, have also been examined but I am satisfied that it would not be feasible to do very much on this score, for the present at any rate.  It should be borne in mind, in this connection, that statutory share capital requirements <Col N="1314" /> do not provide a very concrete type of protection for policyholders since share capital can be lost in the ordinary course of business.  The making of a deposit is in an entirely different category, since this requires the placing of cash or its equivalent in the High Court which retains physical possession of it for the sole benefit of the appropriate claimants.</P>
    <P>Certain licensing rights were provided by the Act of 1936 for Irish and foreign insurance companies, which were doing business here before it came into operation and there is a residue of these rights which has not yet been taken up.  The failure of the Equitable Insurance Company has prompted me to look again at these provisions, and I am satisfied that some tidying-up is called for.  The Bill proposes, therefore, to provide that no new licences may be issued to any company, Irish or foreign, except in the case of a newly established Irish-controlled company satisfying the share capital and other requirements of the 1936 Act.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to make some changes in the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, in relation to the connection between the Minister for Finance and the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited.  I need hardly mention that these provisions have no connection whatever with the other provisions of the Bill; they were inserted in this Bill primarily to save the Oireachtas the time and trouble of dealing with a separate measure.</P>
    <P>The enactment of these provisions will, I feel sure, improve the existing law relating to the insurance industry, and will answer a number of criticisms which have been voiced in the Oireachtas from time to time.  So many people are affected in their everyday lives by this branch of commercial activity, that it is essential to see to it that adequate safeguards are provided to protect their interests.  That is what I have in mind in introducing this Bill to the Oireachtas.  I am satisfied that it will achieve the object to which I have referred and, accordingly, I have no hesitation in commending it to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but I regret very much the necessity for it.  I welcome the Bill because it will save a great number of people from ruin or bankruptcy following the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company, Limited.</P>
      <P>People in this country for some years back regarded insurance as a giltedged business.  In other words, they believed and I think were led to believe that it was impossible for an insurance company to collapse or to fail to honour its commitments to its policy-holders. The collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company, Limited, last year meant that very many people who effected policies with that company found themselves without any indemnity whatever and were faced with huge demands on them either under the Workmen's Compensation Acts or under Common Law.  Therefore, I think the Government had no alternative but to come to the rescue of these policyholders.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the liability of the insurance company concerned amounts to some hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Admittedly, some proportion of that would be looked after by the Motor Insurance Bureau under an arrangement of some years' standing &mdash; I shall not say of long standing &mdash; with the Minister for Local Government.  But there were many other people who had workmen's compensation insurance, fire insurance and other types of insurance with the Equitable who found themselves without any indemnity whatever. To that extent, the Bill is to be welcomed and the Minister and the Government are to be thanked for facing up to their responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret, and regret very much, the necessity for this Bill.  Prior to 1936, the insurance business in this country had come to be regarded as a shady, doubtful business, particularly as far as Irish insurance companies were concerned. The Insurance Act, 1936, did a lot to build up confidence in Irish insurance companies.  Until this particular incident, I think we had reached the stage where a person treated an <Col N="1316" /> insurance company as he would treat the bank or the State.</P>
    <P>It did, then, come as a great shock to the insuring public in this country to realise that notwithstanding the fact that they paid premiums and effected insurance policies it was possible for them to find they were not insured and had no indemnity whatever.  The collapse of this company has done a lot of harm to Irish insurance companies in general.  People with experience of dealing with insurance companies and effecting policies can bear out my statement that people are now inclined to be careful as to where they will place their business.</P>
    <P>I did not come in here to launch an attack on the Minister or on the Government but I say that quite a lot of responsibility for this situation must rest on the shoulders of the Minister and the Government.  If the Government decide to control by legislation a particular business such as the insurance business and, by so doing, lead the public to believe that the State is keeping an eye on their interests, then there rests a heavy responsibility on the Minister concerned and on the Department concerned to keep up to date with the particular industry and to keep an eye on it and, in fact, to give to the public the protection which the Insurance Act, 1936, led the public to believe they had a right to expect.</P>
    <P>One of the protections given to the public by the Insurance Act, 1936, was an obligation on insurance companies dealing, shall we say, in motor business to make a deposit in the High Court.  In 1936 the deposit required from an insurance company doing motor business in this country was £15,000.  In 1936, £15,000 was a sizeable sum of money.  In the same year the number of motor cars on the roads in Ireland was trivial compared with the number on the roads at the present time.  Damages being awarded in the courts at that time were very small. £1,000 awarded then was a very substantial sum of money.  Down through the years circumstances changed and changed drastically.  We have now, perhaps, by a gradual process, reached <Col N="1317" /> the stage where we find High Court juries awarding damages of £75,000 and £60,000.  £20,000 is not uncommon and £10,000 and £15,000 is an everyday experience.</P>
    <P>Despite this we find, nearly 30 years after the passing of the Insurance Act of 1936, the deposit still stands at £15,000.  If the Ministers, all down through that time, were discharging their duties to the public, that deposit should have been altered, and substantially increased, because it is not now sufficient to pay what might be regarded as an everyday award.  The Minister now sees fit to increase that deposit from £15,000 to £100,000. That is certainly a more realistic approach to it but I may be forgiven for saying that it took the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company, with a consequent damage to the Irish insurance world, to bring about that change, which should have been apparent to the Minister several years ago.</P>
    <P>There is also another protection in the Insurance Act of 1936 which takes the form of an obligation imposed on insurance companies to make a return to the Department every year.  I understand, in the case of the Equitable Insurance Company its last return was very much overdue.  In fact, I think the second return was due before the collapse.  At any rate, I am accurate in saying that the auditor's return, which a company is obliged to make, accompanied by an auditor's certificate, to the Department of Industry and Commerce was substantially overdue by the Equitable Insurance Company.</P>
    <P>That might be understandable in an ordinary case and it might be reasonable for the Minister to grant an extension of time to a company to put in the required certificate but one would not have to be a lawyer, or an accountant, to know that the Equitable Insurance Company, at best, was not a wealthy undertaking.  A glance at the balance sheet of the Equitable Insurance Company for any particular year will show that its capital was limited, that its assets were not very considerable, even taken at face value.  A substantial <Col N="1318" /> asset of the Equitable Insurance Company consisted of shares in another company, which were not, to say the least of it, well known on the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, there was an obligation on the Minister to take a special fatherly interest, if you like, in the Equitable Insurance Company. There was an obligation on him to take extra care.  He owed that obligation to the general public, to the Irish insurance industry and to the policy-holders of the Equitable Insurance Company.  The Minister did not act as quickly as he should have acted, having regard to the balance sheet of the company, and as a result this thing was allowed to drift on until the stage was reached when we find that the Equitable Insurance Company is insolvent to the extent of some hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>The Bill is certainly welcome.  It is necessary and any other steps that the Minister feels called upon to take to protect the policyholders of the company will certainly be approved of by this side of the House.  I trust that increasing the deposit to £100,000 will be effective.  Sometimes legislation comes before this House providing for legislation by ministerial order.  Generally speaking, I am not in favour of that type of legislation but in this particular instance the House would feel justified in conferring on the Minister the power to regulate by ministerial order the amount of the deposit which an insurance company should make.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this matter I should like the Minister to deal with if he considers it relevant in his reply and that concerns the claims being made by the Equitable Insurance Company on the agents and policy-holders. Certain agents of the company found themselves indebted to the company perhaps in substantial amounts for premiums collected but not paid to the company at the date on which it went into liquidation.  Most of these agents I understand did not pay that money over to the Equitable but instead expended it in effecting proper policies <Col N="1319" /> of insurance for their clients.  My own personal view is that they were perfectly right in doing that and would be very wrong in paying it over to the company.  I know that the liquidator of the company is pressing these agents and perhaps policy holders too for payment of the amount alleged to be due.  Again, my personal opinion is that there is no liability whatever on these people to pay one penny to the company.  Might I ask what would they be paying it for?  They would be paying for a consideration which had wholly failed.  They would be paying a premium for a policy of insurance which was completely ineffective and gave no cover whatever.  If they paid the premium they would have to pay another immediately after to get proper cover.</P>
    <P>If I am correct that there is no liability on these people in respect of these moneys I think that the liquidator should cease pestering the people concerned with demands for payment. If, on the other hand, there is some legal liability on the grounds that he holds the money in trust or something like that, steps should be taken to absolve the agent or policyholders from liability.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the standard of efficiency, integrity and solvency of Irish insurance companies in general is very high.  There are some excellent insurance companies entirely of Irish origin and control carrying on business here, giving good service and transacting their business in a most desirable way.  That should be said and said again, and I sincerely hope that this catastrophe will not do any irreparable damage to the other Irish companies here.  I think it perhaps is a pity that the Minister saw fit to put section 12 into this Bill, which is regarded by the country in general as the Equitable Insurance Company Bill no matter what we call it.  I know it has nothing to do with it and the Irish Life Assurance Company is absolutely above reproach and is not asking for or seeking or requiring any assistance under this Bill.  It is a pity to include in this Bill any mention of the Irish <Col N="1320" /> Life Assurance Company lest it might lead to misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>With these remarks I repeat that I welcome the Bill but deplore the necessity for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as this Bill is primarily intended to provide for a new and extended insurance compensation fund with specific relief for some of the innocent victims of the recent failure of the Equitable Insurance Company and an overdue revision of the statutory deposits which all insurance companies are required to maintain in court for the protection and security of their clients, in these respects the Bill can be commended to the support of every member of the House.  In my personal opinion, however, the Bill has little else to commend it.  It contains to my mind certain indications of a kind of panic thinking on the part of the Minister and his Department, and in its complete lack of any evidence of awareness on the part of the Minister and his Department of the actual legislative requirements of the insurance industry in this country today it does provoke and call for some constructive criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in my view a good example of a type of ill-considered patchwork legislation, lacking in essentials and full of expedients, on which the substantial cost of legislative machinery should not be dissipated.  I am aware that the Minister was under a certain obligation to ask both Houses of the Oireachtas to give their earliest approval to the primary purpose for which this Bill is intended.  While with other members of the House I deplore the event and the circumstances which necessitated the introduction of a measure of this kind, I certainly wish to commend the primary purpose of the Bill to the support of all sides of the House.  In saying that, however, I know no reason why the Minister could not have brought a straightforward request to the Oireachtas for the enactment of a measure which would have established an adequate insurance compensation fund and also have provided immediate relief for the <Col N="1321" /> Equitable Insurance Company claims while also increasing, in fact, the statutory deposits of insurance companies generally.  He could have done all that without involving by a wholly unnecessary association the name or undermine the integrity of other companies.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the establishment of an adequate insurance compensation fund.  On the contrary, I would suggest to the Minister that by increasing the statutory deposits of all the companies registered here &mdash; I understand there are more than 60 of them &mdash; from £15,000 or £20,000 to £100,000 in that one step, which I wholeheartedly approve, the Minister has, in fact, created automatically a fund of £6 million on which he could take power at any time to draw to make good a deficiency of any one insurer at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials must surely realise that recourse to such funds or reserves as this is surely tantamount to closing the proverbial door after the horse has fled.  This Bill is at best a good expedient devised for the purpose of repairing the losses incurred by certain policyholders from an occurrence which should never have happened.  In my view the fact that it did happen, can, to some extent at least, be attributed to the lack of adequate supervision and examination of the accounts of the insurance companies when those accounts are submitted, as they are required to be submitted by law, to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I submit that soon a more effective system of supervision and stricter control must be introduced over the operations and general activities of such companies.</P>
    <P>In that respect this country is lagging far behind most other countries in Europe and the world at large today. Here in Ireland virtually no regulation or control is exercised over the conditions under which insurance companies are licensed to operate.  I repeat there are virtually none.  Unlike most other countries, the insurance companies here are free to carry on their business as they like, and to appoint what they call agents whose only function is to secure business at the <Col N="1322" /> cheapest possible cost, and without any regard to the actual interests or needs of the insuring public.</P>
    <P>Some tentative steps were taken recently by the Minister to induce a better flow of investment by insurance companies inside this country, but there are foreign companies operating here which are not even obliged to invest here, so far as I know.  This Bill does nothing whatever to remedy that ridiculous situation.  I do not regard this Bill, the primary purpose of which is the establishment of an insurance compensation fund, as adequate protection for policyholders in the future. I am on record as saying in this House previously that all insurance companies, native as well as foreign, should be required by law to maintain within this country sufficient native investments or assets to cover all the liabilities they incur that affect insurance contracts of any type with insurance holders.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I suggest that the interests of the insuring company should be protected by prohibiting the appointment of touts &mdash; I use the word advisedly because in my view that is what they are &mdash; as so-called agents.  The Minister should insist either by licence or registration on some kind of <i>bona fide</i> agents.</P>
    <P>I am rather concerned also to note that the Minister appears to take a very complacent view of the functions of the officials of his Department in their inspection of insurance accounts. In his reply to the debate in the other House as reported in the Official Report, volume 211, column 947 the Minister made the following statement:</P>
    <P>As far as the Department are concerned, the accounts of insurance companies are not required to be audited by the officers of the Department.  There is no provision in the Act requiring officers of the Department to evaluate the assets of an insurance company as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>At that point he was interrupted by Deputy Sweetman who asked:</P>
    <P>What about the doubtful solvency section?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>But there has to be a doubt about solvency &mdash; that is the only case.</P>
    <P>The operative word is &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  That does not convey to my mind an indication of a serious approach to the question of inspection on the part of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>The same type of attitude appears to be in operation in other aspects of the manner in which the Department deal with this matter.  For the benefit of the House I should like to point out that the returns of insurance companies are published by the Department once each year.  They contain a useful mass of information.  They are quite detailed and could be a most useful source of reference for all sorts of purposes in the commercial life of the country.  Let us see what happens.</P>
    <P>On the title page of the latest return it is stated: &ldquo;Summary of the Statements of Assurance Business deposited with the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Insurance Acts, 1909 and 1936, during the year ended 31st December, 1962.&rdquo;  That return did not become available in this House or anywhere else until well into 1964.  I purchase these returns every year, and I have had experience of asking for them as late as the month of May, for the period covering practically two years before that date.  I do not say this is the fault of the Minister or his officials.  I think the fault lies in the fact that this is the requirement prescribed by law.  The trouble begins with the fact that the companies are not obliged to deposit this information, let us say for 1962, until whatever month suits them in 1963, right up to 31st December, 1963.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell the House that the meat, the essential information in the return, is advertised publicly by practically every insurance company operating in the country.  Usually it is published in a matter of weeks or even in a matter of days after the close of one current year.  I have seen advertisements published of the returns of more than one company in the first <Col N="1324" /> two or three days in January.  I grant you that might be a bit early, but surely they could be expected to have the returns deposited sooner than 12 months after the year for which they are appropriate.  That type of requirement is lacking here.  There should be a much more realistic approach to the whole matter.  That accounts for the delays to which Senators and Deputies referred which took place in ascertaining vital information in the case of the Equitable.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the purpose in insisting upon submission of accounts and data of that type if, in fact, every aspect of the accounts is not seriously and minutely studied by the Department.  Surely there is an obligation on the Department to acquaint themselves with the information contained in the accounts and, if necessary to act on their own initiative in dealing with them.</P>
    <P>To my mind the establishment of an insurance compensation fund, no matter what the amount of the fund may prove to be, is a very poor substitute for a more thorough examination of the accounts each year.  The establishment of a fund may give some more security to policyholders in the future.  Of course it will, but I want to point out that it will do so only at the expense of the insuring public.  Already spokesmen for the insurance companies have indicated that quite clearly.  I should like to quote now, if I may, a gentleman who is described as the honorary secretary of the Irish Insurance Association, an association, I understand, of most, if not all, of the Irish insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Speaking, I think, in Cork, as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on Wednesday, 24th July, he said, in reference to this Bill, that, in effect, the Insurance Bill, 1964, now proposed to compel the companies to extend this voluntary agreement to all other classes of insurance schemes &mdash; the reference there is to the Motor Insurance Bureau.  He said that such a fund is to be administered by the courts and not by the companies.  It is certain that the companies must budget to pay a very considerable additional sum.  The <Col N="1325" /> House may take it from me that if they have to budget to pay a considerable additional sum then no company, Irish or foreign, will provide that very considerable sum without recourse to their policyholders.  Therefore, a very considerable sum &mdash; which the creation of this fund will involve, apparently &mdash; will inevitably result in higher premiums.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that some foreign companies have apparently refused to contribute voluntarily to this fund.  I am not surprised to hear the Minister say that in some cases they have suggested that the existence of such a fund could provide a cloak either for further defalcations or the adoption of reckless practices. It is typical of the contempt in which certain British insurance companies seem to hold most if not all of our Irish institutions.  It is common knowledge that a number of them, for instance, even deny the right of their staffs to organise and openly flout and even insult the findings of our Labour Court.</P>
    <P>It is time we ceased genuflecting to such people.  I am very glad to see that the Minister is taking power in this Bill to compel them to conform to his requirements.  He has taken that step in the right direction.  I hope it will be the first step in an advance along a road where much will be done to clean up the present state of the insurance industry in this country.</P>
    <P>I should prefer to see the Minister take effective power in this Bill to compel British and other companies operating here to conform to better standards not only in dealing with the public but in the employment of their investment funds in this country and in their treatment of their staffs.</P>
    <P>One of the most objectionable features of this Bill is the unwarranted association of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, with the primary purpose for which this Bill is intended. I can assure the Minister that the inclusion of sections 12 and 13, neither of which has any relevance whatever to the primary purpose of this Bill, is very deeply resented.  To my knowledge, it has given very serious cause <Col N="1326" /> for concern to many people, including both the management and the staff of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited.  Was there any consultation with that company before these clauses were inserted?  That, perhaps, might not be a fair question to address to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Finance would probably know more about it.  I notice that these sections are included at the request of the Minister for Finance so perhaps we are dealing with the wrong Minister.</P>
    <P>There never was any association of any kind between the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, and the Equitable Insurance Company, Limited.  As Senator Fitzpatrick rightly said, I believe this Bill will go down in history as the Equitable Insurance Company, Limited, Bill. These two companies transacted two entirely different classes of business. They were registered under different sections of the Insurance Act.  They had nothing whatever in common either to warrant or to justify the regrettable association of the name of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, with the limited purpose of a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>The financial stability of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, is above question and beyond any dispute. Its resources are virtually impregnable. The assets of the company &mdash; I am alluding to their life funds &mdash; now actually exceed £40 million.  The business of the company in both branches of life assurance is expanding at an unprecedented rate in this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself specifically excludes all life assurance companies from the scope of sections 1 to 11.  Why, then, associate the name of any company in the position of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, with a Bill of this kind?  It has caused unfounded gossip and unnecessary concern and anxiety to policyholders and staff.  It has presented the company's less scrupulous competitors with gratuitous ammunition with which to swipe again at a sound and progressive Irish enterprise.  There is further evidence <Col N="1327" /> here of the kind of thoughtless and irresponsible approach on the part of the responsible Department to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Another inexplicable feature of this Bill, the introduction of which is again the function and the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is the inclusion in it of sections 12 and 13 at the request of the Minister for Finance.  In section 12 the Minister is given power to purchase a limited number of shares &mdash; I understand it is considerably less than 10 per cent of the total shareholding &mdash; in the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, held by a small number of individuals other than the Minister for Finance.  I understand that the Minister informed the other House that there is little or no prospect of these people selling their shares.  Does the Minister for Finance, therefore, propose to resort to compulsory acquisition of the minority shareholding? On that, I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be as specific as possible.  Incidentally, a good case could be made for it but I am not making that case.</P>
    <P>In the same section 12, the Minister for Finance is given power to sell his holding of shares in the same company. I understand that the Minister for Finance has indicated that he now has no intention of disposing of his interest in that company.  Simultaneously, the Minister admits that he is already vested with power to sell these shares if he so decides at any time.  Why, then, are these two totally unnecessary provisions written into the Bill?  Is it not evidence of the lack of discretion to which I have already adverted?  I submit that it is.</P>
    <P>Section 13 purports to remove some mysterious doubt on the qualification of the Minister for Finance, as the majority shareholder of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, to qualify under certain headings specified in the Agreement scheduled to the 1938 Act.  On this point, however, we are told that the Minister for Finance himself has no doubt whatever.  We are entitled to ask the Minister for <Col N="1328" /> Industry and Commerce if there was any real justification or necessity for the inclusion in this Bill, with all the implications it poses for the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited, of the type of verbiage contained in this section on a very moot point, at the request of the Minister for Finance. I hope there is nothing indicative in that fact of any intention that at any time in the future the Minister for Finance will sell either the whole or any part of his shareholding in Irish Life. I am personally aware that there will be some possibility of that in the near or distant future.  There are rich plums in that company ready for the picking if they could be got.  I hope the Minister will have proper and serious regard for his responsibility in the interests of the policyholders of this country, to say nothing of the State, in the continuing prosperity of that company in the future.</P>
    <P>I shall have more to say on this particular section of the Bill when it comes to Committee Stage.  Meanwhile, I suggest the Minister could give reassurance to everybody concerned by deciding now to delete from the section the provision which merely confers on the Minister for Finance the existing right under the 1938 Act to sell, or otherwise dispose of, his holding in the shares.  A decision in this regard at the present time would give reassurance to everybody concerned on that point.  Finally, I hope the Minister will not regard any criticism I have made as being directed to himself.</P>

      <P>Much the same statements <Col N="1329" /> were made here as were made in the Dáil except for some comments by Senator Crowley.  I do not like to go over the same ground again.  Senator McGuire established a good precedent in this respect in relation to the other Bill which has just been dealt with by this House.</P>
      <P>The machinery provided for in the 1936 Insurance Act for the lodgment and inspection of accounts of insurance companies was operated in this case. Senator Fitzpatrick suggested that the accounts were substantially overdue.  I explained in the Dáil that the accounts for the year ending 30th June have to be lodged, by statute, at 31st December but the Insurance Acts give a discretion to the Minister, which he is bound to exercise according to the statute, to extend the period for lodgment of these annual accounts to the following 31st March.  In effect, the accounts for 30th June could be lodged legally up to 31st March of the next year.  It is not unusual for an insurance company to request an extension up to that time.  Deputy Sweetman, who was the principal Fine Gael spokesman in the Dáil, readily acknowledged that.</P>
      <P>Section 46 gives power to the Minister to require certain information in the case of companies of doubtful solvency.  The doubt about the solvency of the Equitable Insurance Company arose in the concluding months before the final accounts were lodged and before I moved for the compulsory winding up of the company.  There is no magic wand in section 46, if I decide to use it.  In the first case a doubt about solvency must be there and the then Minister would ask for certain information, and, if necessary, appoint an inspector, in the event of the accounts being overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pressed the company to lodge the accounts and ultimately got them, admittedly in an incomplete form, but in a form which was sufficient to indicate to me that the company was not solvent.  With regard to the suggestion that the Department should exercise more control and that they should, in effect, audit the accounts of an insurance company, I suggest that would put an impossible obligation on the public service, far beyond that fixed by the <Col N="1330" /> statute.  In the first place, it would be impossible, with the existing staff to do that and it would also put a considerable burden on the taxpayer to audit the accounts of all the companies who have to submit and lodge their accounts with the Department.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I might demonstrate the impracticability of this course when I mention there are scores of foreign companies legally operating here in this country.  Such an obligation to audit their accounts and evaluate the securities of these companies would mean auditing their business in Britain, the continent and elsewhere and evaluating their securities, no matter where they were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <P>I am speaking about the requirements of the 1936 Insurance Act and I am trying to point out that what some people said should have been done by the Department would be impracticable.</P>
      <P>In any event, my calling on this company to lodge their accounts was acted on in the most expeditious way. There could have been no question that the utilisation of section 46 would have disclosed the true situation any more quickly.  In any event, the liabilities of the Equitable Insurance Company were liabilities which had accrued over a considerable number of years in the matter of workmen's compensation and other liabilities.  At any given time, if the Equitable Insurance Company were wound up there would have been a deficit.  I am not putting this forward as a defence, as was suggested in the Dáil.  I am putting it forward as an indication that people at any time would have been caught by the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company.  I do not believe the amount involved would have been different had I acted some months previous to April, 1963, when I did get the account and act accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick suggested that agents who had collected money in lieu of policies and who had placed the policies in other companies, other <Col N="1331" /> than the Equitable Insurance Company, were entitled to be indemnified to the extent of any money that they used in this respect.  As the Seanad knows, the affairs of the company are in the hands of the liquidator and I cannot make any decision in that regard.  As the Seanad is aware, the affairs of the company are being wound up by a liquidator appointed by the High Court and under the control of the court.  Any agent who receives a demand from the liquidator to pay moneys he got for this company could, of course, have recourse to the court if he is not bound to pay it.  Incidentally, I am not aware that representations have been received in the Department either before or since the order for liquidation was made by the High Court with regard to premiums that were collected by agents or brokers and not paid to the Equitable Insurance Company.  Deputy Tully in the Dáil mentioned something to this effect as far as brokers were concerned. The first mention I have heard regarding agents, who are also brokers, and policyholders was from Senator Fitzpatrick here today.</P>

      <P>I am not denying it. The fact is that any relief that is forthcoming under the law will be forthcoming from the capable hands of the High Court judge now responsible for the liquidation of the company through the officially appointed liquidator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mention of the Irish Life Assurance Company in the Bill was completely incidental.  It was made at the request of the Minister for Finance who is, on behalf of the public of this country, the principal shareholder.  If I would not act at the request of a person acting in that position then I would not act on anybody's request. Surely I was entitled to accede to the request made by the Minister in this respect.  Before I deal with the matter on its merits, of course there can be no doubt whatever about the solvency of the Irish Life Assurance Company, and I cannot see how any doubt could <Col N="1332" /> be imported into this Bill.  I said that categorically in the Dáil, that it is purely a matter of administrative machinery in order to clarify certain points dealing with the relationship of the Minister for Finance with that company.  It has no reference whatever to a suggestion of insolvency.  On the contrary, the steps that the Minister for Finance is asking me to take in this respect are only further proof of the integrity of that company in every way.  The position as far as shares and the disposal of shares is concerned is that up to this the Minister for Finance could only sell certain shares and he did not have power to acquire new shares.  There is no suggestion that he should acquire existing shares, or compulsorily acquire existing shares. The new provision will give him power to acquire new shares and I think that is a desirable thing.</P>
    <P>The other provision, in section 13, refers to the voting rights of the Minister for Finance.  Some suggestion was made that the Minister for Finance was not a beneficial owner or did not qualify under certain other qualifying terms in the articles of association as far as the voting rights were concerned, and the purpose of section 13 is to set out in unequivocal terms the voting rights of the Minister for Finance.  It has no other meaning.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley made all kinds of accusations of irresponsibility, thoughtlessness, patchwork legislation and panic legislation, and then naïvely says: &ldquo;I am not imputing anything like this against the Minister.&rdquo;  Of course, he is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he is because nobody but the Minister is responsible, and I want to say this of Senator Crowley, that he brings in here a written statement in which he grinds a personal axe in this Bill on matters that have no relevance to the Bill.  He made reference to the registration of insurance agents.  Senator Crowley wants to exclude the widow who does an odd bit of insurance to help her keep her family, and to exclude <Col N="1333" /> a lot of others from earning a little to help them make their way in the world.  That is the type of registration that he wants and he cannot deny it.  He wants to exclude bank managers. I have no brief for bank managers who may do insurance business on the side, but I have to have regard for the other people trying to make a little income from any source they can find.  That is the personal axe that Senator Crowley is grinding here intermingled with his allegations of thoughtlessness or irresponsibility and of all that kind of thing that he makes against me.</P>
      <P>Senator Crowley also said that this legislation will inevitably lead to higher premiums.  I do not know whether he wants this legislation in this form or not.  On the one hand, he says that the Government are living up to their responsibilities in this respect by providing compensation for the Equitable policy holders.  Does he suggest that all the compensation should come from the taxpayer only and that the insurance companies should not pay anything? I do not think he does.  But if the insurance companies are not going to pay and if, as I think, he will not want the taxpayer to pay, how else does he propose that the fund should be provided?  In any event, I propose to discuss the method of payment into this fund with the insurance companies and to suggest a scheme to them and to the Minister for Finance, who will have to advance the moneys for the fund initially, to ensure that the annual levy on any insurance company will be small enough to ensure that there will be no justification by reason of the levy alone to increase insurance premiums in this country.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with the main points.  Some Senators will have more to say on the Committee Stage and I propose to deal with anything they say on that stage.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask as a personal favour if it could be done today.  Apart from suiting my personal convenience, there is a great urgency about this Bill, to have the fund set up.  I understand that the Seanad will not be sitting next week and there is a prospect of the Dáil having adjourned in the meantime so I would appeal to the Seanad to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister I should like to point out that this Bill was introduced in the Dáil last Thursday and this is Wednesday. Less than a week has elapsed since it was brought in and it is now past the Second Stage.  It is very unfair to members of this House at any rate if not to the other House as well.  There is quite a good deal more to be said about this Bill and I am sure that a number of members would wish to comment on it.  I have no wish to hold up the work of the Minister and his Department but I am considering putting down an amendment to a particular section on which I am being pressed and I need at least time to think that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is done, as the House is aware the Dáil expects to adjourn either this evening or not later than tomorrow and if an amendment is introduced here &mdash; and I do not deny the right of the House to introduce an amendment &mdash; it will mean that this Bill cannot be passed until very late in the year, possibly not until December, and in the meantime quite a lot of people who are policy holders are being pressed for payment of sums due on foot of their legal liability, in particular people who have workmen's compensation claims against them and are now in a bad way because they cannot meet the claims of the insured workers who had been in their employment. Severe hardship is already being suffered.  It would be very severe on <Col N="1335" /> many people if this Bill were delayed, and I would appeal to Senator Crowley to have regard to that and to let us discuss his observations in Committee to see if we can deal with them then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to all Stages of the Bill being taken today, but if Senator Crowley wishes an opportunity to put down an amendment, he is certainly entitled to that opportunity.  This is a classical example of the futility of rushing legislation through the Oireachtas at this time of year.  It has been said before, but it is no harm to say it again, that we get at least half a dozen Bills at this time of year, and we are expected to deal with them like machines.  If a Senator puts forward a case such as Senator Crowley has put forward, he is met with the stonewall which the Minister has built up to him: &ldquo;If you do that you are depriving the people of the Bill&rdquo; and that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that special circumstances apply in this case.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, I was trying very hard to get a voluntary scheme, and it was only when those efforts failed that this Bill became necessary.  It was published on 18th June, the earliest possible date.  I can assure the House that if I had known earlier that the voluntary scheme would not be accepted, I would have introduced the Bill much sooner.  In the event, the position now is that the Oireachtas will be rising at an early date and it will not be possible for the Dáil to come back until late in the autumn&mdash;possibly November, and possibly December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the precise difficulty in which I find myself.  I do not wish to delay this Bill.  I am perfectly well aware of the fact that many people are waiting on the Bill.  The amendment I wish to put down is not in connection with sections 1 to 11. It deals with sections 12 and 13.  There is no justification for those two sections, and certainly no justification for including them in this Bill.  There is a specific Act which deals with the <Col N="1336" /> functions of the Irish Life Assurance Company and if any amendment is required that Act is the place for it, and not this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable. I know many people are waiting for relief under sections 1 to 11 because of this Equitable affair.  I am entitled to consideration in regard to sections 12 and 13 and I have got a very poor answer from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for an explanation of some of the matters that appear here. This is the section that makes provision for payment to the liquidator of the company of certain sums including costs or expenses, if any, necessarily and reasonably incurred.  Would the Minister be able to tell us what costs and expenses are specifically referred to there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Higher up in subsection (1) the Seanad will see that provision is made that there may be paid out of the fund to the liquidator of an insolvent insurer any sum which is due to a person under a policy issued by the insurer.  There was some comment on that phraseology in the Dáil yesterday, and I undertook to inquire whether that sum would include, for example, a decree against an insured person for costs and expenses of the plaintiff together with the costs of defending the insured person.  I am assured that that is the case.  Lower down in the section the words &ldquo;together with the costs and expenses aforesaid (if any) incurred by him&rdquo; appear.  Those costs and expenses do not in fact refer to the costs and expenses of the action, but the costs and expenses of the policy holder in procuring payment out of the compensation fund.  It is not anticipated that such costs and expenses will be in any way significant, if they arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear beyond doubt that the section covers costs and expenses which a successful claimant <Col N="1338" /> might recover against an insurer, but does it refer to the costs and expenses of an insurer incurred by him in defending proceedings brought against him by a third party?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1936 Act, Irish companies established before the Act were entitled to do certain classes of insurance if they so desired.  Similarly with British companies which were already established.  The purpose of this section is to freeze the present position.  Almost 30 years have elapsed since the Act in question was passed.  Some of the companies have not seen fit to take full advantage of the 1936 Act.  The intention now is to freeze the position and to confine these companies to the classes of business which they are now doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the House might have confused my reference to registration or licensing.  It has nothing to do with this section.  Personally, I am wholeheartedly in agreement with what the Minister is doing in this section. I think the Minister was rather unkind to me when he said that I have some sort of personal axe to grind on this matter.  I have none whatever.  I hold no brief other than my desire to see that this industry is properly run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will not convince me or many people if he feels that the important advice a client needs when he is transacting particularly a life <Col N="1339" /> assurance contract might be left in the hands of people who have no permanent or vested interest in that transaction. To suggest that somebody such as a widow should be allowed to do that, almost for the sake of charity, is to my mind reducing the whole concept of commerce to something hardly worth contemplating.</P>
    <P>We shall be having other talks with the Department on this matter.  I shall not hold up the House now but there is a case for it.  It is necessary in America, Canada, Belgium, Sweden, Australia and in practicably the whole of Europe outside the British Commonwealth itself.  With the possible exclusion of Britain, we are the only country that continues to allow this particular system to operate.  It has nothing to do with this section.  I am in favour of this section.  The Minister is perfectly right in taking power at this stage rigidly to control the grant of further insurance licences in this country.  There are too many of them there already.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 8 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, if an insurance company engaged in, shall we say, a motor business here desires to continue, it is obliged to deposit £100,000 with the accountant of the High Court.  That applies to every insurance company operating here.  This section deals with Lloyd's syndicates.  There are various syndicates of Lloyd's operating under different titles separate and distinct from each other.  As I see it, all of these groups are covered by a deposit of £100,000.  Is that correct?  If it is correct, I shall have something else to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to apply the same obligations to Lloyd's syndicates as are now being imposed by section 8, that is, the deposit of £100,000 in respect of a class <Col N="1340" /> of insurance business.  As I have said already, motor business requires a deposit of only £15,000.  Other classes of business require differing amounts. Sections 8 and 9 require the deposit of £100,000 irrespective of what class of insurance business is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Lloyd's are in a different category from most other insurance concerns.  There are a lot of English insurance companies here giving quite good employment.  They have offices here and transact business in the normal way, Lloyd's, on the contrary, do not employ any staff here. They have no offices, properly so called.  I think they should be dealt with in a different way from other companies.  I should be inclined to require a separate deposit from each syndicate of Lloyd's operating here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister quite satisfied that we shall not have a repetition, as a result of the drafting of this section, of what happened to the Equitable Insurance Company, Limited?  Does it mean that at no time they may have less than £100,000? Does this section fully safeguard the future position?  Suppose they have liabilities of £150,000.  How is the Minister to know that they would not have greater liabilities than the deposit of £100,000 and where, then, is the policy holder safeguarded?  Should it be on the basis that at least all the time they will be able to keep deposited the amount that would be required to meet all the liabilities which they might incur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be an impossible obligation on an insurance company.  Nobody can determine in advance what a liability is likely to be. In a motor accident, a man might be injured and the claim might be worth £10 or £10,000.  Nobody can determine in advance of the claim being made and prove what the liability is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the obligation to deposit £100,000, there are also obligations that a new company registering must be an Irish company and must be a company with a share capital of <Col N="1341" /> £200,000 of which £100,000 is paid up. Therefore, there is also that safeguard. Over and above all that, there will be this fund which is now being created. It is not intended to have this fund built up to astronomical heights.  Initially, it will be kept to about the sum that would be required to pay off the Equitable liabilities.  If and when the occasion arises &mdash; which I expect will be never &mdash; that we shall have to come to the assistance of policy holders in respect of another insolvent company then the legislation is there to enable the fund to be built up in the same way as this fund is being built up.</P>
    <P>With regard to Lloyd's, I am sure they would argue that, with their particular set-up, there should be no deposit at all.  The Senator, I am sure, is aware of the requirements of membership of one of the Lloyd syndicates. I believe they are very rigid.  One must establish not only one's solvency but one's financial background before one becomes a member of Lloyd's Syndicate. They also have some internal rescue arrangements of their own. However, we do control the number of these syndicates that may operate here and the size of the business they may do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that he should avail of this opportunity to make this particular group &mdash; I want to make it perfectly clear I am not speaking about British companies generally but about Lloyd's &mdash; establish an office in the city of Dublin?  I think I am correct in saying they have not an established office in the city of Dublin or anywhere in the Republic of Ireland.  They operate through representatives here.  I think I am also correct in saying that Lloyd's policy contains an arbitration clause which obliges an insuring person who wants to go to arbitration, to travel to the city of London.  That is most undesirable.  Very many people enter into these insurance contracts, without fully realising their rights and obligations.  If a person has reason to complain about his rights under a Lloyd's policy I think it is provided that the arbitration takes place in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> Again, I say they have not any office here and they do not employ any substantial staff.  It would be a good idea to compel them to invest here.  I do not know how Lloyd's invest here.  I know other British companies invest substantial sums of money here but I do not know what Lloyd's invest.  I hardly think they invest very much. This would be a good opportunity to compel them to make as many deposits as they have syndicates.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to what the Minister said on Second Stage in connection with this and the following section.  I understood him to say that it is here at the request of the Minister for Finance, who considers it necessary.  I am open to correction but I also heard him use the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;. I want to repeat again that something is being done in this Bill which is causing a lot of concern to many people.  If it were serving any practical purpose I would be less severe in my criticism but it is not doing so.</P>
      <P>I am suspicious of this.  I do not like it there and I do not want it.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he could reassure me and a lot of other people by agreeing to a reasonable amendment of this particular section.  Senator Fitzpatrick has already said we would be far better off without the section in the Bill at all.  The Minister is, if I may say so, acting unreasonably.  While I do not want to be unreasonable to the Minister or this House, I am conscious of the position the Minister is putting me in.  I do not want to be accused by somebody of holding up relief to the unfortunate people who suffered because of the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company.  As I say, that is the Minister's fault.  I do not like the use of the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  I only use this after careful thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of the Minister and his Department to the whole question of the inclusion of these two sections <Col N="1343" /> is most unreasonable.  It would be much better to leave out these two sections of the Bill.  If any change were being emphasised in this section of the Bill in the capital structure of the Irish Life I should be the first to welcome it.  I would even welcome it inside this Bill if it were done in that way and for that reason.  It is there only because of the fact that the Minister for Finance wants here to confirm his right to dispose of his shares in that company.</P>
    <P>He already tells us he has the right to dispose of the shares, whenever he needs to exercise that right.  Here we are asked to regard it in these words although the Bill has nothing whatever to do with that company.  Surely that is unreasonable.  I would strongly put it to the Minister that he could make much better use of the time of his Department and this company in avoiding legislation of this kind.  I should be satisfied if the Minister would agree to amend this section. Would he delete two words from line 17 in section 12, &ldquo;and sell&rdquo;?  They are superfluous and unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to confirm what I said on the Second Stage.  The word &ldquo;thoughtless&rdquo; has been used here a number of times throughout this debate.  Sections 12 and 13 have been thoughtlessly included in this Bill.  All the other sections of the Bill, sections 1 to 11, inclusive, and, indeed, sections 14, 15 and 16 are there for the specific purpose of cleaning up a mess created by the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company.  It is hoped as the Minister said, when this mess has been effectively cleaned up, that this Bill will never be required again.  It is a great pity that the Bill was availed of to deal with the Irish Life Assurance Company, especially as the provisions of the Bill dealing with the Irish Life Assurance Company have no relevance whatever to the remaining sections of the Bill.  The Minister would have been much better disposed if he had introduced a small Bill, called the Irish Life Assurance Company Bill, 1964. The impression has got abroad that <Col N="1344" /> there is some sort of connection between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot state strongly enough that there is no connection, and I do not think the fears of Senators about a connection between the Irish Life Assurance Company and the Equitable Assurance Company are real fears.  I expressed myself as strongly as I could in the Dáil that the Irish Life Assurance Company were as solvent as it is possible to find an assurance company in the world &mdash; a company going from strength to strength.  We should be all the more proud of this in view of their fine record of investment in Irish industry.</P>
      <P>As I have already explained, under the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, which set up the Irish Life Company, the Minister for Finance had power to sell certain shares.  He had no power to purchase shares.  This section will give him power to purchase and the reason is obvious.  There is no intention of forcing anybody compulsorily to sell shares but the Minister for Finance will have power to subscribe to new shares in any new issue.</P>
      <P>Under the present structure of the company, the Minister is the major shareholder and it is only right that he should be empowered to subscribe if the company seek new capital for expansion.  In the event of the Minister buying new shares, there might be some doubt about his legal power to sell these new shares.  I am informed that the power to sell in the existing legislation, which gave him power to sell shares, may perhaps limit his powers to the shares he already possesses, the shares he acquired on the passing of the 1938 Act.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is essential that the words &ldquo;and sell&rdquo; be included in this section as well.  In the event of the Minister for Finance acquiring new shares, it should be beyond doubt that he would have power to sell those as well as those he gained possession of under the 1938 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were the position, I should be quite happy, but is is not the position &mdash; not quite, at <Col N="1345" /> any rate.  I am afraid it becomes necessary now to go back over the ground already covered.  We must bear in mind that there are certain powers in the 1938 Act.  Again, I wish to point out that if the requirements of the Minister for Finance were as simple as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us, surely the proper thing to do would be to amend the old Act.  That is where all the trouble is coming from.  I shall go a step further. The insertion here, and its retention, of the power to sell these shares is looked on with suspicion at the present time. I believe the present capital structure of the company is unsatisfactory and needs reorganisation but not along the lines the Minister has just suggested &mdash; to dump their shares on the market for purchase by the highest bidder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested there might be a new flotation &mdash; an accretion of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this point on the section, and I think it is as good an opportunity as any to make it?  The Minister will hold with me that this type of capital structure is, in fact, totally unsuitable to a life assurance company of the strength and prospects of this company.  Total paid-up share capital at the moment is, I think, £90,000.  It certainly does not exceed £100,000.  As I pointed out earlier, the company's assets exceed £40 million.  Their liabilities will naturally be in some proportion to those assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liabilities of the company must be very heavy and certainly £90,000 or £100,000 offers no protection whatever to the policy holders.  The only function that £90,000 or £100,000 has at the moment is that it confers on the holders of that capital something like 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the surplus thrown up by the company.  What would that mean if the Minister for Finance should get the bright idea of putting these shares out for auction? That is what worries me.  We think it would be a most foolish thing to do. In the interests of the Irish taxpayers &mdash; the taxpayers have an interest to the extent of £1¼ million in the future of this company&mdash;I should like the <Col N="1346" /> Minister to be more specific in his assurance to me.</P>
    <P>I should like him to tell us categorically that the Minister for Finance has no designs on making the shares of the company available to the general public at any cost.  I do not think that would be a right thing to do.  If the Minister had the future of the company and of the country at heart he would seriously consider mutualisation.  That is a step he should contemplate and which I seriously advocate.  These two sections have been pushed into the Bill, pushed before the Dáil and brought here today, and now the Minister insists on their retention.  I want an assurance from the Minister and if it is forthcoming I shall be quite happy.  I am not satisfied the Minister has disposed satisfactorily of the suspicions I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Without entering into the merits of what should be done about the Irish Life Assurance Company, it is very bad parliamentary practice, very bad drafting, to put these two sections into the Bill.  The first words used by the Minister in his introductory remarks this afternoon were that the purpose of the Bill is to provide relief for the policy holders of the Equitable Insurance Company Limited.</P>
      <P>If that is the object, why is some other insurance company brought in? It has been suggested that the business of putting the two names together is a bad thing for the entirely good and solvent company.  I do not pretend to know how an insurance company should be run but if there are two opinions as to what the Minister for Finance should do about the Irish Life Assurance Company, this is not the place or the time.  This Bill should have been drafted to provide for the Equitable policy holders and to make a general plan for such occurrences in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was quite lucid about that and quite right about it, but I take it that what happened was that the Bill was drafted and circulated and the Minister for Finance wanted this done about the Irish Life Assurance Company.  That starts a debate which <Col N="1347" /> is highly irrelevant for the purposes of the Bill as to what ought to be done about the Irish Life Assurance Company. As well as that, the fact that the debate takes place on this Bill is harmful, as Senator Crowley and others have suggested, to the Irish Life Assurance Company.  It would be much better if, when you wanted to find out, if you were a lawyer or, indeed, an ordinary person, what happens when an insurance company goes bankrupt you could refer to this Bill when it becomes an Act; but that you have to refer to this Bill when it becomes an Act not only to do that but also to find out what the powers of the Minister for Finance are about the purchase and sale of the shares of the Irish Life Assurance Company &mdash; that is surely a very bad way of transacting business.</P>
    <P>That is only part of a scheme I have often referred to where a Department wants to have everything done if possible at the same time.  These two things are quite irrelevant.  I know that nobody can rule them out of order. The Ceann Comhairle gets this Bill and he cannot do anything about it. The title of the Bill is there, it is called the Insurance Bill, 1964, and the Minister for Finance can bring in practically any other purposes that he likes.  It would, however, be much better for everybody, much easier and much more relevant, if the business of the Irish Life Assurance Company was kept out of this and if, when we had to discuss its business, we got a particular opportunity.  We could have this Bill at great speed, indeed, and, as far as I am concerned, I am quite willing to go the whole way with the Minister. So, I think, are Senators Fitzpatrick and Crowley on the question of the Equitable Insurance Company.  Is not that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very reasonable proposition, but as far as the matter of sections 12 and 13 is concerned, if that is something that ought to be discussed, then we should not be asked to pass it here in these <Col N="1348" /> circumstances.  There is plenty of time for it.  The company is perfectly solvent.  The Minister has plenty of powers, and if he wants to get more he can come to the Dáil and Seanad with a Bill dealing with those powers and anything else.  What we have here are two subjects which have no connection with one another, though I know they can be drafted into one Bill.  I think they should not have been drafted into one Bill.  The argument that if we hold up this Bill we prevent the policy holders of the Equitable Company from getting benefits is, of course, an unfair argument.  We should not have been confronted with this problem of the Irish Life Assurance Company at all.  It has nothing whatever to do with the purpose of the Bill and it should not be done rapidly. It should be done slowly.  It would be much better if these two sections were taken out and put somewhere else and discussed adequately at the proper time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I can hold with Senator Hayes that it is bad parliamentary practice to include these two sections.  As he knows, the Bill is entitled the Insurance Bill, 1964 and its final sub-section says: &ldquo;The Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1961, and this Act shall be construed together as one Act and may be cited together as the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1964.&rdquo;  If there were no mention of the Irish Life Assurance Company in this Bill you would have the same final subsection; and if we had a separate Bill dealing with the two sections put in a Bill which we might call the Irish Life Assurance Company Bill, then we would have another Insurance Act which would be cited together with all the other Insurance Acts.  All these Acts, including the Insurance Act of 1938 which set up the Irish Life, are construed as one.  I suggest that Senator Hayes's observation that this is bad parliamentary practice does not stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>Therefore, it does not involve a wide or lengthy debate.  I want to assure Senator Crowley that the inclusion of these two sections does not in any way involve a change of policy by the Minister for Finance in relation to the Irish Life Assurance Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out that the fact that both the Minister for Finance and now the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us first that there is no prospect of the Minister buying any shares here and, secondly, that he has no intention of selling, makes one ask why then must we be put into this situation on this day.  The Minister tells me that the Minister for Finance deems it necessary. There are other amendments to the existing insurance Acts necessary and, in fact, overdue.  I have from the Minister's Department at least one assurance on certain sections of the Insurance Act proper that they are due to be overhauled.  They told me that three or four years back, and that they would be overhauled on the introduction of a new insurance Bill.  These are matters which would be of benefit and interest to the public at large.  If it is one argument of the Minister that we are dealing with an Insurance Act and that, therefore, it is necessary to stick these two sections in, why was it not necessary to bring the Insurance Acts as such up to date?  The Minister knows what I am alluding to.  There are various sections of the industrial assurance which need overhauling and revision in an up-to-date Act.  That was dealt with through his Department a good many years ago.  The point was regarded at the time as not warranting the expense of special legislation and we had an assurance from the Minister's Department that it would be dealt with when a new Act was before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These matters are forgotten now and these two sections are introduced in this Bill and are wholly irrelevant to its purpose.  The Minister has not been very specific about it.  I <Col N="1350" /> am in the unsatisfactory position that if I hold up the Bill and insist that it should be held over for proper debate by amendment or otherwise, then I can be accused of delaying the payments to the Equitable Insurance Company claimants.  That is not a satisfactory position for me or any other member of the House, and I think that the Minister is just being unreasonable on it.</P>

      <P>It is like the old story of the wolf and the lamb.  If it was not the lamb it was the lamb's father.  The truth is that this is bad parliamentary practice.  The Minister can do what he likes and the Bill can go through.  He can draft a Bill any way he pleases and get it passed, but in this particular instance all he should have done was to remedy the urgent problem, which is doing something about the policyholders of the Equitable Insurance Company.  I do not think that the Minister is guilty in any way.  The Minister gets these two sections from the Minister for Finance and puts them in.  Why would he not?  If I were Minister for Industry and Commerce I would probably do the same thing, but the Department of Finance should not have asked that they should be put in.  This is a system of devising legislation which should not be agreed to and continued, and which is bad in itself.</P>

      <P>That, of course, is the difficulty.  Everybody is trying to be helpful, but an important point has been made.  It is not possible to amend the Bill really because we could not put something in or take something out.  That of course would be amending. But if you keep the question of the other insurance companies apart, that may be termed an amendment but it is not an easy type of amendment. An amendment means changing something. This is a matter of whether we can leave something over.  There is no emergency about the points raised by Senator Crowley.  There is urgency in regard to the Equitable Insurance Company and everybody appreciates that, but there is no urgency in regard to the Irish Life to say that we need legislation immediately on the lines drafted in the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has two aims: (1) to increase the maximum permissible financial contribution by county councils to committees of agriculture and (2) to provide for the recruitment of at least 50 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture from outside the membership of county councils.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill deals with the first of these objectives.  It provides, with effect as from the financial year commencing 1st April, 1965, for an increase in the maximum local contribution from its present level of 15 times the produce of a rate of one penny in the area consisting of the county, exclusive of urban districts, to 21 times the produce of such rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is, no doubt, aware committees of agriculture derive the money for the service of their agricultural schemes both from county council contributions and from grants from my Department related to the local contributions. At present the local contribution in each county may not be less than twice nor more than 15 times the produce of a penny rate.  Before last October the total grants from my Department to the committees amounted to approximately the total contributions from the councils.  Acting on the recommendation of the inter-departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms, I decided to <Col N="1353" /> improve the basis of grants to 12 committees of agriculture with a view to bringing about a speedy and substantial strengthening of the advisory services in the western areas.  The result of the improved grant is that since October last my Department is contributing 75 per cent of the salaries of the advisory officers in these areas instead of 50 per cent as formerly.  In respect of the other areas my Department continues to contribute to the committees an amount approximating in the aggregate to the total amount contributed by county councils.</P>
    <P>The present maximum of 15 times the produce of a penny rate was laid down in the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958.  Before that the maximum was the produce of a tenpenny rate. Since the enactment of the 1958 Act, 15 committees have availed of its provisions by obtaining an amount higher than the former maximum.  One of these committees is now in receipt of the present maximum contribution and four more are very near the limit.  The increased expenditure by committees in recent years arises mainly from the very welcome expansion in their advisory services.  The number of all categories of advisers employed by the committees in 1963/64 was 402 compared with 313 in 1957/58, i.e., an increase of approximately 30 per cent. The expenditure of committees increased in the same period from £559,428 to £828,017.  In the next few years it is expected that there will be a further substantial increase in the number of advisers, both to implement the expansion scheme already initiated for the western areas, to which I have already referred, and in other areas also, to meet the growing demand from farmers for technical advice to assist them in the economical running of their farms and the efficient production of high quality goods to enable them to meet the very keen competition in modern markets.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increase in the number of advisers, the periodic upward trends in the salaries of the committees' staffs and increasing costs generally have to be taken into account.  For example, many committees have increased the number of <Col N="1354" /> scholarships awarded by them to young men and young women tenable at agricultural schools and schools of rural domestic economy &mdash; a most desirable development.  It is evident that due to these various demands, committees now at or near the maximum local contribution of fifteen times the produce of a penny rate will be unable to carry out their agricultural programmes unless they are enabled by legislation to increase their income in the future.  That is the purpose of section 1 of this Bill.  County councils will not of course be obliged to increase their contributions.  They are merely being enabled to do so, where they consider such an increase is needed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with the second aim to which I referred earlier, that is the recruitment of at least 50 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture from outside the membership of the county councils.  At present the legal position, dating from 1931, is that committees of agriculture may be compased either entirely of county councillors, or partly of councillors and partly of non-councillors.  In practice, the proportion of non-councillors on committees of agriculture varies considerably from one county to another; some county councils tend to confine membership to councillors while others have shown a more liberal outlook towards the appointment of non-councillors.</P>
    <P>I feel that with the great changes which have taken place in rural circumstances since this provision was originally framed over 30 years ago, a change in the requirements for membership of committees is now called for.  I have particularly in mind the emergence of voluntary rural organisations, the extension of the co-operative movement, the growth of the educational and advisory services and the development of new farming techniques generally.  It goes without saying that committees of agriculture would derive considerable advantage from the inclusion in their membership of suitable persons from the voluntary rural organisations and the co-operative movement, and also local individuals prominent in the practice of farming <Col N="1355" /> or development of agriculture.  There are undoubtedly progressive persons in every county who could make a worthwhile contribution to the work of committees of agriculture but who, for one reason or another, are unwilling to stand for election to the county council.  I consider it desirable that such persons should have a greater opportunity to become members of committees of agriculture.  With this objective in view, section 2 (1) (a) of this Bill provides that where a committee of agriculture consists of an even number of members the number of councillors shall not exceed the number of non-councillors, and, where the committee consists of an odd number, the numbebr of councillors shall not exceed the number of non-councillors by more than one.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that this widening of the scope of membership will have the desired effect, section 2 (1) (c) of the Bill provides that each non-councillor member shall be chosen by reason of his attainments in the practice of farming or in the development of agriculture and rural living in the particular locality in which he resides, or by reason of his attainments in the promotion of agricultural or rural home education and advisory work.  County councils in making appointments under the section are expected to select men or women of attainments, that is, who are progressive farmers or who have taken a leading part in one or more of the activities I have mentioned.  I believe that this change will increase the effectiveness of committees, especially in the educational and advisory aspects of their functions, which I consider to be predominantly the most important.</P>
    <P>While I am suggesting the rural organisations and the co-operative movement as a likely source of suitable members for committees of agriculture, I have not found it practicable to provide in this Bill for giving them direct representation, although I have given a great deal of thought to the matter.  In view of the large number of rural organisations in the country, the varying strength of these organisations from one county to another and <Col N="1356" /> the varying number of members on individual committees, I do not think that a statutory formula could be worked out which could be applied equitably to all counties.  I hope, however, that county councils will keep the rural organisations and the co-operative movement in mind when choosing members for committees and that this broadening of membership will lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that our system of advisory services is fundamentally sound and my aim, therefore, is to improve the system rather than to replace it or to alter it radically.  I am indeed very confident that more broadly based committees of agriculture working with the Department of Agriculture as a team, and backed by the research work of An Foras Talúntais and the Universities, will in the years ahead provide us with the advisory services needed to develop our agricultural resources on sound lines in the light of changing conditions and designed to bring about a worthwhile improvement in the lot of our rural population.</P>
    <P>I trust that the House will see fit to approve of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House accept this Bill as a very small step forward.  We welcome the extra expenditure from fifteen pence in the £ to twenty-one pence in the £ which will now mean that the counties in the west of Ireland will be able to meet the recommendation of the interDepartmental Committee on the problems of Small Western Farms for the provision of extra instructors to look after this section of our country.  It seems that committees of agriculture will be able to increase their drawings from the county councils.  We know, of course, some of the committees, even at present, are already drawing the maximum from the county councils. Consequently, we find this Bill is bringing the position up to date and putting the county committees of agriculture in a more normal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few sections of the Bill with which we are not totally in agreement. Firstly, the figure of 50 per cent <Col N="1357" /> of the members being non-members of the county council is perhaps rather harsh.  I feel it is rather unfair to appoint people to these committees, which perform a very important function, without imposing any responsibility on them for the raising of the finance necessary for the running of the committees and the giving of service. From that point of view I feel, had the Minister not put that in but had made it mandatory that members of the committee must not be members of the county council, it would have been much better.</P>
    <P>I believe the more work the members of our county councils do and the more committees they serve on, the more effective they become.  It is perhaps difficult for a lot of people living a long distance away, especially in remote parts, to have opportunities of serving people.  They do not have access to the offices.  If these people are to come in about their business only once a month, they will not have the same efficiency in handling the problems of the people they represent. Therefore, I feel the more committees these men are allowed to serve on, the better it will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, perhaps, not have insisted on the clause whereby 50 per cent of the members are to be non-county councillors.  It will be rather difficult to work out a solution whereby there are five or six permanent voluntary agricultural organisations in a county.  How will we allocate the places on the committee?  Will we find in succeeding years that one organisation seems to thrive and another organisation perhaps declining a little?  The situation could well be that, after a few years, an organisation would be almost extinct in the county but it will have as good a representation on the committee of agriculture as the big representative organisations. That may arise and it would be much better had the Minister left the appointment solely at the discretion of the county council.</P>
    <P>After all, each council and committee is properly constituted.  In the case of many of them, up to 50 per cent of the members are non-councillors.  It is rather an imposition on the council committees to lay down a rigid rule. <Col N="1358" /> They do excellent work voluntarily and the less they are dictated to by Government Departments, the easier their lot will be.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this figure of 50 per cent increased at least to 75 per cent because in the case of the majority of committees, the county council members are from the district.  A farmer who is a member of the county council will surely be as good a committee man as the farmer who is not. He will not be afraid to stand up in a local election in the county for the interests of his locality.  He will be a man with a certain amount of public spirit and a man who is not afraid to declare his allegiance or to defend his principles.</P>
    <P>It is the men who are not afraid to come forward and express their views who are the type of people to serve on these committees and not the fellows who will perhaps do as good a job but are not perhaps prepared to fight for it.  The farmers' representatives may be a little lax, in that they are not aggressive enough in insisting on their rights.  The county committees of agriculture are the premier committees in any county dealing with agricultural matters.  If the farming community is to survive and thrive, these people will have to become more aggressive and more insistent on their rights and the rights of the agricultural community to a decent standard of living related to the 1964 cost of production.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while I welcome this Bill as a small step in the right direction, I feel that the general overall grant could perhaps be increased.  It is difficult to know now where the poor areas of our country are.  While the Minister has increased grants west of the Shannon, I believe practically every county has bad sections of land.  The demand for advisory services is enormous indeed, and in many of the counties we have increased the advisory services by almost one-quarter in the past few years.  The demand is there for them but it is perhaps unfair to increase the rates in order to provide for the payment of extra officers.  The demand is definitely there for them and I feel it is something to which the Minister should devote special attention, <Col N="1359" /> and not merely in the western regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielHoganJnr" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a short Bill which has two main functions.  The first is to increase the amount that county committees of agriculture can get from county councils in order to run their various services.  Most county committees have by now reached the maximum contribution they can get and the Minister, in this Bill, is providing that the figure can be increased.  For that reason alone, the Bill is an important one.</P>
      <P>The second main provision of the Bill relates to the number of county council members who may be appointed to these committees.  While I have no objection to people who are not county council members being members of committees of agriculture &mdash; in my county several of the members of the committee are not county council members &mdash; I feel it would be unwise of the Minister to set the ratio at 50-50.  It may work out well, but it may not.  In fairness to members of county councils, who are, after all, elected by the people and who have the main responsibility for striking rates, they should have a slight majority on committees of agriculture. I am not asking for a big majority.</P>
      <P>County committees of agriculture do not strike a rate.  However, they set out their demand to the county council each year and, to my mind, that is equivalent to the function of striking a rate.  I should like elected representatives in the future to have a sufficient majority to strike that rate, as it were, if necessary.  I realise that the Minister may not be able to accede to that.  Apart from those points, I think the Bill is an excellent one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome section 1 of the Bill which provides for increased allocations from county councils to county committees.  I agree that in many counties the committees have reached the maximum of the 15 pence in the £ they have been allowed up to now to finance their advisory services so necessary if we are to increase agricultural production.  The increase <Col N="1360" /> permitted in this Bill will not affect my county.  It is rather wealthy, as the Minister is aware, and a penny in the £ yields £2,400.  Therefore, we have not nearly reached the present maximum of 15 pence in the £.  Against that, there are counties in which a penny in the £ would yield less than 25 per cent of the yield in County Meath.  For that reason, I am glad to note that in 12 of the less well-off counties, the Minister has decided to increase the allocation to the advisory services from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.  I welcome that section particularly.</P>
      <P>I do not share the Minister's enthusiasm for section 2 of the Bill.  My main reason for opposing that section is that it will deprive so many elected representatives of the right to sit on county committees of agriculture.  If Senators will pardon me, I shall again cite my county.  I have been a member of the county committee of agriculture there during the past 22 years.  In June, 1965, 29 county councillors will be elected and of those, almost two-thirds will be deprived of the right to sit on the most important body the council will be called on to appoint at their annual meeting.</P>
      <P>The county council will be able to appoint only ten of the 29 elected representatives if this Bill is passed in its present form.  That deprives too many good public representatives of the right to sit on that important committee. I therefore appeal to the Minister to have another look at that section.  I agree with Senator Hogan, and particularly with Senator McDonald, that the 50 per cent proportion should be increased to 75 per cent.  By depriving 50 per cent of the elected representatives of the right to sit on those committees, we may appear to be doing an injustice.  The suggestion that the ratio be increased to 66 per cent is weighted altogether too heavily against the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, as an elected representative, I am jealous of the rights of elected representatives and find it hard, possibly, to agree with the idea that people who do not even bother to go forward in local elections and who are frequently critical of everything elected <Col N="1361" /> representatives do, can now be co-opted to these committees.  The Minister may have his reasons.  In some counties, the county councils may not have brought in any extern members to serve on county committees of agriculture, no matter how qualified or worthy they were.  The Minister may say there has been nothing in previous legislation to compel county councils to appoint outsiders to county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>My county council, at their annual meeting, appoint a county committee of 20 members.  Of those, five have been extern members.  During at least 12 years of my term on that council, the chairman of the committee of agriculture was an extern member&mdash; the late Deputy O'Reilly.  I repeat that this section is loaded too heavily against the elected representatives. Those public-spirited enough to contest an election, whether as political Party members or Independents, have the right to sit on those committees and they should not be deprived of such membership in the way this Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>Out of 29 members of the Meath County Council, almost two-thirds will be deprived of the right to sit on the county committee.  I submit that will create a big problem.  In Meath, the Minister's Party have been the dominant political Party in local politics during all the years I have been a member of the committee, but I should pay them the compliment and tribute that they have always been very fair to the other Parties&mdash;they have given us equitable representation on committees.</P>
    <P>Now, whichever political Party happen to dominate local politics, we shall find that instead of having 20 seats to hand out, they will have only ten.  In such circumstances, it will be impossible for them to be fair.  The Minister may say we have 20 members on the county committee of agriculture, that the dominating Party can take 12, give five to Fine Gael and three to Labour and say: &ldquo;You may bring in anyone you like.&rdquo;  Let us take it that the Minister's own Party have 15 which gives them a <Col N="1362" /> majority of one and there are at least 10 of those 15 who are admirable farmers and would be most suitable for the agricultural committee.  How many of that 15 can they put on it out of 10?  It means that they are eliminating five of their own and there will be a problem created within their own Party as there would be among any Party.  I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at this and increase the figure from 50 per cent to at least 75 per cent because if it is obligatory on a committee to appoint at least 25 per cent extern members there is nothing in it to prevent the committee increasing that to 50 per cent if they want to.  To debar at one fell swoop two-thirds of the elected representatives of the right to sit on a committee of agriculture is going altogether too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with quite a lot of what Senator Fitzgerald said in connection with section 1 of the Bill.  We all know that costs are going up and the committees of agriculture require more money.  If the Minister had left the Bill with section 1 the debate would last about five minutes and he would have gone away about his business long ago, but when he introduced section 2, which affects all the county councils, in other words the local representatives, who are on committees I for one with Senator Fitzgerald will have to oppose it.  The fact is that people from three Parties have spoken here today.  Senator Hogan opposed the Minister on this matter though perhaps when it comes to a vote he will not.  Senator McDonald has been pulling his punches a bit and has been opposing a certain section but it is not hard to know why he is inclined to pull his punches in connection with this section.  People who represent the NFA know right well what is at the back of the Minister's head when he introduces this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county where we always give fair representation to good farmers, leading farmers as the Minister calls them, and we have a fair number of them on the committee. Not only that but one of the people <Col N="1363" /> co-opted by the county council is the chairman, which I think could not happen any more under the conditions laid down in this Bill because the chairman is a very important person and where you would only have a majority of one a person may die and the council may decide not to fill the seat.  If the man dies in the first year they may not fill the seat for four years and, having someone in the chair who will be favourable towards the Party ruling the council, they would leave it vacant and let that Party decide the policy of the committee of agriculture.  For that reason I think you should put it down and not confine it to 50 per cent or in the case of a committee where there is an odd number give them one over.</P>
    <P>Our own committee consists of 16 members so on the 50 per cent basis the question of the chairman of that committee is very important.  The NFA organisation is claiming all along that it does not want to go into politics. The Minister does not want that organisation to come into politics either, but he wants to give it scope through the committees of agriculture to put its case before him.  He does not want the Bridge of Athlone again, nor does he want to give way to the NFA on its claims for decreased rates.  It did very well last year when it got 80 per cent of the first £20&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, and I will not dwell on that.  If we are looking for the leading farmers, as the Minister said in his opening statement, if you come down into the midlands the leading farmers today are the foreigners.  Those are the people who are coming in on the heifer scheme, the people who will get the most out of the scheme.  It will not be the small farmers from the west of Ireland but those who have come along here, bought large farms and got into the heifer business.  They stay in it for one year and collect the maximum.  I recall people who are making the most use of the grants and subsidies that are going. They are the people who would be <Col N="1364" /> described as the leading farmers in Ireland today.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I hold that in a committee of agriculture it is just as important that people who represent labour will have their say there as people who represent the farmers.  It is very important for the officials who are working for the committees of agriculture that there should be people there interested in conditions of employment and pay. There was quite an amount of trouble during the last few years to get proper conditions of employment and pay for officials of the committees of agriculture. I consider it is important, too, that people who represent the workers, that is, people who are elected on the Labour ticket, should be represented as they would have a grave interest in seeing how the committee of agriculture would affect their cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A majority may be got at any time when the committee are elected by the death of a member because there is no obligation on the council to fill the vacancy.  The people who would strike the rate for that committee if they were not the elected representatives of the people, would not have to answer any question about why such a rate was struck.  It takes a man with an amount of courage to go forward, and during the next year every Party in the House will be looking for suitable candidates to go forward in the local elections.  The people who have to put up the money, that is the county council, are the people who are put on the spot.  We are the people who have to face the NFA and different farmers' organisations on the day we strike the rate.  We should have a say as to how the rate would be struck in the committee of agriculture and also in the vocational committee.  If the rate comes in from the committee of agriculture we have no say whatsoever and no choice but to give that amount on that day.  The very same thing arises regarding the vocational committee. We must pay up no matter what rate they struck.  If the committee of agriculture and the vocational committee have a majority of councillors then if a rate comes in we can blame the councillors who are on that committee. If, however, there are people who <Col N="1365" /> would refuse to go forward for election then those people should not be in a position to come in and to dictate to us that we should put 3d, 4d or anything they wish extra on the rates.  It is our job to collect the rates and it is our job to decide how the rates should be spent.  But if this Bill is passed today we shall have no say whatsoever in the amount that the committee of agriculture will decide on and we must pay up.</P>
    <P>We cannot interfere with the amount they claim.  We must give it to them whether we like it or not.  It is for that reason I would ask the Minister to modify section 2 of the Bill and, as Senator Fitzgerald has done before me, ask that at least 75 per cent of an agricultural committee be members of the council.  I was a member of two councils and the councils were always delighted to bring in a fair number.  In Westmeath we bring in almost one half of them.  There must have been abuses in some counties, where they did not put anyone on except county councillors. I am sorry if this is the case. I see grave danger in asking us to support a Bill which provides for a 50 per cent membership in respect of people who are prepared to sit on the fence during a local election and who would refuse to contest the election in case they might be defeated.  It is for that reason I support Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill as a step in the right direction. I am glad to say we had similar ideas about eight years ago in the independent commission set up by Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers Association.  At that time they reported on somewhat the same lines as the proposals the Minister is now introducing. I take it this is a recognition by the Minister, his Department and the Government in general that our agricultural organisations have developed and come of age and that they are capable of taking greater responsibilities than in the past&mdash;responsibilities which similar organisations accept readily in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that any leading officers in the main farmers' organisations in the <Col N="1366" /> counties, especially the National Farmers Organisation, will be among the first to be considered for selection. It will do them good to be brought into contact with a body such as the county committee of agriculture.  That would be no harm, now that the organisations have developed to the stage where they recognise that a member of the organisation can express his political beliefs openly and still render a good service to the organisation.  Perhaps the introduction of such members into county committees of agriculture in this way would at a later stage encourage them to go forward for actual service in the county committee itself, and probably ultimately in higher offices of public life.  If this is the case, as I hope it is, it would again be a step in the right direction in broadening the field of selection for public offices in the country.  Consequently, I have pleasure in recommending this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree there might be doubts about the percentages involved, and so on, but I take it that this measure, being in the nature of an experiment, will be under close scrutiny for the first years of its operation, and the percentage can be readily changed afterwards. I would have thought of starting perhaps from a small percentage and working up.  This might commend itself to some, but still I think we should accept the Bill as it is and I, for one, have great pleasure in welcoming it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to welcome this Bill but the debate looks like becoming almost a Committee Stage debate.  Only one section seems to give rise to any comment, apart from the question of general approval.  There is a lot to be said for leaving some elasticity in the proportion of people who are not members of the county council and who can be elected on any sub-committee, in this case, the committee of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of a statutory hospital committee, a large one, in which the membership of subcommittees is more or less specified.  It cannot be more than 25 per cent on <Col N="1367" /> any sub-committee, that is, of persons who are not members of the main hospital committee.  Sometimes this gives rise to trouble because a number of members with a particular interest may be wanted on a sub-committee, and to include them all we must multiply that number by three from the council itself and that gives a large sub-committee.  That is the reason for having rather more than 25 per cent even up to 50 per cent, of people on a sub-committee who are not members of the main body.  On the other hand, I can see it would interest the main body represented on the sub-committee to want it the other way round.  Since, I am sure, in the various county councils throughout the country there are different interests represented, and even in one county different interests from time to time on successive county councils, there should be some elasticity so that a county council could decide what proportion of outsiders it wanted on the agricultural committee, say, not less than 25 per cent and not more than 50 per cent.  That is my experience of this sort of thing and I think if the Minister could meet the wishes expressed it would get over the difficulties.  It is a good Bill and I am happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCostello" hpid="Mr. Costelloe Mr. Costelloe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costelloe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill.  It is very important that the committee of agriculture should provide advisory services. In Kerry we have made good progress and I am thankful for that. As far as the committee of agriculture are concerned, Kerry has always appointed a large number of non-councillors. I have 25 years' experience on committees.  During that time, I always appointed a good percentage. At the present time it works out on a 50-50 basis, and it is very satisfactory. However, I notice that in most counties they have more councillors on these committees.  It is very hard for county councillors to appoint all the members of the committee of agriculture from the county councils.  I believe councillors should have some majority in the workings of committees.  I believe that is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say to the Seanad that I did not look at this matter with any hostility towards elected representatives or members of Parties in local bodies.  I did have in mind one thing, and I believe many people have it in mind in common with me.  County committees of agriculture, in the main, did not seem to be serving the purpose they were intended to serve as well as one would like them to.  They did not appear to have the confidence of the people, the degree of confidence they would require to be successful in their work.  I am not saying all this lack of confidence was justified, but it is true to say that it existed.</P>
      <P>As I explained briefly in my opening remarks, a number of farming organisations have been growing up in recent times.  Any time I meet them at close quarters I complain of their lack of effort to make use to the fullest extent of the advisory services available to them, and to all farmers.  I have always sensed that their case was this: county committees of agriculture are appointed by county councils and, in many cases, predominantly controlled by members of county councils.  Again, whether there is justification for it or not, they always advance the argument that members of these rural organisations and good farmers of one kind or another who were never in public life have no chance of being called upon to serve.  That, briefly, is the background to my thoughts and conclusions as to what we should do when we were framing this Bill.</P>
      <P>I very carefully examined this whole matter of percentage or percentages. I have one major reason in my mind for not wishing to make it less than 50.  If you made it less than 50 you almost suggested to those who were critical in the past that you would not trust people outside those bodies to go half and half with the elected people.  Some Senators said this could have been taken in stages.  I do not entirely disagree with that line of reasoning.  I can see it is a line of reasoning that could be followed.  I did think of it, and I did not accept it because of what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only did I think of all this, but <Col N="1369" /> I and my officials had discussions with the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  As one would expect, the representatives of the Council took the very same view as some Senators from both sides of the House have expressed.  I did not expect it to be otherwise.  The possibility is that if I were one of the representatives on the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture I would probably take up the cudgels for the same case.  I know what can be said as to the merits of the man, or the men, or the persons, who seek election, meet the public and are chosen by the public.  In fact, I have very often defended members of a county council on that very basis from critics who might be very excellent people, but many of whom I not only suspected but knew would be unsuccessful if they sought election.</P>
    <P>I have a full appreciation of that angle, and it was not absent from my mind when I was proposing this percentage. The General Council of County Committees of Agriculture suggested 25 per cent, so there was not very much in it, but I decided I would come to the Dáil with the provisions in this Bill, which would make it half and half with the exception of a committee on which there was an odd number, and in that case the odd number was in favour of the elected people.  I should not like to give the impression to members of the Seanad and especially to members who have a keen interest in this matter, that I want to be rigid, but I believe that since I and my officials have had all these discussions and contacts, and knowing that we were in the right frame of mind, this 50-50 arrangement is the better one.</P>
    <P>The proper organisation of our advisory people is one of the most intricate things I know of.  It looks to be a very simple matter: appoint officers; select the districts in which they will operate; one of them will make his headquarters in some part of that district; and his job is to make all possible contacts with farmers.  It is not difficult to make contacts with 15, 20 or 25 per cent of farmers, but it is tremendously difficult to make the <Col N="1370" /> type of contact that these men would require in their own and the farmers' interests with the balance of that section of our community.  I want to bring these committees&mdash;I mean in their composition&mdash;to the condition that is proposed here of a 50-50 basis so that these representatives of rural organisations that are now critical will be robbed of any opportunity of claiming that they have not a voice in the determination of matters that come up there and affect their lives.</P>
    <P>I find that one of the great weaknesses of rural organisations is that they all seem to want to do things themselves.  They all seem to want to be in a position to get all the glamour and all the sensation that is associated with being in at the top.  People are always wanting to be in at the top.</P>
    <P>I believe we would not have half the number of rural organisations if it were not for the fact that we have so many people who want to lead some group, whether it be small or large or important.  I have a list of these organisations in case anybody should ask me why we could not arrange some method by which this 50 per cent representation could be given to them on some representative basis.  I am not saying that on the list I have they are all very important but there are 105 on it.  That is a large number.  One could not do much in the way of formulating some proposal that would enable one to get fair representation for all these by a provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have mentioned difficulties which really are not legitimate difficulties.  The county council themselves, ultimately strike the rate. County councils have been known to refuse a demand.  County councils have been known to reduce a demand. County councils have been known to reduce a rate previously in operation. The county councils have the ultimate say in how, when and where the rate, and the amount of it, will be struck.</P>
    <P>I should genuinely like to see these committees more active.  When men offer themselves for election to county councils they are interested in rates, housing, land, and in half a dozen very important matters.  However, you will find the man who just does not <Col N="1371" /> want to go before the public, who does not take much of an interest in these wider fields of local or national administration but who would have something to contribute if he were brought on to a committee where the subject, and the only one to be discussed, affected his own business and way of life and all his interests.  To those who have appealed to me, I would say that we gave very careful examination to this whole matter.  I know that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture will perhaps be disappointed that I did not accept their recommendation.  It is unfortunate that when people come to a Minister to discuss some important matter they go away aggrieved or afterwards feel aggrieved if the Minister does not see his way to concede the point they may have very strenuously made to him.  I do not think we could possibly do our business on that basis.</P>
    <P>I must admit that they were reasonable up to the point that they would go as far as 25 per cent.  I feel that is important from the point of view of creating the proper spirit and ensuring that in the future nobody will be able to say, in effect: &ldquo;These committees are just committees of men elected on one political ticket or another.  While they may know farming, and so on, they have not some separate interest which other farmers may have and therefore we have not very much dependence on the work which these bodies do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is not too ambitious to hope that the committees, when making selections, will try to get the type of individual who in their judgment will make the best contribution possible to the work which we hope they will do. It is a fact that some few counties have already been generous in this regard.  Four of them have 50 per cent councillors or less.  However it is also a fact that five counties had 100 per cent councillors and there were others with 87, 86, 75 per cent and so on.</P>
    <P>I have to contact, off and on, rural organisations.  I try to get them to play their part.  Sometimes, when they accuse me of maybe not playing <Col N="1372" /> mine as well as they think I should, I, with a good deal of justification, turn to them and say: &ldquo;Well, why do you not play yours?  I do not mind you people in rural organisations being critical of me but why do you, back in the country as you are, not see to it that the advisory services, that are being increased at the expense of the ratepayer and of the taxpayer, are availed of to as great an extent as possible for the common benefit?&rdquo; When public officials representing my Department, the Department of Local Government, and all the other Departments are out loose in the country, except in the case of very conscientious individuals, you will not get the same volume or quality of work from them all.  If it were not for the fact that somebody was trying to watch them and check up their mistakes and the output of that work we would not do even as well in many of these Departments, which are affected in that way.</P>
    <P>I should like our rural organisations to take an interest in the work of our county committees so that in all districts the members of the farmers organisations would keep a reasonably watchful eye on these important activities and say &ldquo;Well, we had not an instructor here for such and such a time&rdquo;.  They should keep on pressing so as to ensure that the greatest good will be secured by the farming community from the services of these technicians, who are employed, and of whom more will be employed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Senators, therefore, to withdraw the objection they have to this.  I have seen their point of view and, very deliberately, but not without understanding that point of view fully, I decided to keep this position in the Bill of making appointments to the committees in the future on a fifty-fifty basis.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1373" /> SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not convinced me that he has made a good case for the 50 per cent.  The Minister stated in his Second Reading Speech:</P>
      <P>While I am suggesting the rural organisation and the co-operative movement as a likely source of suitable members for committees of agriculture, I have not found it practicable to provide in this Bill for giving them direct representation, although I have given a great deal of thought to the matter.  In view of the large number of rural organisations in the country, the varying strength of these organisations from one county to another and the varying number of members on individual committees, I do not think that a statutory formula could be worked out which could be applied equitably to all counties.</P>
      <P>The next is the kernel of the point:</P>
      <P>I hope, however, that county councils will keep the rural organisation and their co-operative movements in mind when choosing members for committees and that this broadening of membership will lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, and anybody who is a member of a local authority or who has past experience of them, will agree that that is only wishful thinking on the part of the Minister. While I agree it is most desirable, I feel when it is not written into this legislation, it will not be applied in any of the local authorities, that I have knowledge of anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, after the wind of the local election has died down and the elected representatives assemble to elect a chairman and a vice-chairman for the ensuing five years what happens?  When we come to the county committee of agriculture we divide up the ten places among the 29 county councillors and then we have to take <Col N="1374" /> in 10 from outside.  Can anybody see any of the Parties, when the ten external seats on that committee are allocated, maybe to the various political Parties that may compose the county council, the NFA, Muintir na Tíre or any other of the rural organisations, getting consideration from the members of that particular county council?</P>
    <P>All of us will have the hard luck story and a very good farmer who just got tipped for the last seat and we will have to put him on to the county committee of agriculture.  That is how the external members of the county committees of agriculture will be taken in.  We are all human and we all do that.  We want to help those who helped us.  I do not want to appear critical of any of the rural organisations, who are doing excellent work, but members of rural organisations have been very critical of the local authorities and their members.  We would not be human if we were to say it is all well meant.  We are not likely to say that we will take in five of those external members from the NFA, and another three from Muintir na Tíre.  That is not going to happen.  I am sure nobody knows that better than the Minister.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister, with all due respect to him&mdash;I am not saying this to be critical of the Minister&mdash;will not improve the composition of any of our committees of agriculture by this.  I would again appeal to him&mdash;I have already asked him to give 75 per cent &mdash;to compromise somewhere between his 50 per cent and my 75 per cent.  If we do not do this we cannot hope to get a better type of member who has the public spirit to stand for election, but one who wishes to sit on the sideline and criticise.  He can come into the county committee of agriculture and criticise there.  I do not think we will be improving the composition of our county councils and for that reason I oppose section 2.  I would ask the Minister to compromise on a 66? per cent, that is a ? figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Second Reading debate on this Bill very carefully and I have come to the conclusion that there is a lot to be said for having a proviso that there should <Col N="1375" /> be a minimum of 25 per cent of the county committees of agriculture non-council members and that there should be a maximum of 50 per cent.  That would be more flexible and it would meet the wishes of those concerned.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's case is accepted it would seem that we are to take in one less likely to be an efficient or good type of farmer among the elected representatives of the councils than one from people who are not prepared to stand for election.  I should like to feel that one of the attractions of a county council candidate, a person who offers himself for election to the county council in a rural community, would be his qualifications as a good farmer. I am sure that is a thing even political Parties take into account in selecting candidates.  I am sure it is a qualification the electorate take into account when selecting councillors from the candidates offered to them.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I feel that 50 per cent is too high.  The Minister is not prepared to yield on that and if I understand his case for the section correctly, it is that he desires to give representation to voluntary organisations on committees of agriculture in order to interest them in the advisory services being provided. There is a lot to be said for that, but I submit there is not one sentence in the Bill which will ensure that any rural organisation, whether it be NFA, a creamery society or some cattle breeding society, will get representation on a county committee of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The definition in section 2 (1) (c) is wide enough for anything.  I confess it is difficult to follow.  If the Minister wanted to ensure that voluntary farming organisations would get representation on county committees of agriculture, it would have been very easy for him to write into the Bill that the qualification would be service on such a voluntary farming organisation within the county concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Which one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On a one.  That would be for the council to decide.  I could see the Minister's difficulty if <Col N="1376" /> he were conferring on the voluntary organisation the right to elect directly to the council but that is not what he is doing.  If it were, the Minister's objection would be valid.  He could validly ask which voluntary organisation was to have the right to elect a person to the county committee and I would have no answer to that.  What I suggest is that the qualification should be that a person is interested enough in agriculture to have served on some voluntary farming organisation&mdash;some creamery committee or something of the sort&mdash;to show he really was interested in the collective welfare of the farming community.</P>
      <P>The Minister's case in favour of 50 per cent is based entirely on his anxiety to give representation to voluntary farming organisations; yet there is nothing in the qualifying section to ensure that will be so.  As other Senators have said, knowing the set-up of county councils and the manner in which they are elected, it is simply wishful thinking to say a person will be elected to a committee of agriculture merely because he is a member of a voluntary organisation.  There will be an added qualification, a political qualification.  It would be a simple thing to define in this qualifying section that a person must have given voluntary service on a rural organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Would such a man not have his politics, too?  I did not wish to make this point because the main point that concerns me here is a financial one.  After all, the Minister for Agriculture has a 50 per cent interest in all counties as far as technical staff is concerned.  In some counties, his interest is as high as 75 per cent.  Should he therefore not have the right to make a stipulation such as the one I have inserted in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural organisation with whom I have discussed this matter admitted that what the Senator is advocating could not be done&mdash;that there was no real workable provision you could put in the Bill that would get you that result.  The rural organisations would not have conceded that point to the <Col N="1377" /> Minister for Agriculture if they had any hopes of putting the other case over.  I have not said it is impossible to have a good farmer elected to a county council.  I have expressed no opinion on that matter because I was a county councillor myself, and was also on a committee of agriculture; and in both bodies I knew very good farmers.</P>
    <P>It is not what I think, it is not what somebody else thinks; it is what these organisations claim they think about the composition of county committees of agriculture.  Do they give us reasons why these committees and their employees have not the confidence or the necessary close contact with agriculture that would serve the county best?  The net point now is that, as the representative of at least a fifty per cent share, I am asking for the first time, from 1965 on, that the committees of agriculture will be on a fifty-fifty basis and even if the extern members do not come specifically from rural organisations, at least the county councils will be obliged to select 50 per cent of the membership of these committees from outsiders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>And they can be defeated councillors or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it they will be sensible men who will do their best. If rural organisations have influence and sufficient organisation and go along to the county councils seeking representation on county committees of agriculture, public men will yield to that kind of pressure and give the necessary representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister.  The more he has said, the more he has failed to convince me he has a good argument.  All the Senators who have spoken, including those from the Minister's side of the <Col N="1378" /> House, with one exception, have been against this provision.  The only member to support the Bill was Senator Quinlan.  Might I add that when he gets Senator Quinlan on his side he should start examining his conscience, because it is the first time I ever heard him taking the Minister's side.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister lays it down that there is an opportunity to get progressive farmers to become members of the committee.  If I were convinced tonight that progressive farmers would be appointed, I would have no objection whatever to the Bill and would welcome it very much, but I know what will happen these progressive farmers.  Their political background will be examined thoroughly and whoever has a majority on the council will see that if they are not active politicians, along with being progressive farmers, they will not get on to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened before in connection with Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and everywhere else, and it will be the same old story over again.  Suppose we do not appoint a progressive farmer, a man who is a good politician but not a bit progressive, perhaps the worst farmer in the county, will the Minister step in and say: &ldquo;Under section 2 of this Bill, you cannot sit on this committee&rdquo;? He will not interfere at all. I hold that the Minister could have done rightly without introducing this section into the Bill.  It is because we have to provide the money that we should be in a position to put a number of county councillors there so that we can point the finger at them if they have overdone things.  We should have control over the amount of money <Col N="1379" /> spent on the agriculture committee and we must take it on the 50 per cent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be spending our money, too.  The other 50 per cent is our money and if they put it up, our contribution will also be going up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  Subsection 1(c) of section 2 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person, other than a member of the council, appointed to be a member of a committee of agriculture shall be chosen by the council for such appointment either by reason of his attainments in the practice of farming or the development of agriculture and rural living in the particular locality in which he resides, or by reason of his attainments in the promotion of agricultural or rural home education and advisory work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there is anyone in rural Ireland who would not qualify under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;attainments&rdquo; is very important.  Every member of the Seanad knows very well just how difficult it is to get an exact definition, not only in this country where every person could really claim to have some knowledge of farming. We could couple this with the 1931 Act and the definition in the 1931 Act will still apply as to 50 per cent to every councillor elected.  This is the new definition for the incoming 50 per cent to apply to people who are outside the elected body.  It is the best we could think of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone at all could be eligible for appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator reads this carefully, he will see that it is the best we could think of.  I do not say he cannot interpret it in the way he describes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only just asking if the vocational membership <Col N="1380" /> was going to be more or less kept to qualified <i>bona fide</i> farmers or people with expert first-hand knowledge. Everyone in this country claims to be an excellent farmer because he thinks there is nothing to do but put things in and they come up automatically. Apart from that, I thought we were looking for a more vocational committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a question on this section?  It is laid down here that every person co-opted must fulfil certain qualifications.  Suppose this were challenged in a court of law&mdash;that some person who was disgruntled were to challenge whether a person co-opted was within this category of a person who had attainments in practical farming and rural living. Could that be questioned in the law courts?  It would be an extremely difficult thing for any judge to decide whether or not a person was within that category.  It seems to me that there is laid down there a qualification for co-option that could be decided in the law courts, and it would be an extremely difficult problem for any judge to decide whether any individual person had these qualifications or not.  I wonder if the Minister has thought at all about that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make one further point?  If the Minister wishes to attain his objective, which I take to be the granting of representation to voluntary organisations really interested in farming, I suggest he can do so in quite a simple way by compiling a register of such organisations. Within his Department, he must have done so already when he says that there are about 105.  He could then say that a certain percentage of the members of the committees of agriculture must come from one or more of these organisations, if there be a branch of that organisation within the county.  That would go a long way to get over the difficulty some members had.  It would certainly meet the wishes of the voluntary organisations concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are precedents for it already. There is a register of people who can nominate people to Seanad Éireann <Col N="1381" /> and there is a register now of political Parties.  It would not be a very difficult thing to have a register of those worthwhile voluntary organisations and to define a qualification for membership as being a member of one or more of these if there were a branch in the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see this return of interest on the part of Senator Fitzpatrick in these rural organisations.  I know that he used to be very concerned about their welfare but I thought he had tended to desert them in recent years.  However, it is nice to see this return.  Of course, the Senator would devise a scheme without any difficulty.  I know that he has tremendous organising ability and a high standard of understanding of these problems that far overshadows mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity for humility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see this idea worked out.  Where is the register of members in a particular area? Take even the NFA and the ICMSA. The best chance would be the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  I would like to see one of these on the committee of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  Why should not the sensible people whom we elected to the county council see the need as well as I?  We have, as I say, examined this.  I do not know whether Senator Fitzpatrick is suspicious of my genuine interest in this or not.  If he is, I am not going to try to disabuse him any further.  I say that we have tried this.  The organisations themselves have discussed this matter with us.  They appreciate fully what is involved in it. I know that what is proposed here will not give any firm assurance that a certain thing will happen, but I am prepared to attribute to the elected representatives, in the main, a fair share of judgment and a sense of fair play.  I know in certain counties when fairly outstanding leaders of the NFA, or some other rural organisation, were mentioned, they have been co-opted to county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The better the organisations are <Col N="1382" /> organised in the districts, the more likely they are to make themselves felt with the county councils in securing representation.  If they have not the standard of organisation, it is their fault.  They have often claimed to me to have, and I am now going to put them to the test and say: &ldquo;You can get 50 per cent one way or another. It is for you to go after public men and to ensure that you will&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the other point, mentioned by Senator O'Brien, I do not know what the legal position is.  I think a person, or persons, could seek an injunction if some person were chosen who did not appear to have the qualifications set out here.  An injunction, or some sort of restraint, could be invoked to examine the credentials of the individual who had been co-opted.  I shall not say it would be easy for the court to determine whether a man satisfied the requirements set out here.  I cannot make it easier for the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have heard the Minister aright, he mentioned that it is up to the rural organisations who are anxious to get representation on these committees to go out after the public representatives, or the elected representatives, and ensure that they get elected.  The onus is on them to bring pressure on the elected representatives, to get appointed or co-opted, to committees of Agriculture.  It is obvious now that a certain amount of pressure is being applied in certain places, and now the pressure will be channelled in another direction, so that the public representatives who are elected, or who are likely to be elected next June, will be subjected to a certain type of pressure from ambitious people who will use their organisations to further their ambitions by saying: &ldquo;Will you support the appointment of two members of such and such a rural organisation on the committee of agriculture, or three members, or four, of these ten extern members who are to be co-opted, if you are elected.&rdquo; That is the type of pressure I foresee being exerted next May and June when public representatives go out to seek election to the county council.  I do not think it is fair that public representatives should be subjected to that <Col N="1383" /> type of badgering by ambitious people who have not the courage to run the gauntlet of election and find out what the public or the electors think about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I do not think that a statutory formula could be worked out which could be applied equitably to all counties.  I hope, however, that county councils will keep the rural organisations and the co-operative movement in mind when choosing members for committees and that this broadening of membership will lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In his reply on Second Stage the Minister saw fit to accuse members of the rural organisations of being men who were looking for the glamour of leadership and publicity.  I feel that is a slight on the rural organisations. After all, they are composed of men who have the common interest of their livelihood, and the right to come together and discuss their problems. The beekeepers have an organisation, and have they not the right to meet together to discuss the problems of beekeeping?  Have not the various societies of cattle breeders the right to organise and meet to discuss their common interest of improving livestock? The same is the case in regard to the ICMSA, and all the other organisations which I am sure the Minister has included in his list of 105.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair for the Minister to be constantly attacking these rural organisations who have done such wonderful work to help their members, and the farmers of Ireland, to be better citizens, to produce better crops, to pursue better crop husbandry, and to be better Irishmen and farmers.  The Minister should be more helpful to these young men who give their time and work voluntarily to improve their own and their neighbours' lot.  They <Col N="1385" /> are to be congratulated.  The tremendous amount of work that has been undertaken, and successfully carried out, by Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre is easily recognisable in all parts of Ireland, and particularly in the counties in which those organisations flourish and thrive.  I should like to register a protest at the Minister accusing them of looking for the glamour of leadership and publicity.</P>

I was defending the right of public representatives to form their own subsidiary committees after they had run the gauntlet of election. If people feel they would make better representatives on the committees of agriculture, they have the same opportunity to get on to committees of agriculture as others have, without depending on a section in this Bill which will enable them to be co-opted on to a committee without having to undergo the hardships and frustrations connected with contesting a local election.</P>

    <Title>Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 1964: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has three main objects.  First of all, it proposes that the requirement in the Civil Liability Act, 1961, of certain special findings by a jury or judge in a contributory negligence action should be abolished.  Secondly, it proposes that the present temporary <Col N="1386" /> provision in the 1961 Act allowing compensation for mental distress in fatal injuries cases should become permanent. Finally, it proposes to state in statutory form the rule that, in assessing damages in a personal injuries action, account is not to be taken of any sum payable to the injured person under any contract of insurance or under any pension scheme.</P>
      <P>Because of paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 40 of the 1961 Act, the jury or judge, if there is no jury, in a negligence case must find and record whose negligence, want of care, <i>et cetera</i>, contributed to whose or what damage and in what respects. This requirement was based on similar requirements in certain of the Canadian jurisdictions.  Our provision has in practice been found somewhat difficult to operate.  It has been alleged that it imposes on the jury an unfair and unnecessary task, and that it is a provision that would allow the finding of a jury or judge to be upset if the law were not strictly complied with.  After full consideration of the matter, I came to the conclusion that the paragraph in question should be repealed.  The Bill provides for this repeal in section 6 and the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to repeal paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 49 of the 1961 Act.  The effect of this repeal will be that the provision in that subsection allowing reasonable compensation up to £1,000 in a fatal case for mental distress will become a permanent part of the law.  The compensation to be awarded to the dependants of a fatally injured person will continue to be a matter for the judge.  What Scots law knows as <i>solatium</i> was first introduced into our law by the 1961 Act.  It was considered at that time that some experience should be gained before the concept was permanently incorporated into the law of damages.  Accordingly, it was enacted that the relevant provision should have effect only in respect of deaths occurring within three years after the passing of the Act on the 17th August, 1961.  So far there have been seventy-nine fatal cases, of which two were Circuit Court cases.  I am satisfied from the inquiries I have <Col N="1387" /> made that the provision allowing for <i>solatium</i> is operating satisfactorily and that, being a desirable provision, it should be made permanent.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes to state in statutory form what was understood to be already the law in personal injuries cases when the 1961 Act was being enacted.  However, doubt has recently been raised in England by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal there in a case involving a particular type of pension.  To avoid any such doubt arising here, section 2 of the Bill provides that, in assessing damages in a personal injuries case, account is not to be taken of any sum payable in respect of the injury under any contract of insurance or of any pension, gratuity or other like benefit payable under statute or otherwise in consequence of the injury.  There is already a corresponding provision in section 50 of the 1961 Act in so far as concerns fatal injuries.  I should mention that payments or pensions under either section 2 of the Bill or section 50 of the Act do not include compensation under the Workman's Compensation Acts.  These Acts themselves make special provision for the award of workmen's compensation and civil damages.  An injured person or his dependants may not recover both compensation and damages.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 contain the remaining proposals in the Bill.  These sections involve clarification of existing provisions in the 1961 Act, and they have been designed to cover matters that came to my attention since the 1961 Act was enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will add a new subsection to section 27.  The idea of the new subsection is to ensure that an alleged wrongdoer, sued by the injured person and wishing to obtain contribution from a fellow wrongdoer, may make a claim or serve a third-party notice, although he denies or does not admit that he is a wrongdoer.  Also, the making of the claim or the serving of the notice is not to be taken as implying any admission of liability.  One of the objects of sections 21 and 27 of the 1961 Act was to give a wrongdoer a general right to contribution from any <Col N="1388" /> fellow wrongdoer, provided he exercised that right in the injured person's action.  This was to ensure that all matters arising out of a particular set of circumstances would, as far as possible, be heard and determined at one and the same time.  It has been suggested that there is a danger that a judge would hold that a person wishing to claim contribution under section 27 of the 1961 Act would have to admit that he was a wrongdoer. While my own view is that the section could not reasonably be read in this way, I feel that it would be better specifically to negative any such interpretation. This is what section 3 of the Bill seeks to achieve.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill proposes to make subsection (2) of section 35 of the 1961 Act subject to paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of the same section. The reason for this is to ensure that, in an action for loss of <i>consortium</i> or loss of services, the plaintiff will, for negligence purposes, be identified with his wife or servant, where the wife or servant was acting in the course of her or his employment with the plaintiff. This was the law prior to 1961; and one of the objects of the 1961 Act was to continue that law.  It has been argued that the law has, in fact, been amended because the rule as to vicarious liability stated in subsection (1) (a) of section 35 does not specifically govern the rule in subsection (2) as to actions for loss of <i>consortium</i> or for loss of services.  This, I may say, was never the intention.  Section 4 of the Bill clarifies the matter.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 5 of the Bill to add a new subsection to section 36 of the 1961 Act in order to ensure that what is known as &ldquo;the principle of cross-liabilities&rdquo; will apply to every claim against an insurance company. I can best explain the problem by an example.  Suppose that A and B are involved in a accident, and that, after apportionment of fault, A gets judgment for £500 and B gets judgment for £400, thus making A entitled to £100 after set-off of B's judgment against him.  The sum of £100 is paid to A by B's insurance company.  B, under section 36(4) of the 1961 Act, is entitled to recover from his own insurance <Col N="1389" /> company the sum of £400 deducted by the company in settling A's judgment.  A should have a similar right against his own insurance company in respect of B's judgment However, subsection (4) of section 36 does not in terms give him this right, though the intention of section 36 was to ensure that the two insurance companies would between them, meet their aggregate liability for £900 in full.  This is now being made quite clear.</P>
    <P>The principle of cross-liabilities is being applied to both B's and A's case. This principle has for many years been enshrined in marine insurance policies, and is written in to all policies by subsection (3) of section 36 of the 1961 Act.  By reason of the proposed new subsection, if A becomes bankrupt, his insurance company will not be able to enrich itself to the extent of a debt owed to him by B.  The corollary is already the position where B becomes bankrupt.  Under section 62 of the 1961 Act, moneys payable to an insured person under an insurance policy in respect of liability for a wrong are, where the insured becomes bankrupt, applicable only to discharging in full all valid claims against the insured arising out of the wrong.  This protects the injured person where the wrongdoer becomes bankrupt.  Section 36 protects the creditors of the bankrupt, although the section applies, of course, in cases other than bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a non-contentious type of Bill which has been introduced principally, I would say, to tidy up certain doubts or certain effects which were not anticipated but which followed from the principal Act, the Civil Liability Act of 1961.  There is no objection to the Bill from this side of the House.  As a matter of fact it is a type of Bill which might usefully be introduced in the Seanad, instead of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to abolish the section of the 1961 Act which limited the right of a person to recover compensation for mental distress, following the death of a dependant, to three years.  For the first time, the 1961 Act conferred on a court the <Col N="1390" /> right to grant compensation for mental distress to the dependants of a person who had been killed through the negligence of another.  I agree with the proposal to make that right a permanent right.  The ceiling of £1,000, as was said in the Dáil, is too low.  I do not believe the full amount of £1,000, has ever been awarded by a judge since the 1961 Act was passed. The courts, in awarding compensation under this section, must keep in mind that £1,000 is the ceiling, and are therefore inclined to cut down on the amount of compensation to be awarded.  The ceiling might very well be removed and discretion given to the courts to award compensation.  It is the judge who awards compensation in this case and not the jury.  The judge could be relied upon to award a reasonable amount of compensation.  There are cases where a sum of £1,000 would not be adequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be satisfied with section 2 as drafted.  The question was raised in the Dáil as to whether the effect of it might not be to exclude from consideration workmen's compensation under the Act.  I think, and some other people think, too, that it is open to argument, and that a case could be made that workmen's compensation would fall into the very wide definition of section 2 (b) which refers to any pension, gratuity or other like benefit payable under statute or otherwise in consequence of the injury.</P>
    <P>Workmen's compensation could be said to be a pension or other like benefit.  It is certainly payable under statute.  If there is a clash between two statutes, I do not know which would prevail.  I feel the latter would be deemed to have revoked the earlier one.  If the Minister is satisfied about this beyond doubt, and his advisers are, it is all right but it is a bad job winning by a photo-finish.  If there is any doubt about it, it should be put beyond doubt.  It is like the jockey leaving a race to the last 100 yards and then winning by a photo-finish.</P>

      <P>Sometimes the horse has left it too late.  If this is a <Col N="1391" /> question of a photo-finish, it should be beyond doubt at this stage.  The other sections in the Bill are more or less declaratory sections for the purpose of clarifying the law or rectifying the sections which were not allowed to go through in the earlier Bill.  I should like to hear the Minister's comment on section 2 (b) about the ceiling for mental distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick is right in saying that the question of whether the ceiling is adequate was raised in the Dáil.  It is very difficult to measure mental distress in financial terms so as to say what amount of money is adequate to compensate a person for the mental distress caused by the loss of a relative, be it a parent or a child.</P>
      <P>We approached this matter with very great caution in 1961, because it was new to our law.  We had regard to the fact that in Scotland, where there is <i>solatium</i>, the figure was £750.  Taking everything into consideration, we settled on £1,000.  It seems to me that this provision allowing for £1,000 maximum is working well and has not caused any adverse comment.  For the moment, I think we are justified in leaving the figure at £1,000, though, of course, any fixed figure in a statute like this must necessarily be reviewed from time to time, having regard to the fall in the value of money over a long period.  We shall be keeping an eye on the situation, with particular regard to the adequacy from time to time of the maximum of £1,000.</P>
      <P>I am assured that the provision in section 2 does not include, and could not be held to include, workmen's compensation.  The rule of interpretation is <i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i>, that is to say, general enactments do not affect special ones.  The workmen's compensation code is a special enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draftsman was satisfied that workmen's compensation could not be held to be a pension, gratuity or other like benefit, and I think we are safe enough in leaving the section as it is. Apart from that, there is the fact that <Col N="1392" /> the Government have announced their intention to abolish workmen's compensation as we know it and to substitute an entirely different system.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill, which was envisaged in the Programme of Law Reform published in 1962, is to state in a single measure and in modern terms the statute law relating to pawnbroking.  In addition, the opportunity is being taken to effect a number of amendments designed chiefly to simplify the law and make it more suitable to present-day requirements. A modest increase in pawnbroking charges is also being provided to compensate for the substantial increases that have taken place over the years in the cost of conducting a pawnbroking business.</P>
      <P>The law regulating pawnbroking is contained basically in two statutes of Grattan's Parliament, and it is remarkable that, apart from some minor amendments, spread over a dozen statutes, the law in its essential features has remained unaltered for so long.  The statutes of 1786 and 1788 were in fact the first attempt of the Irish legislature to regulate the trade of pawnbroking here.  Before 1786 the usury laws then in force made it unlawful to charge more than 6 per cent per annum for the loan of money, however small the loan or great the trouble connected with it.  This must have made it difficult, if not impracticable, to carry on the trade of pawnbroking for small loans in an open and lawful manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1786 made it lawful for pawnbrokers to charge from 25 to 30 <Col N="1393" /> per cent per annum.  Section 17 of the Act, however, provided that nothing in the Act &ldquo;should extend or be construed to extend to any person who should lend money at the rate of six per cent per annum only&rdquo;.  This provision enabled any pawnbroker who was satisfied with six per cent&mdash;and it must be assumed that even then there were very few&mdash;to escape the restrictions of the statute altogether.  This is still the law, but it obviously has no relevance to present-day conditions and it is proposed to repeal the provision without re-enactment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the pawnbroking trade is declining.  In Dublin alone there are only somewhat more than half the number of pawnshops that there were in 1945.  This decline in the demand for the services offered by pawnbrokers reflects the general improvement in the level of wages and employment and is indicative of the increasing prosperity of the community. In addition, the expansion of credit facilities in other directions has also had its effect.  Pawnbrokers have over the years provided a very useful service to the community, and I believe there will still be room in the future for the special loan facilities which they provide. These facilities can be made all the more efficient and the interests of pawners better protected if the law governing pawnbroking is simplified and brought up to date.  This the Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to summarise the principles involved in the regulation of the pawnbroking trade by statute.  There are, first of all, two classes of pawning, namely, that which comes within the Pawnbroking Acts and that which does not.  The Acts apply at present where the loan does not exceed £10, and the pawnee is a pawnbroker within the statutory definition. In all other cases the contract is governed by the general law.  We are only concerned here with pawning within the scope of the Pawnbroking Acts.</P>
    <P>The reasons for regulating smaller pawnbroking transactions by statute may be stated briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) To ensure that the pawner is given a ticket which will readily <Col N="1394" /> identify his property; (2) to vest the right to redeem the pledge in the person producing the ticket; (3) to enable the pawnbroker to make a specified charge for the ticket and, before releasing the goods on repayment of the loan, to demand a settled amount of interest; (4) to make it lawful for the pawnbroker to realise the sum lent, together with the interest due, by the sale of the pledge at the end of a specified period, if the pledge is not redeemed; (5) to oblige the pawnbroker to pay to the pawner on demand any surplus (termed overplus in the Acts) which the unredeemed pledge may have produced on sale, after deducting the amount of the loan and all lawful charges due; (6) to ensure that the sale of unredeemed pledges is effected through public auction.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with some of the more important amendments of the present law proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first amendment I should like to mention is contained in section 3 of the Bill.  As I have said, the existing statute law governs pawning transactions in which the loan does not exceed £10. This limit has remained unchanged since 1788.  Having regard to the changes in money values that have since taken place, the Government consider it desirable that all pawning transactions not exceeding £50 should be brought within the scope of the statute.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the licensing of pawnbrokers.  The present requirements of the law in regard to licensing are cumbersome and complicated and, moreover, there are differences in the licensing procedure depending on whether the pawnbroker has his premises in Dublin or elsewhere. Many of the requirements have long since become obsolete, and should be abolished in favour of more modern procedures.  Furthermore, there is no reason why the present differentiation between the licensing procedure in Dublin and the provinces should be continued.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides simply that a pawnbroker shall be required to obtain a licence for each premises at which he carries on business.  This <Col N="1395" /> licence will be renewable annually and will be granted by the Revenue Commissioners on payment of the appropriate duty to be fixed by the Minister for Finance in a Finance Act and on presentation of a certificate of suitability from the district court, for which certificate provision is made in section 10.</P>
    <P>In considering the grant or otherwise of a certificate of suitability, it is proposed that the district court should have regard, amongst other things, to the character of the applicant, the suitability of his premises and the kind of business, if any, in which the applicant is already engaged.  There will be a right of appeal to the circuit court against refusal by the district court to grant a certificate of suitability.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in licensing procedure will have the effect of abolishing the duty of £92 6s 2d which each pawnbroker carrying on business within the Dublin Metropolitan Police District is now obliged to pay annually to the local authority.  This duty, which is in addition to the present excise duty of £7 10s, was originally imposed by a local Act of 1804 which applied the duty to defraying the charges of preserving the peace within the city of Dublin.  There can be no case for continuing the payment of this duty to the local authority.  Indeed, it is noteworthy that its abolition was recommended as far back as 1868 in the report of a Commission of Inquiry into the pawnbroking laws.  The loss of revenue to the local authorities will not be significant, £1,200 in the case of the Dublin Corporation and £92 6s. 2d in the case of the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The present lawful charges which pawnbrokers may levy have remained unchanged since 1825.  I have accepted the representations of the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association that the present charges are inadequate and should be increased to provide some compensation for the substantial increases that have taken place in the costs of conducting a pawnbroking business.  The Government's proposals regarding pawnbroking charges are contained in <Col N="1396" /> section 20 and the Fifth Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland rates of interest were increased in 1954.  Up to then they have been identical with the rates here.  In the case of Britain, a slight increase was allowed in 1922 on the then existing rates which had obtained since 1872.  A further increase in British charges was granted in an Act of 1960, which, although reverting to pre-1922 interest rates, provided for the first time for a &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; charge of 2d per five shillings, limited, however, to loans of £5 or under. Having considered the merits of raising the interest rates, as was done in the North, or of following the method adopted in Britain in 1960, I came to the conclusion that the introduction here of a &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; or &ldquo;service&rdquo; fee would be the most appropriate method of meeting the higher costs of conducting a pawnbroking business. The present maximum rate of interest, namely, ½d per 2/- per month, is, therefore, being continued in this Bill.  Provision is also being made in Part III of the Fifth Schedule for a new fee which is described as a valuation fee. This new fee is at a rate of 2d on each five shillings or part of five shillings of a loan.  The fee will be chargeable only on loans not exceeding £10.  In the case of loans over £10 special contracts will be allowed.  I shall deal with special contracts later on.</P>
    <P>The formulae proposed in the Bill in regard to the method of calculating the interest payable on loans for fractional periods of a month, and on loans which are not an even multiple of 2/-, are being modified in favour of the pawner.  The present supplementary fee of ½d. on loans not exceeding 18/- is being abolished.  A standard charge of 2d. is being provided for pawn-tickets. This will replace the existing charge of 1d. to 4d., according to the amount of the loan.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 21 of the Bill to amend the existing redemption period, that is to say, the period during which pledges remain redeemable and may not be disposed of by the pawnbroker. At present the period runs from six months to 12 months, according <Col N="1397" /> to the amount of the loan.  We have accepted the representations of the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association that the present redemption period is too long and operates in many cases to the detriment of both the pawner and the pawnbroker.  Since 1960, pawnbrokers in Britain are not required to keep pledges longer than six months. The proposal in section 21 of the Bill represents a compromise between the British provision and our existing law. While the redemption period is being reduced to six months generally, provision is made for an extension not exceeding a further period of six months, if interest due is paid within the original redemption period.  Moreover, the more valuable pledges, that is to say, articles of gold, silver, etc., are dealt with exceptionally.  These pledges must be retained by the pawnbroker for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>The law requires that all unredeemed pledges, that is pledges remaining unredeemed at the end of the redemption period, be sold by public auction. This requirement, however, has not been observed outside the Dublin area for many years because of the obsolete nature of some of the provisions now governing the matter.  In the North, the law was amended in 1954.  There, pledges now become the pawnbroker's own property at the expiry of the redemption period; and they may be disposed of as he thinks fit.  In Britain, pledges pawned for £2 or less become the pawnbroker's own property at the expiry of the redemption period.  All other pledges must in Britain be sold by public auction.</P>
    <P>I consider that the pawner's interest is best served by continuing the general requirement of having unredeemed pledges sold by auction through auctioneers specially nominated for the purpose by the Minister for Justice. This is proposed in sections 29 and 30 of the Bill.  However, in order to provide some relief to pawnbrokers from the rigorous requirements of the present law, at least in the case of the less important transactions, section 29 includes a provision excluding pledges pawned for £2 or under from the general requirement of sale by public <Col N="1398" /> auction.  This relief will not extend to pledges of gold, silver etc., pawned for £2 or under.  These will continue to be disposed of by public auction.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill is an entirely new provision and is designed to allow pawnbrokers to enter into special contracts with their clients.  In Britain, the law allows a pawnbroker to make a special contract with a pawner where the loan exceeds £5, but he must deliver to the pawner a special pawn-ticket specifying the terms of the contract and a duplicate of the ticket must be signed by the pawner at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Irish Pawnbrokers' Association made strong representations to me to have a similar provision enacted here. The proposal in section 15 is that a special contract will be governed by the provisions of the Act, except in so far as these provisions are excluded by the terms of the special contract itself.  The need for special contract arises, in the main, where large or very valuable articles, such as furniture, cars, etc., involving unusual storing and insurance arrangements, are offered in pawn.  While the Association's representations have been accepted, it is proposed that the provision for special contract will not operate here unless the loan exceeds £10.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have explained adequately the purpose of the Bill and have given Senators an outline of the reasons for the more important amendments in the existing law which the Bill is designed to effect.  I might mention that during its course through Dáil Éireann a number of minor amendments which had been introduced to meet further representations from the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association were made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill will commend itself to Senators as a measure of reform long overdue and that the House will agree to give it a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced to bring up to date the law governing pawnbroking.  It is nearly 200 years since the last Bill governing this particular type of business was <Col N="1399" /> introduced.  It is a Bill that there is not a great urgency about.  It deals with a very limited number of businesses. I understand that the total number of pawnbroking establishments in the country is about 32.  There are 14 of these, the Minister has told us, in the city of Dublin and in proportion there is a much larger number in the city of Cork.  I think the population of Cork is only about one-fifth of Dublin, yet you have ten pawnbroking establishments in Cork to 14 in Dublin. I do not know what that might mean. Probably different people would use it to arrive at different conclusions. Apart from those 24 there are eight other pawnbroking establishments throughout the entire country.</P>
      <P>This is a specialised type of legislation and I am pleased to note that the Minister consulted with and acted upon suggestions made by the Pawnbrokers' Association.  I think that is desirable.  I had reason to complain here on another Bill that one of the Minister's colleagues did not accept suggestions from the Patent Agents' Association, or at least he did not act on them.</P>

      <P>Maybe the pawnbrokers have a stronger organisation than the patent agents, but at any rate that is desirable.  A lot of the existing law is re-enacted here and there are some new provisions introduced.  The Minister might perhaps have repealed some of the existing law and omitted some of the new provisions.  Perhaps this is a Bill that might have been referred to some sort of committee.  I cannot think exactly what sort of committee might do it justice&mdash;perhaps a joint one of the Pawnbrokers' Association and the university students if they are still interested in that type of business.  I also feel that I might have done more justice to this Bill myself if it had been given to me a considerable number of years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was more in touch with the situation.  At any rate this is a Bill which one might deal with as the various sections arise.  One thing that strikes me is that there is a new section under which pawns in respect of loans under £2 become the absolute property of the pawnbroker after a specified time, whereas pledges for loans in excess of £2 do not.  I wonder is that a wise section.  I wonder if it would not be better to have it either that all pledges become the property of the pawnbroker after a certain time or that none of them does.  I feel that there might be a temptation to make smaller loans in order to get rid of the necessity for having to auction these pledges later on.</P>
      <P>There is one very objectionable section in this Bill, that is, section 30.  It does not really, in principle, refer alone to the pawnbroking profession.  The section gives the Minister the right to say what auctioneer shall, and what auctioneer shall not, have the right to conduct an auction of pledges taken by pawnbrokers.  I want to say I think that is fundamentally wrong.  It is not marked new here but it seems to be taken from sections 9 to 13 of the Act of 1788.  I do not know what the position was then.  There may have been a necessity to interfere to ensure that the right type of auctioneer was appointed to conduct auctions of goods from pawnbrokers' establishments.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the auctioneers' position was like then, but I do know that the auctioneers' profession at the present time is controlled by a responsible body, the Auctioneers' Association, and I do know that since the early 1940's it has been necessary for auctioneers to obtain a licence.  In order to obtain that licence, they have, since that time, to go to the court and get a certificate from the district justice of personal fitness and they have had to deposit with the Accountant of the High Court a sum of £2,000, or a bond from an insurance company for that amount, as evidence of their <i>bona fides</i> and solvency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I fail to see why this section taken in its entirety from an old Act of 1788 should be re-enacted in the year 1964.  I think it is unnecessary <Col N="1401" /> interference with the auctioneering profession and it might be taken as a precedent for further interference in this and other professions.  It has always been the law that if a person pawned an article as security for a loan of, say, £5 after six or twelve months, or whatever the period is, the article is sold and realises £10, against the £5 loan, and after deducting all proper and necessary expenses, the pawnbroker must hold the excess in trust for the pawner.</P>
    <P>That has been the law.  At any rate, it is now made the law in section 33, I think.  There is no provision in the Act for giving to the pawner notice of the amount standing to his credit, and it might be desirable that such notice should be given.  There is also imposed in section 41 of the Bill an obligation on the pawnbroker to hold the pledges in safety and if they are destroyed by fire, or otherwise, the pawnbroker is under an obligation to compensate the pawner to the extent of one-half of the amount of the loan. I should like to ask the Minister how he arrived at that particular figure for compensation.  An article worth £50 might be pawned to secure a loan of £10 and after that article is destroyed by fire in the pawnbroker's premises, the pawnbroker is only under the obligation to compensate the owner by £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that would be £10 for the £50 article about which I am talking, and I hardly think it is reasonable. Those points may be against the pawnbroker.  There are sections of this Act with which we will deal imposing onerous obligations on pawnbrokers to detect criminals and hand them over.</P>

If there is any urgency about the Social Welfare Bill, we are prepared to deal with it.  I must say I cannot see any urgency about the <Col N="1405" /> Pawnbrokers Bill, with all respect to the Minister.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister, I am not at all happy that it is necessary to have this measure even though the law has stood largely as it was passed by Grattan's Parliament. The Minister made the point that the number of pawnbroking establishments has been declining and related that to higher wage rates and better standards of living.  He went on to say that he thinks there is still room for the special useful services which pawnbrokers provide.</P>
      <P>I have not had experience with pawnbrokers.  Every Monday morning when I am going to work I see women carrying bundles of clothes into pawnbroking establishments.  I do not consider that that is a particularly useful function or service.  It seems to me that what we are embarking on here is making certain that the business of pawnbroking will continue.  We are easing what the Minister refers to as the very onerous requirements in regard to the pawnbroking business. We are allowing some financial easement to them by increasing the rates of interest and abolishing certain levies which they have to pay to the local authorities here in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, therefore, left wondering whether the reduction in the number of pawnbrokers is due to what the Minister says it is, the rising wage rates or the fact that it is not a very remunerative business at the present time.  This is what the Minister now <Col N="1407" /> proposes to amend in the Bill.  I do not accept at all that this is a particularly useful and worthwhile element of modern society.</P>
    <P>I should like this business to disappear altogether.  I am against a situation where, by easing the present onerous requirements, we are encouraging the continuation of this type of business.  I am not saying anything against pawnbrokers personally.  I am sure they are all respectable people.  I do not like to see this business of pawnbroking at all.  I do not accept the Minister's contention that they provide a very useful service and that there will still be room for them in future for the special loan facilities they provide.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it is a good thing to see women going along with bundles of clothes to these establishments on Monday morning.  We should not be proud of it and the proper way of dealing with this situation is by proper social services, proper home assistance, proper guidance to these people, a proper standard of living and proper housing and not by providing pawnbroking services.</P>
    <P>I do not like pawnbroking and I am sure there are many Senators in this House who, equally, do not like this sort of business.  It may be good fun for the students.  It may be part of their life to hock things.  I am not concerned about that.  I am concerned about the poor people I see every Monday morning going to the pawnbroking establishments.  It is not a good thing and we should not be facilitating this sort of business.  We should not enable it to continue by making it more rewarding.  We should not accept the Minister's suggestion that they still have a useful function to perform in this modern age.  I do not see it as such and I am opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the hour is late, I shall just confine myself simply to endorsing very strongly everything <Col N="1408" /> Senator Murphy said.  Pawnbroking is a mark of poverty and of ignorance. The three balls stand for that and the quicker we remove them from our daily life here the better for our country.  I suggest the Minister should transfer some of his fervour to bringing in the necessary legislation to start a proper loan credit union system which would quickly get over the necessity for this hand to mouth existence.  We find it in some regions in Newfoundland and elsewhere which are far more poverty stricken than we are.  I understand there are very great difficulties in doing this on a proper scale.</P>
      <P>What sort of service does pawnbroking provide?  It only provides a type of circulation of goods.  The goods go in on Monday morning and come out sometime towards the end of the week.  It provides a very limited finance which should be capable of being provided more readily by the local shopkeepers.  The interest rates they charge provide capital which compensates for the service provided. Consequently, it would be far better to have some positive scheme to gradually ease this out altogether even if that meant buying out some of the existing establishments.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to devote his energies to this in the years ahead and see that the three balls will no longer dominate some of our streets and provide this public exhibition on Monday mornings.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, in order to prevent a recurrence of this unwarranted and extraordinary situation in which Senators vote against something which is not really before them, those who have responsibility for the arrangement of the business of the House will so arrange it as to prevent this situation arising.  The whole business tonight has been a disgrace to those who arrange the business.</P>

      <P>I spoke to Senators Murphy and Hayes on the telephone yesterday and it was clearly understood we would do this business today, and I expressed the reasons why it was so important we should do so. There is no reason why Senator Hayes should put the sheet over his head now.</P>
