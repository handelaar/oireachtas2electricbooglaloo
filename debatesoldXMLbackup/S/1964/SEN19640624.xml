      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to maintain the supply of land bonds for the financing of the land reform programme.</P>
      <P>Senators will, no doubt, be well aware that a very great part of the acquisition and resumption programme of the Land Commission is financed by means of land bonds created from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  The basic authority for these creations is section 6 (1) of the Land Bond Act, 1934 and at that time it was laid down that the Minister could not create more than a grand total of £10 million in Bonds. This limit was raised to £15 million by an amendment inserted in the Land Bond Act, 1934 by section 7 of the Land Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Bill, 1963, which has not yet come before the Senate contains a proposal to raise the overall limit by a further £5 million but that Bill is making such slow progress through the legislature that a situation has arisen in which the existing supply of land bonds will, almost certainly, run out before the Bill is enacted.  Consequently, the Government have thought it best to segregate the Land Bond <Col N="1180" /> provision and make a special two-section Bill of it.</P>
    <P>Since that decision was taken, however, I have given further consideration to the steady rise in the price of land and also to the very lively tempo of the Land Commission's current work in the field of land acquisition and I have come to the conclusion that £5 million is not an adequate increase in the financial supply.  Accordingly, I now propose to provide for an increase of £10 million over all.  This should keep the Land Commission supplied for a reasonably long period, during which I expect to see them make a very big impact on the remaining congestion in the country.</P>
    <P>Land bonds finance on a substantial scale is vital to our land reform programme. I thrust, therefore, that the Senators will agree to the immediate passage of this Bill so that the Land Commission's planned acquisition target for the immediate future can be achieved and the completion of pending voluntary purchase dealings finalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection to the Bill from this side of the House.  As the Minister has stated, its purpose is to increase the authority of the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Finance to issue land bonds up to £25 million.  The present limit is £15 million.  The terms on which land bonds may be issued are governed by the parent Act and there is no reference to the terms on which they may be issued in this Bill.  Land bonds have been issued at various rates of interest from 3 per cent to 4½ per cent and 6 per cent.  It is highly desirable in the interests of the smooth acquisition of land by the Land Commission that land bonds should be attractive to the owners of land.  It did happen in the past, when money was cheap and bonds were issued at 3 per cent, that people who sold their lands to the Land Commission found it was impossible to realise the land bonds at par or anything like par.  That left a very bad taste in the mouths of landowners and led them to believe, rightly so, that they were not getting a fair crack of the whip and were not <Col N="1181" /> being paid for their land in real money. Therefore, I would like to join in the appeal which was made in the Dáil to the Minister and the Minister for Finance to ensure that land bonds are issued at such a rate of interest as will ensure that they will be marketable at par or even slightly above par. If this is done it will lead to a better relationship between the owners of land and the Land Commission and may enable the Land Commission to acquire an adequate supply of land with the goodwill of the owners of the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the proposition to keep the supply of land bonds going until the Land Bill comes in.  I should like to make just a few comments on the fact that the earlier land bonds have shrunken in value.  As the Minister is expanding the scope of the land bonds, he will probably have an opportunity of making some adjustments in the new Bill and he might consider that the time has come to depart from an absolutely fixed interest land bond and relate the interest to that prevailing at the time.  In other words, land bonds which were taken out in 1950 or so at a yield of 4 per cent still bear that rate today and surely in justice the holders of those bonds should be entitled to the prevailing rate of interest.  It should be possible to introduce machinery to create this variable rate of interest which would ensure a fair return from the capital and also that the bonds would remain substantially at par so that nobody would incur either a great financial loss or a capital gain on selling the bonds.  I appeal to the Minister to see if anything on those lines could be done so that the new programme envisaged will commend itself with greater confidence to those who will be asked to accept land bonds for their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to take up a point which Senator Quinlan has raised.  If I followed him correctly, I do not think what he proposes would be workable.  He referred to land bonds carrying the prevailing rate of <Col N="1182" /> interest and I presume that he means that once issued, they will carry a rate of interest which will vary with the ordinary rates of interest levied by banks and financial institutions.  This would make land bonds impossible to negotiate in the ordinary way.  What is more important is that the land bonds should bear a capital value at the time they are received, which would be the true capital value in relation to the cost of the lands taken over.  What has sometimes happened in the past is that land bonds have been issued at, say, 4 per cent when that was the prevailing rate of interest, but by the time the people who were being paid for their lands had received the bonds the value of their capital had considerably dropped and immediately they stood to lose quite considerable sums.  The important point is the capital point and not the interest one.  Obviously, a fair rate of interest should be given but it is most important that when a landowner receives bonds for his land he can cash them on the market at a price which will give him the proper market value of his land and not, as has happened sometimes in the past, a depreciating value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the rapid manner in which this Stage is going through the Seanad.  Senator Ross has really put his finger on the point from the landowners' point of view in suggesting that the capital value of the land bonds is the important thing at the time of issue.  Of course, that also depends, as Senators are aware, on the interest rate prevailing, at the time of issue, for Government borrowing.  When the Minister for Finance agrees to issue these bonds he has to have regard to section 4, subsection (3) of the Land Bond Act, 1934, which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When fixing under this section the rate of interest to be borne by any series of land bonds, the Minister for Finance shall have regard to the prices at which the latest issue of National Loan and previous issues of land bonds under this Act or the Land Bond Act, 1933, are quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange, to the <Col N="1183" /> intent that the rate of interest so fixed may (within the limits imposed by this section) be such as to secure that the market price of land bonds of the said series shall, for a reasonable time after the creation of the said series, be at or near par.</P>
    <P>From that, Senators will understand that at the time of issue of these land bonds the terms must be such as to ensure that at the time and, as far as can be estimated, for a reasonable period afterwards, that such land bonds series shall be at par.  Indeed, if they were anything less or anything much less than par value they would, in fact, be of very little use to the Land Commission because any of the Land Commission's operations are on a voluntary basis and owners will be prepared to accept land bonds at the time of their voluntary sale.  In view of some recent administrative changes we have made and in view of the fact that we have now the full co-operation of the auctioneers, I expect in the future we will acquire much more land on a voluntary basis than in the past. Therefore, Senators can rest assured that it is of vital interest to me as Minister for Lands to ensure that land bonds are at par.  Indeed the present issue of land bonds are a six per cent issue and were above par prior to the dividend.  The last quotation of that ex-dividend was practically 99. Senators will appreciate that all fixed interest securities vary with the depreciation of money but, so far as the present issue of land bonds is concerned, at six per cent they have maintained their price well.  For practically all of last year, until the dividend was paid, they were quoted at a figure above par.</P>
    <P>We can under this new £10 million issue get out of it as much as we require from time to time.  I think possibly the best thing to do is in agreement with the Minister for Finance to have a reasonable amount of that issue at the prevailing rate so that if there is an undue fluctuation in the money market and if the interest goes up a new issue can be created that would meet the particular circumstances <Col N="1184" /> of that particular time.  However, I think on the point made by the Senators who have spoken on this matter the best answer I can give is that unless these bonds were at par, or close to it, they would be, indeed, of little use for the main purpose of the Minister for Lands.  Therefore, it is in our interest and in the interest of the State to keep them in so far as we can at par.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that the interest on land bonds is still paid with the deduction of income tax?  This is something into which the Minister might look.  It is something that is inclined to make land bonds less attractive on the market than other forms of Government securities.  I notice in the Finance Bill, with which we will be dealing later, that provision is made for the provision of Aer Lingus stock without deduction of income tax.  Personally, I cannot understand why this difference was made between ordinary Government loans and the land bonds.  Looking at it from the small investors' point of view, the person not liable for income tax, it is a burden on him to have to apply for a refund of income tax on bonds.  I put that suggestion to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with income tax.  I should like to make a case in relation to Schedule A tax which is now restricted to dwelling houses.  That is to say, owner-occupiers of dwelling houses are charged income tax on the valuation of the house.  That is surely something which might now disappear. There was an amendment of the law last year whereby people who let houses have to pay tax not on the valuation but on the profit rent.  Surely that means that the old-fashioned notion that the valuation is the net rent is gone by the board.  This is really a tax on people who own their houses and who live in them, as distinct from people who own houses and let them for profit.</P>
      <P>The Income Tax Commission made a recommendation that this tax should be remitted in the case of owner-occupiers whose valuation does not exceed £30.  I am sure the Minister will agree that ownership of one's own house is looked upon with favour by everybody.  It has a stabilising effect on the State and has very good results. The house is ordinarily kept in good order and it is less of a wasting asset than houses let for profit.  All the arguments are in favour of a remission and I think there should be an amendment of the law to remit this tax in the case of owner-occupiers of dwelling houses.  Schedule A tax appears to be on its way out anyway.  Perhaps the Minister would accelerate its departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Hayes though it occurs to me this would come up more appropriately on section 10 than it does here.  However, perhaps we should pursue it now.  The Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation makes a very strong case against this Schedule A tax.  It adduces some very weighty arguments in paragraphs 100 and 101 and, in paragraph 105, it <Col N="1186" /> states what is perhaps the really fundamental objection to Schedule A Income Tax.</P>
      <P>One of the strongest reasons for not taxing home ownership is that, notwithstanding theory, no income, as normally understood, is derived from it.  The asset does not of itself provide a fund of income out of which tax may be paid, as does a salary, dividend, or business profit.</P>
      <P>There are a good many other arguments of that kind in the report.  I shall content myself now by asking the Minister is there a hope that he will move further in the direction of the recommendations of this Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has had experience of pleading from year to year both with the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners I should like to join my voice with those who have spoken in support of the abolition of this Schedule A tax.  One does not need to be an expert to appreciate that, in essence, this is a tax on thrift.  It is, indeed an anachronism and quite outdated in our present society.  It has already been abolished in Britain.  It is time it was abolished here for the reasons stated, not only in the Report of the Commission which examined into this matter, but also because of the arguments that have been put, as they have been to my knowledge, from time to time before the Revenue Commissioners.  There is nothing to justify the retention of this type of imposition.  The tax is antiquated. It no longer fulfils the purpose for which it was originally intended.  I strongly urge the Minister to give due weight to the appeals which have been made and I add my voice to those of the other Senators who have asked for the abolition of this Schedule A tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I disagree with my colleagues in this matter.  I can see the argument in favour of getting rid of this tax altogether in the case of small dwellings with a rateable valuation under £20.  As part of the general theory, it seems to me that, if somebody lives in a house for many years, it is not arguable that that person is not deriving <Col N="1187" /> a real income out of that house. The way to look at it is that, if he does not want to live in the house, he would have to rent another house. People who are lucky enough to reside in old houses in Dublin are now paying income tax on a valuation far lower than it would be if the house were revalued today.  Frankly, I cannot see any essential distinction between enjoying a house by living in it and enjoying the rent out of that house while having to live in another house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to support the appeal made by Senator Hayes for the abolition of Schedule A tax.  I think I am correct in saying that the only people who will be liable in future for Schedule A tax will be the resident-occupiers of private houses.  Section 10, I think, proposes to abolish Schedule A tax in other cases.  At the moment a great many people are inclined to build their own houses.  That is a good thing because it relieves local authorities of the obligation to build houses.  It also ensures that the houses are better finished and kept in a better state of repair.</P>
      <P>As Senator Crowley said, this is a tax on thrift.  Let us not forget, too, that some people who are called upon to pay Schedule A tax are already paying income tax under one or other of the Schedules.  As we have been told, Schedule A tax has already been abolished in England.  I do not know what this particular tax brings in but I am sure if the cost of collection were deducted from the amount there would be no very appreciable sum left. I am sure the amount involved could be raised in some other way, some way which would not impose a tax on thrift and a tax on the growing inclination on the part of people to own their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to a point I agree with Senator O'Brien in that it is impossible to differentiate between a saving effected in purchasing one's house and the notional income one gets from it, as against the saving one may make for some other purpose by investing money in stocks and shares or putting it on deposit in the bank and getting some interest from it. <Col N="1188" /> Nevertheless, I strongly support what has been said in making a plea to the Minister for the abolition of Schedule A tax as such.  Senator Fitzpatrick said this tax will in future be levied only against owner occupiers.  This then is a tax on a most desirable form of saving, the saving made by a man who buys his own house in order to be independent on his own land.  If Schedule A tax is only to be levied against that man, then surely it is time we saw an end of it.  There may be an intellectual argument that the possession of a house is something which gives a form of direct income to the person who owns the house, but that house is his dwelling place.  It is quite different from any form of investment. I welcome the steps taken to reduce in number the types of premises which will be liable to Schedule A tax and I ask the Minister to tell us, as I hope he will, that this is a step towards the complete abolition of Schedule A tax at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators have quoted the findings of the Income Tax Commission.  A White Paper issued by the Government in 1961 deals with this matter at pages 8 and 9.  The arguments for and against are very fairly set out there.  They point out that the Commission arrived at their recommendation for two reasons.  First of all, there is the point that real income does not arise from owner occupation and that it is not fair to subject notional income to taxation.  The second point is that if there is a charge on notional income it should not be confined to real property but should extend to chattel property also.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first point, it may be classed as notional income but certain limitations are recommended by the Commission that it should apply only to houses up to the first £30 valuation and, again, in assessing the income tax due, ground rent is taken into account, and the ground rent being deducted from the valuation leaves the residue subject to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that on this basis the average amount on which income tax is assessed is only about £15.  Therefore, <Col N="1189" /> it is a small matter as far as the payer is concerned.  I think there is a matter of principle both ways.  The Government have argued in this White Paper that the principle is still as sound for taxation as it is against it.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator O'Brien, which is also more or less supported by Senator Ross, is very important. For instance, if a person has £2,000 invested in national loan he has to pay income tax on the dividends from that loan.  Before he buys the house, he is paying a rent.  It is not recommended that he should get any benefit on that rent.  Now he buys a house and puts the £2,900 into it and, as a result, he would escape income tax.  There does not seem to be any very good reason for that: it is, of course, a form of saving, I know, but we do not exempt all forms of savings.  For instance, we do not exempt a man who has £2,000 invested in national loan.</P>
    <P>The person who buys the house gets a good many advantages.  If he has not the £2,000 but borrows the money he pays interest to the bank and, to the extent to which he pays interest, he is free from income tax.  If he goes to an insurance company to borrow his money he gets relief also on the premium he pays to the insurance company.  Therefore, many reliefs are given to a person to encourage him to buy his house.  If the argument of the Income Tax Commission were logical, there is no reason why they should stop at £30 valuation.  The arguments all apply just as well to the higher valuations as to the lower ones.</P>
    <P>This form of taxation is not peculiar to this country.  They have it in most European countries.  Evidently, they think it is a just tax in all those countries.  I am not sure if it is mentioned there but it has often been mentioned that the amount collected in this way is comparatively small.  The amount that would be collected on the £30 valuations of owner-occupied houses is not a very big amount&mdash;about £250,000&mdash;but the amount of Schedule A tax collected is about £1.3 million. Therefore, I cannot argue very well against it, on that basis, that it would <Col N="1190" /> be impossible for the Exchequer to meet the point.  I think, therefore, I can only argue against it on the principle of the matter that I do not see any good reason why these particular people should be exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>Let me read the final paragraph from the White Paper issued by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances, therefore, the Government are not convinced that owner-occupiers should be relieved of income tax where there is a liability under existing law.</P>
    <P>That would go to prove that the Government of the time were not so very positive that they thought the matter should never be taken up again. Since 1962, I have not seen any good reason why we should consider this matter.  I do not think it is likely that the Government will consider this in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about logic.  Anyone who talks logic and our taxation system in the same breath is surely playing with words.  It is surely the most illogical thing we have.  You would want to be much more than logical.  You would want to be a very painstaking scholar to follow some of the qualifications of this Bill.  There was a Professor of Metaphysics in University College, Dublin, Professor William McGuinness, who was once a member of this House.  One of his favourite remarks was that life was larger than logic.</P>
      <P>The arguments for this remission would overweigh any logical arguments. Is it the case&mdash;because I have never noticed it in paying my income tax&mdash;that one is charged income tax under Schedule A only on one's valuation less one's ground rent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I never knew that before.  I have been missing that for a long time.  Surely the argument in favour of encouraging people to have their own houses and to occupy their own houses, on the one hand, and the restriction of the suggested remission to a certain figure such as £30 should weigh with the Minister? The owner-occupier of a house has a great deal of expense in connection with the house.  He maintains it.  In doing so, and in keeping it in good order, he is not only maintaining an asset for himself but for the local authority and for the State.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien really came to the conclusion that this should be done to not as high as £30 but should be restricted to a valuation under £20.  I am afraid Senator O'Brien has not kept up to date with the kinds of houses people live in now.  The standard is certainly going up.  The kind of person who lives in a house with a valuation of £30, in a great many cases now, is a worker although perhaps not exactly a manual worker.</P>
      <P>The argument that the return is so small and the desirability of encouraging ownership and the preservation of houses is so great that the Minister should at least go back to his 1961 mood and feel it is something that ought to be done if not now then in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to note that the Minister does not oppose this suggestion on the grounds of expense or on the grounds of the loss of revenue involved.  He is against it on principle.  It is correct to say, I think, that Schedule A tax as such has been abolished in respect of every sort of building except a building occupied by the owner as a private dwelling-house. If the house is let, it is chargeable under Schedule D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new section 10 here, other buildings are relieved.  It is only the man who owns a house and occupies it who has been caught under this section. The argument there is that if he puts £2,000 into a house he is deemed to be getting an income from that and that if he did not put it into the house <Col N="1192" /> but invested it in the National Loan or something else he would be getting an income from that and would be taxed on it.</P>
    <P>Suppose that, instead of putting the £2,000 into the house, he puts it into expensive jewellery for his wife.  It is stored up there and he pays no tax on it and the country does not get any benefit out of it.  Or suppose he collects antique furniture, and amasses thousands of pounds worth of furniture in his house, as some people do, he is not taxed on that.  Supposing he buys a much more expensive motor car than is necessary for his use.  He could buy a Rolls Royce or, without going into the realms of a Rolls Royce, he could buy a car costing a couple of thousand pounds, and he is not taxed on the capital tied up in it.  The country gets no benefit from the capital tied up in it.  Neither does it get any benefit from the capital tied up in jewellery or expensive furniture. Indeed, if I had time I could go on quoting examples of capital tied up in non-productive investment, shall I say, from which the State gets no benefit.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any more beneficial type of investment or saving than the provision of a private dwelling house for the owner, because it adds to the wealth of the country and relieves the national Exchequer and local finances of the necessity to provide those houses.  I think even on the test of logic a case can be made for abolishing this tax.  I know no amendment has been put down and the Minister will not do it this year, but I seriously ask him and his advisers to give the matter further consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to take Senator Fitzpatrick's argument a little further.  Supposing a man who has £2,000 does not do any of the things he suggested, but puts it in the bank on deposit and gets a rate of interest. I think he would get a rate of 1¼ per cent at the moment.  From that £2,000 he will get an income of £25 per annum, and that income will be exempt from tax.  The State will get no benefit from that income.  Surely a case under Schedule A can be made <Col N="1193" /> in exactly the same way?  I mention £2,000 because that is the figure taken by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate but as it has been suggested that there is something wrong in being excessively logical in regard to income tax I should like to say that Schedule A is a very logical form of income tax.  Assuming for the moment that the principle of income tax is admitted, the essence of taxing income is that part of the income a person enjoys should be taxed.  Income may be enjoyed in two ways, directly by enjoying the flow of income generated by wealth possessed and indirectly in a monetary form.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other point made by Senator Fitzpatrick, if the value of antiques and jewellery could be measured to the same extent as a house is valued, they should be taxed also.  Of course, they are taxed by death duties.  A Rolls Royce car pays a very heavy road tax, so it is not correct to say that it does not pay any tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather intrigued, and, frankly, I am getting a little impatient, with this argument about notional income.  It is all very well for Senator O'Brien to refer to people <Col N="1194" /> living in old houses in Dublin which are assessed below their real value, but surely the real problem is the position, not only in Dublin, but in other parts of the country, in which there are thousands of people waiting for houses. Those arguments could not apply to people who are about to get married and are waiting for houses.  We spend time and quite a lot of money in this and the other House, trying to induce people to build houses and relieve the pressure on the local authority to provide them with houses.  There is very little purpose in telling those people that in some mysterious way they are creating income by this peculiar method.</P>
      <P>I strongly put it to the Minister that this is an anachronism and that it should be removed so far as that type of housing is concerned.  It has been removed in Britain.  They are not philanthropists on that side of the Channel, and if justification exists there, it certainly exists here.  There is no case that can be made in all honesty for the retention of this tax in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to introduce logic into this argument but I must admit that a number of illogical instances have been given since.  Some of the matters which were raised could not be taxed.  If a man with £2,000 does not build a house but gives it in jewellery to his wife, I should like to tax him, if I knew how.  The case mentioned by Senator Ross of the man who puts £2,000 on deposit and has his £25 exempted from income tax is true.  That was brought in a few years ago to encourage people to put their money on deposit in the bank rather than keep it in the stocking.  It had an object at least even though it may be classed as illogical in our conception of imposing Schedule A tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know how we can deal with the question raised by Senator Crowley.  It is true that we spend a good deal of money to encourage people to build houses and then when they go in we tax them, but that applies in other ways.  We spent a good deal of money in recent years encouraging <Col N="1195" /> people to go into business, giving them subsidies and so on, and when they get on we tax them and try to get money from them afterwards.  I do not think it is anything out of the common if we do help people to get houses and then put taxation on them.</P>
    <P>Somebody said that the Government had expressed themselves in favour of this tax but not for the moment.  They did not do that.  They expressed themselves as absolutely impartial on this tax.  They said that in present circumstances they did not think it could be considered.  That is still the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before leaving this section, this is the only opportunity we have of dealing with income tax and matters of that sort because it is the section which re-imposes income tax at existing rates and under existing conditions.  I would like to repeat the appeal that I made on the Second Stage of this Bill, during the Minister's very short absence from the House, on behalf of the man on a fixed income.  I assert that this Bill as it stands is really increasing income tax because it makes no increase in the married allowance, the personal allowance or the child allowance.  I am not in a position to say how many years ago those various allowances were fixed at the present rates, but I do know that the value of money has decreased very considerably during that period.  It, therefore, follows that although it has not been stated in so many words the present Budget has increased the rate of income tax.  Last year we were told that direct taxation could bear no further increase and that the turnover tax when it was introduced would eventually lead to the abolition of direct taxation.  Now we have the same people suffering the ill effects of the turnover tax and its consequences and at the same time an increase in the rate of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I learned just now that it was in 1959 that these rates of allowances were fixed.  During that time we have introduced here two separate and distinct Bills to increase the salaries of certain categories of people because the rate of money had decreased.  I <Col N="1196" /> made that case on the Second Stage and I repeat it now.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to one other aspect of existing income taxation, and that is the proposal to tax progressive farmers under Schedule D.  I refer to the proposal to tax people who produce chickens by way of intensive farming under Schedule D.  For many years back we have been encouraging farmers to be progressive, to adopt modern methods, to equip themselves with technical knowledge, in order that we as an agricultural country may be in a position to compete with our competitors on the world market.  The old methods of farming are gone.  It is not possible any longer to produce chickens for table use in small quantities and compete with the competition inside or outside the country. Therefore, farmers now have gone into chicken rearing and chicken fattening in a big way but they are still farmers and the more intensive they are in my opinion the better farmers they are. But under the law as it is being interpreted at present I fear that a farmer who raises a few thousand chickens will be taxed under Schedule D, and this is nothing new, because I understand that a farmer who went in in the past for market gardening in a big way and produced tomatoes in very considerable quantities was regarded as being in business and not a farmer, being in some type of commercial business and liable to taxation under Schedule D.</P>
    <P>This thing is becoming very serious because the day of fattening a few pigs on the farm&mdash;four or five or even ten pigs&mdash;is out of the question.  If a person now is to be in the business at all he must produce or fatten pigs by the hundred.  If he does that, according to the interpretation of our income tax code he will be regarded not as a farmer liable to be taxed under Schedule B but as some sort of industrialist liable to be taxed under Schedule D.  That is not moving with the times.  That is not recognising the fact that old ways of farming are gone and that if a farmer is to be successful as an individual farmer he must adopt progressive methods, going in for intensive production, and if we are <Col N="1197" /> to be successful as an agricultural country all the farmers should be encouraged to go in for that type of farming so that we as an agricultural nation will be able to hold our own with our competitors on the world markets.</P>
    <P>I may be accused of advocating the abolition of this type of taxation of farmers and not giving any alternative, but with respect I say that it is for the Minister to produce that.  I also say that, when the Minister introduced the turnover tax last year, he told us it would be the end of this sort of thing. I would seriously appeal to the Minister to take steps to ensure that progressive farmers will not be taxed.  If the Minister's reply to me is that his interpretation of the law is that a farmer rearing chickens or producing pigs on the land is not subject to taxation under Schedule D, then I would be satisfied with an assurance from him that if his interpretation be held to be wrong and if the people in a position to do so hold that under the law as it stands the farmers will be taxed in a manner that is not fair he will take immediate steps to rectify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in this section I would like to raise and that is the cost of collecting income tax and surtax which lies very heavily, particularly from PAYE incomes, on business firms.  A large amount of extra work has to be done and very large extra staff has to be taken on to deal with the collection and supply the Government with the collection of the tax.  This is surely something that should be borne by the Government. Collecting taxes is surely a Government charge.  I think that the Chamber of Commerce put forward a suggestion that some form of discount would be allowed to the firms concerned on sums collected in that way. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest that the time has come to change drastically the basis of levying income tax on agricultural land and to have regard to the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission in that respect.  The present idea of <Col N="1198" /> basing it on valuation and taking it that the income is only something like twice the valuation is totally unrealistic and underestimates the income.  I suggest this should be brought into line with the actual income position which would mean multiplying it by three or four.  Allied to that there should be a positive use for this new increased estimate of earnings by bringing home to the agricultural community the position of the family in that there would be so many deductions for a wife and children which would help the family farmer and penalise the bachelor gallant of whom we have so many in agriculture today. At the same time, any realistic system of assessment would make allowance for the labour provided on the farm. That would be another positive instrument in shaping our agricultural policy for the future.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, we want to reward the farmer who is doing intensive work and fulfilling a patriotic function in developing his land to the fullest and giving as much employment as possible. By all means reward such a man but penalise the man who is largely back to the dog and stick type of farming.  Income tax could be used positively in that regard.  The Government have been tinkering with the rating system on agricultural land for the past four or five years and they have been compelled to give reliefs. That also is a positive step but the time has come to marry such steps to income tax which should be based on what the land is capable of producing and giving liberal reliefs which would be used to the fullest to ensure that the farmer is encouraged to produce the maximum.  If he is not producing the maximum, or producing above average, he should not be allowed to substitute just any record of actual results from the land.  The taxation levied on the land should be based on what that land is capable of producing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could take a headline from what was done in Australia some years ago where such a system was introduced, coupled with practical reliefs to encourage good farming.  I hope that the Minister in looking to <Col N="1199" /> the year ahead and the practical application of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will seize on this scheme as a means of ensuring that our agricultural targets will be reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one other point I should like to mention and that is in regard to the reliefs given to encourage exports.  In view of the fact that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> points out that 90 per cent of the growth is expected from the export of our industrial goods, the Government introduced these reliefs in respect of increased exports over a standard year.  I feel that this rather penalises people who already had been engaged in the export trade and seems to relieve those who are new to the export trade.  It seems rather unfair to people who have always been exporting goods that they should not receive any relief. I suggest that these reliefs should be granted to all exports regardless of any standard year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Senator Fitzpatrick's point about allowances he is right in saying that it is some years since they were fixed.  They were raised at the time PAYE was brought in.  Various changes were made at the time; the earned income allowance was raised, the personal allowance was raised, and a change was made at the lower end, there was no reduction for the first £100 or the second £100, as there had been.  On the whole, there was in the aggregate an extra relief for everyone in the way it was done.  Here we are dealing with very big money and it is not like in Schedule A.  I was very keen on doing something in this direction and as a matter of fact in the last two or three Budgets I asked what it would cost to give better personal allowances but it was very costly and we could not do anything worthwhile unless we raised the standard rate to make up for it.  If we did that then it would not make a lot of difference.  Let us take an example.  Suppose we raised the marriage allowance, then by raising the <Col N="1200" /> standard rate to pay for it it would mean that single people would pay a little more and married people a little less.  I did not think it was feasible to take a step of that kind but it is something that I have in mind.  If it is ever possible, and Budgetary considerations allowed it, I would feel inclined to do something for the personal allowance.</P>
      <P>This chicken business is purely a legal matter.  We have not made any change and it is the law as it stands. The Revenue Commissioners were interpreting the law as it stands and the real issue here is whether the profits arising from this business arise from the occupation of land.  That is the whole question.  Where a person is assessed under Schedule D he can appeal to the Special Commissioners and I understand there are appeals waiting to be heard by the Special Commissioners.  I cannot do anything about that because I cannot interfere with the Revenue Commissioners in their administration of the law.  They feel they should collect under Schedule D in certain cases and if they feel that is the legal position they must go ahead.</P>
      <P>The Special Commissioners may have a different view and, of course, the Revenue Commissioners will then have to change their view or they may not.  Of course, when that is over it will be a question of whether the law should be changed or not.  I would be very slow to change the law.  As we all know, chicken rearing in an intensive way could be done in the middle of Dublin city quite easily and done by people knowing nothing whatever about land.  Again, if we want to be logical and say that it is farming and should be exempt then if a farmer started a boot factory he should be exempt from the profits on that business also.  That is going a long way, I admit, but it would follow legally, I am afraid, if they were permitted to escape income tax on profits under Schedule D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick said&mdash;and I am sure I did not say it when I brought in the turnover tax&mdash;that the turnover tax would give the Government an <Col N="1201" /> opportunity of reducing income tax.  I saw plainly at the time that there was no opportunity of doing that.  Whatever proceeds we got from the turnover tax would be required to balance the Budget and there was no hope of reducing income tax.  As time goes on, things may be better and it may be possible to give some relief on the income tax side.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire raised the question of the cost of collecting PAYE by businessmen generally.  When we were bringing in PAYE, naturally we examined how this scheme was working in England.  One of the things those in charge in England told us was that businessmen of their own volition preferred that they would not be recompensed for paying this money.  They had a feeling if they accepted payment for doing it they would be under the control of the Revenue Commissioners in England.  It was one of the things that strengthened us here in our opinion that we could not offer any help to firms for collecting this tax. Personally, I must say I have not heard any complaint recently.  In the beginning we were afraid it would be costly and I am sure it takes a lot of time.  In a big firm where there are many people employed the amount, comparatively speaking, spent on staff for this purpose would be small.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to another point in the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation where the basis of the assessment of income tax on land was discussed.  Arising out of that, the Senator thought it should be assessed on a more realistic basis.  As far as I know, the Commissioners say twice the valuation is not realistic and that six times the valuation should be taken.  The Senator said we should allow for children and also allow for labour.  These would be allowed for anyway under the income tax code.</P>
    <P>An interesting point made by the Senator was that it should be based on the value of the land, in respect of its capability of producing, and not what it actually produced.  Is that not actually the basis on which rates are levied?  They are levied on the poor law valuation and there is no regard <Col N="1202" /> to the production of the farmer in having to pay his rates.  It is based on the value of the land and the system is working.  The point made by the Senator is an interesting one and I should like to hear more about it.  I do not know whether there would be any change in the collection of rates.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire also spoke in regard to the relief afforded to encourage exports.  He spoke of two categories.  When this was brought in first it applied only as an encouragement to exports.  Looking at it from that point of view, there would be no point in applying it to existing exports.  That was the point of view at the time, before I became Minister for Finance, and it was decided to give it to all firms on their increased exports.  When I became Minister for Finance I agreed with that.  On the other hand, there was a certain grievance that we afforded a small concession in the case of existing exports.  That was given more or less to get over a grievance and was a bit out of line with the reason lying behind this scheme of giving relief from income tax on profits from exports.  The Senator is aware, I am sure, that the 25 per cent relief on existing exports is now coming to a close but in last year's Budget, I extended it by reducing the amount each year over a five-year period until it fades out.  That is all we can do at the moment in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke about incentives for exports I had the intention of mentioning the distributive trade.  In the retail trade quite a lot of money is spent in advertising exports to America.  In addition, the retail trade has the 2½ per cent turnover tax on any goods sold for export. The trade itself raised this point. Could anything be done in regard to this matter?  Would it be administratively possible and how?  If it could be considered I know the trade would be willing to put forward propositions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point which may be relevant to either section 2 or section 3.  Section 2 is intended, as is section 3, to improve the position of people who are living on unearned income and are not entitled to what is called the earned income allowance.  However, there is the position of the widow with young children who is living on unearned income.  Her husband dies and she is left with young children.  If she has been left an insurance policy and other moneys and invests them the return on the investment is unearned income and she does not qualify for unearned income at all. As a matter of fact, that presses very harshly on that particular kind of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the whole notion of the difference between earned and unearned income is a little out of date.  When money was stable and not falling in value the <i>rentier</i>, the man living on investments, was a person to be envied. The situation today is very different.  Earned income is apt to keep pace with rises in prices.  Take the case of a widow with money invested, endeavouring to rear young children; <Col N="1204" /> she is not an expert on the stock exchange; she is nervous and anxious for the security of her income and invests it in, perhaps, State securities; she finds her income steady but her costs rising.  It seems to me that the Minister, having adopted this particular principle in sections 2 and 3, might very well extend it to cases of the kind I have mentioned, fixing of course, some limit because, after a certain figure, one would not have the same sympathy.  Within certain ranges of income, however, it would be very desirable to take some action of the kind I suggest.  I am not sufficiently skilled to put down an amendment. Anyhow I know from experience that one must persuade the Minister for Finance.  It is very difficult to coerce him.  I am endeavouring now to persuade him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the person over 65 and section 3 with the person under 65.  The principle is the same in both cases though it varies in application.  Those dealt with under section 2 have been getting benefit for a long time.  They get relief on the first £600.  They are fairly well done for now, I think, because even if they have an earned income&mdash;they might have a pension of £1,000&mdash;they get the benefit from both.  We have never done anything for the people under 65.  I got several letters about this prior to the Budget.  Indeed, I think these were the people who made the strongest appeal to me before the Budget.  They pointed out what we were doing for all the other classes while we were doing nothing for them.  I thought we might do something for widows, but then it was pointed out to me that there were others who had just as good a claim. Take, for instance, the very common case of a daughter who remains with a father or mother until he or she dies.</P>

The widow with three children gets quite a good allowance because she has £259 <Col N="1205" /> for herself and £120 for each child. She gets fairly substantial relief now we apply the principle to all.  Those who have an income from investments and who are under 65 get relief on the first £450.  This is a start.  We are moving in uncharted seas.  We do not know what this will cost and we want to find out before we are too generous. After a year or two we shall know how we stand and we may be able to do a little better.</P>

If they have anything less than £450, or up to £450, they get the full relief, as if it were earned income, but, as it goes up, the relief begins to fall back.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Revenue would lose much if it went the whole hog and permitted a ground landlord to be paid his ground rent without deduction of tax. There are very many very small landlords in the country, elderly people who are collecting a few ground rents and are living on them, maybe, and <Col N="1208" /> they are not liable to income tax at all because their income would be only maybe a few hundred pounds a year. Those people are put to the expense, trouble and annoyance of applying for a refund of tax.</P>
      <P>I knew of one case in the country where a widow had three or four houses.  The tenants used to pay her the ground rent without deduction of income tax.  However, she got one smart tenant and he insisted on his rights and deducted the income tax. The other tenants followed suit.  Each year, now, she has to apply to the Revenue Commissioners to refund the tax.  Would it be any great inconvenience to the Revenue Commissioners or would the Exchequer suffer any loss if they did not insist on ground rents being paid on the deduction of tax.</P>

Take for example, 20 tenants in a row, most of whom are not paying any income tax at all.  If one says: &ldquo;We had better pay it in full and the landlord will pay his tax&rdquo; usually, I think the people agree.  That is all right as far as we are concerned.

      <P>This section increases the excise duty on beer.  Last year, the Minister told us that the tax on beer had reached saturation point, that any further tax would bring the tax to the point of diminishing returns <Col N="1209" /> and that it would not be worth while imposing a tax.  I think I am not being unfair to the Minister when I say that his case for the turnover tax was largely based on that proposition. I think he did make the case time and time again that the old traditional taxes, the old chestnuts of beer, tobacco and cigarettes, had ceased to bring him in the revenue he wanted. He put through the turnover tax on that argument.  Now we have a tax on beer again.  I object to that on principle and I object to it on the grounds that the Minister argued last year that such taxes certainly would not be increased.  I might even say he led us to believe that they would be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say can actually refer to some of the remaining sections.  I shall say it now and be finished and not rise again.  The increases in taxation which are provided for in this and some of the other sections I have referred to bear little or no relation, I think everybody will agree, to the actual increase in prices for beer, spirits, tobacco and, for that matter, for hydrocarbon oils.  These rates of taxation apply uniformly to all the citizens regardless of whether they live in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>There is a tremendous variation at the moment in the prices even of beer and spirits.  Just let me take a case in point.  During the past week, I had actual experience that the prices, for example, of a glass of whiskey can vary from 6d. to 1/- or even more between, say, two houses in Dublin or Cork.  One will experience the same kind of variation in the price of a pint of stout, not necessarily of different brands, in either Dublin or Cork.  I refer to that because I think it must be said and should be said here that these are classic examples of nothing less than unbridled profiteering.  We know that it is going on.  I do not think there is any point in our ignoring the fact that excessive profits are being extracted from many different lines of commodities at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to put to the Minister on the remaining sections is that he and the Government have a serious <Col N="1210" /> responsibility to the country in the matter of profits.  I think allowance for an increase was actually made in the national agreement on wages and salaries between the employers and trade unions earlier this year.  Any increase contemplated in that agreement has, I think, substantially been exceeded in most lines of commodities alluded to.  Very serious concern has already been expressed by the Trade Union Congress about the fact.</P>
    <P>As I see it, therefore, and as I see the situation generally building up, it appears to me that the Minister is already warned that if there is further deterioration in that position and if some attempt is not made to have some reasonable control of prices effected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Government have a responsibility to the people in this respect.  If, as a result of these increases, we are now to witness a collapse of the national agreement on wages and salaries, I am afraid the Minister and the Government will have to accept responsibility for that failure. I would urge him, even at this late stage, to have something effective done about it.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give me any information as to why it is that although the duty on Irish brewed beer is lower than the duty on imported beers, a notable beer manufactured not far from O'Connell Bridge by the people who make that excellent drink sometimes costs more but, on the average, the very same as beer brought from Canada, Sweden and Germany?  There must be some reason for it.  I wonder has the Minister any idea of what is behind the extraordinary situation in which beers can be brought from all parts of the world and charged for at the same price as beer produced in Ireland.  I should imagine that with lower tax, and lower excise duty, Irish beers could be sold for 3d, or 4d, or 5d less.</P>
      <P>As Senator Crowley has said, the discrepancy in prices of Irish spirits and beers in hotels and bars is amazing when compared with the price of beers and spirits brought in from abroad.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some indication of what is behind it.  Is it a conspiracy on the part of anyone to push foreign drinks in preference to Irish drinks, or is it just plain stupidity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware, the duty on imported beer is the same as the excise on home-made beer, so there is absolutely equal opportunity, if you like, for the two.  There may be different costs for importing, but that is a matter for the manufacturers.  I do not know very much about the comparative prices of home and foreign beers and if there is a difference I do not know what the explanation is. With regard to beer sold in Dublin, the duty we have put on beer is not the sole cause of the increase in prices, because over the past ten years the pint of stout in a Dublin public-house has gone up from 1/3d to 2/1d, an increase of 10d, while the duty has gone up by 2.68d.  The Exchequer has taken less than 3d, and the remainder went somewhere else.  That is a point which we must keep in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The point raised by Senator Fitzpatrick was made before.  I think the Taoiseach and I both made the same point last year when the turnover tax was being introduced, that the traditional taxes had become unreliable so far as revenue was concerned.  I have the table here with regard to the consumption of beer, and I think it would prove to any Senator that last year we had reached danger point.  About ten years ago a fairly substantial duty was put on beer and there was a reduction in consumption for about four years.  The lowest point in consumption was reached in 1958-59, and then it began to go up.  It went up regularly until 1961-62, and then there was a fairly substantial drop in consumption.</P>
    <P>I have had this examined from the point of view of revenue&mdash;not temperance; that is not my business&mdash;and I found that if you put a duty on two years in succession you kill consumption and, therefore, you get nothing out of it.  Senator Crowley made the point that the turnover tax actually put on an increase.  So it did.  It was a small increase, if you like, and it would not influence consumption very much.  I do not know how this year will work out, but the first quarter shows that there has not been a big decrease in consumption and, therefore, we were right in concluding that we could increase the duty to get an increase in revenue.  An increase in revenue was the important point so far as I was concerned.  I do not think there is anything inconsistent in saying in a particular year that the traditional sources are not available.  It may be the same this year, but I am fairly confident that we will get the increase we budgeted for this year.</P>

I still hear complaints that the standard of performance of our Irish petrol is not as high as the performance of petrol in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  We have tests for spirits; and we have tests for food. Why should we not have official tests and checks of the standard of our petrol?  That would be highly desirable, especially as the price is now so high, and the duty so considerable.  The Government have a genuine responsibility in this matter to see that the quality of our petrol is maintained.  I know there are certain difficulties in having these tests.  I understand there is no apparatus in the country at the moment for testing petrol, but, if necessary, specimens should be sent outside the country to where they can be tested.  A certain amount of public perturbation would be relieved if the Minister gave an undertaking that from time to time he would have spot-tests for Irish petrol.</P>

      <P>Apropos this section, and in view of the fact that several times recently rising prices have been attributed to rising profits, I should <Col N="1214" /> like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is one tax which is a cause of rising prices, because it is a tax on road transport.  It can be quite a factor in price costs. I was interested in seeing that the Minister, when questioned on the matter in the Dáil, said that it applies only to road transport on an exclusive basis.  Does that mean that the road transport of CIE have to pay this tax and only their passenger buses are excluded?</P>

      <P>I have just a small point on this section, which imposes a duty or tax on firearms.  A Bill introduced here last year for the first time controlled airguns and air pistols.  Its object was to control those weapons and ensure that they would not get into the hands of very young people, in whose hands they would constitute a danger to others.  A tax of a £1 on an airgun is a bit high.  It is really going outside the realm of control.  A tax of 5/- or 10/- at the very most on an airgun or an air pistol, which is really in the nature of a dangerous toy and nothing more, would be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that I might not be in order in discussing death duties in general on this section. A case was made in the Dáil for the imposition of death duties on a basis similar to income tax, in other words, that where a married man died leaving a widow and several young children his estate would not be liable for the same amount of estate duty as a man who left no dependants.  I must say that that argument appealed to me as being perfectly reasonable.  I know that where a man leaves a big estate and has dependants there is relief from legacy duty and succession duty and that only when the estate exceeds £15,000 does the widow or family become liable for legacy or succession duty and then only at 1 per cent.  If a man leaving an estate of £10,000 dies and has not a relative in the world that estate is subject to estate duty at the rate of 8 per cent. If a married man leaves a widow and four or five children his estate is subject to duty at the very same rate without any deduction whatsoever. That follows a very long established and old pattern going back to the introduction of estate duty.  This is the age of new and fresh thinking, and the case made by Deputy Paddy Byrne in the Dáil was a very sound one.  To go back to the man leaving £10,000 estate and a widow and four children, I think a certain allowance should be made for the widow and each child under sixteen years of age.  If for the <Col N="1216" /> purposes of argument we take the figure of £1,000 for each of them, then the estate would only be liable to duty at the rate of 8 per cent on £5,000. On the other hand, if the bachelor died with no dependants the State would collect death duties on the full £10,000.  I trust that I have made my proposition reasonably clear.  It is certainly a thing that should be considered when future Finance Acts are being drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  It is one that must commend itself to the Minister and probably one he may be able to effect in the coming Budget.  I want to go a little further in that I have had personal experience over the past two years.  Some of our staff members died rather suddenly leaving wives and children, rather young children, behind them.  We have provision for a widow's insurance to which members of the faculty contribute.  In arriving at the amount of the estate for death duties this sum was actually capitalised and was added to the estate which was subject to the increase of taxation from it.  This is a very inhuman procedure. It may be strict logic in computing what the man's estate is but it is very inhuman.  Probably the best way to get around it might be in the nature of allowances as suggested by Senator Fitzpatrick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, those assessing death duties have sometimes been lacking in humanity in their approach to the widows in so far as they very often descend on the homes of those people, who become subjected to an almost third degree type of investigation of what is the property and the valuation of books and so on.  I think that we should not come to the widow and family in that way a month or so after a sudden death.  There should be some element of humanity that would accept a notional figure from those concerned rather than go in and start checking books one by one, spending days in the house concerned, as though they were almost suggesting that the widow was guilty of some type of concealment. There is a case here for the <Col N="1217" /> exercise of commonsense and above all of a little Christian charity to the families where the heads are removed suddenly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned this matter on the Second Reading debate and I should like to mention it again because it is a matter on which I feel very strongly, that one weakness there is in the whole system of public finance here is the system of death duties and the way in which they are operated here compared with the corresponding rates in England.  We have retained legacy and succession duties which have been abolished entirely in England and we have three rates of death duties&mdash;estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty&mdash;and in England there is only one, estate duty.</P>
      <P>The actual yield from death duties is not very great in relation to the whole Budget.  Everybody knows that to a very large extent death duties can be evaded quite legally and within the four walls of the law by making intelligent settlements, and by gifts given within a certain period before the person's death.  It has almost reached the point where it is only a foolish man whose estate pays much death duties, the ways of getting out are so great.  At the same time, the fact that taxes are taken out of accumulated capital has a very adverse effect on saving and on enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussion on Schedule A today we were told about the great importance of encouraging people to save and to build houses for themselves, but death duties strike at the root of all accumulation of capital.  A man may work all his life, he may scrape together a sum of money as a result of great hardship, and his earning capacity comes to an end with his death, and the State comes in and takes a very considerable proportion of that accumulated capital if the man has not already done something, quite legally, to evade it.  The point I want to make is, I may be wrong, that I believe if death duties were either reduced considerably, or if possible abolished, there would be an inward movement of rich people, that the <Col N="1218" /> attractions of living in a country where there was not this recurrent capital duty would bring in people who would be a source of income to the Exchequer in other directions and the amount they would pay in income tax or sur-tax would contribute to the Exchequer revenue.  The presence of such class of people is very desirable from the financial point of view.  I do not wish to delay the Seanad but I would ask the Minister seriously to consider whether the whole death duty system is not inappropriate to our conditions at present.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick made a point that we should regulate our death duties so that there would be more favour shown to the widows and children than to the people who died without near relatives.  That is done in the succession duties.  If a man leaves all his estate to his wife and children only one per cent is charged after £15,000.  If he left it to a nephew or niece or to a brother or sister it would be 5 per cent and to anybody beyond that it would be 10 per cent, so that it is graded to give the greater benefit to widows and children.  Senator Quinlan said that he thought the methods used in investigations were somewhat inhuman. I must say I have not heard that before but naturally I shall keep that in mind.  I have come across a fair number of people in recent years who asked me questions about the estate of some relatives and I never heard a complaint that the people were treated inhumanly by the officials. In fact, some of them went to great pains to tell me how kind and considerate the officials had been to them. I hope that was true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Brien points out, a person can avoid the payment of estate duty by making over his property at least three years before he dies.  Of course, if he does that it probably has a good social effect.  It is no harm to have that inducement to people who are getting old to get rid of some of their goods and give an opportunity to younger people to make use of that money in development or some other way.  I was convinced by the argument put forward <Col N="1219" /> by Senator O'Brien some years ago that we could induce people to come in if death duties were lower.  We made considerable reductions at the top some years ago and the highest death duties here is 40 per cent while it is more than 78 per cent in England.  I do not know what effect it had and we will not know for some years, but it must always be remembered that it is not enough for the person to come, he must bring his assets here before his death otherwise they will not be treated for taxation.  That is the difficulty. In some cases a person with large assets might find it difficult first of all to realise them and secondly to find suitable investments here.  However, we are trying that out, the experiment of trying to induce people to come here, and I hope we will be successful.</P>

      <P>I raised this point of Senator Fitzpatrick's on two occasions before with the Minister, the position of the widow and children of a youngish man who dies and leaves an estate.  May I say that it is quite irrelevant to point out that if the man had left his property to his nephew he would be worse off than the children.  Surely if a man under 40, who has a wife and three or four children, dies, his property will always go to the widow and children and they are subjected to estate duty.  It is feasible to enshrine in the estate duty code what is in the ordinary income tax code, namely, that a man with a wife and children pays less income tax than a man with no wife or children. That could be brought suitably into the estate duty code so that when there is a widow with children they would pay less death duty than other people or than perhaps a widow with no children.  The Minister is very pleasant to deal with but when he said that if a man's money were left to his nephew there would be more duty paid than if it were left to his children it does not really cut any ice.</P>

      <P>While the figure for CPT in respect of directors' salaries has been extended from £1,500 to £2,500 and is very welcome, it is still felt that the Minister might have gone the whole hog and made it £3,000.  It is generally accepted nowadays that £3,000 is a figure which should be paid to a senior executive in industry and it seems wrong that just for the sake of an extra £500 a company should be penalised.  It is only a small point but it is felt that in a matter like this&mdash;it could not cost the State very much&mdash;and in the present state of development of our industrial wing, anything that can be done in this direction to encourage top management and encourage the proper remuneration of people without throwing back an extra charge on the company, should be done.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is convenient for me, and I am sure the Senators will forgive me, to take this Bill and deal with Deputies first.  I want to go back to the time the State was first established.  At that time Deputies were allowed a sum which was regarded as an expense allowance and there was no question of income tax being charged on it.  They carried on with increases on two occasions until 1960.  In 1960 it was decided that we should pay Deputies for their time as well as for their expenses.  The allowance was then fixed at £1,000.  That allowance was regarded as subject to income tax.  Deputies were allowed expenses as arranged with the Revenue Commissioners and paid income tax on the remainder of the salary at that time.  This £1,500 now put into the Bill will be subject to the same conditions.  I should like to stress the point in regard to income tax because there is a belief among certain members of the community outside that Deputies do not pay income tax and neither do Ministers but we have learned it the hard way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy, of course, is not precluded from engaging in other remunerative occupations.  Part time at least, a Deputy may pursue another occupation. There is nothing illegal in it and there is no professional etiquette against it but there are limits to his freedom.  If he has to be in the Dáil for the greater part of the year, for two or three days a week, it is not <Col N="1222" /> easy to find an employer who will give a man a job if he says he will work two days and he will be away three days.  In practice, it is hard to get a job to do.  That applies in particular to a man who is looking for employment with an employer.  We know, of course, too, that professional men find it hard to pursue their profession fully if they are members of the Dáil or Seanad.  Whether they are legal men or professional men they cannot expect, indeed, to be as successful as if they were all the time able to look after their business.  The same applies to a businessman, or even to a farmer. If they are not there all the time their affairs are neglected.</P>
    <P>As well as that, we must keep in mind the fact that the country requires the best possible material for both Houses.  We should encourage men of ability to come into Parliament.  The primary duty of a member is, of course, legislation and legislation is a very specialised job and requires a person not only of a fair education but a man of judgment as well to be a good legislator.  We are all equal as far as that is concerned in both Houses. As I mentioned in the Dáil, a lot of people outside say that the ordinary Deputy or Senator does not count and that he is just a cipher in a party. They forget that in a democracy the Party develops and it is agreed that the Party system is a good one for the sake of getting things done.  The Party member has an opportunity of making himself felt and he does.  We all know that there are members who make themselves heard at party meetings and they seldom speak in the Seanad or the Dáil afterwards.  It is there the man of ability and judgment is required.</P>
    <P>As well as that, I pointed out in the Dáil that the duties of a Deputy and a Senator to legislate are increasing outside the House.  That, of course, is due in great measure to the great number of Acts passed which provide certain benefits for people, whether they deal with houses, pensions or widows and orphans or whatever it may be. Sometimes they may concern schemes which are too complex and too difficult for the ordinary person to follow. <Col N="1223" /> The ordinary person must be satisfied that he understands things fully and that he is getting the benefits to be got from any particular scheme.  That means that a great number of people come to the Deputy or the Senator for help so that they will get the benefits to which they may be entitled.  It leads to a great deal of work because it means the member of either House must either visit or write the Department to get all the particulars.  Then, if he gets a reply, either by calling or by letter he must write back to his client and explain all those matters.  That means a great deal of correspondence and all these things are attended to. Some critics of this system felt we should try to abolish it.  Suggestions were made but the suggestions have not been followed up and, for the present anyway, Deputies and Senators must continue to fill the void.  I think we must admit that Senators and Deputies are kept very busy both in the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>On this point it was suggested in the Dáil that there are some Deputies&mdash; and no doubt some Senators&mdash;who do more than they need to.  They, as it were, attract work to themselves by spreading the word around, if you like: &ldquo;If you come to me I will do things for you that no one else will do,&rdquo; and so on.  That may be, but I think there are many Deputies and very many Senators who do not try to attract work but simply get it.  My own experience, as a Minister, getting letters from Deputies and Senators, is that they all get a certain amount of work to do but some get a bit more than others.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of work to be done and we have come to the conclusion that a Deputy's job is a full-time job.  It is at least full-time to the extent that he cannot get time to do any other job.  In fixing his allowance, therefore, we had to do it on the basis that he is living on that income.  He may have other income.  If he has, of course, we say &ldquo;Good luck to him,&rdquo; but, if he has not, we must provide for him and that means we have to fix the amount at a level that a person can live on and carry out his duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> The last time allowances were fixed they were fixed at £1,000 for Deputies and £750 for Senators.  Even at that time I think many people thought we had not fixed the allowances at a reasonable level and that they should have been higher.  Since then there have been the eighth and ninth rounds in the Public Service with, in most cases, a status increase as well.  There are certain people in the Public Service who have got more than 50 per cent&mdash; I do not say many&mdash;during those three or four years.  A good many have got more than 40 per cent.  We are not departing very far from what has taken place in the Public Service generally in fixing the allowances for Senators and Deputies.  I also made inquiries from some European Parliaments.  I got replies from about seven or eight. I found that the £1,500, which is being fixed now for Deputies, is the lowest allowance, except for Stormont, which is a bit lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting out of erring on the side of being too low and also on the side of being too high as compared with other countries.  We always have to bear in mind&mdash;I am sure every Deputy and Senator does&mdash; that we have the power to fix our own remuneration and we fix it, of course, at the taxpayers' expense.  We have, therefore, to be careful, but I think no one can accuse us of having been in any way extravagant in the past in looking after ourselves and I do not think we can be accused of being extravagant on this occasion either.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil, when I had finished speaking about Deputies, I dealt with Senators.  I think I might use the same words here.  I said I thought that by fixing Senators at £1,000 as against £750 the proportion, now reduced to two-thirds, comes closer to a realistic appraisal of their respective duties. I thought that, taking the duties of the Senator both in attending the Seanad and outside, a proportion of two-thirds of the time Deputies gave would be a fair appraisal of the position. I trust Senators will agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> As Senators are aware we have fixed an increase of 10 per cent for the Taoiseach, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, for the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of both Houses, and for the Attorney General.  If one takes Ministers&mdash;the argument applies equally to all the other Parliamentary officers I have mentioned&mdash;the amount the Deputy is getting would apply also to a Minister and the 50 per cent increase on that amount will also apply.  On the part of the salary, which is Ministerial, he gets 10 per cent. The average increase a Minister will get is, therefore, 23½ per cent. It is a bit lower in some cases, namely, in the case of Parliamentary Secretaries and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The only other sum mentioned is the amount paid to Leaders of Opposition Parties for secretarial expenses. The increase there is 12 per cent. That appears to me to be the proper percentage because the money is used for secretarial assistance and, therefore, the general 12 per cent increase would apply.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with travelling expenses.  The changes made there are to a great extent for administrative convenience.  A great many anomalies developed over the years as a result of amendments, and so on, and I was anxious to get back to some simple scheme for calculating travelling expenses.  We have achieved that, I think, by the few amendments we have put in.  There is only one point at which there will be an increase on the Exchequer.  Leinster House is now named as the focal point rather than Dublin.  Dublin appears in the original Acts as the focal point.  That meant that a person living in Dublin, no matter how far away he was from Leinster House, could not claim expenses because he was at the focal point.  In future he will be able to claim expenses to the Dáil or Seanad. To that extent there will be a charge, a trivial charge, on the Exchequer. The full cost this year will be £92,000 because April and May do not come into calculation and the Exchequer, therefore, will escape.  I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Col N="1226" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for increases in the remuneration of Ministers, Deputies and Senators.  In view of the increasing cost it seems to me we might consider at this stage a number of general questions.  We might ask ourselves whether our parliamentary machinery and our Civil Service machinery are the best, the most economical, or the most efficient.  We are overhauling industry and endeavouring to modernise our agriculture, but the parliamentary machinery we are using today to do modern tasks is both old-fashioned and out of date.  It is doing a job&mdash;it is called upon to do a variety of jobs&mdash;never thought of when the parliamentary rules were made and the machinery developed.</P>
      <P>The procedure of the Oireachtas and the functions of Deputies and Senators need to be examined if the Oireachtas is to face the tasks which are now imposed upon it.  We would need to do some hard thinking also&mdash; I realise this is a little irrelevant but it does concern Ministers and Deputies &mdash;about our Civil Service, about its higher grades, the method of recruitment and the qualifications.  We have a good Parliament and a good Civil Service.  We have every reason to be proud of the way in which this Parliament has developed when we contrast it with other Parliaments.  It is interesting to note that it works in a democratic manner and that it has survived.  It is, I think, the only one of the new Parliaments formed after the Great War of 1914-18 which has so survived.  Ministers' salaries are not too high.  I agree entirely with the Minister for Finance when he says there has been no extravagance with regard to Ministers' salaries.  Ministers should certainly get an increase although I think there is a case for investigating whether the overall cost of Ministers is not too great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputies, the theory used to be that they were paid a tax free allowance to enable them to do part-time work in the Dáil.  Now they are getting a salary subject to tax. There is no doubt that the work is becoming more and more arduous. The Minister has described it as part-time, but we have to make up our <Col N="1227" /> minds whether the job of being a Deputy in Dáil Éireann is a full or a part-time job.  We also have to make up our minds as to whether the kind of work they do is parliamentary work and as to whether a good deal of it is worth doing at all.</P>
    <P>Deputies, and to some extent Senators, are messengers and correspondents for their constituents.  We should ask ourselves whether that is the right kind of work for them to be doing.  The Minister said in the Dáil &mdash;he repeated here to-day&mdash;that the primary duty of a Deputy is legislation. I think a great number of Deputies do not try to do that at all, and neither do Senators, but I shall come to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the kind of work being done now by Deputies for constituents could not be abolished&mdash; at any rate in a great part&mdash;and whether we could not devise another scheme for enabling people to get their rights from Government Departments and from State bodies.  The question at issue, when a Deputy or a Senator corresponds with a Department, is very often whether the person concerned is entitled to something.  It is a very wearing and difficult occupation because everybody who puts up a case to a Deputy puts up the case from his own point of view.  It is not so much that he tells lies as that he puts his own case, and the parts of the facts that concern his own case and omits the other part and the result is considerable work.  I think we should get a scheme which would leave Deputies and Senators free to do the work which is properly theirs.</P>
    <P>As far as the Seanad is concerned, it seems to me that so long as Seanad Éireann remains as it is at present, can get no more work to do than it is doing at present, there is no justification whatever for increasing the allowance. The truth is that Senators do not earn the money they get.  The fault is not theirs.  We have often asked here, I have often asked here myself, and I have been supported from the other side of the House, that the Seanad should be given more work to do.  I am quite confident that it would <Col N="1228" /> be possible to arrange for that.  I am confident, with regard to the Dáil programme, that with the co-operation of the present Opposition in the Dáil, or, indeed, of any Opposition, agreement could be got for a plan to give more work to the Seanad.  If it could be given more work to do, the whole programme of the Oireachtas could be carried through with less pressure and with a great deal more efficiency.</P>
    <P>I do not agree, whatever about the Dáil, that Senators should be full-time politicians.  I do not think that constant work for a political Party from year's end to year's end should be done for the reward of a Seanad salary.  Perhaps, I should put it the other way around and say that I do not agree that the Seanad salary should be used to hire a full-time organiser for a political Party.</P>
    <P>If we consider the details of this matter, the theory as contrasted with the practice, the theory of parliament is that Parliament controls the Executive. Anybody who has been some time in the Oireachtas knows that that is not so.  The functions of the State have immensely increased and the powers of Ministers and civil servants have immensely increased.  The functions which Ministers, civil servants, Deputies and Senators have to carry out have increased in number and variety.  The theory is that the Minister is a layman who gets expert advice, comes to certain conclusions and brings these conclusions to Parliament which discusses them.  Another word for democratic parliament and Government is government by discussion.</P>
    <P>For myself, I must say that I doubt whether there are Deputies or Senators or, if I might be allowed to say so, civil servants or Ministers who have any special skill to decide the kind of thing we have been asked to decide. Should we spend a considerable amount of money on making nitrogenous fertilisers?  I can pronounce the word but I do not know anything about it beyond being able to pronounce it.  If we are to spend the money, where should we site the factory? That is very difficult to decide. The same thing applies to copper <Col N="1229" /> mines, ship-building and to a great variety of examples which Senators can recall for themselves.</P>
    <P>We should consider whether the Civil Service, in its method of recruitment and promotion, and so on, is capable of doing the difficult and complex duties that now devolve upon it. The Minister for Finance himself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for example, and, above all, the Taoiseach in any particular Government, have multifarious and extremely pressing duties.</P>
    <P>It is not always adverted to when people are talking about Ministers' salaries that they have to include administration in their office, legislation in the Oireachtas, and politics. There is no use saying that Ministers ought not to be in politics.  A Minister would not be a Minister at all if he could not get into the Dáil and he must, therefore, give a certain amount of his time to politics.</P>
    <P>No Government is good all over.  I suppose no team of any kind is good all over, but the active Minister most certainly earns his salary and, I think, deserves more.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputies, the original payments were called allowances. I wonder if this Bill is completely Constitutional.  I am not worrying much about the point but it is interesting that the word used in the Constitution of 1922 was &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; for Deputies and Senators. That word was carried on into the present Constitution.  The word used about Ministers in Article 28 of the present Constitution is &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;. In Article 35 of the present Constitution there is talk of the remuneration of judges and the emoluments of judges.  In the case of the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and their two deputies, the word used is &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;. I am not making a legal point.  I am not qualified to do so. However, I wonder if there is a special meaning in the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;.  Is it possible to take income tax from allowances paid to Deputies and Senators?</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about whether the Dáil was a part-time or a whole-time <Col N="1230" /> job.  I agree entirely with him that it is difficult for a great many people to do any other kind of work except Dáil work.  It is becoming more and more difficult.  One should ask oneself what kind of a candidate is a good candidate.</P>
    <P>Well-meaning people have often said to me that my own Party and other Parties should get better candidates. I always reply by saying: &ldquo;Would you like to be a candidate?&rdquo; The answer is always &ldquo;No, I would hardly like to be a candidate.&rdquo;  When a person gets into the Dáil what steps should he take to stay in it?  I suppose we all know.  Should he read the various Bills given to him in green paper, open the envelope every morning, listen to the discussion on the Bills, listen to debates, put down amendments and make speeches?  He must do something more than that.  He must meet his constituents and do what a great deal of Deputies are now doing in the Library, namely, write reams of letters, not always in accordance with his conscience.  He must do whatever his constituents expect him to do. He must be a go-between, a messenger, whatever you like, between his constituents and the various Departments.</P>
    <P>In strict theory, the best member of the Dáil and of the Seanad would be a person who has made a success of his profession.  If one is to manage the nation's affairs, presumably he should have given proof that he can manage his own.  The truth is that such a person has less chance of getting into the Dáil and still less chance of staying in it.  We are entering now into the era of the professional politician&mdash;the person who takes up politics as a career, which neither the Minister nor myself did in our time.  The Minister suggests a Deputy's pay should be higher and if it were higher still, it would attract a better type.  I do not think that is so.  I think we should reconsider that, and that the Minister and the Government should reconsider it.  I do not think higher pay will attract a better type of Deputy, or give sounder legislation and better Government. Perhaps it should, but I doubt that it will.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that the <Col N="1231" /> Seanad should not consist of full-time politicians.  I have no sympathy whatever, of course, with people who think the Seanad should consist entirely of people who protest they are not politicians.  The Seanad does political work, and its members must have political views.  In this House it is true that we have a fair number of members who are active political organisers and nothing else.  Some years ago a committee dealt with the Seanad, and Senator Ó Maoláin and I were members of that committee. It contained a number of people with political experience, including Senator Ó Maoláin, myself and members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>That committee made a report, and nothing was ever heard of it.  It was the report of a very big majority, I think, and it was signed by a great many people, including myself.  It stated that the Seanad needed some improvement, and that any experiment that had any prospect of improving the Seanad should be put into operation. It recommended that in the case of the 43 members of the Seanad who are nominated by nominating bodies and elected by a purely political electorate&mdash;members of the Dáil, Seanad and local bodies&mdash;the system should be changed, that instead of having the whole 43 elected on a political basis, some of them&mdash;I think the number was 20; it may have been 21&mdash;should be appointed directly to the Seanad by the nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>Objection was made that it would bring politics into the nominating bodies, but none of us is sufficiently innocent to believe there is not any politics in the nominating bodies now. I think there is.  We in Fine Gael think that recommendation should be adopted.  It could improve the position of the Seanad and, if it were adopted, it would, at any rate, bring a number of people into political life and show them what politics is like.  It would do away once and for all with the theory that what we need now are experts and not politicians.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear too pessimistic. I think the progress made in the past 40 years from the point of view of <Col N="1232" /> parliamentary government here is something on which we may congratulate ourselves.  I do not think that congratulation can all be put in the one place.  The time has now arrived when we should consider our parliamentary machine.  We will be having a Transport Bill before us next week, for example, and we have all heard arguments as to why members of the Dáil and Seanad cannot get information about a State body like CIE.  That is one of the unsolved problems of modern Parliaments.  I remember when the Electricity Supply Board was appointed a great many years ago.  I asked how the Dáil would control it, and I said from the Chair in the Dáil that I did not know, but I did not think it could be adequately done. That has proved to be true.</P>
    <P>We should reconsider our parliamentary machinery with a view to seeing where we can improve it to face new problems, new circumstances, and what someone here called new thinking. I also think the Government should take the Seanad more seriously and give the Seanad more work to do, otherwise I think the Seanad if it gets no more to do than it does now should be ashamed to take an increase in pay.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Hayes, I feel bound to oppose the subsection in this Bill which increases the allowances for Senators from £750 to £1,000 per annum, an increase of 33? per cent.  I do not believe that so large an increase is justified.  In presenting the Bill to the Dáil, and to us, the Minister offered three main arguments for the increases proposed in the Bill: first, the need for sufficient compensation for the earnings lost through parliamentary duties; secondly, the need to attract people with the best possible qualities to be members of the Oireachtas, and Ministers; and thirdly, the general rise in salaries throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully concede that there is an unanswerable case for all those three arguments for an increase in salaries for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. Further, I concede that a strong case can be made for members of the <Col N="1233" /> Dáil.  They work a three-day week on average, and we are told they answer about 300 letters per week.  We know they have heavy duties in their constituencies, but not one of those arguments, so far as I can see, holds for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I propose to base my brief remarks on my own case, which is average enough, perhaps, as a Senator.  So far as I can see, the time spent on senatorial duties by me in the past year came to something like this: we had 23 meetings and I attended almost all &mdash;but not quite all&mdash;totalling, I reckon, about 105 hours of sitting.  I reckon that letters, telephone calls, committee work and constituency work averaged for me, at any rate, about six hours per week for, say, 40 weeks in the year, so I reckon the total amount of hours spent on my parliamentary duties&mdash;and I may be remiss; perhaps I am average&mdash;would be about 345 hours a year.</P>
    <P>All this may be refuted by members of the Seanad.  I hope it will be.  I hope to find people saying this is a ridiculously small amount of time to spend.  I should like to hear people honestly say that.  I am being perfectly honest.  In my own case, if I receive a salary of £1,000 a year for 345 hours' work, I am being paid at the rate of well over £5,000 a year, which is too much for me.  I am not worth it, so far as my parliamentary work is concerned.</P>
    <P>Now I can see there are certain objections to this.  Country Senators will say that is all very well for Senators who live in Dublin, but they have to travel 150 miles perhaps.  That is very true but, on the other hand, country Senators do not have a constituency to look after.  They have a plentiful supply of TDs in their constituencies to do their constituency work.  They are on panels.  They are appointed by an electoral college of about 1,000 scattered all through the country and unless I am mistaken&mdash; I would be very happy to be refuted in this&mdash;they certainly have not the intense constituency work that a member of either of the university constituencies may have.  In fact, I think it <Col N="1234" /> is true to say that the only people in this House who have constituencies are members from the universities. I do not think that anyone can deny that.</P>

      <P>The time spent in travelling by country Senators is to a certain extent compensated for by the constituency work that the constituency members of the House must do, but what about Senator Quinlan, who is both a university Senator and has to travel up from Cork?  I think that university people can do a lot of very good work in the train&mdash;personally I find that one of the best places in which to do academic work is in the train&mdash;so I do not think that there is any special case to make about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the interval, I was considering the Minister's first main argument for increasing our salaries.  That argument was that sufficient compensation should be given for earnings lost through parliamentary duties.  I took my own case, probably a fairly average one, but I may be wrong, and I reckoned that in sitting times last year there were 105 hours approximately altogether and in general work like answering letters, telephoning, attending committee meetings and other political meetings, I personally spent about 240 hours or so in the year.  That is six hours a week, which in my case would make approximately 345 hours altogether. At that rate I will be remunerated in the future, if I do receive it, at the rate of £5,000 a year as a Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am speaking of my own case.  I may have said one or two provocative things about other people before the tea interval.  I recognise that Party men must attend party meetings which may take up a good deal of time.  I also recognise that all Senators, except university Senators, officially have no constituency.  They may argue that <Col N="1235" /> the whole country is their constituency and I do understand that at election time it is a hard constituency to nurse. One must make that allowance, too, but can any Senator honestly say that he has to answer anything like 100 letters a week which is one third of the estimate for a member of the Dáil? He cannot say honestly, or dishonestly, because the facts are against it, that he attends anything like one-third of the Dáil sitting time either.  Yet under this Bill Senators will receive salaries equal to two-thirds of a Dáil member. It is not a fair apportionment.</P>
    <P>There is one other argument I should meet under the first heading, namely, that it is easy enough for people like myself who are receiving an annual salary as a professor or something like that.  That is true enough.  There are no deductions made from my salary for attending the Seanad.  I may lose a certain amount of other profitable opportunities, but very few and it does not really count; whereas if a man is self-employed, on piece work so to speak, or is a farmer, he definitely does lose a considerable amount of annual revenue.  But should he be compensated for that at the rate of £5,000 a year?  That is what is happening.  So I say that Senators are over-compensated for their time.  If I can be refuted I would be very glad. But I do not really see that that can be done.</P>
    <P>The second argument brought forward by the Minister to support him in these proposals&mdash;not just the Minister but the whole Dáil which supported him in this&mdash;was that we do want to attract a better quality of member to the Oireachtas.  Can we do that to the Seanad under the present electoral law?  Senator Hayes discussed this earlier on.  He pointed out that we have had a commission on this.  That commission made certain recommendations. We had a motion on this in the Seanad some years ago.  I put it down.  We had a full debate, but nothing has resulted.  Undoubtedly, reform is needed.  At the moment there is an iron grip on the Seanad by the Parties, except in the case of a few Senators. Here is where the taxpayers feel they <Col N="1236" /> have a particular grievance.  They can directly control the quality in the other House by their votes which directly affect the candidates, but they cannot do that in the Seanad.  They feel there is a grille or a cage between them and the Seanad which they cannot break through.  They resent that.  That is why they particularly resent this increase. In fact, this increase would be justified if there were a free and open career for talents so that any eminent candidate would have a fair chance of getting into the Seanad on his merits.</P>
    <P>If that were so, of course the increase would be desirable.  But it is not so at the present.  No one can argue it is so, so the taxpayers have a particular grievance against Senators' salaries which they have not got in the case of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The third argument the Minister and his supporters in the Dáil brought forward was that there has been an increase in the cost of living and a general rise in salaries throughout the country.  Our salaries, or our allowances to use the Constitutional word, were £468 a year tax free up to 1960. From 1960 on they have been £750 a year subject to income tax.  Now it is proposed they should be £1,000 a year subject to income tax.  Those are increases within four years of 36 per cent and 33? per cent approximately. Those cannot be justified, I think, by the general rise in salaries and the cost of living, so I do not see the Minister's third argument is valid for us at all.</P>
    <P>What I have said is based mainly, as it should be, on my own case. Perhaps I am an unusually under-worked Senator.  I am prepared to accept proof of that.  If that is so, let others make a stronger case on the evidence as known to them.</P>
    <P>I will give one comparison, not a perfect one.  The Minister has examined statistics from other Parliaments and says that he found, on the whole, our parliamentarians are at a disadvantage.  I should have liked him to give the figures of both the salaries and the approximate working hours.  I question whether if we saw both we as Senators would appear to be at a disadvantage.  I take one <Col N="1237" /> case, the only one easily accessible to me, the case of the House of Lords in England.  Perhaps you will think they are all rich landlords and noblemen. They are not.  Many are now school teachers, business people, and so on, who have been raised to the House of Lords for political reasons. The House of Lords in Britain is not paid at all.  A member gets travelling expenses and gets three guineas for each sitting, if he is present.  Contrast that with our emoluments, and the contrast is very striking.</P>
    <P>If the case I have made is not refuted here this evening I must oppose subsection (2) of section 3.  I imagine now one question remains in the minds of Senators as well as in my own: in that case, suppose the Bill is passed, what am I going to do with the increase? There is a good deal of room for casuistry here.  Should one return it to the Government?  What should one do with it?  I simply say that I propose, since I think it is an unjustifiable increase, to give 21½ per cent to public charities, provided that the increase in the cost of living does not get worse.  I may have to reduce the percentage should that happen.  I feel this is the only way in which I can satisfy my conscience in this matter.</P>
    <P>In view of the paltry increases mentioned here so often&mdash;and we must continue to mention them&mdash;which we have voted for old age pensioners, can we honestly feel happy about what we are doing this evening?  With that in mind I propose to give a share of that 21½ per cent to charities which help the aged and infirm.  I do not regard this decision as at all meritorious in my case.  I hope the Seanad does not think I have that in mind.  I believe that it is a matter of simple justice to the taxpayers.  I do not think that I and my family&mdash;they may be a little indignant about my speech this evening, not having been consulted&mdash;are entitled to enjoy an excessive salary at the expense of the taxpayers, and that is what this amounts to, as I see it.</P>
    <P>There is one way in which we could justify ourselves.  Senator Hayes has already suggested it.  If we did a real job of work in this House, if the Government <Col N="1238" /> gave us more to do, and if we did it better, then this kind of salary would be fully justified; but until then, I really do not believe it is defensible, though I should be very happy to hear some other Senator make a really convincing defence of this remarkably large increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not intend to speak on this Bill.  Before I came into the Seanad I had the impression that the Bill would go through in about five minutes.  The Minister would make his statement. The Leader of the Chief Opposition Party would make a short statement. It would be a free-for-all with regard to those who can genuinely call themselves Independents.  I have no grievance whatsoever in relation to what Senator Stanford has said.  He is in a very, very independent position here. I can quite understand that he would object to getting a couple of hundred a year if he takes the number of hours we work and divides them into the wages we get.</P>
      <P>During the election for the Seanad, I met people who travelled all over the country and who got nominations from the nominating bodies.  They did not get them from the Oireachtas Parties.  I met these people in my house and in the houses of other county councillors.  They said they would be quite prepared to take a seat in the Seanad and do the work for nothing.  I should like to ask the Minister now if at any time he has received back a cheque for £750 from anyone who came into this House.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister because he has been pressed for quite a long period now to give these increases to Senators and Deputies.  No one in this House will agree that Deputies were paid a reasonable allowance. I have advocated an increase for Deputies all the time.  I have never spoken about our own position.  I agree with Senator Hayes that we could, perhaps, get a good deal more work to do and, if we get more work, we are quite prepared to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the increases to Ministers, and so on, I think commendable discretion has been shown.  They have acted in a most creditable manner. <Col N="1239" /> They are taking an absolute minimum. The Minister for Finance would not be here this evening piloting this measure through the Seanad were it not for the fact that all the major parties agreed on the measure before ever it was introduced.  The Fianna Fáil Party introduced this measure only because the Fine Gael and Labour Parties agreed there should be an increase in the remuneration of Senators, Deputies, Ministers, and so on.  Had Fine Gael refused to sanction the increase the Minister would not now be occupying the chair he does in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We can see now from what has happened here this evening that there are people who were not unanimous about this increase.  I am not a bit ashamed to stand up here and say that the people in the Labour Party were unanimous.  I am quite certain that the people in the Fianna Fáil Party were quite satisfied and that there was no dissension in that party as to whether or not there should be an increase.  If I am a member of a political party, and I am nominated by the Oireachtas Party for the Seanad, that means that if a majority decision is made by that party, then I am supposed to come in here and support what the party agreed on, irrespective of whether or not I agree with the decision.  When it is a majority decision of a party, then I hold no one has a right, when he belongs to that party, to come in here and object to that decision.</P>
    <P>An Independent who is not tied in to any party can make the case Senator Stanford made this evening and no one can take exception to that. The only exception I take is that, if we were to confine membership of the Seanad to people in the £5,000 a year bracket, then working-class people would never have the right to come in here and have their say in the Seanad. I hold that working-class people have a perfect right to come in here and make their voices heard.</P>
    <P>This question of expenses came up recently in county councils, in vocational committees and agricultural committees.  I was at a vocational course in Clonmel and quite a number of people in high places passed a <Col N="1240" /> motion that a man should not be compensated for loss of time on these committees. I said that the very people they were trying to keep out of the vocational committees were the people who had qualified through their own schools.  No man could afford to lose half a day's wages to act on a vocational committee.  A half day's wages for a tradesman might mean anything from £2 to £2 10s. or £3, depending on whether the job is done by contract, by the hour, or by the day.  These people could not afford to throw away £2 10s.  Yet, these are the people who do such very good work for the country and who can give the best advice where technical students are concerned because they can point out the mistakes that were made in their time and have these mistakes rectified. If expenses are ruled out, then we will not have these people on the various committees and the loss would be ours.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford said he would defy anyone to make the case here that he uses even one-third of the free postage provided &mdash; in other words, that he did not write 100 letters per week.</P>

      <P>As a Senator, I am a member of a county council and of a vocational committee.  Tomorrow morning I shall have at least 30 letters to answer.  It is quite a common thing to get 40 letters.  There is a record kept of every letter we post.  I invite Senator Stanford to examine that record and he will find that I go into 150 to 160 letters per week.  Not only that, when you come into Seanad Éireann, your job does not end up in Seanad Éireann.  People come to you not only in the morning or at 3 o'clock in the afternoon but they knock at your door in the middle of the night and expect you to get up and you do get up.  When it comes to county council business, if there is a question of the appointment of a rate collector or anything else like that, you could be called up at 3 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes said we should have the sort of legislation in this country where everyone would get his rights. <Col N="1241" /> We are all trying to give people their rights.  There are certain people who, not through their own fault, cannot get their rights because they cannot state their case.  Their public representative will state it for them and succeed.</P>
    <P>I am very proud that any time I ever had to write to a Department, and so on, I was able to help some such person.  There are difficulties every day about grants, social welfare, benefits under the Health Act, and so on, and, every day of the week, we get letters and people cycle up to 20 miles to see us.  It is not that the Departments have refused them their rights but there are people who are not capable of presenting their case as it should be presented.  It is a wonderful thing if they have public representatives who are capable of presenting their case.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to abide by the decision of the Labour Party that an increase in the allowances of TDs, Senators and Ministers is warranted. I have no time for anybody who belongs to a party and who comes in here and talks at the other side of his mouth.  The place to stop it was within their party and the Minister would not then be here this evening.</P>

      <P>We all know that the Dáil has become very much a fulltime job and that even the new level of allowance at £1,500 a year&mdash;of which probably half will be allowed for expenses&mdash;is totally inadequate.  We know that the Revenue Commissioners will not allow £750 for expenses unless they feel reasonably certain that a Deputy has to incur up to that amount.  That leaves a net £750, which is totally inadequate and, by European standards, is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to build a modern Parliament and a Parliament that will be representative of a cross-section of the nation, we must ensure that all our citizens from all ranks are able to serve <Col N="1242" /> in that Parliament.  I think the best model we can take is that of Holland. Five years ago&mdash;probably it has increased considerably since then&mdash;the personal allowance of each Deputy was £1,500 and all other expenses were provided free so that that was his personal living allowance.</P>
    <P>It was recognised at that time in Holland that £1,500 was a relatively modest salary.  They wanted to attract many persons in other walks of life who were capable of earning considerably more than that.  Consequently, it had grown up there that any of those engaged in public service, even from the Civil Service itself, were free to run for Parliament and if elected had to get leave of absence from the post while they served in Parliament.  In addition, if there were any difference between their salary as a civil servant or as a local authority employee, that difference was made good by that body. Therefore, the principle was established that no person there, whatever his position, lost by getting into public service.  Neither did he make money by it.  At least, however, the principle was established that he did not lose by being in public service.  That was a most valuable principle.</P>
    <P>In our country, where so many of our people are in public employment of one sort or another and are virtually precluded from serving in Parliament, our Parliament becomes lopsided. On the one hand, you may have some professional people close to Dublin&mdash;lawyers or some others&mdash;who can combine service in our Parliament with keeping on their office.  On the other hand, you have self-employed people&mdash;farmers, publicans, shop-keepers&mdash;who can combine the two. But we have got none of the vast middle professional class represented in our Parliament and that class has a very big contribution to make to our public life.</P>
    <P>We have spent more on the education of that class than on any other section of our community.  Consequently, they should be expected to contribute, at least proportionate to their numbers, to the public life of the country.  As we set our allowance at <Col N="1243" /> present, that is impossible.  I hope the Minister or the Government will try to evolve some scheme in the future that may make it possible for such a class to serve.  I do not know how it can be brought about.  Perhaps the Dutch model is about the best we can get.  Maybe something along those lines could be evolved.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that the Parliamentary life in this country cannot prosper so long as the vast proportion of our people&mdash;engineers, doctors, local authority employees, and so on&mdash;are precluded from service.  I appeal to the Minister to find some way of introducing this improvement.</P>
    <P>The second class I might deal with here are Ministers.  It is a shocking thing to propose an increase of 10 per cent.  Is it to be said that a Minister is entitled to about only half the salary of the senior Secretary in his Department? I do not think you would find a country in the world where such a principle is accepted.  It is false modesty in the worst sense of the term.  It can result only in lowering the calibre of men who will take Cabinet posts.</P>
    <P>At the very minimum, the principle should be accepted that a Minister should have a salary as high as the Secretary of his Department.  Certainly, the salary of a Parliamentary Secretary should be equated at least to that of an Assistant Secretary in the Department. I think that that comparison should be established once and for all. We should not have the embarrassing position thrust upon us here that the Minister for Finance has to introduce a Bill the purpose of which seems to be to increase his own salary.  That should go hand in hand with the Civil Service salaries and perhaps the Minister may see his way to do that and to do it as soon as possible.  It should not be mixed up with a wage round.  It should be remedied as soon as possible.  It is necessary to remedy it before we contemplate this big step of joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>Of course, I do say that there is not room for savings.  The travel allowance that is occasioned at the moment at something like £3,300 seems to be <Col N="1244" /> altogether excessive.  I think there is room for some saving in that respect. It need no longer be necessary to assign a driver and a car to each Minister.  There should be a small pool available and, just like Bishops and Archbishops, at the moment, Ministers should be able to drive their own cars for quite a bit of the time and get the necessary expenses for it. There is room for much cutting down there which could offset in some way the expense of giving to Ministers the salaries to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In regard to our own position here, the fact is that on paper we could be shown to have a rather poor record of sittings per year.  The Seanad has a vast potential, and it is an essential part of the legislative machinery.  The fault lies not with us, but with the Government, and with successive Governments, for not using the House to 10 per cent of its capacity or capabilities. I hope that in the future the Government will find ways and means of doing that.</P>
    <P>I differ from Senator Stanford in his tot of hours.  After all, it depends on what we put into the work we do here. We have to read and study Bills and voluminous reports.  The report of Córas Tráchtála came out today, and it would take a week to study it.  We have also the statistical abstracts and statistics issued prior to the Budget. We could spend almost a year studying them, and then use the facts in them profitably in some debates afterwards. I think we need not be worried about the return we personally make, provided our own consciences are clear.  We put in a reasonable time in the Seanad and its associated activities which range over all facets of our public life, and provided we do that our consciences are clear.  That does not preclude us from advocating a much more effective use of our time.</P>
    <P>We seem to have reached the cross-roads in our relationship with semi-State bodies, and independent bodies in which the State has made a big investment such as Verolme Dockyard. There is clearly a need for some type of effective committee action which would answer most of the queries with respect to those companies, <Col N="1245" /> and answer them in committees across the table rather than having to put queries very often in an exaggerated way from the floor of the House in the hope of getting some information.  We must modernise our system, and when we do, the Government should be able to draw very heavily on the Seanad for the personnel to man those committees.</P>
    <P>I would feel very happy to contribute in any way on those committees, and I am sure my fellow Senators would be equally happy to make a contribution.  We all have something to give.  All of us have tremendous experience of political institutions, and we know what works and what does not work.  Other Senators may be experts in economics, or mathematics, or law.  Everyone here has some talent to give, and to be effective in a committee of the House. Now that we are at the cross-roads and trying to plan for the future, we will have to make more use of the Seanad than using it merely to sound off on Second Stage of a Bill, and perhaps to be ten per cent effective on Committee Stage by getting some minor modification made in some provision of a Bill.  There is far greater work for us to do than that, and I hope the Government will give us an opportunity of doing it.</P>
    <P>We in the university constituencies are rather fortunate in that we do not have to do constituency work in regard to letters or queries and so on, which other members of the House have to do.  I believe it should be possible to rescue members of the Dáil and Seanad from a great deal of this unnecessary work at constituency level.  Perhaps it could be provided that while a Deputy would make representations to a Department, the answer would go directly from the Department to the individual concerned.  An educational campaign could be launched by the Government on television to inform people on their rights, and to disabuse them of the idea that they will not get their rights unless a public representative intervenes on their behalf.  By that means it should be possible to free Deputies and Senators from a lot of work that is of little value, and merely <Col N="1246" /> takes their time and energies from work they would prefer to do, which would be more valuable for the country. Television is a powerful medium.  It goes right into the home.  It could show how the Civil Service works, and how it deals with queries, and so on.  In that way the people could be gradually educated to look for their rights rather than depend on someone else to get them.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in welcoming this Bill.  I am in agreement with Senator Hayes in his appeal to the Minister to modernise our Parliamentary system and make it into an effective instrument, especially within the framework of the Common Market.  Ministers must abandon this false modesty, and accept the fact that they must be paid at least as much as senior officials in the Civil Service.  The level of salary in the Dáil must be such as to allow all classes in the community to be represented equally so that we will have a much greater quota of professional and salaried people in the Dáil than we have at present.  I believe the Seanad will continue as a part-time body.  We must develop the Committee system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps now is the time to look at the recommendations of the Seanad Commission to see whether the Government should implement these recommendations, in an effort to bring a new stream of thought into this assembly, and bring in a new group that would be completely free of the vocational organisations concerned. By all means let them have party lines. That is how our system works.  They would primarily have come for their excellence in the vocational organisations and the second stream, the other 20, would come as they do now from the political life of the country with qualifications for the vocational panels.  If we can achieve that we can get a blend of Irish life and Irish brains and effort into the Seanad that would make it a very effective instrument in the future, not so much an instrument that the Government need worry about whether it will delay Bills but an instrument that could be used by the Government to carry out many of those different <Col N="1247" /> tasks like the control of semi-State bodies and set up effective committees in between the Minister and various other organisations.  If that can be done the decision to revive the Seanad in 1939 will be fully justified and we can face the future with confidence in our legislature as a bicameral assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the increased demands on the time of members of the Oireachtas, to the decrease in the value of money and the incomes of a cross-section of the Irish people who might be expected to serve in the Oireachtas, I think the increases proposed by this Bill are justified, and I approve of them.  This Party think that they are justified and approve of them.  Having regard to what Senator McAuliffe said, I wish to say that the decision to increase the salaries of the members of the Oireachtas is a Government decision and that the figures of the proposed increases contained in the Bill are the Government's figures.  Again, I say I approve of them and this Party approve of them, but that does not mean that we would approve of any proposals brought by the Government before the Oireachtas.  We consider these proposals reasonable and for that reason we approve of them.</P>
      <P>The debate this evening has more or less turned on this House and the question has in effect been asked whether the members of this House are entitled to the proposed increases.  In the first place, I think Seanad Éireann is an essential part of the Oireachtas. Down through the years, it has fully justified itself.  In the 1930s, the present Government Party came to the conclusion that the Seanad should be abolished and they abolished it.  After a short time, they had second thoughts and the Seanad was reconstituted, and with a very short interruption since the foundation of this State, we have had two Houses of the Oireachtas and, I think, quite rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new Constitution, this House was called upon on one occasion to defend the Constitution and notwithstanding the method of election and the composition of the House itself, <Col N="1248" /> Seanad Éireann defended the Constitution and opposed the proposal of the Government to abolish proportional representation.  That measure and that action by this House must justify the House in the eyes of the country.  I do not want to delay too long on this, but I can say without fear of contradiction that were it not for the ventilation that the Referendum Bill got in this House and were it not for the fact that it was defeated and held up in this House for three months the people would not have realised what an outrageous proposal it was to abolish proportional representation and it might well have been carried.  That is something that this House can still be proud of.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is reasonable, as Senator Stanford has done, to measure the value of Seanad Éireann by its working hours.  We had a Bill here a short time ago to increase the salaries of the judiciary and a Senator asked had there been an increase in judicial output, so to speak, to justify the increase.  The Minister for Justice rightly pointed out that you could not estimate the value of the members of the judiciary by the volume of work that passed through the courts.  He agreed that, on the contrary, it might be an indication that the courts were working more efficiently if there was a smaller volume of business done.</P>
    <P>It is true that the work of Senators does not end in this House.  Any Senator who discharges his obligation to the Seanad, to himself and to his Party finds that he has a pretty full day.  This is a democracy and long may it remain a democracy.  The only way a democracy can work is through the Party system.  If members of the political parties do not keep in contact with the people, do not serve on various Government boards and committees, and do not take an active part in the affairs of the country to an extent that they would never be called upon to do if they were not members of the Oireachtas, then it would not be possible for democracy to continue as we understand it today.</P>
    <P>Again, I must disagree with Senator McAuliffe who is not correct in saying that Senator Hayes opposed this measure.  Senator Hayes did not oppose <Col N="1249" /> this measure.  He called on the Government, as I call on the Government, to make more use of this House, to give it more work to do, to arrange the parliamentary programme in such a way that Bills will come to this House throughout the year so that they can be adequately dealt with in this House.  At the present time the Government arrange the business of the Dáil in such a way that the Bills come to this House all in a lump, so to speak, during the months of June and July and it is then not possible to do justice to these measures because we are told that they must be enacted before the recess.  That is not the fault of this House or of any member of it.  We are here.  We are prepared to tackle measures that are sent to us however technical they may be.  We are prepared to serve on select committees of the Dáil and Seanad and deal with measures sent to us.</P>
    <P>The House may not be aware that Speaker Ponsonby of the Irish House of Commons got more than £5,000 per year by way of emoluments during the mid-18th century.  That is according to an article that appeared in one of the daily newspapers today.  I do not advocate that we should ascend or descend to that sort of ridiculous extravagance but I do think, in order that the country may be served in both Houses by a fair cross-section of the people, the remuneration of members of the Dáil and Seanad should be adequate.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening until I heard the speech made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  I must say that whenever I hear the plea for a vocational Seanad as if the word &ldquo;politician&rdquo; were a dirty word and the word &ldquo;party&rdquo; something to be ashamed of, it makes me sick because I think of vocationalism in relation to the corporate State of which we hear so much from time to time, and I remember how these alleged vocational bodies and alleged vocational Parliaments which they constituted operated in Spain, Portugal, Germany and Italy.  It is time we came down to brass tacks in this part of the world and stopped the nonsense in which both <Col N="1250" /> Senator Hayes and Senator Stanford indulged tonight.</P>

      <P>Is it not?  I felt sick listening to the double talk of Senator Hayes this evening and of Senator Fitzpatrick.  Senator Hayes proceeded to tell us we were not worth the money we are getting and suggested that if the Seanad did not get more work it should be abolished.  He is perfectly entitled to do that.  On the other hand, Senator Fitzpatrick in my opinion became the most interesting speaker of the night when he appeared in the role of a defender of the Constitution.  He said that the Seanad defended the Constitution in the case of the PR issue.  There was no question of defending the Constitution. It was a question of a referendum to decide whether the Constitution should be amended by vote of the people and it was not a question of the Fine Gael Party or Senator Fitzpatrick or the <Col N="1251" /> Seanad defending the Constitution. They just defeated the Government proposal to submit a further proposal to the people.</P>

That was why the Seanad was abolished.</P>

      <P>Having got that off my chest, I should just like to add on this particular point, since it was referred to in Senator Fitzpatrick's adroit little effort to suggest that this was a Government decision, the fact remains that every member of the House knows, as Senator McAuliffe quite properly said, the Parties in the Dáil, Fine Gael in particular, had been pressing for quite a long time for an increase in salaries, which they considered adequate, and which everybody with any commonsense considered adequate, and which everybody with any commonsense agrees should be increased to a level commensurate with the status and dignity of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so and well the Senator knows it.  All Parties agreed that it was necessary to do this and all Parties agreed that this modest increase was necessary.  I agree entirely with Senator Quinlan&mdash;it is seldom I find myself in agreement with him&mdash; but I do believe he is quite right about the percentage increase in salaries to Ministers.  We must remember &mdash; and nobody need make any apology for upholding these increases&mdash;that in the 40 years which have passed since the revolution which made it possible to have a Parliament in this country, the men who served here were motivated by intense idealism and an upsurge of patriotic motives and practically every one of them came into politics by accident.  There was no such thing for them as considering pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new generation has arisen, a generation based on practical realities and the facts of life and they see that the world goes on, that business progresses, that there are great opportunities in industry and commerce and that money can be made, and they have not got the same outlook, unfortunately, as the generations that ruled this country for the last 40 years.  They regard everything from a practical, business point of view and if we are to have a free Parliament with men of talent and ability who can make a success of life and contribute to the <Col N="1253" /> Parliamentary institutions, then in the future it must be made worth their while to come in and spend their time and devote their talents and give assistance to the upbuilding of the country.</P>
    <P>The sooner everybody accepts that without equivocation the better and the sooner the people realise that the labourer is worthy of his hire the better. If those who constitute the Dáil and Seanad are to give of their best they must be in a position to devote their time to the service they give to the community.  As Senator McAuliffe quite properly said, it must be made possible in the future for any man, no matter how low his income may be in ordinary life, to come into the Dáil or the Seanad and devote his talents to the service of his country without being in the position of driving his wife and children to starvation if he leaves the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Senator Stanford said, I am afraid in his reference to his constituency he is in complete isolation from the rest of the members of the Seanad, particularly those from the country.  Senator Stanford's constituency I am afraid is a small intellectual group.  It has far wide flung ramifications, I agree, and his constituents spread practically around the globe.  I do not think they can be representative of the type of constituency which constitutes the rest of Ireland and for which all Senators are responsible.  There are country Senators here, as Senator McAuliffe said, who from the time they go home do not get ease or peace until the time they leave again for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I know what being a Senator means particularly in the country.  People think you are in a position to advise them on everything from China to Peru.  You may not know the answers and if you do not they think you can get them.  They come to you and expect you to make telephone calls, write letters and call on Ministers. It is all right saying we have no constituency but our constituency boundaries are the whole Twenty-Six Counties.  It is useless to talk like Senator Stanford of the number of hours, the number of minutes and the amount of work done. <Col N="1254" /> You may still compare them with the surgeon who does a job in five or ten seconds and on occasion he may get £1,000 for it.  He has done a tremendous job.  He has saved a life.</P>
    <P>I consider the members of the Seanad and the Dáil as being in the same category as a surgeon.  They may not have to devote the same amount of time to their work as a man may have to devote to other occupations, but the responsibility and the work which they have to do and the amount of time, as Senator Quinlan quite rightly pointed out, used in the study of Bills and the reading of documents more than justifies the fact that the Seanad and the Dáil are doing their job and are good and worthy upholders of tradition and democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford in referring to the increase in salary which he was going to give to charity made me feel that if he was so unworthy of receiving this increase, and if he felt that we meet only so many days and so many hours in the year, then he is not worthy of the £750 he has got up to now.  I have not heard he has given any back or that he has volunteered to give any to charity.  We should be honest in this. If Senator Stanford or any other Senator thinks he is not worth the money, he should give it back or give it to charity.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue and I feel that the Dáil Ministers particularly are well worthy of the increase they have got.  I hold that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are not getting enough.  I even wonder whether the Dáil salaries are enough.  However, this is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Seanad, the Constitution lays down that we have a second House.  If we are to have a second House, then the second House must be put in such a position of status as to make it appeal to people of talent in the country.  Therefore, the members of the second House must be paid.  If slurs are cast on them, if it is suggested that we are not worthy of these salaries and that we do not perform a useful function, by all means get rid of us.  So long as it is in the Constitution, we have to make provision <Col N="1255" /> that it will be fully and adequately filled by people of the best talent we can find.  If it involves the expenditure of public money, there is a good case for it as a matter of policy in the cause of democracy in this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on the ministerial salaries, which seem to be the most important part of the Bill.  I regret the Government have not seen fit to give a bigger rise in salary to Ministers.  We should not count the extra £500 allowance we give to Deputies in estimating the amount of ministerial salaries.  The Minister for Finance in introducing the Bill pointed out that the total increase was 33 per cent.  I do not think the two should be related at all.  Ministers, as we know, have the duties of a <Col N="1256" /> Deputy to perform and there is no reason why they should not get the Deputy's allowance along with other Deputies.  I cannot see why it should be reckoned in relation to the ministerial salary.  They should get the salary of Deputies and the salary of Ministers.  The two are entirely different.  Taking the salary of Ministers by itself, they have given themselves an increase of ten per cent, from £2,000 to £2,200.  That seems to me to be entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with Senator Quinlan that the present level of ministerial salary is entirely too low.  In giving themselves this increase they did not even get to the 12 per cent ninth round.  It is only a measly ten per cent.  The result of this increase and those previously given through the years is that the present level of Ministerial salaries has been degraded to a level far below that of comparable occupations throughout the country.  I have been doing a bit of research with regard to the general level of Civil Service salaries.  We must remember that a Minister like, say, the Minister for Finance is in charge of a big Department.  The Minister for Finance has the sole responsibility for taking decisions which may have fundamental importance for the entire economic and financial climate of the country. He has to control a big Department with various branches, such as the Board of Works which are, indirectly, his responsibility.  He has a responsibility in all these matters.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, make it clear straight away, in case there is any doubt in the matter, that I am not suggesting that civil servants are paid too much.  I am quite certain many civil servants are not paid enough. The only point I am making is that the differential that does exist between the salary of a Minister and the salary of a civil servant is entirely wrong. The Minister for Finance has very big offices to control.  If my calculations are correct, there are 211 public servants under him who earn more than he does, even allowing for the increase that will come under this Bill.  That seems to me a very strange state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> If one takes the Civil Service as a whole&mdash;my figures may not be absolutely accurate, but they are sufficiently accurate for the point I am making &mdash;there are over 700 public servants who earn more than £2,300, which is what we propose for Ministers of State under this Bill.  I took a few examples at random&mdash;I could have taken many more&mdash;out of the Book of Estimates of the classes of public officials who earn more money than Ministers of State.  I am not acquainted with Civil Service grades.  I am sure these are important officials, but I do not think they equate in importance with Ministers of State: Assistant Principals, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Assistant Solicitor, Inspector, Assistant Principal Architect, Assistant Chief Engineer, Engineer Grade I, and many more.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the position in which many civil servants&mdash;no doubt they are important in the Civil Service&mdash;have salaries equivalent to that of a Minister for State even though their duties are largely routine. Clearly many of them have little to do with the making of policy.  Many of them have little real responsibility.  It is quite clear they deserve the salaries they get.  They earn them and there is no reason why they should not get them, but it is fantastic to have a Minister of State in the position of having large numbers under him, doing routine jobs, but getting more money than he does.  I might mention, too, if my calculations are right, that there are six public servants who earn more than the Taoiseach does, or will under this legislation.</P>
    <P>On one of the sections of the Finance Bill earlier today Senator McGuire made a point with regard to taxing people who work in manufacturing industry.  If I understand him correctly, he said that nowadays a senior executive in industry is paid £3,000 as a matter of course.  I take it that is a minimum.  Many will be paid very much more.  If a senior executive in a relatively small industry is paid £3,000, surely Ministers of State should at least have an equivalent sum.</P>
    <P>I think the Government are adopting a very dangerous policy because it <Col N="1258" /> could happen in the future that we would find ourselves deprived of the kind of material we need in Government. Nobody goes into politics for what he can get out of them.  Nobody becomes a Minister because he thinks it is a profitable job.  There could come a time when a man, because of family commitments and liabilities, would decide that he could not afford to become a Minister and work for the salary of a relatively minor civil servant. We have not reached that stage yet but we are getting near it.</P>
    <P>I regret the Government have not seen fit to give Ministers decent salaries.  I know that stupid, irresponsible people will say: &ldquo;Oh, of course they give themselves so much a year extra&rdquo;.  That is a risk that must be taken because otherwise we may find ourselves in the future in the position of not being able to get the best people for the various ministerial posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I think it is a courageous and an honest Bill, inasmuch as it has been brought in in the face of quite a good deal of public misunderstanding and prejudice, as Senator Hayes has pointed out.  The State is the largest business operated in the community.  It is the community itself.  I look on the members of the Dáil and Seanad as the directors of the State company and the Ministers are the executive directors of that company. If we compare the rewards paid under this Bill with those prevailing in private enterprise they will be found to be very inadequate indeed.  As has been said, people do not go into politics, certainly not at the top level, for the money they get.  Up to now they have gone in because of patriotism, or for one reason, or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we got round to looking at the running of the State as a business proposition.  The State is taking more and more of the affairs of our lives under its control.  If the State is in that position surely we must have the right kind of men to run this operation. We will not get good men for bad money.  They will go into industry where they will get not only what is being given here but far greater rewards, and with far fewer brickbats <Col N="1259" /> being thrown at them.  The minimum paid to any director in modern circumstances is £1,000 per year.  If he is not worth £1,000 he should not be a director at all.  In fact, that is small money nowadays for a director.</P>
    <P>Dáil and Seanad Éireann should not be places for rich men only or people who have time to spare.  It is all very well to talk about being independent but it is only people with plenty of money and time to spare who can afford to be really independent.  If that is the criterion, then we shall rule out a very large section of the population.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McAuliffe when he says that Deputies and Senators, if they do their job properly, are always on duty.  One cannot just work out the hours that Senator Stanford did and say that some are paid at about £20,000 per year.  Those of us who are closely associated with what is happening in the two Chambers are never off duty.  I am not very prominent in the purely political machine but I get numerous letters asking me to recommend, to talk, to advise, and so on.  I have a secretary who works very hard.  She does a great deal of work in which I would not be involved if I were not in the Seanad.  If that is true of me then it is even truer of those members from the country who act as local advisers to everybody and who spend a great deal of time visiting Departments on behalf of various people, and so on.</P>
    <P>Senators and Deputies are always on duty.  Judging by the figures produced they are very inadequately paid indeed.  Senator Stanford was, of course, very honest when he stated his own hours of duty and his contribution to the Seanad.  It must be remembered, however, that Independent members here have a much easier job than have those of us who are associated with Parties.  Take even the holding of a House here at night.  If you are on the front bench in our Party, or in the Government Party, you must be here from 3 p.m. until 10 p.m., or later. If the House is sitting late, we have to be here.  We have our meetings beforehand and decide who will speak on <Col N="1260" /> every Bill and we take an intelligent interest in the Bills.  You cannot work out in hours what contribution is made by a man who is really doing his job in a conscientious way.</P>
    <P>It is time, after 40 years, for us to settle down in this country to working our governmental institutions and machinery.  It is very bad that these institutions should be denigrated from inside; it is bad enough that it should be done from outside by people who do not know very much or who do not think very much about what is happening.</P>
    <P>There are people who still say there are too many members in the Dáil and that the Seanad should be abolished or halved.  It was abolished and, to give him his due, it was abolished by a man who thought there was no need for it and at a time when it was thought there was no need for it.  Experience has shown that it is necessary.  It has been embodied in our Constitution.  We should not fool about and talk about abolishing our State institutions which have been built up so carefully, slowly and laboriously over the past 40 years. It is very irresponsible talk.</P>
    <P>Take the numbers in the Dáil.  They could not be cut down and it is irresponsible to talk about how much would be saved by getting rid of, say, 20 Deputies.  Anybody who knows the working of governmental machinery knows that there is only sufficient in the Dáil to give a Government and an alternative Government.  That is our system of government &mdash; a Government and an Opposition which can provide an alternative Government.  By the time we have our Ministers, our junior Ministers and the essential elements of a Party, there is very little to choose from or left even to act as backbencher Deputies.</P>
    <P>I believe we are at a minimum in the Dáil for a properly operated governmental machine in this country. I believe all the Deputies, whether they be Ministers or simply backbenchers, have a wholetime job on their hands dealing with their constituents and with making legislation.  The only thing wrong at present is that I think we are not paying people enough.  If and when we do pay people enough &mdash; and this <Col N="1261" /> Bill is a step in the right direction&mdash;we should demand good service and we should select the right type of man for public life, somebody who will do his duty conscientiously.  There will always be a certain element of Independents, who can sit on the fence, if you like. But they have a function to carry out in that they can look at things objectively.</P>
    <P>The system we have built up here is a political system composed of political parties.  I think everybody should belong to a political Party and should play his part at some level, from the lowest to the highest operation in the political system.  In England, they have an admirable Parliamentary system. Nobody boasts over there: &ldquo;I am not a politician or in politics.&rdquo;  Everybody is.  One person is a Tory and goes to his local branch.  He attends conventions and his wife helps to get money for the party.  It is the same in the Labour Party.  Nobody over there says: &ldquo;I will not tell you what I am.&rdquo; We all know what politics each one professes.  We have all seen them at work.  It is one good thing we ought to copy from England and English political life.</P>
    <P>We should get rid of this idea that one should not support a political Party.  This should not mean that one should go as far as showing active dislike of people in the other Party, but one must take a line somewhere and stand for some philosophy.  Let us get the right people into Parliament and pay them properly.  Then this Bill will be justified.</P>
    <P>My only fault with the Bill is that I still do not think Ministers are paid enough.  I do not think £1,500 a year is enough for a TD if he is doing his work properly.  Because the Seanad is not being properly used I think £1,000 a year is about fair: it is certainly not too much.  I would hope that, in time, all Governments would make more use of the Seanad and get rid of this idea that the Seanad is useless and should be done away with.  It should not be done away with.  It should be improved and used.  I think that the amount paid, even at present, to Deputies and Senators is quite inadequate <Col N="1262" /> and it is about time this Bill was brought in.  I give it my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support much of this Bill.  I certainly support the increase to Dáil Deputies.  I entirely agree with what Senator Yeats said about the Taoiseach and the Ministers, though in comparing their salaries with those of public servants, he has possibly overlooked the allowances which the Taoiseach and all Ministers get.  I do not know what these allowances are but I think that, if they were equated with salaries, they would be fairly considerable. Perhaps the Minister in his reply might tell us something about these allowances&mdash;not necessarily individually but in bulk &mdash; because in terms of motor cars and other factors they represent considerable salaries.  Nevertheless, the amounts which we pay in salaries to the Taoiseach and our Ministers are, to my mind, totally inadequate in modern conditions.</P>
      <P>I support, too, section 11 about which very few people, if anybody, spoke this evening &mdash; the proposal to pay a salary to the leading members of the Opposition Parties.  This is a step in the right direction.  For the Opposition to do their job properly, their Leaders must spend considerable time, make considerable researches and employ essential secretarial help, and so on.  They obviously need these additional allowances and I welcome this provision.</P>
      <P>I should like to go back, of course, to the point which Senator Stanford made in particular and which Senator Hayes made in part, in regard to Seanad salaries.  I feel that my colleague, Senator Stanford, rather overstated the case in comparing our constituency with other constituencies and on the question of the amount of hours spent on Seanad work as a measurement for the amount of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that, although we have many constituents in many parts of the world, we are not, on the whole, plagued by them as are many of our colleagues here in the House, particularly those in the country who are plagued by people who may not directly be their constituents but who live in their areas.  I do not think it is perhaps fair either <Col N="1263" /> to measure the hours we spend as a measure of the work we do, although it may be a rough and ready rule.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin attacked Senator Stanford for using hours as a measurement of work but Senator Ó Maoláin was being a little unfair to Senator Stanford because this was the Minister's own measure or one of the Minister's measures for supporting increases, in his opening statement. The Minister mentioned the two or three days per week a Deputy has to spend in the Dáil.  He mentioned the number of letters he has to write, the number of meetings he has to attend, and proceeded in his argument to say that the position of Senators is somewhat similar.  I think, here, that Senator Stanford was right to take up the point of hours.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no comparison between the number of hours that any of us spend on our duties (whether we are Party members or Independent members) and the time spent on their duties by members of the Dáil. We do not sit anything like the same number of days.  Very few of us write anything like the same number of letters and very few of us have anything like the amount of lobbying of one kind or another from constituents or other people who ask us to do things for them.  It may be that the position of most members of the House is not the same as the position of Senator Stanford and myself, or the position of members for the National University, but it is still true that the duties of Party members here are nothing like as arduous as the duties of Party members in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe said working class people were entitled to come to the Seanad and should be paid.  We are all entirely in agreement with that statement.  I do not think anyone has suggested to the House &mdash; I certainly would not suggest for one moment &mdash; that they were not entitled to come here, or that they were not welcome here.  Senator McAuliffe contrasted them with the £5,000 a year man.  The Seanad is not composed of £5,000 a year men, nor is it composed of working class people.  It is composed of a <Col N="1264" /> number of representatives put up for the most part by vocational panels, and elected here on those panels. There was no idea at any time that the Seanad should consist of any particular section or class.</P>
    <P>I oppose the increase for Senators on the basis of measurement put up by Senator Ó Maoláin that &ldquo;the working man is worthy of his hire&rdquo;.  I do not honestly think that as this House is used at present, and in relation to the amount of work we do, we are worthy of the increased hire which it is proposed to give us.  We would be worthy of it if we did more in this House, and we would be worthy of it if we were allowed to do more. I can give two examples.  I remember a year or two ago when we were considering the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  So far as I remember 50 or 60 amendments were put down to that Bill.  Because it was urgent &mdash; it being, of course, the end of July &mdash; that the Bill should pass, none of those amendments was accepted.  Some were debated, but none was accepted.</P>
    <P>I can think of an example last week in which the Patents Bill, which is a Bill of great complexity, was passed through this House in all stages in a single evening.  The reason why that Bill was passed in all stages in a single evening, was that the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in the House, agreed to have all stages passed.  I do not think that is using this House properly.  The Patents Bill was the type of Bill which should have been debated in two stages, and certainly on two separate days.  I cannot believe the Seanad could not have contributed something of merit to that important Bill.  Nevertheless, it was taken through all stages, and I do not think any good was done in the four or five hours we spent on it, because the Bill was rushed through and the House was not used properly.</P>
    <P>I have stated that we are not worthy of our hire.  I quite appreciate that in saying this I am open to the charge: &ldquo;You are all right.  You have got another job.  It does not make all that difference to you if you do not get another £250 a year.&rdquo;  In regard to that argument, are we not all one way or another in just the same position, or are not <Col N="1265" /> the vast majority of us?  Are not nearly all of us doing another job of work?  Are not some of us in receipt of some pension for having done another job of work?  If we are not, I suggest we should not be here, because we are here on our vocational panels, or other representative positions, because of what we can contribute of our experience gained outside the House.</P>
    <P>It may be that some people are here because of being State pensioners. Their duty to the State has been done in the past, and they are in the Seanad as a reward for that.  For such a case I feel we should have a civil list.  In general principle the Seanad should be composed of people who are part-time employed (and very much more part-time employed than members of the Dáil) but in such part-time employment they will almost always be in receipt of some other moneys, some other earnings, or some other pension. As such, therefore, the addition which they receive as Senators should be an addition commensurate with the work they are called upon to do.  That is not what will happen under this Bill, because under this Bill I think, quite frankly, that we are being very much overpaid.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin said he hoped the Bill would put the Seanad and Senators in a position of status, and that they must be paid to be put in a position of status.  I do not agree with that.  If you want to put Senators in a position of status, you should put them in a position in which they can do the job which it was intended they would do.  It is not a question of payment.  It is certainly not a question of payment alone.  Status is measured by what we can contribute, and what we can really do to help in the enactment of Bills. At the moment we are not being allowed to do what we should be doing to help in the enactment of Bills.</P>
    <P>Here I want to say that I agree with Senator Ó Maoláin that a vocational Seanad is not going to be a solution. We must accept that this is a political body and will only work as a political body although composed of vocational members with political allegiances. Nevertheless we could do a far better <Col N="1266" /> and more effective job if we were allowed to do it.  Until we are allowed to do it I cannot accept that part of the Bill which gives us an increase in salaries.</P>

      <P>We have had an interesting discussion on this Bill.  Senator Hayes in starting off gave a sort of review of the State for the last 40 years and the way in which it developed.  It is only natural to look back at a time like this.  He was right in saying that we have settled into a successful democracy whatever rules we may have followed in recent times. We are, therefore, not compelled to do anything that would be necessary to improve things as far as that particular point is concerned.  He may be right &mdash; I certainly cannot recollect any case to contradict him &mdash; that this is the only State set up since 1920 that still survives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think that is probably correct.  Many Senators made the point that it is a pity that the Seanad does not get more to do. There is quite a lot in that point.  I must say that I have given attention to it more than once, and so have the Government, but somehow or other we never came down to the point of doing something about it.  Maybe we could raise the matter again.  In that connection Senator Quinlan made a very good point that Senators, if they were to read all the publications that come to them, would spend quite a lot of time doing their work.  If they would all read as assiduously as Senator Quinlan and make the same use of it the Seanad would have plenty to do and there would not be any shortage of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion also turned to a great extent to the best way of selecting good Senators and good Dáil members.  Senator Hayes started that by saying that he thought the man who was successful in his own profession was almost certain to be the best Senator.  I was thinking over that point and I must say that taking the farming position I knew three farmers <Col N="1267" /> in County Wicklow, the best men I ever met to discuss farming, but they were entirely unsuccessful on their own farms.  You will find the same in the professions and business.  The man with perfect ideas, good in debate and making a great contribution, very often when it comes to the practical point of view is not a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan then deplored the absence of professional men.  I do not know whether we would be better or not if we had more.  The Senator said that the Seanad is not open to the best type of candidate, but I think it is.  Nobody here can say that we have not got the best type of candidate in the Seanad, because you do not know how much better anybody else can be until he is in and if you had others they might not be as good as the men we have.  We do not know if we have the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Proportional representation was mentioned.  I do not want to go into the merits of this question, or rather I do not want to go deeply into past history.  I have always thought myself that in selecting a Dáil candidate without proportional representation you will certainly get a better candidate.  Each individual will have to stand on his own.  We know that in the parties there is a tendency that if there are one or two good candidates in the constituency the party supporters will say: &ldquo;They can carry this fellow in even though he may not be too good.&rdquo; That would not occur if you had a single member constituency and a selection of a candidate in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous to talk about proportional representation having saved democracy, because the two greatest democracies in the world, Great Britain and America, have never touched proportional representation and do not intend to touch it.  They have got on quite well without it and <Col N="1268" /> I am sure will carry on without it. The whole thing is how can we get the best candidate, and in a democracy as far as I know what is done outside they do it in much the same way as we do it ourselves.  In other words, the party one way or another think who should be selected.  They have various ways of holding those conventions such as we hold here.  In some of them headquarters select men and send a direction down, and some come up from a convention, but there is not much difference in the way they are chosen. We have carried on very much in the same way.  In spite of all the suggestions that were made, I am afraid we have not got any light on the subject that would enable us to proceed to a better position.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe said that his Party had taken a decision and that he came in here to support that decision.  He was perfectly right.  This point I mentioned in my opening remarks, that we have the party system and that sometimes party members do not speak too vocally in the Dáil or Seanad meeting but they are very vocal at a party meeting, and argue their points there, but when a decision is taken they follow that decision.  There is only one way out of that, and that is that if it is a matter of very grave principle a party member can resign, as they do sometimes, though not very often.  Of course, the question of whether you give £1,000 or £800 to a Senator is not a matter of principle.  It is only a matter of detail so that there is no necessity for any man to resign over it.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats went on to compare Ministers' salaries with those of people outside.  I am afraid that Senator Yeats did not take a fair figure because it is not fair to say that a Minister's salary is £2,200 as it is laid down in the Bill. You must add what the Minister receives also as a Deputy.  It is all practically the same job.  It may entail long hours at times but at any rate it is one job and, therefore, under this Bill the salary must be taken as £3,700. I have gone to a great deal of trouble, naturally, getting out examples before bringing in this Bill as to how we stand with regard to public servants and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> I would also like to refer to one very important point, that the Minister has free transport.  I am not going to estimate what that free transport is costing the State.  That would be unfair to the Minister, but if the Minister had to supply his own transport we should take that figure into account and I suppose every Senator knows what transport costs.  We would have to put it at £600 or £700 a year taking everything into account, including renewal of motors and so on, and that would be a modest figure.  Even taking £600 or £700 and adding it to £3,700 then you have a fair comparison and on that comparison a Minister's salary which will run up to £4,300 or £4,400 which is fair enough and comparable enough with other salaries that are going. Taken on the whole a Minister's salary is now on a fair basis.  Up to this it was not, but it will be under this Bill.  It follows, of course, that Parliamentary Secretaries will be fairly well treated too.</P>
    <P>Talking about this question as it did arise, a couple of Senators said that Ministers were too well paid and that the cost of keeping Ministers was too high.  They talked about transport. That has given me a great deal of trouble and worry.  I did get an investigation carried out about two years ago.  It was a very thorough investigation, not in public, and I got a report which I studied and I could not see any suggestion of how any change could be made from the present system. I think it is a very bad system personally but I cannot see any good alternative.  There is no doubt that it would be a very onerous matter if a Minister had to do his own driving because, taking the past six or seven or eight weeks, I have left home shortly after nine o'clock in the morning and have not come out till about 11.30 p.m. about three nights a week.</P>
    <P>That is rather hard going and I really think that the Road Traffic Act should not allow a person who has been working fairly hard all day, whether in his own office or in the Seanad or Dáil, to drive after such a long day's work.  Personally I would not be inclined to take the risk of <Col N="1270" /> driving home at night after a long day's work.  Then what do you do? You might say that the Minister should get an allowance and an allowance for the driver but no driver will work 16 hours a day for six days.  You come up against terrible difficulties.  I cannot see any solution.  I hope somebody will.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGuire that people do not come in here for money. I said that in the Dáil, that surely nobody would come in in order to make money, and I also said that it is almost 40 years since I came into the Dáil and, of course, I have known a lot of people come in and go out and I cannot remember any single person who made money.  They all went out worse off than when they came in and a lot of them went out very badly off. There is no doubt about it, there is no money to be made out of this job.  I quite agree also with Senator McGuire that it is not easy to work out the number of hours a Senator has to work.  He may easily work out the number of hours the Seanad meets, but to work out the number of hours necessary if a person is interested in a Bill, to prepare material and look up matter and to keep in touch, as Senator Quinlan said, with these publications that are sent to us by various organisations, and which are very useful to a public man if he reads all of them, is very difficult.  Beyond that, he is accosted by people occasionally to know if he could help them in getting what they thought they were entitled to from some Department or other and all this makes it very difficult to know what the number of hours would be.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think Senators are entitled to an increase.  It could be said I suppose that a Senator does not work very hard if he never speaks or does not ask questions.  Then, perhaps, he is overpaid for his time but the Senator who takes an interest in his work and gives a fair amount of his time to preparing material is not and, therefore, I have no hesitation in asking the Seanad to agree to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a gesture of holding up the Bill by proposing an amendment, but I should like to report the amendment I would be putting down if I thought I would get any support for it.  The amendment would be to the effect that our salary should be increased by 12 per cent to £840 a year.  That would be a fair increase.  I think we could all go away satisfied and happy with that.  However, this is a matter for each person's conscience and I have spoken for my own.  I should like to say in regard to what Senator Fitzpatrick said about the increases that were recently given to judges, that if he looks at the Official Report of the Seanad Debates, volume 57, column 1061, he will find that the Chief Justice got a six per cent increase, the President of the High Court got 10 per cent, judges of the Circuit Court and justices of the district court got 12 per cent.  We are voting ourselves a 33? increase this evening. That is a significant difference.  I should like to add that Senator Quinlan is quite right, and that we should allow time for reading documents.  I overlooked that in my estimate.  It would reduce the equivalent salary to about £4,000 instead of £5,000 a year, but I still think my main point stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point the Minister raised which is relevant on this section. There is this difference about getting the best member of the Seanad and the best member of the Dáil.  An Independent of distinction and brilliance can go up for the Dáil and have a fairly good chance right away, by direct appeal to the electorate, of being elected.  But how many Independents are there in the Seanad outside university professors and the 11 members nominated by the Taoiseach? I do not think there is even one.  The <Col N="1272" /> reason is that an Independent of brilliance has very little chance of getting into this House.  That is why I oppose this rise.  If I thought it would attract people of that kind and that they had a good chance of getting in, I would be all in favour of it, but under the present system only in very few cases is it possible for a brilliant person, suitable as a Senator in every way, to be elected.  I simply record that I must dissent from this section.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I am not satisfied with the Minister's arithmetic where he added up the actual salary of a Minister to say it reached £4,300.  First of all, I do not think it is fair that the Minister should add in the Deputy's salary.  Certainly, the most he should add in is one half the Deputy's salary which the income tax holds as actual salary liable for taxation.  Travelling done by the Minister is surely travelling done on official business and the classes he is compared with do not have the corresponding travel.  It would be hard to discover free travel for the Minister in his off hours.  I think at most a modest estimate of £150 or £200 a year would be adequate for that.  By any system of reckoning I do not think we could hold that the Minister has more than £3,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, he is still in a very unfair position as compared with salaries prevailing outside.  I think the Minister should check the arithmetic again when he would find that the Minister's salary is too low.  I think if the Minister's salary were related directly to the salary of the Secretary of his Department that also would ensure <Col N="1274" /> that Ministers in the major Departments&mdash;Finance, Agriculture or Industry and Commerce &mdash; would have a slight differential over Ministers in other Departments, such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and others.  I would appeal to the Minister to get away from this salary business altogether and establish once for all some parity between civil service grades and ministerial salary.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;leasehold interest&rdquo; contained in section 3 briefly says that two periods in a lease shall be deemed to create one continuous term in possession. My only objection to that definition is that as the law relating to stamp duty stands at the moment a lease for a period of less than 35 years is subject to a smaller rate of stamp duty than a lease in excess of 35 years.  A lease, therefore, for two periods which together would be for more than 35 years still would only be subject to or attract a lesser rate of stamp duty.  But if two periods which together make up more than 35 years are to be taken as one period here the argument would be for the higher rate of stamp duty, as the Minister considers it is.</P>

      <P>I have considered the amendment.  I am assured by the draftsman that the words the Senator proposes to insert are not, in fact, necessary.  Senators will notice that subsection (1) of section 3 begins with the words &ldquo;In this Act,&rdquo;. This is sufficient to establish that all the definitions contained in section 3 are for the purpose of the Registration of Title Act only.  When the Bill is enacted these definitions will not affect the meaning of these terms in any <Col N="1276" /> other context whatsoever.

      <P>The central office shall be the office for registration of all land in the State.</P>
      <P>I submit that the office referred to is for the registration of title rather than the registration of land and it would be desirable, I think, to amend the subsection to read: &ldquo;The central office shall be the office for the registration of title to all land in the State&rdquo;.

      <P>Again, the draftsman assures me the section as drafted is satisfactory.  What we are registering is, in fact, ownership of land, and land in this context means land of any tenure.  That is the first sense in which it is defined in section 3.  It is not land physically and, therefore, the term &ldquo;land&rdquo; as used does incorporate in it the idea of ownership of the land.  That is what is being registered.  The draftsman tells me it is quite satisfactory. Anyway, the Senator's amendment is unacceptable from the drafting point of view.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I should like to refer the Minister to the title of the Bill, which is &ldquo;Registration of Title Bill, 1963&rdquo; From the outset we are dealing with the registration of title, not the registration of land or houses.  Land would, I submit, presuppose a fee simple interest in land. We are registering leasehold interests <Col N="1277" /> here and limited ownership of one description or another.  I maintain the word should be &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; or &ldquo;title&rdquo;.  It would really be neater to call it registration of title.  The drafting of my amendment may not be perfect. Opposition amendments have to be tabled without the aid of expert draftsmen and can always be improved upon, but I think the idea behind the amendment is sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has a point, but if he takes subsection 3 and this section together he will find that land under section 3 (1) includes land of any tenure.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), line 43, to delete &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9 prescribes the qualifications of the Registrar of Titles, not the Registrar of Lands.  This is a very important position.  At the moment we have a Registrar in charge of the Land Registry and a Registrar of Titles in the Registry of Deeds.  Now we are going to appoint a Registrar of Titles who will be responsible for the administration of the Land Registry in Dublin and responsible also for the administration of the offices in each county.  He will, of course, have the local county registrar but, in the last analysis, it is he who will be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill confers on the Registrar of Titles functions of a quasi-judicial nature.  He will have the right to do what up to now could only be <Col N="1278" /> done by a judge of either the Circuit Court or the High Court under section 52.  Section 49 of this Bill confers upon the Registrar of Titles the right to declare a title to lands subject, of course, to appeal to the court.  The qualifications laid down in subsection (3) stipulate:</P>
    <P>No person shall be appointed to be Registrar of Titles unless at the time of his appointment he is either a barrister-at-law or a solicitor who has practised his profession for not less than eight years.</P>
    <P>The effect of these amendments would be to require a barrister or solicitor to have ten years' practice in his profession immediately before appointment. Eight years is a bit short.  Ten years would be reasonable.  It should be laid down, too, that it would be a necessary qualification that the ten years should be immediately before appointment. As the Bill stands, a person could practice for eight years and then take up some other occupation, come back after ten years, and find himself appointed to this important position. I make the Minister a present of saying that that this is unlikely to happen, but the fact remains that it could happen, and it should not be possible for it to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no very strong feeling one way or the other about whether it should be eight years or ten years.  In order to be agreeable and amenable, as I always try to be in this House, I shall make it ten years.  However, I would ask the Senator not to press amendment No. 4 because it would be, I think, unnecessarily restrictive. One might have an ideal person, suitable in every way for appointment, but debarred if this amendment were adopted for one reason or another &mdash; perhaps he might have had a period of illness or he might have left the profession to take up an appointment in a university, or something like that.  Provided we make the ten year qualification we could, I think, leave it to the good sense of future Governments to make suitable appointments.  I would not like to tie the hands of any Government and that is what we would do by confining it rigidly to people who <Col N="1279" /> are actually practising at the date of appointment.  Amendment No. 4 would make that mandatory.</P>

      <P>This section provides the fees that shall be charged. When this Bill is enacted and when all the land of the country and the title to all the land of the country is being registered, the Land Registry will be more expensive than it will be in 25 years' time when the work of registration has, in fact, been completed. I think it would be unfair that <Col N="1280" /> the present generation, so to speak, should have to bear the brunt of all the first registration.</P>
      <P>The people who own lands now will not really reap the benefit of first registration because they will be registered subject to all sorts of qualified titles and possessory titles.  It is only as the years go by and when those qualified and possessory titles are converted into absolute titles that the people of the country will really reap the benefits and advantages of registration of title.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to consider this question of fees and not to set out to impose the entire burden of the costs of first registration on the present owners of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give any undertaking to depart from the underlying principle enshrined in this section, namely, that the Land Registry should more or less pay for itself.  However, I would hope that the greater volume of business which would ensue as a result of the extension of compulsory registration should not necessarily involve a corresponding increase in overheads and that it may be possible in the years ahead to reduce Land Registry fees.  When I say &ldquo;reduce&rdquo;, I am using the word in a rather artificial way.  I would regard Land Registry fees as being reduced in fact if they did not keep pace with rising costs and the falling value of money.  I would hope that, over the years, the services rendered by the Land Registry might in reality be less expensive.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), lines 33 and 34, to delete &ldquo;or any portion thereof&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 (1) provides that the Minister for Justice may by order provide that this section shall apply to any county or county borough or any portion thereof on and after a specified <Col N="1281" /> day, but not less than six months after the making of the order.  I have no objection to the Minister's being able to bring this Bill into operation in respect of a specified county or a specified county borough but I do object strenuously to the proposal in this section which enables the Minister to apply the Act to a portion of a county or a portion of a county borough.  It is absolutely essential that the general public and practitioners should know when and in respect of what land compulsory registration applies because the penalties are very heavy.  If a person enters into a deed transferring land, and it is not registered, that deed, within three months as the Bill stands at present or within six months as it will stand when the Minister's amendment is accepted, is void.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that a solicitor practising in a certain county will know what barony or what parish compulsory registration will apply to. That may be so but a mistake could be made.  Furthermore, and this should apply to the Civil Service, it is not necessary that a solicitor be employed in every case.  I know it is usual. I know it is nearly invariable.  The provision here is to simplify the transfer of land.  If the registration applies only to part of a county, it could lead to misunderstanding and to mistakes.</P>
    <P>I strongly appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment which proposes to delete the words &ldquo;or any portion thereof&rdquo;.  I do not think the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be any the worse therefor.  In fact, I think it will be considerably improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we retain the flexibility which is incorporated in the section as drafted.  I would find it very difficult, indeed, to accept the amendment proposed in the name of the Senator that the flexibility which is there be taken away. One argument that comes to mind is that, in so far as we can estimate, if compulsory registration were to be extended to the whole country there would be as many applications from the county borough of Dublin alone as there would be from the rest of the country.  That I think, makes it inevitable <Col N="1282" /> that we must have, certainly so far as Dublin is concerned at any rate, the power to extend it to portions of a county borough rather than to the county borough as a whole because it would be impracticable suddenly to throw the whole weight of Dublin city on to the Land Registry for compulsory registration purposes.</P>
      <P>The difficulties which Senator Fitzpatrick envisages will, in fact, in my opinion not arise.  First of all, we would propose, in regard to county boroughs, that, if we were to depart from the borough as an entity at all, we would go down only as far as an electoral area, which is a fairly clearly-defined and well-recognised unit. Secondly, I should not imagine that, outside the principal county boroughs, there would be any question of dividing up a county, for purposes of extending compulsory registration.</P>
      <P>I think it would be fairly likely that we would deal with counties as a whole.  I would be prepared to give an undertaking to the Seanad in this matter that when we are bringing in any particular area, whether it be a county, or a county borough, or a smaller unit such as an electoral area, we will publish the fact very adequately, and we will certainly be in touch with the Incorporated Law Society and facilitate them in every way possible to notify their members of the fact. Indeed, I am sure it would be possible for us to have maps provided in the Land Registry of the particular areas to which compulsory registration has been extended, and have them made available to practitioners on request, or to any member of the general public who may wish to see them.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Senator Fitzpatrick to withdraw the amendment on these two grounds.  First of all, the difficulties he foresees in my opinion will not arise, and secondly this amount of flexibility is absolutely essential if we are to fulfil the promises I made here and in the Dáil that we will not in any way overstrain the resources of the Land Registry, and that we will bring in only an amount of territory, as it were, with which it can cope at any given point of time.</P>

      <P>Some people feel that if there are delays in land registration it could lead to serious difficulties. They fear, for example, that if a person lends money on this security on a charge, and in normal circumstances pays over the money in exchange for the charge, it goes to the Land Registry, the person may find for some reason or another that the charge is not acceptable and that he has no security at all.  I know it may be said that it is up to the lender to safeguard himself by the proper drafting of the deed of charge, and ensuring that it will be accepted.  I fear the lender will safeguard himself in this way: that he will not part with the money until he has been notified that it has been dealt with by the Land Registry.  Big corporations who lend money are not inclined to take any chances, and if that state of affairs came about it would be a great inconvenience to the general public.  It may be that this has been considered and there is some safeguard in the Bill which has escaped me.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first point is that section 14 (3) provides:</P>
      <P>Any provision of this Act or of general rules requiring or authorising anything to be done or any certificate or other document to be issued by the Registrar or in or from the Land Registry shall be construed as requiring or authorising the same on payment of such fees as may be fixed by order under this Act.</P>
      <P>Section 28 is qualified by section 14 to the effect that if you do not pay you will not get it.  That takes care of that. The reply to the other point is that the situation will still obtain that the land certificate will issue to the practitioner as heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section. Owing to the hour of the evening that it is, I propose to just give a summary of the argument I had hoped to develop if I had got in at an earlier hour.  This section, as I have already intimated on Second Reading, proposes to give the Registrar of Titles on application from some person or from his solicitor the power to declare a title a possessory title to land.  As I pointed out on Second Reading, this is a very important power and one which in my view amounts to a judicial power and falls within the definition of judicial power as given in the decisions of our courts.  As such judicial power it cannot be exercised save by somebody in the position of a judge properly appointed in accordance with the Constitution.  For the purpose of my argument I must quote the relevant provisions of the Constitution which restrict the exercise of judicial power by a person other than the judges.</P>
      <P>Article 6 (1) says: &ldquo;All powers of Government, legislative, executive and judicial derive, under God from the people...&rdquo; Subsection 2 says &ldquo;these powers of Government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 34 (1) says &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 37 of the Constitution, as the Seanad knows, is a limiting one.  In that regard it is limited in an extremely careful manner and it has been interpreted by the courts in an equally careful manner.  Article 37 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than <Col N="1287" /> criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>The question then has to be examined from this point of view &mdash; what is the administration of justice and what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.  I refer the Minister to the latest and very exhaustive judgment delivered by the Supreme Court and reported in the Irish Reports of 1960 <i>in re</i> the Solicitors Act, 1954 where this whole question was examined very minutely and in which all the relevant authorities were brought to play and examined and applied.  Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore delivered the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court in this case, and it all hinged upon the question as to whether or not certain powers given to the Disciplinary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society were judicial powers.  It was found by the then Chief Justice, who tried it first, that it was a judicial power but then he said that it was limited according to Article 37 of the Constitution.  It referred to the striking off the role of solicitors by the Disciplinary Committee, and the Supreme Court on appeal and cross appeal found that it was a judicial power and that it was not limited and accordingly could not be exercised by a body such as the Disciplinary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society in order to strike solicitors off the role.</P>
    <P>The whole question of judicial powers was examined and considered and judgment given upon it.  I quote from page 263 of the Irish Reports of the year 1960, and from the judgment of Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore.</P>
    <P>The judicial power of the State is by Article 34 of the Constitution lodged in the courts, and the provisions of Article 37 do not admit of that power being trenched upon, or of its being withdrawn piecemeal from the courts.  The test as to <Col N="1288" /> whether a power is or is not &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in the opinion of the court lies in the effect of the assigned power when exercised.  If the exercise of the assigned powers and functions is calculated ordinarily to affect in the most profound and far-reaching way the lives, liberties, fortunes or reputations of those against whom they are exercised, they cannot properly be described as &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any ruling on people's title to lands is an exercise of a power that, in my respectful view, is most profound and far-reaching in its effect on the lives, liberties and fortunes of the people.</P>
    <P>In the same judgment at page 267 the judicial power is dealt with.  I quote:</P>
    <P>It follows from its nature as I have described it that the exercise of the Judicial Power, which is coercive and must frequently act against the will of one of the parties to enforce its decision adverse to that party, requires of necessity that the Judicial Department of Government have compulsive authority over persons as, for instance, it must have authority to compel appearance of a party before it, to compel the attendance of witnesses, to order the execution of its judgments against persons and property.</P>
    <P>All of this judgment I would urge upon the Minister to read and for his advisers to read, particularly with regard to the argument that I anticipate the Minister will make, namely, that there is an appeal to the court and that that solves the whole situation. There was an appeal to the court in the judgment to which I refer and the matter decided upon and there at page 275 of the same judgment, Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore continues:</P>
    <P>It is urged that the existence of an appeal to the Chief Justice is sufficient to answer these objections. The Chief Justice in his judgment took the view that, notwithstanding his own opinion as to the merits, he was not at liberty to act as if he was engaged on an untrammelled re-hearing and he must not interfere <Col N="1289" /> with the decisions of the Committee unless he was clear that the decision was wrong, nor interfere with the punishment unless he was convinced that it was out of proportion to the misconduct.  If this view be correct the appeal is but an indifferent protection, but even if it be not correct the existence of an appeal to the courts cannot restore constitutionality to a tribunal whose decision, if unappealed, amounts to an administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Here is where the Minister is in trouble with this section and may well be in trouble later.  I would strongly recommend him to reconsider it and come before us again.  To summarise, in my view the exercise of the power, which it is proposed to confer under section 49, by the Registrar of Titles is a judicial power; it is not limited and amounts to an administration of justice. Accordingly, it is an exercise that can be performed validly only by a judge properly appointed under the Constitution. I am sorry I have not got the time to develop this fully.  This judgment is an extremely interesting one.  It is becoming far too frequent a happening here that the constitutionality of a Bill taken through this House when challenged, shows that sufficient attention was not paid to the Constitution.  This is particularly true in a country where there is a written Constitution and where rigidity follows from it.  It is in that respect that the Minister and his advisers find themselves in trouble so I strongly suggest that the Minister should reconsider it and pay attention to this judgment and consult further with his advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My simple answer to Senator Lindsay's constitutional argument is that this is not an exercise of a judicial function at all.  It is necessary to consider this matter against the whole background of the change in substantive law which we are making in section 49.  In regard to unregistered land, a squatter becomes entitled by the mere effluxion of time to the land if he has been 12 years in possession of it, because the Statute of Limitations applies to him.  Section 52 of the 1891 Act stipulates that a squatter on registered <Col N="1290" /> land can never become entitled to the registered estate by adverse possession but goes on to say that such squatter could apply to the court for an order declaring his title and directing that he be registered as owner.  We are making this change in the Bill, or, rather, section 49 makes the change in the substantive law, that from now on the squatter on registered land will be in exactly the same position as a squatter on unregistered land, and he will acquire simply by adverse possession.</P>
      <P>The 1891 Act created a judicial function and the court in exercising that function decided whether or not a person could be registered by virtue of adverse possession of registered land but we are doing away with that judicial function.  We are not taking it away from the court and giving it to the Registrar.  We are abolishing that judicial function and saying that from now on the squatter on registered land will be entitled to acquire by adverse possession, which is the same as the squatter on unregistered land, so that the question of constitutionality does not arise.  There is no question of the Registrar exercising a judicial function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 22 to add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) On the registration of a transferee under a voluntary transfer, the fact that it is a voluntary transfer shall be noted on the register and in the absence of such note the transfer shall be deemed to be a transfer for valuable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to give notice on the register when a person is registered under a voluntary transfer. The whole idea behind this Bill is to simplify title to land and to bring about a state of affairs in which a person, by inspecting the folio, or its equivalent, will know more or less where he stands.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to accept this amendment or not, but if he does not I cannot see any reason why he should not.  I might be pardoned for saying that perhaps it is the Civil Service attitude to resist this amendment because, if accepted, it might be easier for a mistake to occur in the land <Col N="1292" /> register.  It might be they would have to decide what was a voluntary transfer and, more important, they would have to remember to put the note on the folio.  It would be in the interests of simplification of title to put the notice on the folio and I cannot see any reason why it should not be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Formerly it was the practice to put this note on the folio but the practice was discontinued on the instruction of Mr. Glover, the then Registrar, about 40 years ago.  The argument is that the person inspecting the register of registered land is entitled to rely on the register as evidence of the title as it appears thereon.  Mr. Glover felt strongly that it was no concern of the purchaser as to how the owner became registered.  If we were to accept Senator Fitzpatrick's amendment, it might well be that it would have the reverse effect to what he intends.  Mr. Glover makes the point that a purchaser is under no obligation to make enquiries outside the register that might fix him with notice of possible claims.  As Senator Fitzpatrick knows, the question of estate duty might arise in this regard.  I understand that on a sale the matter of estate duty is covered by standard requisitions. The practice has worked satisfactorily for the 40 years that have elapsed since the direction was given by Mr. Glover at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fact that the Minister mentioned death duties is a reason for the folio.  If a person knows that a person from whom he is purchasing has been registered for less than three years, for a voluntary transfer, then he must get a certificate of discharge from death duties, or he must protect himself in some other way if the three years have elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchaser can be at a loss.  If <Col N="1293" /> he really wants to protect himself adequately he will have to go back and get a copy of the instrument under which his predecessor was registered. I think it is unreasonable.  I think a person must investigate the title, notwithstanding the fact that it is registered. I think this defeats the whole object of registration.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 59 reads:</P>
      <P>(2) It shall be the duty of the Registrar to note upon the register in the prescribed manner the prohibitive or restrictive provisions of any such enactment;</P>
      <P>That is quite understandable, but it goes on to say:</P>
      <P>but such provisions shall be, though not registered, burdens on the land under section 72.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it says that the prohibitive provisions of any enactment shall be noted on the register and presumably it is the duty of the Department of State, in whose favour this prohibitive provision applies, to see <Col N="1294" /> that they are registered.  Then it goes on to say if somebody forgets to put this note on the folio these prohibitive provisions shall affect the land.  I propose the subsection shall read as follows:</P>
    <P>(2) It shall be the duty of the Registrar to note upon the register in the prescribed manner the prohibitive or restrictive provisions of any such enactment; and unless such provisions are noted they shall not affect the land.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point I made under the last amendment.  I think, as far as possible, the public should know where they stand by an inspection of the register.  I say the trend here is to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  The Minister wants to have the benefit of a registration but, at the same time, he wants to reserve to Departments of State, and, indeed, to the register of titles, the advantage of non-registration.  I do not think it is reasonable.  Indeed, if I were arguing from a strongly professional point of view, I would have accepted the Bill as it stands because it leaves things more complicated.  It makes it more necessary to employ a solicitor and justifies a solicitor charging a larger fee.  It makes it easier for the legal profession to argue a case for a larger fee, but it is not in keeping with the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the amendment is unacceptable.  In practice, statutory prohibitions are registered and the Bill says they must be. What Senator Fitzpatrick proposes would bring about a situation where the inadvertent omission to enter a statutory prohibition would nullify the prohibition.  After all, the important thing is the statutory prohibition.  This is something which derives its force from a statute laid down by the Oireachtas in pursuance of some policy or other.  It would be illogical to accept that a simple error of omission in registration would be sufficient to defeat a statutory prohibition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that as far as the transfer is concerned although two citizens enter <Col N="1295" /> into a transfer, it is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is registered within a certain time.  I am asking the Minister to accept that prohibition so far as statutory procedures are concerned and take steps to note on the folio that it will not affect the land.</P>

If the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for example, decide to lend X £1,000 and X executes a charge on his farm, the procedure at the moment is that when the charge is handed over to the Corporation, the Corporation send X, or his solicitor, the money they have agreed to lend.  They get a charge, but, under this Bill, that charge will not be worth the paper it is written on until it is registered on the folio.  It seems to me that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, some building society, or other such lender, will in <Col N="1296" /> future take the precaution of not parting with the money until the charge is, in fact, registered on the folio.  If that should happen, it would be a source of great inconvenience to the general public.</P>

      <P>They are all part and parcel of the same idea.  Section 72 of this Bill is the old section 47 of the 1891 Act and section 16 of the 1942 rolled into one.  It is the section which declares that certain rights and burdens can affect registered land without registration.  That is out of line with the general trend, which seeks to create a situation whereby the folio will speak for itself and a person inspecting the folio will know where he stands.  There are such things as rights-of-way which could not be registered on a folio.  It would be unreasonable to expect that they should be and that they should affect registered land without registration.</P>

    <P>What I seek to remove from this section are land improvement charges and drainage charges.  Surely one Department of State could facilitate another in this matter.  The same is applicable to annuities and rent charges payable under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts.  If there is anything due to the Land Commission, <Col N="1297" /> surely it is not too much to expect that the Land Commission should register that with the Land Registry under some simple device.  Subsections (d) and (e) apply to rights in favour of the Land Commission and the others are rights in favour of the Labourers Acts.

    <P>When the registration in the Registry of Deeds of any deed or other document within a certain period or otherwise is required by any enactment, registration of the title under such deed or other document (within the same period, where registration within a certain period is required) shall be a compliance <Col N="1298" /> with the provisions of that enactment.</P>
    <P>I think the idea behind this subsection is to indicate that where registration in the Registry of Deeds is required then registration under this Act will be sufficient.  However, I think it is necessary to add the words I have put in &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo; to make it clear.  In our reading of several other sections, the words &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo; are used.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the draftsman that the words are unnecessary because registration of title can arise only under this Act.  It cannot arise otherwise.</P>

      <P>In subsection 5 (5) (c), a time limit is placed on the making of a claim for compensation and the time is confined to six years. Experienced practitioners know that mistakes of this sort rarely come to light very quickly.  It might be many years after the mistake was made in the Land Registry before it would come to light.  Therefore, I think that <Col N="1299" /> the imposition of a time limit here largely defeats the benefit of compensation.</P>

      <P>I want to refer the Senator to this point.  <i>In re</i> Ryan's application, 1944, the Supreme Court in construing the provisions of the 1891 Act held that the expression &ldquo;from the date of the registration in respect of which compensation is claimed&rdquo; did not necessarily refer to the registration in which the mistake had occurred but rather referred to the registration which caused the loss.  The registration of a subsequent disposition for value is usually the registration which causes a loss in such a case. So, the period of six years does not necessarily, or even probably, run from the date on which the mistake has occurred and it is much more likely to run from the date of the registration of a subsequent disposition for value.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 46, to add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) Every office under the control of the Registrar as such, or as Registrar of Deeds, shall be <Col N="1300" /> open to the public on such days and during such hours as the Minister for Justice may from time to time by order appoint.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Registry of Deeds Office (Ireland) Holidays Act, 1883, is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>(c)  Notwithstanding section 2, this subsection shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to empower the Minister for Justice to regulate by order the days and hours during which the offices under the control of the Registrar, that is, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, shall be open to the public.  It is desirable that the method of determining the hours of opening of the offices in question should be a more flexible one, so that alterations may more easily be effected as and when required.  The recent decision of the Government to extend the five-day week to civil servants will involve changes in these hours and has underlined the need for flexibility.</P>
