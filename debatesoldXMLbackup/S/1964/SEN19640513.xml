      <P>Pursuant to Standing Order 75, a Bill which has been initiated in the Seanad and amended by the Dáil is, after its receipt back from the Dáil, deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage, the Minister, on the Question &ldquo;that the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, explains the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  Seanad amendments on Report Stage are in order provided they arise out of the amendments made by the Dáil.  The only matter that may be discussed are the Dáil amendments or any Seanad amendments arising out of them.  There are no Seanad amendments tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The single amendment adopted by the Dáil consisted of the insertion of the following paragraph in section 1 (1) as presented to Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>(c) premises in which a majority of the persons being maintained are being treated for acute ailments by or under the control of medical or surgical specialists,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> I made it clear to the Dáil that the intention was to devise some procedure which would prevent the exploitation of the aged and the infirm without, at the same time, involving unnecessary interference with establishments such as nursing homes, the majority of which are well conducted.  It is noteworthy in this connection that nowhere in the Bill is the term &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; used.  My intentions were that the type of homes in respect of which a measure of control was necessary was those homes kept for private profit in which people not acutely ill but who may be suffering from chronic illness are cared for and maintained. Those are the types of homes which I intended the Bill to deal with.  The amendment which was made by Dáil Éireann makes that intention of mine more specific and more precisely defines it.  I accordingly recommend the Seanad to adopt the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I just ask does this mean that fewer institutions will come under the Bill than would have come under it as passed by the Seanad, or does it mean that more institutions will come under the Bill than would have come under it as the Seanad passed it?  Does this extend the scope of the Bill or reduce it?  I am not quite clear on that.</P>

      <P>I thought that I <Col N="910" /> was sufficiently explicit in recommending this amendment to the Seanad when informing the Seanad that the purpose of it is to confine the Bill to those institutions to which it was originally intended to apply, and in the sense that it states my intentions more precisely, it may be said to restrict somewhat the scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have hoped that the Minister's amendment which has been inserted would have been framed in such a way that a person in a home who felt that he was being illtreated would have some means by which he would be able to convey his complaint to the outside world.  I hold that the Minister's amendment does not do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if I may make one, it is not the Minister's amendment, though I was responsible for introducing it.  It was an amendment put down by me to meet the point made by the Opposition in Dáil Éireann.  It is an amendment made by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps what the Minister said is quite true but I want to point out that I consider it a useless amendment, because, as the Minister told us, he himself did not know how the person in the home would use the amendment to convey his complaint outside the confines of the particular establishment.  I just want to express the hope that if there is legislation in the future, the Minister will be so kind as to consider my point, which is not put forward in any narrow or narking sense but really because I believe, with the Minister, that there is no way in <Col N="911" /> which a complaint can reach the outside world.</P>
      <P>The Minister kept on reminding us that if he followed our theory in regard to inspection and supervision, we would be doing a great harm to the charitable institutions and would be very unfair to them.  With interest, I received a note from one of those very fine institutions in the course of the week which carries this message to me: &ldquo;You will always be welcome to come to see us and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Senator in what way this matter is connected with the Bill itself?  The Senator must confine herself to the Bill before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, on the Bill before us, as the Minister himself said: &ldquo;I do not know how the Bill as it stands will help a poor person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, Sir.  The Senator elsewhere has been misinterpreting me.  I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I did not bring the report of the debate, but if the Minister will read it, he will see that my question was how I&mdash;I used myself as the example&mdash;would convey my complaint outside the confines of the institution, I being friendless and helpless.  The Minister replied : &ldquo;I do not know&mdash;some kind person, some charitable person.&rdquo;  I have not a copy of what was said in front of me, but the Minister repeated &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;.  He then went on to say &ldquo;some kind person&rdquo;.  I cannot just remember the words.  It seemed to me that it was merely a chance that somebody would do so.  I do not want to leave the matter to chance; I want certainty.  I am asking the Minister if, in future legislation, he will bear this in mind.</P>
      <P>If I am insistent on this perhaps the Minister will forgive me.  I was really misled because I had been reading a book and came across the following, which I should like to quote, if the Seanad will bear with me:</P>
      <P>When as my weary feet no further fare,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> And all my wayward wandering is done,</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now back to the terms of the Bill.  I just wanted to point out that the Minister misled me.  I thought he was so kindhearted about this matter when he wrote this poem and talked about:</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be fair to the Minister in this.  He brought us a new Bill which goes a certain distance and we are grateful to him for that.  Some of us would like to go a good deal further but I think it is only right we should end on a note of gratitude to him for taking the initiative in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I should like to refer to the fact that this Bill was initiated in this House. I think there were very useful discussions on the Bill here during all its Stages, before it went to the Dáil. It has now come back to us here with one minor amendment only.  I think we have an example of a valuable procedure that might well be followed on future occasions of introducing Bills of this sort in this House.  The Bill, as it stands at the present time, <Col N="913" /> meets with my approval, for what that is worth.  I think, by and large, all our nursing homes, hospitals and institutions, which the Bill is meant to deal with, are properly run.  There are, of course, abuses but I should like to feel that these abuses are isolated instances.  I think the Bill, as it stands at the present time, is adequate to deal with those cases of isolated abuses without subjecting properly run institutions to unnecessary investigation and inspection.</P>
      <P>There are two schools of thought on this subject.  One school is of the opinion that all these institutions, which cater for elderly incapacitated people, should be subject to registration. It follows, if they are subject to registration, they must be subject to inspection before they can be registered. The other school of thought takes the view that as long as a health authority has power to go in and inspect an institution, where it is alleged abuses are taking place, it is sufficient. At any rate, for the time being, the latter school of thought is the more correct.</P>
      <P>As I say, I think the Bill meets the case and I am sure, where any abuses have been taking place in the past, reports will be made to the health authorities and these institutions will be inspected again, with all the consequences that follow, if they are not being properly conducted.  I am sure if, at any time in the future it appears that this Bill is not adequate to deal with cases, then the position can be reviewed but I think it would be a mistake to impose compulsory inspection and registration until a case has been made that it is absolutely necessary to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which I brought in in the hope that it would be regarded as a humanitarian measure, has provoked, as sometimes social questions do, an extraordinary amount of controversy.  I must plead guilty of being exasperated myself.  I am glad to say Senator Hayes did not interrupt me at an earlier stage or I might be even more exasperated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, in regard to the remarks of Senator Miss Davidson, for whom I have the highest regard, that <Col N="914" /> I think she was unfair.  When she asked me a question, I answered in general terms.  I went on to say &ldquo;some person, any person, a kind person, a person concerned with the condition of a particular patient.&rdquo;  It might even be done by letter.  I admit there is some difficulty.  Who would make the complaint regarding a person who is penniless and without relatives, where he or she is maintained for profit in a home? We have to consider the matter of the person living in the world, as we know, an old person with money and who is able to pay for his or her maintenance. That person might have a bank manager of his or her own, or might be a ward of court.  The only complaint I have in regard to what Senator Miss Davidson said is that she took a single sentence out and omitted to quote my full statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, with respect, to the Minister, that I had not the report with me and I did not intend to misquote him in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly accept that.  The Senator also flattered me when she quoted extracts from a poem written in my distant past.  When I came to deal with this Bill, I dealt with it, not as a poet, but as a public man with some responsibility for the legislation which I wished the Oireachtas to pass.  I have tried to get positive, substantiated evidence that these abuses were so widespread that the measures which were proposed, that is to say, registration and periodic inspection, were necessary to deal with them.  I failed to secure substantial evidence in regard to this matter and I decided to proceed on another basis. If a complaint were made by a responsible person, I would have power to conduct an inspection of the premises complained about.  If it should happen that the health authorities themselves, from knowledge they had obtained, or merely by complaint, felt that it was necessary to inspect certain premises where elderly people were maintained for profit, they would be authorised to enter these premises and conduct an inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not provide for registration. <Col N="915" /> It provides that where a complaint is made, the widest possible powers of inspection are conferred on the health authority concerned.  The main point is that if, by inspection, we establish that it is necessary to go further and ensure that before premises are opened for the care and maintenance of elderly people for profit, first of all, they will be subject to a character inspection, and the premises in which they propose to conduct their business will be inspected, then it is open to the Oireachtas to legislate to that effect.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the measure is to enable these very generalised complaints, which I hear from time to time, to be investigated, if necessary, in order to establish whether or not the abuses are so widespread as to warrant drastic restrictions upon the liberty of the person embarking on the enterprise.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  Now that it has had this somewhat frenzied passage through the Seanad, my approach will be found to be justified.  I am not wedded to it and if it appears that I am wrong and Senator Miss Davidson is right, then it is open to any successor of mine to introduce legislation and give his point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite pleased about the powers of inspection which the Minister has taken to himself, or put on the health authorities.  I am still worried, however, about how to initiate that inspection.  I cannot see how that is to be done.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1964&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be seen from the Long Title of the Bill, and from the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Senators, that this Bill arises in consequence <Col N="916" /> of the enactment of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960.  Part II of that Act rationalised local borrowing powers by giving local authorities a general power to borrow or lend for the purpose of any of their functions or duties, and provided for the control of such borrowing and lending. Section 9 of the Act precluded borrowing or lending by local authorities save pursuant to Part II of the Act.  When section 9 was under discussion during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, I intimated that I was considering the introduction of a Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Bill to repeal the earlier enactments empowering and regulating borrowing by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1960, the practice was that every statute enabling or requiring local authorities to perform a function or carry out works included provisions to authorise borrowing specifically for the purpose of performing that function or carrying out such works.  The statute usually regulated the manner of borrowing and in some cases the repayment of loans and related matters. All of these matters are now governed by the 1960 Act and the primary purpose of the present Bill is, therefore, to remove from the statute book the provisions which were rendered ineffective by the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>The provisions replaced by Part II of the Act of 1960 are contained in a multitude of enactments, reaching back in time for more than a century. It will be appreciated that the borrowing powers were associated in a good number of cases with enactments which are now in themselves ineffective or obsolete, having been superseded by modern legislation, or having otherwise become unnecessary through lapse of time.  Some of these enactments have been included in the schedule of repeals, where specific repeal seemed desirable and could be effected without widening unduly the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Bill, as I have stated, will be to remove from the statute book provisions which are, in fact, already spent or obsolete.  There is one divergence from this principle which I would like to mention.  It relates to grants by a local authority <Col N="917" /> to a vocational education committee under the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  That Act required the consent of the Minister for Local Government to the making of the grant, and gave power to borrow for the purpose of making a grant.  The function of sanctioning the borrowing has already been transferred to the Minister for Education by the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the proposed repeal of the relevant clauses in subsections (1) and (2) of section 51 of the 1930 Act will transfer to that Minister also the function of consent to a grant.  I would emphasise that, apart from this one exception, which is a logical sequel to the 1960 Act, the proposed repeals will remove from the statute book provisions which for one reason or another are no longer operative, and will effect no change whatever in current local government controls or practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a desirable Bill.  It deals with the vast complexity of financial provisions in Local Government Acts for just a century, from 1860 in the British days to 1900. Perhaps one would be allowed to say, in passing, that as we are clearing out a great deal of deadwood from these Acts, the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, is one of the most important Acts passed with regard to Ireland by the British Government. On my calculation, the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; or &ldquo;spent&rdquo; occurs nearly 150 times in the present Bill.  That is, we are taking nearly 150 cases, which are professionally obsolete or spent and removing them, that is, clearing away the deadwood.  It makes it easier for professional people, for local bodies, civil servants and everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister says, it is a measure of rationalisation.  Perhaps, since the Minister has put his hand to this work and a certain amount has already been done, something could be done with regard to consolidation of local government measures so that one can find local government law in one consolidated Act.  I know that would be by no means a simple matter to do but it is one of the things upon which this House might be usefully employed. We have done it before in certain <Col N="918" /> other cases.  I recommend to the Minister that it might be done in the case of local government as well.</P>
    <P>The Bill is eminently desirable.  The one exception which the Minister mentions, which deals with the Vocational Education Act of 1930, transferring certain powers of the Minister for Local Government to the Minister for Education throws light on some of the peculiar anomalies of our education system.  We have trouble at the moment about one particular part of it. One of the troubles is that primary, secondary and vocational education are in separate compartments with separate histories and nothing is being done about them much as the Minister is doing to rationalise them. Vocational education is partly under Local Government and partly under the Department of Education.  Perhaps the rationalisation of that matter which occurs here in the amendment of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, might get rid of some of our troubles with regard to teachers and examinations.</P>
    <P>However, so far as the Bill is concerned, we are in complete agreement with it.  I recommend to the Minister that, having gone this far, he might contemplate consolidating all local government law, and he might consider putting it in the hands of this House.</P>

      <P>We have gone quite far in the Electoral Act, 1963.  We have brought the housing loans and grants legislation fairly well up to date.  In the Planning and Development Act, which is not yet actually in operation, we have brought the law fairly well up to date.  We have had the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and we have had the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960. In so far as other measures are concerned, I can tell the House that various Bills are at various stages of preparation at the moment.  We have the <Col N="919" /> Electoral Petitions and Disqualifications Bill which is a hangover from the original larger measure which we have already enacted.  A Bill consolidating the electoral law is also being worked on, and there is a Bill which is quite far advanced to consolidate the local authority housing law.  We are also working on a Sanitary Services Bill. So I think the end which Senator Hayes has mentioned as being very desirable is well within sight.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains a number of provisions to improve the present arrangements relating to the circuit and district courts.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that the number of ordinary judges of the circuit court shall not be more than nine.  As the President of the circuit court carries out the full normal duties of a circuit judge, in addition to his other functions, the maximum number of circuit court judges will, in fact, be ten.</P>
      <P>In providing accordingly, the Bill does no more than restore the permanent strength of the circuit court bench to what it was up to August last when, under the existing law, the maximum number of judges fell to be reduced by one on the occurrence of a vacancy. After full consideration of the matter I am satisfied that, for the present at any rate, and at least for a few years to come, it will be necessary to have ten judges, including the President, in the circuit court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Following the reduction in the number of permanent judges in August last consequent on the retirement of Judge Binchy, the Government, in order to avoid the accumulation of arrears to an excessive extent, found it necessary to appoint a temporary circuit judge at the commencement of term last October and this appointment has been renewed periodically. In view of the objection in principle to having temporary judges for other than short periods, the Government decided that the appropriate course is to seek legislative approval to restore the number of permanent judges to that which obtained for many years up to last August.  It is the intention that when the strength of the circuit court Bench has been restored to ten, one of the judges will remain unassigned to a particular circuit.  The unassigned judge will be required mainly in the Dublin Circuit where there has been a sustained increase in the volume of work in recent years to such an extent as to require practically the whole-time services of three judges.</P>
    <P>The next provision is concerned with the reorganisation of the circuits of the circuit court.  Before I deal with that, I may mention that I am satisfied that no form of reorganisation would enable us to provide an efficient service without the tenth judge.  It may be that in some years time, the circumstances then prevailing will enable a reduction to be made; if so, the position can be reviewed and adjusted on the retirement of one of the judges.</P>
    <P>In the matter of reorganisation, it is proposed to give the Government power to alter the composition of the circuit court circuits, other than the Dublin circuit and the Cork circuit, by transferring counties from one circuit to another.  The immediate need for this provision is that experience has proved that the Northern Circuit, which was formed in 1960 by the amalgamation of the North Western with the North Eastern Circuit, is too heavy for one judge.  It will, accordingly, be necessary to transfer some of the work from the present Northern Circuits to adjoining circuits.  Senators will note that the provision is confined to alterations in the composition of the <Col N="921" /> circuits, and does not extend to any alteration in the total number of Circuits which will remain at eight. In view of the limited scope of the provision, it is considered reasonable that the Government should be empowered to make alterations of this kind without having to seek specific statutory authority on each occasion. The section provides for prior consultation between the Government on the one hand, and the President of the circuit court and any judge concerned on the other hand, in relation to any proposed alterations.  On general grounds, alterations will be confined to those required to provide an efficient service and a fair distribution of work.</P>
    <P>In relation to the district court, the Bill provides that the times at which justices of the district court may take vacations shall be at such times as may be approved of by the Minister for Justice.  This provision does no more than confirm the position which has obtained for the last 40 years. From 1924 until last year the vacation periods were subject to the prior approval of the Minister for Justice and this approval was given either in particular or general terms as circumstances made appropriate.  In 1963, however, it was contended on behalf of district justices that they had a right to take vacation at periods chosen by themselves without the approval of, or even consultation with, the Minister for Justice.  It is obvious that such a contention, if accepted, would make it impossible to arrange for the smooth running of the district court service, and could readily lead to chaos.  The provision in section 5 of the present Bill is designed to maintain the longstanding practice which has been operated in the public interest, and with due regard to the convenience of district justices.</P>
    <P>The next provision in the Bill relates to the transfer of trials in criminal cases by judges of the circuit court.  Since 1924, the position has been that either the accused or the Attorney General is entitled to apply, without notice, to the circuit judge to have the trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court which has <Col N="922" /> always sat in Dublin; and such applications must be granted.  The change proposed in the Bill preserves the existing absolute right to have a trial transferred from the circuit court to the Central Criminal Court, provided the accused or the Attorney General, as the case may be, gives at least seven days' notice before the trial of his intention to apply for the transfer. If either of the parties for any reason fails or neglects to give seven days' notice, the application for transfer may still be made and it will be in the discretion of the judge to grant or refuse it.  Up to now cases have in some instances been transferred without notice to the Central Criminal Court for no better reason than to secure an adjournment which had been properly refused, or to suit counsel or because the accused wanted to postpone the evil day.  There have, in fact, been some recent cases in which the grave inconvenience for many parties which arose from transfers without notice gave rise to justifiable criticism of the existing law.  The limited modification now proposed will not only obviate much of the present inconvenience and expense to witnesses, jurors and the police in respect of unnecessary attendances at the Central Criminal Court but will also facilitate generally the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The last provision relates to the service of circuit and district court documents by post.  These documents have normally to be served by summons servers appointed under section 44 of the Court Officers Act, 1926. While this arrangement has worked fairly well for very many years, the position is that in recent years, notwithstanding progressive increases in the annual salary paid to summons servers from the Exchequer and also in the fees payable direct to summons servers by parties requiring service, it has become increasingly difficult to attract suitable persons for appointment to the post of summons server.</P>
    <P>Indications are that unless the Exchequer is to be called upon to bear very much heavier charges for the service, together with substantial increases in service fees, it will be impossible to maintain this service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> I am satisfied that service of court documents by registered post is an arrangement which should now be introduced.  Registered post service has been operating in England for very many years, is an accepted idea on the Continent and is being provided in the Uniform Law on Arbitration now being drafted at Strasbourg, which it is hoped to have adopted in this country.  Service by this means is also provided for in some of our own Acts, namely, the Arbitration Act of 1954, the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, and the Charities Act, 1961.  It is also frequently allowed by judges in the circuit court, in areas in which no summons servers have been appointed. The provision in the Bill introduces registered post as the normal method of service for district and circuit court documents in areas in which there is no summons server.  The change-over, which will depend on vacancies for summons servers, will be a gradual one.  The various provisions I have mentioned are designed to improve the efficiency of our legal system, and I trust that the Bill will meet with the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced to deal with a number of matters.  First of all, it is to make provision for the appointment of an extra judge to the circuit court bench; secondly, to rearrange the circuits of the circuit court with particular reference to the northern circuit; thirdly, to deal with the vacation of district justices; fourthly, to impose conditions on the right of an accused person or the Attorney General to have a trial transferred from a circuit court to the Central Criminal Court, and lastly it is to make provision for the serving of circuit court documents and district court documents by post. I do not think this is an opportune time to appoint an extra judge to the circuit court.  Changes have been promised in the circuit court jurisdiction; we understand that workmen's compensation will be removed from the jurisdiction of the circuit court and handed over to the Minister for Social <Col N="924" /> Welfare.  If that comes about it will mean that the circuit court will be relieved of quite an amount of work. There is also a rumour that the malicious injury code as we understand it will be abolished.  If that happens it would also relieve the circuit court of a lot of work.  It is, therefore, possible that in the near future there will not be as much business to be done in the circuit court as there is at present.</P>
      <P>While dealing with this aspect, I should like to say that the jurisdiction of the circuit court should be increased and increased considerably.  It is several years since the jurisdiction was increased from £300 to £600 but since that increase took place there has been a big change in the value of money and £600 now is really a very inadequate jurisdiction for the circuit court.  It means that any claim for damages involving any matter of any seriousness must be decided upon in the High Court with consequent inconvenience, delay and considerable expense, particularly to country litigants.  I am expressing a personal view when I say that I consider that the time has come for a considerable increase in the jurisdiction of the circuit court.  It would lead to the provision of cheaper administration of justice and more convenience for litigants.  If that happens, as it inevitably must, there will then perhaps be reason to revise the position in the circuit court with particular regard to the number of judges, but it is time enough to do that when the occasion arises.</P>
      <P>Another point which I should like to make is that if there has been a considerable increase in the amount of work in the circuit courts in recent years it is due to the introduction of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which created new indictable offences.  That Act provided that where a person was guilty of dangerous driving, causing death or serious bodily injury, he must be returned for trial to the circuit court on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always held that that section was unwise and unnecessary.  In the first place, it created a new type of <Col N="925" /> offence, an offence which depended not on the act of the accused but on the consequences of that act.  A person could be guilty of frightfully dangerous driving yet might only damage a gatepost. If he were unfortunate enough to injure somebody, which, of course, he never intended, he is guilty of a much more serious offence and is sent for trial on indictment. How many days of circuit court time have been taken up with the trial of such indictable offences under the 1961 Road Traffic Act?  I should like the Minister to tell us also the number of people returned for trial since the coming into operation of that Act and the number of cases in which convictions were procured.</P>
    <P>These cases could, in my opinion, quite properly be dealt with in the district court where the accused person has the right of appeal to the circuit judge.  If that were attended to, it would mean there would not be as much work in the circuit court. Regarding the rearrangement of circuits, I understand from the Minister that this can only be done by the Oireachtas and that a section in this Bill is necessary to give him power to rearrange the circuits.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that the Northern Circuit, which this provision is primarily introduced to deal with, is much too large at the moment.  For many years there were two circuits. One comprised Sligo and Donegal and the other was made up of Monaghan, Cavan and Leitrim.  Some years ago the five counties were constituted one circuit and it is a fact that the circuit is much too large for one judge to deal with.  That has been recognised in this Bill and with that provision I am in entire agreement.  I understand, however, that two of these counties can be allocated to adjoining circuits without apparently over-burdening them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general rearrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think this alone can make the case for the appointment of another circuit judge at this stage.  The provision <Col N="926" /> regarding the times at which district justices may take holidays is a minor matter.  I agree with the Minister that perhaps the Department or the President of the district court should have a say in the matter of holidays for district justices, because otherwise you might have chaos: you might have the district court left without an adequate number of justices.</P>
      <P>I noticed the matter was raised in the Dáil as it seemed this might be regarded as a change in the terms of appointment of justices.  The Minister does not seem to think it is, but I venture to suggest that the 1960 Act or some statutory instrument of that date created a doubt in the matter and since then justices have felt themselves at liberty to take holidays when they like without referring to the Department or to the President.  If for some years they have been entitled to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Only last year.  It was only contended last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It arose out of an Act of a couple of years earlier. Justices who have been appointed since the change took place or since the Act was passed which made it possible for them to take holidays when they liked, would have grounds for saying their terms of appointment have been altered.  I should like to say I am in agreement with the provision in the Bill which seeks to make it a condition of the right of either the Attorney General or an accused person to have a trial transferred from the circuit court to the Central Criminal Court that either should give seven days' notice.  If either the accused or the Attorney General gives seven days' notice, then he is entitled as of right to have the trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  He is at the moment entitled as of right to have the trial transferred without any notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either is entitled at the moment to come into court on the morning of the trial and ask to have it transferred, and that request must be granted.  That has led to abuses and to absurd situations. In one instance, it worked out to the advantage of the Attorney <Col N="927" /> General who found himself without a witness in a case where an accused person had come back from another country to stand trial.  The Attorney General availed of this provision to get an adjournment there and then. The Bill as it stands gives the presiding judge the right to make the transfer notwithstanding that notice has not been given, but then it becomes a matter for the discretion of the judge and there is no absolute right in either the accused or the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The provision about the service of circuit court and district court documents is also reasonable.  Where the position of a summons server is vacant, the Bill provides that court documents may be served by registered post.  On the question of the number of judges, when I dealt with that earlier I overlooked the fact that for two years the President of the circuit court was absent in Cyprus and the work seemed to go on with the judges available, without any additional appointment.</P>
    <P>To summarise I am in agreement with all the provisions in this Bill with the exception of that relating to the appointment of an extra judge.  I would say that is unnecessary at the moment, that it is inopportune, and I suggest to the Minister he should consider the situation which will arise if and when workmen's compensation and malicious injury cases are taken away from the jurisdiction of the circuit court.  I invite the Minister to take steps to increase the jurisdiction of the circuit court specifically.  When all these things have been done the position will then be clear and he can come back to the Oireachtas with proposals dealing with the number of judges he considers necessary in the circuit court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this Bill in all its terms can commend itself to the House.  It is one of many steps that have been taken by the Minister to bring our courts and court procedure up to date.  A few years ago it was found that circuit judges in certain circuits had far too much work to do and in other circuits they had not perhaps <Col N="928" /> enough.  At that time the circuit areas were rearranged and it was considered that possibly there could have been one circuit judge less.  Experience, however, has proved that this was not possible.  The situation in certain areas got almost chaotic.  Most of us have had experience from time to time of attending circuit courts throughout an entire week and finding then that our cases have not been reached, and have had to come back again three months later to another circuit, or alternatively the judge is good enough&mdash;and most of them are very obliging&mdash;to try to get time some day in some subsequent week so as to suit everybody.</P>
      <P>The net result is that for some months past there has been a temporary circuit judge.  A judge should at all times be completely independent of the executive.  It is very wrong in principle to have a temporary appointment if it is at all possible to avoid, and certainly it is very wrong to have an extended temporary appointment which could or should be avoided.  I do not think that there is any reasonable possibility at the moment that the work of the circuit court could be done effectively without having the number of circuit judges for which provision is made in the present legislation.  Further, I do not feel that even if malicious injury claims or workmen's compensation be taken out of the jurisdiction of the circuit court it will make all that difference, because by then in all probability, with legislation growing as it is, with life and business relationships getting more complex as they are, there will be so many other matters to occupy the circuit court.</P>
      <P>Supposing it was then found there were too many circuit judges surely the converse of Senator Fitzpatrick's point would be more appropriate, that when a circuit judge resigns or dies legislation could then be introduced so that it would not be necessary to fill the vacancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other matters in the Bill, each and every one of them is necessary to provide for the smooth working of our courts.  The provision for the rearranging of circuits is not so remarkable.  A few years ago they <Col N="929" /> were rearranged and again today they have to be rearranged.  It seems completely inappropriate that on every occasion when circuits have to be rearranged the matter must come before the Houses of the Oireachtas for power to do so.  A general power is given here.</P>
    <P>Regarding vacations of the district justices, if district justices simply take vacations any time that suits themselves it is practically impossible. Many solicitors must arrange their own vacations when the local district justice is on vacation because in the country very many offices have only one solicitor in charge&mdash;they are not partnerships as a rule.  The same thing happens with many civic guards.  They are giving evidence in a case and the accused does not wish to have his case adjourned.  The whole situation could become completely chaotic if district justices could take their holidays any time they wished without prior arrangement with anybody or without consulting anybody's convenience other than their own.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transfer of trial from the circuit court to the Central Criminal Court, it is very appropriate that certain notice should be given in both instances, because most of us have had experience of perhaps only one or two days' notice and, on very rare occasions, of being told on the evening before the court that it is intended to transfer the trial to the Central Criminal Court.  Likewise, I fear that many of us possibly have been unfair to the Attorney General by not giving him adequate notice, perhaps through no fault of our own. Where it is obligatory on everybody to give seven or eight days' notice then all witnesses can be notified in time not to attend the court, and it will lead to less expense and more smooth running courts and a better arrangement of the rest of the list in the circuit court.</P>
    <P>The service of documents by registered post is a very normal and sensible procedure to adopt.  As matters are at the moment, one writes to the summons server to call; he calls; one hands him a document and asks <Col N="930" /> him to serve it.  He serves it, having had perhaps to travel three, four or five miles, and comes back and arrangements are made to have him make a statutory declaration and he hands back the document.  That is all very cumbersome and unnecessary.  It could be done so simply by service of these documents by registered post.</P>
    <P>I personally feel that this Bill in all its terms should commend itself to the House and I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as the Minister said in his opening sentence, is to improve the present arrangements relating to the circuit and district courts.  This being so, we all welcome it, but I should like to ask two questions in connection with it.  Is the Minister satisfied that much of the hold up in the law courts is not due to the cumbersome methods of reporting adopted at present?  Many people have said to me that a good deal of the delay in lawsuits is due to the method of simply taking down the evidence and to the various procedures.  Some people call those procedures antiquated; others have called them mediaeval.  I should like to ask the Ministerif he can give us some notion of whether his mind is moving in the direction of speeding up the administration of the courts on those lines.</P>
      <P>I shall not develop the theme&mdash;he knows very well what I am talking about&mdash;but a good many people in the country would be hoping that he could say to us that he would take effective steps to make the courts efficient in the business aspects of their work.  I should like him to call in some of those consultants in efficiency to consider the Irish courts as they work on the mechanical side of their procedures, and to give a report and to implement that report.  Perhaps the Minister has something of this kind in mind.  I personally, and many others, too, would be grateful if he could give us an assurance that these mediaeval procedures, as they are sometimes justly called, will be brought up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to raise is a matter of detail.  I am not entirely <Col N="931" /> satisfied that the provisions in section 7, subsections (3) and (4), for the service of documents by registered post are entirely satisfactory.  Perhaps, I do not see the full implications of these subsections and I would ask the Minister for clarification.  The documents are addressed, registered and posted.  The postman is given the registered letter to deliver.  Am I right in thinking he cannot deliver the letter unless he gets a signed receipt from the householder at that address?  If that is so, I am quite satisfied with the provisions.  I am not satisfied with the provisions, if he can simply drop the registered letter into the letter box and walk away.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, if I may, to take advantage of the Bill to make a plea for more uniformity in the administration of the law, particularly in the district courts.  I shall quote two cases which took place within the last week in support of that.  In one case a farmer was fined £10 and his driving licence was suspended for two years for driving at 40 miles an hour within the 30 mile speed limit. In another court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point raised by Senator Stanford, I would also appeal for a speeding up of the hearing of cases.  I refer especially to cases in the circuit court, particularly murder cases.  I saw cases where the accused has been walked around from one circuit court to another.  Recently, in this House, we considered a Bill in relation to the protection of animals and I am making an appeal here for the protection of accused persons, particularly in cases of murder.  The cumbersome methods of dealing with these particular cases <Col N="932" /> should be examined with a view to speeding up the procedures.  In most of those cases the accused person is brought to the local district court.  The following week he is brought to a district court 10 or 20 miles away and the week after that he is brought to a district court 22 or 23 miles away.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to have a more speedy way of dealing, not alone with murder cases, but with other cases.  It must be disconcerting for people to read that a person is being brought from one court to another or returned to a further court when the superintendent states he is not in a position to indicate when depositions will be taken in the case.  I should like to see a provision in the Bill for the speeding up of those particular matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the Minister considers there is a need for an additional judge.  We have nine judges and the President; that would make ten in all.  What is the reason for any extra judges?  Is crime on the increase?  I do not think it is.  Are the judges overworked? I do not think so.  If they are overworked, it would be well to explain how they are overworked in carrying out their duties.</P>
      <P>We certainly need a sufficient number of judges to administer the law but it would appear that they have not been putting in that extra time as compared with other workers in the State.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to explain more fully the justification for another judge.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to refer to is the transfer of trials.  I thought it was the judge who decided that.  I think, where a defendant is concerned, whatever his advisers consider advisable should be allowed to stand.  We have seen, from time to time, a first hearing may be in a court in the local area and suddenly it is transferred to another court.  I think trials should only be transferred for some very good reason.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that point also.</P>

I do not know if that is a wise suggestion. We should all like to see the work of the courts speeded up provided it was not done at the expense of justice.  I, for one, would prefer to see cases in courts given full consideration, long drawn out, if necessary, rather than see cases disposed of in a rapid manner with the people involved suffering as a result.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure about the suggestion that experts should be brought in to examine our judicial system. I do not think that is at all necessary. Our judicial system is as good as it is anywhere in the world.  We have judges and legal practitioners who I consider are second to none.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, I was not referring to actual judges and lawyers.  I simply referred to reporting and the procedure adopted for taking evidence and that kind of thing.  I made no reflection whatever on justices of the district court.</P>

      <P>I think that would be a matter of administration by the judges in the courts.  The procedure in the courts would be a matter which could be dealt with by the judiciary itself, in conjunction with the Minister and the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding about the number of judges envisaged in this measure.  As I understand it, we are just restoring the <i>status quo</i> by a provision for ten circuit court judges.  I am entirely in agreement with having one of these unassigned to any particular circuit court.  It could happen that there would be a very heavy volume of litigation in a certain part of the country and this unassigned judge would be able to deal with the extra volume of work.  That would be particularly the case in the city of Dublin where the population is increasing rapidly as the years go by.  I detected a note of inconsistency in the remarks passed by Senator Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick deplored the idea of increasing the number of circuit court judges at the present time, when, of course, we are not increasing the number at all. If the Senator is so concerned about not increasing the number of judges, then his suggestion that the jurisdiction of the circuit court should be increased from £300 to £600, or £1,000 or whatever figure he had in mind, would create more work for the circuit court.  The natural consequence would be that more circuit court judges would be appointed.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the provisions of this Bill are sensible, and should commend themselves to the members of this House.  There is one point to which I should like to refer before I sit down&mdash;the adjournment of sittings of courts down the country.  That should be avoided as much as possible. Such adjournments create very great inconvenience for the litigants, the lawyers and the general public. Adjournments create inconvenience and extra expense and I think it would be a good idea if the Minister and his Department would consider it advisable to issue a directive to the effect that postponement of sittings of courts, especially the district courts, should not take place except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am happy the Seanad as a whole welcomes the provisions in the Bill, with the possible exception, of course, of the provision that would enable us to make the present temporary judge permanent. I wish to emphasise what Senator Ó Ciosáin said and to demur in relation to the suggestion of Senator Fitzpatrick on the question of whether or not the Bill proposes to appoint an extra circuit court judge.  We are merely seeking to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, to maintain the number of judges in the circuit court at ten, the level it has been at for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision was taken in 1953 to reduce the number to nine, and that reduction was to take place on the first retirement.  The first retirement was <Col N="935" /> that of Judge Binchy and, if the decision of 1953 had been adhered to, Judge Binchy would not have been replaced and the number of judges would have been reduced from 10 to nine.  It became obvious to everybody, even before Judge Binchy retired, that this was an important concept and that, far from there being any possibility of carrying on with nine judges, the question which practitioners and others were asking was whether or not the circuit court would be able to carry on even with the full complement of 10 judges.</P>
    <P>We had no option, when the time came for Judge Binchy to retire, but to appoint a temporary judge to carry on in his place.  I have no hesitation in saying that no Senator in the House likes the idea of a temporary judge, particularly in the circuit court.  We now have to decide whether or not we are to continue keeping this judge in a temporary capacity or whether we shall make him permanent.  There is no doubt he is fully occupied at the moment, and the circuit court could not carry on without his services.  The only question to be decided is whether or not we shall make him a permanent judge of the circuit court and provide the legislation to enable us to do that, or whether we shall continue to retain him in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>If that is the issue, as I think it is, the answer is clear.  We are duty bound as a Legislature to get rid of the idea of a temporary appointment to the judiciary at any level, and provide the necessary basis for appointment in a full-time capacity.  It is all very well to say changes in contemplation will bring about a reduction in the volume of work in the circuit court one, two or three years from now. That may or may not be.  Certain changes are contemplated.  Whether or not they will result in any significant reduction in the volume of work in the circuit court is problematical because in both years mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick, the number of sitting days taken up by this type of case is limited and provides a small fraction of the total number of sitting <Col N="936" /> days.  Even if the Senator is right in suggesting that this particular type of case will be removed altogether from the ambit of the circuit court, it is doubtful, if it is removed at some time in the future, that we will even then be able to do with a lesser number of judges.</P>
    <P>No matter what happens about these matters, it is unlikely that anything concrete can emerge with regard to them for two or possibly three years. I must deal with the situation as I find it now.  I shall deal with it in support of and in sympathy with Senator Fitzpatrick's profession in this matter. I get many complaints from professionals in the courts about delays in the circuit courts, accumulation of work, and so on.  I must deal with that situation as I find it now.  If in the light of certain developments it transpires that in a year or two, or three, we can do with a lesser number of judges in the circuit court, the situation can be reviewed and dealt with in the normal way by retirements from the Bench.  One thing is crystal clear, and that is we need ten judges to do the work.  I am simply asking the Seanad to enable me to have ten permanent judges and not nine permanent and one temporary.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asked me more specific questions.  One was about practice and procedure in the courts and the other was about procedure in relation to the serving of notices by registered post.  First of all, with regard to the question of practice and procedure, I wish to tell the Senator we are doing something about this matter.  We established a Committee under a judge of the Supreme Court to examine the whole practice and procedure in our courts and make recommendations with regard to their improvement. The Senator will probably be glad to know in regard to one aspect of this matter about which one hears most complaints&mdash;the taking of depositions&mdash;that the Committee have submitted a report and that report will be published and laid on the Table of the Oireachtas in the next day or two. I do not know what action the Government may decide to take in relation to the recommendations in that report, <Col N="937" /> but I think it is clear we will be able to do something with a view to expediting the procedure in the preliminary hearing of indictable offences.</P>
    <P>I agree that the whole system of law reporting at present is not very satisfactory and I hope, when time and resources permit, to get something done about it.  With regard to the specific question of whether or not the signature must be procured for a letter sent by registered post, the position is a letter which has been proved to have been addresesd, registered and posted shall be deemed to have been served unless it is proved that it was not delivered. Of course, the proof of addressing, registering and posting, would be by statutory declaration stating, among other things, that the letter was undelivered, and was returned to the sender, so the position of the recipient will be fully protected in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the postal regulations but, so far as the law is concerned, the position will be that if a person can prove, and substantiate by statutory declaration, that the letter has been addressed, registered and posted, it shall be deemed to have been delivered unless the recipient can prove he did not, in fact, get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Senator supports me on the question of transfer of trials because the situation had become unsatisfactory. I think we have struck a nice balance between the necessity to have practical working of the system and, at the same time, the rights of accused persons.  We are providing that, provided seven days' notice is given, the accused shall have the absolute right to have his trial transferred <Col N="938" /> and even if he does not give seven days' notice he will still be able, at the discretion of the judge, to procure a transfer.  So I think his rights are reasonably protected.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Seanad will notice that we are imposing the same obligation on the Attorney General as on the accused so that the new order will apply to the accused and to the Attorney General equally.  Another aspect of the matter is that the necessity to grant the accused the right of transfer to the Central Criminal Court has become a little less important since it is now possible for the criminal court judge to transfer the trial from one part of his circuit to another.  As Senators know, the idea behind that originally was that the accused might feel it was impossible for him to get a fair trial in his own particular area. That gave rise to the provision that the trial could be transferred to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin. That necessity was weakened a little by the provision introduced some time ago whereby the circuit court judge could transfer the trial from one area within his circuit to another area within his circuit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if, in fact, it has been his experience that over some years past this provision was availed of more for transferring an action from the Dublin circuit court to the Central Criminal Court, than from what I shall call the country circuits to the Central Criminal Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the exact figures but it is true to say it was availed of to a large extent by people in Dublin transferring from the Dublin circuit court to the Central Criminal Court.  That was an absurd position because the only justification for a transfer of that nature is to get a different jury, and in Dublin the same jury panel applies to the Dublin circuit court as to the Central Criminal Court.  What I said originally in my opening remarks is largely true, that this provision was availed of irresponsibly from time to time, mainly in Dublin and also elsewhere in an effort, shall we say, to postpone <Col N="939" /> the evil day, or to get an adjournment which the judge in question had very properly refused.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick asked me specifically about the number of dangerous driving cases under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, since the commencement of the Act.  I gave this information recently in the Dáil in reply to a Parliamentary question.  The total number of cases to 30th September, 1963, was 455.  The number of convictions was 38, and 41 cases are still pending and undisposed of.  As the various other provisions of the Bill recommend themselves generally to the Seanad, I do not think it is necessary for me to comment any further on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought.  If 455 persons were returned for trial and only 38 convicted, the Minister would agree that would be a very small percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows, a fair amount of discussion about this section is going on at the moment.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

I can tell the Seanad that the Minister for Local Government is actively considering an amendment of the Road Traffic Act <Col N="940" /> in this respect and, indeed, in some other respects also.</P>
      <P>Finally, the main provision of this Bill is necessary, that is, the provision that enables us to continue to have ten judges in the circuit courts, and not to reduce the number to nine.  I ask the Seanad to accept that proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to confirm an Order entitled the Transport Act, 1950, (Additional Powers) Order, 1964, which was made by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the powers conveyed by section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950.  The Order requires to be confirmed by a Resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  Subject to confirmation by the Oireachtas the Order will enable CIE to establish a subsidiary company under the Companies Act to promote the development of air freight.</P>
      <P>CIE established an air freight for the handling of air cargo during the year ended 31st March, 1962 and provided an office and a warehouse at Shannon Airport for the purpose of developing the activities of the agency.  The Board's decision to enter the air freight business was influenced firstly by a desire to play an active part in the collection and delivery of air cargo both import and export, secondly to earn revenue from agency commissions in respect of air cargo and thirdly to be in a favourable position to provide the necessary Customs clearance, documentation and other facilitation measures ancillary to the handling of such traffic.  In this way the Board set out to provide an international &ldquo;door-to-door&rdquo; service for air cargo to and from any point in the State&mdash;a move in line with developments in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> In the light of experience since the establishment of its air freight agency over two years ago, the Board has decided that its interests in this field and indeed the interests of the air freight industry as a whole would best be served by the establishment of a separate subsidiary company to cater exclusively for this business.  The carriage of goods by air is growing steadily in importance.  At the present time, the volume of air freight between this country and other countries is not more than a small fraction of the volume of freight moving by land and sea but, in terms of value, air freight is not inconsiderable and as between this country and Britain, for example, it represents about 7 per cent by value of the total value of import/export trade.  CIE by virtue of its commercial contacts and the widespread transport network which it provides throughout the country, is especially well placed to provide an effective collection and delivery service for air freight for the community at large.  In addition to the facilities originally provided by the Board at Shannon Airport, the Board now has an office for the handling of air cargo at Dublin Airport, and is also participating in the promotion of air freight traffic through Cork Airport where the Board would also be interested in opening an office for this purpose if and when that step would be warranted by the volume of traffic arising.</P>
    <P>In order to participate effectively in the business of air freight forwarding, it is necessary to be in a position to consolidate cargo on the air transport services of the airlines who are members of the International Air Transport Association.  Consolidating simply means the bulking of a number of small consignments into one larger consignment which, by virtue of its overall weight, qualifies for a much lower freight rate.  This is an important incentive to the development of air freight, and any company wishing to play a full part in the air freight forwarding business, must be in the position to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by consolidation.</P>
    <P>In order that CIE's air freight forwarding <Col N="943" /> business may qualify for the recognition by the International Air Transport Association which is necessary to enable it to participate effectively in the air freight forwarding business, it is desirable for CIE to disassociate its air freight forwarding business.  For this reason CIE finds it necessary to establish a subidiary company to deal with the air freight forwarding business.  This, however, is but one of the reasons governing the Board's decision to establish the subsidiary company.  The business of air freight is a specialised business differing in various respects from surface transport and the Board considers that by divorcing the air freight activities from its normal day-to-day operations, the air freight business will have greater flexibility and will thus be enabled to make a quicker response to changes in an industry where changes in the pattern of development demand flexibility.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the decision of CIE to establish a separate subsidiary company to deal with the promotion of air freight is very much in the best interests of the air freight business.  As I have already mentioned, the new company will be established under the Companies Act.  Its powers will not, however, be any wider than the powers already being exercised by CIE in relation to air freight.  The new company will be subject to official control in many respects.  For example, the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the new company will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and of myself and no alterations may be made in the Memorandum and Articles of Association without my prior approval.  Furthermore, the exercise of the company's borrowing powers will be subject to my consent after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  This procedure is in line with that adopted in relation to the Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta, the CIE hotels subsidiary company, set up in 1961.  To the extent necessary to provide a statutory basis for control of the affairs of the new <Col N="944" /> air freight subsidiary company, the appropriate powers will be incorporated in future amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The capital of the new company will be nominal in character, 100 shares of £1 each, which will be taken up entirely by CIE.  The directors of the subsidiary company will be four members of the Board of CIE including the Chairman who will also act as Chairman of the subsidiary company; neither he nor the ordinary directors will be paid any remuneration for their services to the company. In the event of the appointment of a Managing Director, however, he may be paid such remuneration as the Board of the company, subject to my approval, may determine.  The name chosen for the new company is &ldquo;Aerlód Teoranta&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the present time in order further to encourage the development of air cargo through the airport, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is providing warehouse accommodation at the airport.  Initially, eight warehouse units each of 3,750 sq. ft. are being provided and these units are expected to be completed later this year.  The Development Company is undertaking a promotional campaign in the United States and in Europe to stimulate interest in Shannon as a warehousing and distribution centre and the taking of fuller advantages of the airport's strategic position in this respect.</P>
    <P>The total quantity of air freight terminating or originating at Irish airports, as distinct from transit traffic, rose from 19,325 tons in 1962 to 23,854 tons in 1963, an increase of 23 per cent.  The entry of CIE into this business in an effective way through the formation of a special subsidiary company should maintain and stimulate this rate of increase in the volume of terminal air freight handled at Irish airports.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend that the House should give its approval to the motion confirming this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should find no difficulty in giving approval to the motion confirming this Order because it would seem that this is a normal development for CIE into the <Col N="945" /> air freight business now that it has been carrying on the business of transport on the ground.  We could easily make a speech here on the future of air transport and so on but the Minister's statement has pretty well covered the ground and I do not propose to keep the House by repeating what has been said already.  I agree that this is a desirable development and we all hope it will meet with success.</P>

      <P>The existing legislation in regard to the guaranteeing of borrowing by the air companies is contained in section 75 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, as amended by section 3 of the Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Act, 1959, and provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee debentures issued by Aer Rianta up to a limit of £5,000,000. There is no provision for the direct guarantee by the Minister for Finance of borrowings by Aer Lingus.</P>

    <P>It is considered that Aer Lingus should be in a position to borrow direct from commercial sources, under the guarantee of the Minister for Finance, moneys required for its own purposes and it is proposed to provide for this and other matters in comprehensive <Col N="946" /> legislation which I hope to introduce later in the year in relation to the air companies.  As an interim measure, it is proposed to avail of the machinery of the State Guarantees Act, 1954, to provide the Minister for Finance with the necessary powers of guarantee.  I would propose on the enactment of the new legislation to have Aer Lingus Teoranta deleted from the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has ordered four short-haul jet aircraft, for use mainly on the company's continental services, and these aircraft are due for delivery next Spring.  Of the total cost of about £5 million, £2 million will be provided from the Exchequer by way of equity capital.  It will be necessary for Aer Lingus in the near future to borrow moneys from commercial sources towards the financing of the purchase of the short-haul jet aircraft and for other capital purposes.  Borrowing from commercial sources&mdash;provided the terms are reasonable&mdash;is to be encouraged as it reduces the demands for loans from the Exchequer.  The addition of the company to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act will facilitate the proposed borrowing as it will enable the borrowings to be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance would, of course, be prepared to give a guarantee only where he is satisfied with the terms of borrowing.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the State Guarantees Act, 1954 requires the Minister for Finance to lay an annual statement before each House of the Oireachtas giving details of each guarantee given by him under the Act and borrowings by Aer Lingus guaranteed by the Minister will be included in the annual statement.</P>

      <P>I have not seen this Order, but I gather the idea is to give more powers of borrowing to Aer Lingus&mdash;powers to borrow from the commercial banks and other financial sources.</P>

      <P>The only point I wish to make is that it might be no <Col N="947" /> harm&mdash;I happen to have been nominated by the Banks Standing Committee to the Seanad as well as by the Federated Union of Employers &mdash;to point out publicly, as the banks very often do not get credit, that the banks give considerable assistance to the State by underwriting loans.  It is rather interesting that in this case it is being made apparent to the public that State and semi-State bodies like Aer Lingus do lean on the commercial banks to a considerable extent.</P>
      <P>There are people who imagine that the banks do not play a big part in the economic life of the country. Neither are the public aware of the large sums called on to be lent by the commercial banks.  Such loans and such financial assistance take away from the amount of money the commercial banks have available for private enterprise, for the entire private sector of the economy.  I am not being critical of this motion&mdash;in fact, I approve of the powers being given to Aer Lingus to borrow because I think it is a worthy cause&mdash;but I am glad to be able to take the opportunity to draw the attention of the public to the help commercial banks give to the Government directly, and to the nation indirectly, in helping State and semi-State bodies in a financial way.</P>

      <P>Senator McGuire is right in saying that in regard to our air company, the banks have been of assistance&mdash;so have the insurance companies&mdash;in providing loans for improvement purposes.  The purpose of this Order is to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings on a scale not at present possible because, as I have already indicated, under present legislation the Minister for Finance is not enabled to guarantee borrowings from private sources and has been only able to guarantee debentures issued by the company.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance reviews the terms.  The Minister for Finance has to examine the terms under which the air company will borrow before he sanctions a guarantee in the usual way.</P>

      <P>We are in a bit of difficulty in regard to No. 10. The Minister is engaged and, anyhow, feels that the debate on this motion will be the same as on the Pensions Bill which has now been passed by the Dáil and which will be before the Seanad at its next sitting.  Would it be possible to vary the order and adjourn discussion on the motion until the Pensions Bill is before us?  The two can be taken in conjunction.</P>

The motion enshrines a principle in which many people are interested&mdash;the principle of keeping pensions in step with increased salaries.  If I am granted that privilege, I have no objection to adjourning consideration of the motion.</P>
