      <P>The following message has been received from the President of the United States of America:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was profoundly moved by the resolution of sympathy of Seanad Éireann on the death of the President.  I would like, on behalf of the American people and my Government, to express my appreciation for this action.</P>
      <P>John F. Kennedy devoted his energies to the great cause of peace with freedom and justice and I know his fondest wish would be for us to survive to carry on with this task for which he in fact gave his life.</P>
      <P>I am sending a copy of the resolution of Seanad Éireann to Mrs. Kennedy for I am sure she will appreciate its sentiments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I feel sure the Seanad would like to have the message incorporated in the proceedings of the House.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(g) prescribe requirements as to the description of homes in written communications and the display in homes of notices specified in the regulations.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was in Committee, I said during discussion on Senator Stanford's amendment that, without committing myself in any way to accepting the amendment, I would consider how far I could go to meet his point of view.  This amendment represents the extent to which I have found myself able to do so.  The purpose of it is to enable the Minister to prescribe that notification will be given in a specified form to those who may wish to avail of the services of a home that the local authority concerned have been notified of the existence of such a home.</P>
      <P>I have not, at the moment, formulated the exact terms of the regulations to this effect which I propose to make, but I can say that the amendment will at least ensure that those who entrust friends or relatives to the care of a person will know that the local authority concerned have had notification of the existence of the premises in which such person is maintained and that, if necessary, they may call the attention of the local authority to any complaint they may have in relation to the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may speak on this point for a moment, we understood earlier on that in Section 2 &ldquo;may&rdquo; had the effect of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I think the point raised in the amendment in Senator Stanford's name and in mine has been met by what the Minister has said and by the amendment he has put down.  If I understood the Minister correctly, he will, in effect, produce such regulations as will in due course make the point effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I should like it to be quite clear that the regulations will not be in anything like the form which the Senator's amendment suggested.  It will, however, have the effect that the name of the proprietor of the home will be carried on the notepaper and that all stationery issuing from the home will also carry a statement that this home has been brought to the notice of the health <Col N="333" /> authority under the Act.  It will also bear particulars of the name of the person to whom further communications in relation to the home should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>One point of importance is that there is some certificate or some statement available in the home itself so that a person going into the home is able to see, apart from the notepaper, that the home has been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation will provide that there will be displayed in a prominent place a notice stating that the health authority has been notified of the existence of the home in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no relationship between amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 4.  The former, as I see it, gives the Minister power to prescribe requirements as to the description of homes in written communications and the display in homes of notices specified in the regulations. That is perfectly all right.  It means that if a person running one of these homes has letter headings or billheads, the Minister can prescribe what will go on these.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should accept amendment No. 4 but to say that amendment No. 1 meets amendment No. 4 is, I think, entirely incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said it represented as far as I could go&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Senator Ross had stated that amendment No. 1 was meeting the case of amendment No. 4. Amendment No. 4, as I see it, seeks to insist that each home be inspected after notification has been given to the health authority and that a certificate be issued by the health authority saying it has been inspected and is satisfactory.  In effect, that, in my opinion, is registration.  I am only making the point to clarify the two amendments as they appear to me.  I am not to be taken as supporting amendment No. 4 because I made my position perfectly clear on that matter on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am personally grateful to the Minister for going so far.  What it amounts to&mdash;and I should like to assure the House on this&mdash;is that we shall have a certificate displayed in a prominent place in these homes.  If we get that, it is quite a considerable step forward.  What we shall not get, I take it, is the inspection. I should like to get that inspection; we are not going to get it and so I think the best thing to do is to express our limited but sincere gratitude to the Minister in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>How is the Minister to give a certificate if he does not have an inspection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct that point if I may.  There will not be a certificate in the sense in which the Senator has used the word.  What will happen is that a person running a home will be obliged to display on the notepaper a statement that the health authority has been notified of its existence. I may go further and require the proprietor to state that any complaint to be made in regard to the premises should be addressed to the health authority.  That will make every person concerned aware that there is an authority which can investigate complaints about conditions in the home.  If necessary, arising out of a complaint, a health authority, having received a reasonable complaint, can have the home inspected but I am not conceding the point that the home must be inspected before a complaint concerning it has been made, or that there will be a certificate to the effect that it has been inspected displayed anywhere.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>May we take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together?</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(g) provide for the conduct of interviews (including interviews in private) of persons (including staff) in a home where the health authority have reasonable cause <Col N="335" /> to believe that a person in the home is not receiving proper care,&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is the best I can do to meet the point of view which has been put forward in amendment No. 3.  I think that is as far as any person can go.  It must be a reasonable complaint and a <i>prima facie</i> case must be made and established by some responsible person.  If that is the case, then the inspector investigating the complaint and inspecting the home may interview in private not merely a patient but a member of the staff, if he feels it necessary to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say &ldquo;the inspector inspecting the homes&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who follows up the complaint.  If a complaint is made, the home has to be inspected but the inspection will follow the complaint; it will not precede it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask who would make the complaint in the case of a person who had no relatives?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know&mdash; some person, any person, a kind person, a person concerned with the condition of a particular patient.  It might, perhaps, even be made by letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the patient were put in a home perhaps by an institution in England?  I think there is an association, referred to in the letters the Minister sent, through which&mdash;if I understand it correctly&mdash;relatives of service people are put in homes when they are ill or aged.  How would that person convey a complaint if he or she were unable to write?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I cannot answer that nor do I think anybody could answer it.  It would depend upon the circumstances and the person's ability to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong but I had thought that the Minister for <Col N="336" /> Health was there to help the least of our people in cases of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an honest and sincere attempt to meet a point of view which I thought was sincerely held but I shall not press the amendment if the Senator is not satisfied with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in to thank the Minister most graciously for this amendment but when I heard on a previous amendment that there is no inspection, I am a little unsure if this amendment is workable.  At first glance, it appears to be practically what I want but a lone person in a home has no contact with the outside world.  I am not being awkward: I am sincerely trying to help a person such as myself, say, if I had no relatives and if I were being badly treated or not treated at all in a home of this kind into which some organisation, to which some of my relatives have contributed before they disappeared, had enabled me to go.  What is my contact with the outside world?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt&mdash;I think the Senator mentioned an organisation which was responsible for sending patients to homes here.  As far as I am aware, that organisation has a representative who regularly visits any home to which the annuitants of the organisation are sent for treatment and any complaint that should be made could be made to that representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  I am glad to know that; I did not know.  It still leaves a little doubt in my mind.  Again to refer to myself, I do not belong to any organisation.  I do not see anybody paying for me.  I could see myself being in such a situation and I feel that I would be very lost.  I am sorry that on looking it over again, I do not think I would care to be responsible for accepting the Minister's amendment, although, as I have said, at first sight I did think it gave me what I wanted.  When the Minister says that there is no inspection at official level, I am extremely doubtful of its value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="337" />
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Miss Davidson has put her finger on the point when she asks as to who would make a complaint, who would establish that there were reasonable grounds for complaint in respect of an old person who had no relatives, no visitors, nobody to look after him and who is put away in a home like this.</P>
      <P>We might remind ourselves that what the Seanad is dealing with is a complaint that some homes&mdash;a very small minority&mdash;operating for old people are not up to a proper standard. It is that sort of home that we have been pressing the Minister to deal with.  The ultimate result of this Bill appears to me to be that the homes which are good will continue to be good but that there is nobody to make the complaint, nobody who will inspect, nobody who will put pressure on the small number&mdash;I hope it is a small number&mdash;of places where the standard is not good, where proper attention is not paid to people and where people have been left who have no relatives or who have relatives who do not accept responsibility or have not a great deal of care for them.</P>
      <P>I am very unhappy about the small degree the Minister has come to meet us in this respect.  He has given an explanation for the other amendment to which we have just agreed.  Taking these two together as they appear on the paper, they seemed to amount to more than the Minister now indicates they will amount to in actual fact.  I thought in relation to the first amendment that there would be a certificate or some sort of indication in the hall of such a home that the home had complied with standards, that it had been inspected by the authority and was up to the standard required by the local authority.  The Minister has indicated that that is not his intention, that he will not make regulations along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment we are told that reasonable grounds for a complaint have to be established and Senator Miss Davidson rightly asks who will move in respect of an old person who has no relatives or who has relatives who are not bothering about him or <Col N="338" /> visiting him.  It is quite right that we should expect the Minister to have regard to those helpless individuals, even though they may be few in number. I do not think that under this Bill or the regulations the Minister will make under this Bill, he will go to the extent that is necessary in order to provide for those people.</P>
    <P>I shall be returning to the point on the next amendment, No. 5, which, to my mind, is a much more satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on Report and I have been rather disorderly in rising on two or three occasions.  If I am to rise now, I should like to rise to conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister to conclude.  The House understands that amendment No. 3 is also under discussion&mdash;amendments Nos. 2 and 3?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to press the point that Senator Murphy and Senator Miss Davidson are absolutely right about this.  The fundamental weakness in the Bill is this lack of inspection and we must press it as far as we can at this stage.  The case has been made of a helpless person without anyone to complain for him. These are the very cases this House should keep very strongly in mind and I agree with Senator Murphy and Senator Miss Davidson that this amendment does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am in order, I should like to say that I understood the Minister to suggest that he might not press this amendment.  If by that he means that he is contemplating withdrawing the amendment, I think it would be a mistake because the amendment as it stands is, in my opinion, an improvement on the Bill and the Bill would be better with this amendment than without any amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, an inspection <Col N="339" /> will take place only when the health authority has reason to believe that there is necessity to check up on a particular institution.  The inspecting authority is the local health authority. On the local health authority there are public representatives and I assume that if a complaint of a general nature were made by a public representative or by any other responsible person to the health authority, the institution concerned would then be inspected. Under the Bill as it stands, the inspecting officer might not have authority to interview an inmate of the institution alone or to interview a member of the staff of the institution alone and in private.  The amendment as it stands will give such authority to an inspecting officer in case of an inspection. That in itself is an improvement and a valuable addition to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me a good deal of stress has been laid on what may happen in very rare cases.  A previous speaker has said that the number of homes that would be guilty of ill-treating old persons is very small, and we all believe that.  The number of persons who would have no relatives, no organisation or nobody to look after them from the time of their admission to the home would be very small.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide that homes may be inspected if a complaint is made. Complaints may be made by the staff of such homes.  It is not possible to close the mouths of everybody.  If a person is ill-treated in an institution, that cannot continue for very long. There are public representatives on the local health authority.  There are various social bodies interesting themselves in the welfare of lonely and elderly people.  Such persons would always be able to investigate complaints. It would be a pity at this stage to over-emphasise rare cases.  I should not like to trammel the 95 per cent or 98 per cent of homes which are doing excellent work by making them liable to inspection by local authorities and others and thereby hinder the work they are doing.  It would be a reflection on them.  Inspection would not solve the problem.</P>

      <P>Apparently some magic is thought by some Senators to reside in the word &ldquo;inspect&rdquo;.  This amendment No. 2 is being rejected because it does not provide for inspection. Inspection in what circumstances? In the circumstances in which an irresponsible person may make any allegation about a home and then the whole machinery of the local administration is to be brought to bear <Col N="341" /> upon the unfortunate individual who owns the home and operates it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Senator with great respect and now I should like him to try to listen to me. The one thing I have found in connection with this problem of premises in which the elderly and infirm are cared for is that I have heard many general allegations concerning the conduct of these homes and I have challenged from time to time those who have made these allegations to prove that there is some substance in them.  Some couple of years or more ago, perhaps.  Senator Miss Davidson brought to my notice three homes.  It was found by my officers that there was no substance in the complaints when they brought in the people who made them.  First, they found that some of these homes were approved premises under the Maternity Homes Act.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have misrepresented Senator Miss Davidson in the matter.  I am speaking from a hazy recollection of some correspondence with her some time ago.  If she says she did not mention any homes to me then I am completely in error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion the Bill was discussed here, a letter was read out making allegations against certain homes.  I did not follow those up; I did not have any inspection of the homes carried out.  I thought that if this Bill went through, then, if abuses such as were alleged to exist, did in fact exist, a responsible organisation would take <Col N="342" /> care to bring the premises in question under the notice of the health authority, and so I did nothing about the letter.  But the fact that the names of their nursing homes had been mentioned in this House in connection with this Bill came I think to the notice of two people and they wrote to me.  I have sent a copy of the correspondence in that matter to Senator Crowley.</P>
    <P>I would read, for the information of the House, what was written to me by the two persons whose homes were mentioned in the course of the debate. Here is one which was addressed to the Secretary of the Department of Health:</P>
    <P Just="Right">4 Willow Bank,&nbsp;</P>

    <P>The Secretary,</P>
    <P>Dept. of Health.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>It was with shock and dismay that I read in the Senate Debate of December 11th, 1963, that this premises (a Home for retired people) was submitted by Senator Crowley to Mr. MacEntee, Minister of Health, in a letter dated August 1st, 1962, from the Irish Nurses Organisation, to be a Home that was unsatisfactory and in need of investigation and without night attention.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of who the person or persons might be that made these grave allegations to the Irish Nurses Organisation and why the said Organisation made no attempt to investigate them before submitting such reports to any member of Seanad Éireann.  I hope that these references to my home may not have any effect on my livelihood.</P>
    <P>In 1943, I qualified at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, and subsequently held many responsible posts, including a permanent position at St. Kevin's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The writer of the letter continued:</P>
      <P>After my husband suffered a severe financial crash in business in 1957 I was compelled to take in retired people.  Having worked very hard I established an excellent business, and from any source of income continued to improve my property with the building of an additional bedroom, wash-up and toilet on hall floor.  Later I had central oil fired heating installed throughout the Home.</P>
      <P>Finding some of my residents more helpless and in need of round the clock supervision, from August, 1961 I have had constant night attention.  In addition, at all times I was in residence; if on holiday, a qualified Nurse was available.  Prior to August, 1961, in the event of night duty being necessary, it was available, at no time did any of those placed under my jurisdiction be neglected.  I realised my first duty was to them, to their next of kin and to God.</P>
      <P>My staff and I are thoroughly devoted to the care of the aged and infirm.  The premises are kept clean and at all times open to inspection. Meals are served punctually and the menu is varied.  Evidence of the high esteem of which this accommodation is regarded is available to the Minister in the enclosed letters.  I also enclose a list of Doctors who are in attendance here and can furnish the Minister with further reference if required.  The Sisters of St. Michael's Hospital have visited here, various representatives of the Royal United Kingdom Beneficent Association, London, Drs. Fitzgerald and McCracken from the Award of Courts and finally an inspector of the Adoption Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would give me great pleasure to welcome a visit from the Minister <Col N="344" /> or an official of his Department. Then I could prove to the Irish Nurses Organisation that their allegations were false and without foundation.</P>

      <P>This letter is addressed to the Secretary of the Department of Health.  The address is <Col N="345" /> St. Jude's, 18 Clarinda Park East, Dún Laoghaire, 10th January, 1963, and reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I am writing on behalf of my partner (Mary I. Long) and myself, who are both deeply shocked and distressed on reading in the Seanad Report (Wed. 11th Dec.) a letter from the Private Nurses' Section of the Organisation (Date 1st August, 1962) addressed to Mr. Crowley&mdash; referring amongst others to our Home St. Jude's, 18 Clarinda Park East, Dun Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>These allegations are completely unfounded.  We are both trained State Registered Nurses and have a very wide and varied experience in all branches of nursing, especially with old people.</P>
      <P>Our Home at all times has been well run, respectable, and never left without one or other on duty (day and night).</P>
      <P>Our Home is well equipped, H &amp; C. each room. Electric bells. Carpets. Everything for the care of the aged.</P>
      <P>A resident maid.  Daily woman. We never pretended to be a Nursing Home, mostly paying guests are our main source.  We have had old people, who became ill and in failing health.</P>
      <P>We immediately had night attention provided, or on Doctor's orders, removed to hospital.</P>
      <P>We have been established here for the past 15 years; returning from England after years of nursing and war service.  For reference I quote&mdash;</P>
      <P>then follow the names of several doctors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>who have supported us for the past 15 years and you can refer to them for reference.  May I add our premises are open to inspection at any time.  We gladly invite you to inspect.  We would also like proof and names of informant.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for permitting me to refer to these letters because, since the complaint is on the records of this House, the refutation of the complaint in the cases of these two homes should also be on the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> I want to go further.  I want to draw the moral from that.  I have on several occasions challenged those who made the allegation that there are homes in which the inmates are treated inhumanely.  I have said that no person has ever brought an allegation of that sort which, on investigation, could be substantiated.  I do not think we are warranted in instituting a system of inspection in the case of any premises, any home, or any undertaking unless the facts will justify giving authority to a servant of the State or the local authority to enter into what are private premises and to inspect and investigate them and to contact and interrogate the people who happen to reside on these premises.  It seems to me at any rate that there would be the possibility that the rights of private individuals would be very gravely infringed by that sort of procedure.  Therefore, until I am satisfied that a case has been established for the inspection of places of this sort I am not going to accept the principle that a nursing home can be inspected in the way suggested here that it should be, without any facts being given, any well-founded facts which would justify such an inspection.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have said here that I will oppose inspection and oppose registration until at least we have seen how this Bill works out.  I have said the measure may not be the last word&mdash;it may be the last word but it does not inevitably follow that it is.  If, as a result of its operation, it is found that we must go further, then some other Minister for Health will go further.  At the moment I am not prepared to do it.  That is why I have strenuously opposed the idea that we must inspect and register these homes because if we do it in the case of these homes where are we going to stop?  Are we going to go into the reputable private hospitals in this city and inspect them and call to account those responsible for the treatment of this, that, or the other person, or are we going to call to account the doctors who patronise these homes? It is all very well to talk about inspection but we must bear in mind the <Col N="347" /> consequences that will flow from these inspections and you cannot treat the premises to which this Bill relates and those who operate them as conforming less to the general standards of humanity and decency than any other similar institution might.  Therefore, I oppose these amendments.</P>
    <P>Let us take these two amendments. Senator Stanford and Senator Murphy both suggested there were grave differences between the purport of both amendments.  It seemed to them that there was some vital principle embodied in amendment No. 3 which was absent from amendment No. 2. What does amendment No. 3 say?  We will take it first.  It says that a person authorised by regulations may visit and interview in private any person in the home.  That is the first thing that amendment No. 3 proposes.  What does amendment No. 2 propose?  This amendment which according to the Senators differs so radically from amendment No. 3 says the Minister may make regulations to provide for the conduct of interviews (including interviews in private) of persons, includng staff, in a home.  But the Minister can only make regulations for this interview and this visit where the health authority have reasonable cause to believe that a person in the home is not receiving proper care.</P>
    <P>I am sure that no Senator will say that this whole process of inquisition and interrogation should be undertaken in a case where the health authority is not satisfied that there was reasonable cause to undertake it.  Yet that is what is implied by those who have been supporting this amendment.  The amendment seems to take the view that whether there is cause or not for seeking inspection the inspector can, on his own volition, interview in private any inmate of the home or any member of the staff.  I contend that this would be a serious infringement of the liberty of the citizen.</P>
    <P>What is the other part?  Part (b) of amendment No. 3 provides that this authorised person may visit the premises in any case where the person so authorised has reasonable cause to <Col N="348" /> believe that a person in the home is not receiving proper care.  What can be the difference in practice between empowering an individual who, having been authorised by a local authority, has reasonable cause to believe something and empowering the health authority itself when it has reasonable cause to believe?  The expression &ldquo;health authority&rdquo; in this case connotes the officers of the health authority and any member of the health authority who makes a complaint to the manager will, of course, be regarded as a responsible person.  I was asked who will make the complaint and I answered quite frankly that I did not know.  Certainly I do not know who will make the complaint in the case of a person who is friendless and without relatives, but is a person who is friendless and without relatives likely to be in a home where she or he is being maintained for profit?  Of course he is not.  Someone will have to foot the bill.</P>

      <P>They may have money themselves.  That is not unknown, is it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have money themselves.  One cannot, of course, legislate to cover purely hypothetical conditions <i>ad infinitum.</i>  We have to consider the matter as reasonable people living in the world as we know it.  A person, of course, may have money of his own.  Is it likely he will keep that money in the home? Is it not much more likely he will keep it in the bank?  Is the bank manager not likely to have some interest in his client?  Perhaps he will have a solicitor.  Perhaps he will be a ward of court.  One can reduce this measure to an absurdity by providing for every circumstance which may, but is not likely to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have to consider is the day-to-day operation of these places. If a person is maintained in a home, which is run for profit, then that person will be paying for maintenance in that home and can legitimately complain. If the person is being paid for, then it is more than probable that those who are paying for that maintenance will make a complaint if that person is not being properly treated. <Col N="349" /> There must be more than one inmate in a home before it can come within the scope of this measure.  There may be two, three or four.  Will they not all be in the same circumstances?  Conditions which apply to one will apply to all and there will, therefore, be several sources from which a complaint can emanate if, by any chance, conditions are not what they ought to be.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for an interview in private.  Amendment No. 2 provides for the making of regulations which will enable interviews to be held in private.  Not merely a patient but any member of the staff may be interviewed in private.  It provides that this will take place only in cases in which the health authority has reasonable cause to believe that a person in the home is not receiving proper care.  What is the difference?  The difference is that my amendment is a much more flexible amendment.  Within the limits of the regulations, we will be able to cover every conceivable case which is likely to be met in practice.  I defy anybody to go further than that and to write into a statute a definition which will cover every conceivable case and yet be flexible enough to cover all the types of premises to which this Bill may apply. On the other hand, we will be able to amend readily our regulations if it is shown that such amendment is necessary and we can give much more thought to the framing of them than can be given to it here.  We can frame the regulations in such a way as to cover every possible contingency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, on this Stage, to deal with what is in the Bill, not what we should like to see in the Bill.  Inspection is, in fact, in the Bill, but not compulsory registration.  There is provision for inspection before registration.  There is provision to enable a local authority to see to it that an establishment is up to the standards prescribed by the Minister. We have heard this afternoon about homes which maintain they are up to a reasonably good standard.  I hope it is correct that they are up to a proper standard and that their desire will be to comply with the regulations the Minister will eventually make.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, I think, left the House with the impression that anybody who is anxious about the care of elderly people, who has heard complaints, and who voices these complaints, is irresponsible.  Miss Davidson has made such a complaint. I think the Minister thinks Miss Davidson irresponsible.  However, he backed down a bit and said she was a bit too credulous.  No doubt Senator Crowley is also irresponsible.  We have heard the replies read from some of the people whose homes were mentioned when we debated the Committee Stage of this Bill.  Might I remind the House, as inspection is in the Bill to a limited extent, that Senator Crowley was making the point that without registration, it was clearly impossible for anybody to satisfy himself that these abuses do not exist?  He was pressed and urged by the Minister to put on the Table of the House the names of the establishments about which complaints had been made to Senator Crowley.  I do not think Senator Crowley did this irresponsibly. I do not think he rushed into speech or print about it.  He was urged by the Minister.  The Minister was making the point that he had no evidence of these complaints at all, and I think Senator Crowley then grudgingly put this information before the Minister.  I am sure Senator Crowley will be equally delighted to know that these establishments are up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we going to have inspection of these establishments?  Is the Minister <Col N="352" /> or the local authority going to satisfy themselves that, in fact, these establishments are up to standard?  If an organisation like the Irish Nurses Organisation say they have complaints from their members that these establishments are not up to standard&mdash;this was mentioned in the House; a reply has been quoted and it is perfectly right that a reply should be read here by the Minister&mdash;is the Minister going to accept the invitation of these people, the few who have replied, and satisfy himself that their establishments are up to a reasonable standard?</P>
    <P>It does not require and has not required up to now any legislation by the Minister to accept the kind invitation issued by these people to go along himself or send some of his officials to visit these places.  I am sorry the Minister has not done so.  It would only be correct and just that, after these charges had been made, the Minister could come here this afternoon and say he had accepted this invitation, that he had somebody go out and that he could categorically state to the House that these homes were of a good and reasonable standard.  Even now, when the Bill eventually weathers the storm that, I am sure, awaits it in the Dáil, will these homes that have been mentioned be inspected?  Can we be assured that anybody making an allegation or a complaint, such as the Irish Nurses Organisation and Senators and Deputies, will not be regarded as irresponsible? Can we be assured that the Minister will urge on the health authorities that these inspections be made, see to it that the terms of this Bill, as it will eventually come from the Dáil, will be applied and that at least the limited number of homes which will be inspected will be up to a reasonable standard?</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy has saved me the trouble of commenting at any great length on this Stage, but there is one point on which I should like to be very clear, particularly in view of the correspondence which the Minister has put on the records of the House.  Like Senator Murphy, I welcome the spirit of these people who saw fit to write in and put their position <Col N="353" /> in order on this matter.  But this must also be said: I am perfectly satisfied that in communicating with me in August, 1962, the Irish Nurses Organisation were not acting in any one of these individual cases mentioned out of any spirit of malevolence or malice of any kind.  I am satisfied that an organisation such as this, a well-organised, responsible trade union, representing one of the most important sections in our public service, were but conveying to me obvious complaints which had been lodged with them by some of their members.  In communicating that information to me as a public representative, I am satisfied they were not acting out of malice and had no intention of doing more than what was their plain duty.  I, in turn, had no other intent when I very reluctantly agreed to have that letter put on the records of the House at the insistence of the Minister and some Senators on the other side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated on another Stage that the Bill was introduced for the purpose of dealing with possible cases of hardship or neglect in these homes.  The Bill is sufficient to do that, for the time being at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to Sections 1 and 4.  Section I defines a &ldquo;home&rdquo; and excludes from the definition of a home premises in which no incapacitated person is maintained for private profit.  The Minister seems to think that means that if any person pays his way or is paid for in such a home, that home is brought outside that exception. For what my opinion is worth, I disagree with the Minister in that. The Bill applies only to what I will describe, for want of a better term, as commercial homes&mdash;homes run for private profit.  I think it does not apply at all to what I would call charitable institutions run by communities or other groups of charitable people. Even if a charge is made for the maintenance of people in that home, that is not a charge for private profit.  This is a charitable institution, but it has to get money to discharge its charitable obligations.  However, I say such a home cannot be said to be maintaining <Col N="354" /> a person for private profit.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the case made by the Minister in support of Section 4, particularly subsection (2), falls to the ground.  The Minister made the case that it was necessary for him to take power to grant exemption to any home from the provisions of the Bill because a home might not be able to bring itself within the exception mentioned in subsection (1) of Section 1.  Section 4 (2) of the Bill as it stands reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, on the application of any home, grant exemption from the provisions of this Act to that home.</P>
    <P>On principle I oppose that provision because it is too wide.  It gives the Minister power to nullify the provisions of the Bill by a stroke of his pen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator misunderstood me when he seemed to think that, when I was referring to a home in which an incapacitated person was being kept for private profit, I felt I was covering homes in which people might be maintained for reward, that is to say, that this did not exclude these charitable institutions to which the Senator referred where a person might be maintained for a small sum or a small fee which would not permit of the person operating the home making a profit but which might merely be a contribution to his keep and would not be sufficient to fully provide for the person.  These are the charitable homes which the Senator has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister but I think the Minister said several times on the Committee Stage discussion on Section 4 of the Bill that there were cases of institutions which were, generally speaking, charitable institutions but in which some person was paid for because a trust fund had been set up or because he had money or some relative had paid for him.  Certainly the Minister gave me the impression that even if one or two such persons existed it would exclude the home from the exception to which I have referred and I respectfully disagree with the Minister.</P>

      <P>All right, but I am advised to the contrary.  That is why the provision went in, in order to make certain we were covering that case.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the remarks of Senator Murphy.  Senator Murphy is the most astute debater I have listened to for a long time and I know no person who can create a smokescreen or muddy the waters with the same dexterity and <i>expertise</i> as he does.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the case of these two homes in respect of which letters had been written to me, and Senator Murphy proceeded to suggest to the House that in one way or another I had lured Senator Crowley to commit an indiscretion here in the Seanad.  I am paraphrasing Senator Murphy's remarks.  I wish to deny that absolutely. I am perfectly certain I could not induce Senator Crowley to say anything he was not prepared to say, that I could not trick or dupe him into being indiscreet in any way.  I think I should refresh Senator Murphy's mind about what did take place on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I am quoting from column 124, volume 57, of the Seanad Debates of the 11th December, 1963, where Senator Crowley, having set out the reasons why he felt registration was necessary, went on to say:</P>
      <P>I want merely to make this observation on that aspect of this problem, that I find it extremely difficult to accept a contention that either the Minister or his Department or his Departmental officials are not very well aware by now that abuses do exist and I do not think it is quite fair to suggest that they do not.</P>
      <P>I had the ill manners to interrupt Senator Crowley to say:</P>
      <P>That is to suggest that I am misleading the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Crowley began to speak and I interrupted him again to state:</P>
      <P>You must assume that I am speaking truthfully when I say that we have no record of these abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Senator Crowley then said:</P>
    <P>I accepted the Minister's statement as made now but I think I am entitled to make the observation that I find it extremely difficult to accept a situation in which the Minister for Health and his Department at this stage of our knowledge of this problem are still looking for absolute evidence of abuses.</P>
    <P>I interrupted to say:</P>
    <P>I am looking for evidence.  You cannot make a charge without trying to support it.</P>
    <P>Then the Senator preceded:</P>
    <P>Very well.  If you will allow me....</P>
    <P>He then went into detail and said he had a letter in his possession which he was going to pass to me.  I said he should put that letter on the records of the House and he did.  I am sure Senator Crowley would be the last to concede the point Senator Murphy was making that in some way or another I had lured him into the position in which he felt it necessary to put that letter on the records.</P>

      <Col N="359" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) (1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act and in this Act a Superintendent may grant a firearm certificate which shall be called a possession certificate.</P>
      <P>(2)  A possession certificate shall authorise the person named therein to have in his possession the firearm described therein.</P>
      <P>(3)  A possession certificate shall not authorise the holder thereof to use or purchase ammunition for the firearm described therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I mentioned this point on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I should like to see some form of certificate introduced which would allow people to keep a gun in their house without having to pay for it.  In the normal course at present people have to pay £2 5s. simply for having a gun in their possession. There are widows and older people who have been left a gun by their deceased parents, and they would like to keep it.  In this country, apart from the value of the gun, there is a sentimental value attaching to it, and the owner likes to hand it on to a member of his family.  Quite often when a widow has to move from the country to a town, she must either sell the gun or get some friend who has a certificate to keep it for her. That is asking a lot of the friend because it has to be kept clean and oiled.  I should like to see a permit issued for one year, or possibly a period of four or five years, so that such a person could keep the gun until she wished to dispose of it in some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other cases of men who are growing old and do not want to part with their guns.  They want to keep them in their possession but that will cost them quite a considerable sum year after year, knowing they will not use them, and that they cannot be legally used by anyone else.  So far as I can ascertain, years ago it <Col N="360" /> was possible in this country to get a permit to keep a gun in the house, although you were not allowed to buy ammunition.  I should like the Minister to introduce some amendment that will permit that type of thing.  I do not know whether it is peculiar to this country, but we have a great love and respect for old firearms, and I think it a pity that they must be disposed of.  At one time it was possible to ask to have them kept in the Garda barracks.  I think in this Bill the Minister is trying to get away from that, and also there is no guarantee that these firearms will be kept in good order.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree to any relaxing of the restrictions on the keeping of guns.  I was not here for the Second Reading of the Bill but I should like to say on this section that anything that restricts the use of firearms of any kind&mdash;and especially firearms in the hands of children&mdash;is for the good of the country.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposal in this amendment that guns may be kept in houses but that perhaps people would not use them, that they would be kept for sentimental reasons, we all know the dictum that it is the empty gun that shoots the man.  Guns are made to hurt and to kill and if they are not kept under rigid control and supervision, they are dangerous things. Therefore, I would be against any alteration of the Bill in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator McGuire.  I submit that the restrictions should be more rigid, that inspections should be carried out. Since this Bill came before the House on Second Stage, no fewer than three tragedies involving guns have occurred in the country, all the result of mishandling. If guns are kept in a house, there should be a place for them. There is a saying in the country that &ldquo;the devil loads an empty gun&rdquo;, that he puts a bullet into it.  People are inclined to believe that.  It has been found that a gun which was examined beforehand has discharged, resulting in the death of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Monaghan, for instance, a child <Col N="361" /> going through the gate of an estate was shot by a man who did not realise the gun was loaded.  In Longford since Christmas, there has been a similar case.  In fact cases of this sort are cropping up every day.  Accordingly, when we have a Bill of this sort, it is up to us to take all precautions and to make the most stringent provisions in regard to the use and the keeping of guns.  I would urge the Minister to insist on periodic inspections of homes where guns are kept to see that these guns are kept properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the reasoning of either Senator McGuire or Senator Mooney and find myself coming down on the side of Senator Cole.  The argument is that because there are accidents involving firearms, those accidents take place with guns under licence in the hands of people who use them carelessly. When a licence is granted for a firearm, as far as I know the Garda Síochána make no inquiries into the competence or the carefulness of people applying for licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has occurred to me, but I may have a high standard in so far as these matters are concerned. From this point of view, it would be of great benefit if more people had Army training in this country.  There would be fewer accidents.  As Senator Cole has said, many people have sentimental attachment to guns: they may be shotguns belonging to the father of a family who has died; they may be pistols used by somebody in the War of Independence or revolvers used in the Battle of the Some or elsewhere. There is not the slightest risk of these guns being used because ammunition is not purchasable.  I am sure the Minister will realise&mdash;he is a practical and realistic person&mdash;that a large number of such guns are kept by members of the Dáil and Seanad.  I have not got one myself so the Minister will not have the pleasure of raiding my house.  Those people have no intention of ever using these guns on anybody.  This is no laughing matter at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I suggest the Minister should have another look at the idea expressed by Senator Cole. It may not be possible for him to do it now but I feel sure he could devise a better way of achieving what Senator Cole has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some confusion here, that some Senators are reading more into the amendment than should be read into it.  It has been pointed out that it is not always the unlicensed gun which gives rise to accidents any more than it is the unlicensed driver who always causes accidents on the road or, as in England, the untested driver.  The only point I want to make is that though I feel there is something to be said for the amendment, I should like to see further limitation to such an extent that this would apply only to shotguns.  This idea of sentimental attachment to weapons which were not designed for the shooting of game does not make sense.</P>
      <P>I have not the slightest sympathy with the argument that anybody would have an attachment to a .22 rifle.  However, there are shotguns which can have a certain financial value and I can imagine circumstances such as Senator Cole described where there may not be anybody in a family at the moment who can use such a gun, possibly worth £200 or £300.  It would be a pity if that gun had to be sold, since later on a member of the family might be able to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister therefore examine this further to see if some way could be found whereby permits could be issued for the retention and safe keeping of such guns?  People who would wish to keep such guns should be willing to have inspections carried out to ensure that there was no ammunition in the house which could be used in the gun, and of course the permit would not allow them to buy any new ammunition for it.  Such people should be willing to put up with a little hardship in order to allow the authorities to see there is not any stray <Col N="363" /> ammunition about.  There are many guns which are quite irreplaceable and it does seem a pity the owners must be forced to dispose of them.  It may be said that people in possession of such guns, possibly heirlooms, would not be hurt financially by having to dispose of them but I would suggest that the Minister have another look at this, though I do not press the point too seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the point of view of Senator Cole.  First of all, I should like to explain exactly what the position is with regard to these non-used weapons.  If, as I explained on the Second Reading, the gun is an antique, then it is excluded from the scope of the Firearms Act.  Again, if it is a gun which somebody wishes to keep for purely sentimental reasons and does not intend to use, it can be taken outside the scope of the Act completely by the simple process of rendering it inoperative by drilling a small hole in the barrel.  If it is a weapon usable and serviceable which it is proposed to use again and is merely being kept in the interval, then as the law stands, the person concerned, the owner of this weapon, has a choice as to the manner in which it is kept.  He can pay the £2 5s. annual duty, and one would have a great deal more sympathy with the amendment if that £2 5s. were £10, £15 or £20.  I think it is a bit unreal to suggest that the payment of £2 5s. at this time would involve serious hardship in most of these cases.</P>
      <P>If he dislikes paying the annual duty, then, as Senator Sheldon mentioned, he can make an arrangement with a firearms dealer to store the gun. If it is a very valuable gun, it is certainly desirable that the weapon should be stored under proper conditions on the premises of a firearms dealer.  I think dealers would be prepared to make an arrangement at a very nominal charge to store such a weapon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further possibility is that the person can arrange to leave the gun with somebody who has an existing <Col N="364" /> licence for which he pays £2 5s. a year.  That person may keep the extra weapon for 10/- a year.  Thus, as matters stand, the position is not too rigid.  A person in the position envisaged has a number of possible courses open to him.</P>
    <P>I should be reluctant to make the simple change suggested by Senator Cole because this type of possession-only certificate would certainly be open to abuse.  In any case this is really a revenue matter.  At present firearms are regarded as something on which the State raises revenue just as the State makes people take out dog licences, even though a licensed dog has no superiority as compared with an unlicensed dog.  Senator Cole's amendment would really get us nowhere unless we could persuade the Minister for Finance to fix a nominal duty for this possession-only certificate.  I think it is the duty that Senator Cole is concerned about.</P>
    <P>The position has always been that we regard these weapons, as revenue-yielding. There is an arguable case that can be put forward that it is not the possession of the gun that should attract the revenue but its use for the shooting of game.  We have come a little way towards recognising that principle by the introduction of the limited certificate which attracts a considerably lower rate of duty because the gun is not used for shooting game but only for the destruction of vermin. This is a principle to which they adhere in Britain.  They distinguish between mere possession of a gun and its use for shooting game.  It is the use for shooting game that attracts the revenue imposition. We have not done that: it would be a matter for the Minister for Lands, who is the authority concerned with the preservation of game, to consider any change to such a system.  I know that he is at present carrying out an examination of the whole position, regarding the control and licensing of firearms from the point of view of game preservation.</P>
    <P>It is possible in the context of that examination that he may wish to alter the basis along the lines I mentioned, <Col N="365" /> namely, to tax the use of the gun for the shooting of game rather than its simple possession.  But that is not something we could do in this Bill, and for that reason I am opposing the amendment and asking the House to reject it.  To make an amendment at this stage would mean nothing unless the Minister for Finance would agree to reduce the duty to a minimal amount.  That can only be done in a Finance Bill and I think it is better to leave it over until we see what is the outcome of the examination which the Minister for Lands is at present conducting particularly when the people about whom Senator Cole is concerned have a reasonable number of other possible courses open to them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly said something to which I should like to refer, namely that there is no proper supervision on the issue of certificates.  The local superintendent of the Garda in each area has a statutory obligation on him, to be satisfied that the person to whom he issues a certificate is a competent and suitable person to have possession of a firearm.  That is a very real and definite obligation.  I have no reason to believe and no evidence to suggest that the Garda take that obligation lightly.  In the Second Reading debate, I think I said the position is the opposite and that the only representations I get in this matter are from people who think the Garda are being too rigid or unnecessarily restrictive in refusing certificates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Lands when there is some future discussion of firearms certificates in regard to shotguns.  The Minister mentioned two alternatives but the trouble is that I do not think either of them is any good.  With all due respect to firearms dealers, there are very few of them in the country to whom I would like to hand a very valuable gun if I had one, to be kept for me.  Apart from putting a drop of oil on any gun they might have, I do not think they would want to take in guns which they are not going to sell.  I doubt if they have any place in which to keep them reasonably safely.</P>

      <P>The other suggestion was that a person would give the gun to some friend to keep in which case he could take out a second or subsequent licence for 10/-.  It might be very difficult to get people to agree to keep a valuable gun for a number of years. They might not want the responsibility of keeping and maintaining it.  They might not want such a valuable thing in the house.  It imposes a certain responsibility on them.  I have considered these possibilities and I do not think they are reasonable and I had hoped the Minister would accept this amendment.  If he would, perhaps, bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance at some future time I shall withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think this section will be welcomed by tourists, visitors and sportsmen coming here.  Under this provision the certificate will remain in force for a full year irrespective of the date on which it is <Col N="367" /> issued.  That will put an end to much frustration and annoyance that arose in the past.  If a man came before the 1st July and wanted a licence which would enable him to stay on for two months shooting, he would have to take out two annual certificates. This section does away with that and is something that will be welcomed by everybody.</P>

I should like to know what is the position of a widow who has a son or two sons or of a man who has a piece of land in a particular place and has to cross over the land of somebody else to reach it?  Will the 10/- licence be sufficient cover or will it be necessary to get another certificate for the second piece of land?

      <P>May I ask your permission, sir, and the permission of the House to make a brief statement before we go on with the Bill regarding an error which occurs in the Official Report of the Second Reading debate on the Adoption Bill?  The interjection by me, <Col N="369" /> recorded at the top of Column 271, Volume 57, No. 5, should read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would be if it were there, but it is not there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This error was not made by the Official Reporter.  It arose through some confusion in the correction of the typescript of the report and the responsibility was entirely mine.  I have arranged for a correction to be made in the revised report.</P>
      <P>The reason I mention this now is that Senator Miss Davidson has told me that she considers that the report, as it now stands, makes her appear to have said that she regards the Board as irresponsible.  The Senator, of course, did not express any such view. I am sorry for any misunderstanding that may have arisen and I am grateful to the House for permitting me to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 2 and 3, to delete subsections (1), (2) and (3) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (c) of section 10 of the Principal Act, an adoption order may be made for the adoption of any child who was illegitimate at birth.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the present Act, the position is that a child must be either an orphan or illegitimate at the time of adoption for a valid adoption order to be made. This position, to be carried out with due scrupulosity, would require inquiries to be made in respect of every adoption order immediately before the making of the adoption order.  This is something which we realise should not be looked for.  It is little surprise that cases have occurred during the operation of the Act where orders have been made in good faith which, under this provision, are not valid orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 2 of the Bill, the Minister has brought in the proposition that, in the case where an adoptable child has been legitimated but not re-registered, adoption can proceed under certain <Col N="370" /> conditions.  He has also brought in a provision that the Board need not inquire, that they can presume at the time of making the order that no marriage has taken place which would legitimate the child.</P>
    <P>I have brought in this amendment because I think it is simpler.  It gets the effect which the Minister is looking for without the special provisions.  It is better to make a clean cut and to say that if a child is illegitimate at birth, then the position is that, so long, as the mother consents to adoption, that child may be adopted.  This does not rob the mother of any right because the mother could even withdraw her consent previously given at any time up to the final granting of the order and this withdrawal, of course, would have the result that the proposed adoption would collapse.</P>
    <P>It is preferable to do it this way rather than to bring in this artificial thing that we say that if the child has been legitimated under the 1931 Act but has not been re-registered in accordance with this act, the child can be adopted but if the child is legitimated and re-registered, then the child is not available for adoption even if the mother consents.</P>
    <P>Also, it is preferable to avoid putting a provision into the Bill whereby we say that the Board may make a presumption. The wording here is &ldquo;unless evidence is adduced to the Board.&rdquo;  In other words there is almost a suggestion here&mdash;I do not think I am being unfair&mdash;that the Board can go ahead and make orders with at least one eye shut in this regard.  I do not think this is quite the way in which we should legislate in this matter.  I propose this amendment whereby a child who was illegitimate at birth, is, independent of the subsequent history, available for adoption.  This would be a simpler method of achieving what the Minister desires and with which I think we all agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is only a matter of putting the draftsman to a bit of trouble in order to achieve exactly what we wanted, I think we should do that rather than opt for the simple way <Col N="371" /> of doing it.  Senator Dooge's amendment would not, I think, achieve what he and I both want.  First of all, there is an objection to it in principle.  In all our law and in all our policies governing these matters, it has always been the objective to ensure that the legitimated child is, to all intents and purposes and in every possible respect, put on a par with the legitimate child, in other words, the child who is legitimated by the subsequent marriage of its parents should for the rest of its life, be in exactly the same position as if it were a legitimate child.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge's amendment would cut across that principle to some extent in so far as it would put all legitimated children into the same boat.  In the case of the legitimated child who has been re-registered, I think there is no question of it being permitted to be adopted.  The father has, by the re-registration, fully acknowledged that child and in no circumstances should it be deemed eligible for adoption.</P>
      <P>I mention that objection in principle purely <i>en passant.</i>  I am not suggesting it would necessarily be conclusive if some other important element entered into the situation.  However, it is something to which we should have regard.  The Department of Health, who have an interest in this matter, are very anxious that we should maintain the principle, that, to the greatest possible extent, the legitimated child will be exactly on a par with the legitimate one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, Senator Dooge's amendment does suffer from the following defect.  My objective, and his, is to obviate the need for last-minute inquiries by the Board which can cause embarrassment and give rise to some very troublesome incidents.  If we adopted his amendment, the need for these last-minute inquiries would not be obviated.  In the case of a legitimated child, the father has full parental rights and his consent to the adoption would have to be procured and thus the need for last minute inquiries to determine whether legitimation had taken place, <Col N="372" /> thus rendering the father's consent necessary, would arise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, from the point of view of drafting, my draft&mdash;while it is, if you like, cumbersome compared with the comparative simplicity of Senator Dooge's amendment&mdash;achieves precisely what we want to do without interfering with the principle I have mentioned.  Senator Dooge's amendment has the merit of simplicity but it does not achieve what we want to do, namely, to obviate these last-minute inquiries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has provided in subsection (3) that the Board need not make such last-minute inquiries?  Surely subsection (3) &mdash;which is the subsection of Nelson's eye&mdash;allows the Board to ignore them? This is merely by reference to what the Minister said.  He said a legitimated and re-registered child is a fully acknowledged child: I do not agree with him.  Such a child may be fully acknowledged in law but the only child that is fully acknowledged in fact in so far as we are concerned with child welfare is the child which the mother and father are prepared to take into the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister seems to feel that my amendment would allow a legitimated and re-registered child to be adoptable.  It will not, if the mother refuses her consent.  Surely, if the mother and father are to take the child into part of their family, the provision in relation to the mother's consent can destroy any attempt at adoption.  It will ensure that a child whom the mother and natural father, who have now united, wish to bring into the family can be brought in through the mother's power to withhold consent to adoption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt?  I do not think the Senator understands. The Senator's amendment is a blanket one.  As such, it covers all illegitimate children.  It covers children who are <Col N="373" /> illegitimate at birth; it covers children who are never legitimated and it covers children who are legitimated.  In that respect, it is objectionable; it does not differentiate between the illegitimate child and the legitimated child. All our law seeks to ensure is that once legitimation takes place, the stigma of illegitimacy is for ever wiped out and that the child becomes an ordinary member of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone farther than the Minister in this principle. I agree with the Minister when he said that in law once the marriage of the parents takes place, the child is legitimated.  But, in Section 2, he proposes to allow the adoption of a legitimated but not re-registered child where the mother and father consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, apart from the principle, which I merely mentioned <i>en passant</i>, the Senator must recognise that his draft will not achieve what we both want.  There will still be the necessity for last-minute inquiries in the case of a legitimated child because in the case of a legitimated child the consent of the father will be necessary and therefore the Board will have to enquire if there has been a marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the consent be necessary if subsections (1) and (2) were deleted as is proposed in my amendment?</P>

      <P>Under Section 14 (1) of the Principal Act, 1952, which says:</P>
      <P>An adoption order shall not be made without the consent of every person being the child's mother or guardian or having charge of or control over the child, unless the Board dispenses with any such consent in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Senator really only wants to do the same as I do except that he says his way of doing it is simpler.  Surely if that is all that is involved he can accept my way of doing it, if it is only a question of a difference of language, particularly as I say to him that his draft is, first of all, objectionable in principle and does not achieve what he wants to do, namely, obviate need for the Board to make last minute inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument largely devolves on the consent of the natural father with which I should prefer to deal on the section.  Accordingly, I withdraw the amendment although I am not completely convinced by what the Minister has said.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question which appears in subsection (2) in regard to the consent of the natural father, there is a tendency in legislation about which I am not very happy.  The position is that legitimation can only occur in the case where there is a subsequent marriage between persons who could have married at the time the child was born.  Here we have the position of placing a natural father who failed to marry the mother of the child before its birth and who subsequently marries, into the position of having an undesirable degree of control over the future of that child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument is that, as the law stands, if the mother refuses to consent, the adoption cannot take place.  Our criterion must be that we would wish to see this child a member of a family, preferably a member of the family of its own parents.  If we look on this as our criterion, if the mother wishes the <Col N="375" /> child to be a member of the newly-formed family then the mother will refuse to allow that child to be adopted away from her newly-formed family. So, the existing situation under which the mother's refusal to consent is sufficient.  If, on the other hand, the mother does not wish the child to become part of the family the mother will then be willing to consent to its adoption.  When we bring in the consent of the natural father we have the position that if he also consents to adoption the child can become part of a family.  He does not add to or subtract from the position.  However, if the natural father does not consent he can condemn that child to an institution. The mother's refusal to take it into the family means it cannot be part of the family of its parents but the refusal of the natural father means that it cannot go into any other family.  If we take the welfare of the child as the criterion we may by bringing in the rights of the natural father be bringing in something harmful to the child.</P>
    <P>I do not know what legal principles are involved but it appears to me that we are giving rights here which can prevent a child being a member of a normal family to a person who had an opportunity to legitimate that child before its birth and did not take the opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, with all respect, that is very muddled thinking. Do not all of us want, if possible, to see these children legitimated by the subsequent marriage of the parents? The child will then grow up in the natural family with all the status and rights of the legitimately born.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most desirable. Once that happens there is a legitimate family with the father entitled to all the rights of a father, including the right to refuse consent to the child's adoption by some other family.  I do not think the Senator's arguments stand up for one moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), to delete paragraphs (a) and (b) and substitute &ldquo;the application is made before the child attains the age of sixteen years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come again on this amendment to a question on which I unfortunately find myself once more taking the opposite view to that held by the Minister with regard to the best means of achieving the maximum degree of welfare in relation to certain types of children.  It is only proper that I <Col N="378" /> should on the Committee Stage of this Bill state quite clearly what I believe are the principles involved.  There is general agreement that infant adoption is preferable but there are many people who believe that children over seven years of age should have their cases for adoption considered on their merits.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he cannot agree with this point of view and that he feels the difficulties involved in adoption over seven are so great that the whole of child adoption would be endangered if adoptions of children over seven were allowed.  In support of this contention, the Minister referred to a quotation he gave in the Dáil.  It will be found in volume 206, column 908 of the Official Report. The quotation was from the report of a European Seminar on Inter-Country Adoption.  I should like to express my viewpoint now that the way in which the Minister introduced these quotations into his argument shows that he failed to point out clearly that these quotations, being part of a report on inter-country adoption, were largely directed towards the problems of such adoption.  Thus, in the first quotation, the Minister did not commence his quotation at the beginning of the paragraph of the United Nations Seminar Report.  The first sentence reads:</P>
    <P>Here a word of caution should be posed concerning the consideration of children over seven years old for inter-country adoption.</P>
    <P>That is the first sentence and, in the good writer, it is the topic sentence which gives us the background; what the Minister quoted were the sentences following.  The last sentence of the paragraph&mdash;it was not quoted by the Minister&mdash;reads:</P>
    <P>The task of the rehabilitation of an emotionally damaged child is one for experts and such children should not be subjected to the hazards of transportation to a new country with a new language, culture, etc.</P>
    <P>The Minister's first quotation was clearly directed towards inter-country adoption and I submit it is not relevant, certainly not directly relevant, to the problem of the appropriate age <Col N="379" /> for adoption within a country.  In the second quotation, the Minister quoted the last sentence:</P>
    <P>For a child of seven identity and emotional ties may also include identification with his&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There then follow five dots, and the word &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo;.  When we turn to the United Nations report we find this reads &ldquo;identification with his country, language and neighbourhood&rdquo;. Neighbourhood comes third and is not necessarily the most important of the barriers of which the writer was talking in this report.  I think, therefore, we should look beyond what the Minister said and I should like to put on record here now two other quotations indicating how thinking has developed in regard to this question of the adoption of the older child.  The first quotation is 12 years old and there has been a great deal of development since then but, even 12 years ago, in a Report on a Workshop held in May, 1951 in New York, attended by 94 agencies, on the subject of &ldquo;Adoption Practices, Procedures and Problems&rdquo;, there is the statement:</P>
    <P>In actual practice close to 50 agencies report that they accept for adoptive placement children of any age.  The trend is towards placing a child of any age for whom a home can be found.  With the exception of four agencies that place only infants the agencies for all practical purposes have no age limit if a home can be found.</P>
    <P>I should like also to place on record a quotation from an article by Ann Leatherman, M.Sc., on placing the older child in adoption, which appeared in the journal <i>Children</i>, in the issue of May-June, 1957, published by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare:</P>
    <P>Older children, those between six and fourteen, who are without parents, have special needs.  However, progressive child placement agencies and their board members are no longer saying that older children cannot be placed for adoption, for many such childrren are <Col N="380" /> being placed with considerable success.</P>
    <P>I submit there are a number of cases of children above seven years in which we have a duty to see that their cases are examined on their merits by the Adoption Board.  We do not look for adoption on such a widespread basis for children over seven as for children under seven but it is, I think, unfair that a complete curtain should be brought down.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board, on which the Minister relied when he spoke of the success of the operation of the 1952 Act, recommended the raising of the age in its reports for 1957 and 1960. As far as can be gathered from the Minister's Second Reading speech, the Board again recommended in their memorandum to him that the age should be raised, with the limitation on this occasion, that the child should be placed before seven.  So far the Minister has not brought forward any real grounds for his belief that the adoption of children over seven years in special cases would endanger infant adoption.  As I have said, there is no need for such adoption to be widespread. Subsection (1) of Section 3 refers to &ldquo;the particular circumstances of the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section as drafted gives the Board discretion to limit adoption over seven years in any way they wish.  If the section were amended as I have suggested here, there is no doubt that the present Board, on the basis of what they said in their memorandum to the Minister, would limit such adoption to those placed before seven years of age.  This appears to be the opinion of the present Adoption Board.  It would appear that the Board of 1960 or 1957 might not have put in that particular limitation.  But I think there is a case, not for the widespread adoption of children above seven, but for a right in those cases to come before the Adoption Board for special consideration.  This is the reason I have put down the amendment raising the age of possible adoption to 16 years, taking that age as being the age at which children would normally leave an institution.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge has made a very cogent and lucid case for raising the age.  I agree with him entirely.  On the Second Reading, I quoted statistics from legislation in other countries showing they do accept a much higher age for adoption. These countries have gone into the matter with very great care.  I do not see that there are any particular circumstances in this country making it desirable to keep the age down to seven or nine.  In fact, I think this is one of the great faults in this piece of legislation.  We are keeping the age far too low.  I know the Minister has given strong reasons for this, but I personally do not find them entirely convincing. I would support Senator Dooge very strongly in his very reasonable and well substantiated plea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, strongly support this amendment.  As Senator Dooge said, we are all convinced that infant adoption is the best, but there does not seem to be the slightest necessity to restrict the age to seven or nine years.  Cases are bound to arise where suitable and successful adoptions could be arranged for young people of a much higher age group.  The owner of a business with no children of his own might find in a young worker in his business, a boy perhaps taken from an institution, whom he might wish to adopt as a son, to take into his home and eventually pass his business on to him.  He might want to do this in a firmer way than by merely making a will in the boy's favour, willing the business to him, fearing that circumstances might arise where the will might be contested and the legatee might have to face court proceedings because a distant relative felt that he had a greater claim to the business to which by that time the boy concerned&mdash;perhaps now grown to manhood &mdash; might have contributed greatly in building up a valuable asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot think of anything more dreadful than that we should keep young people confined in institutions merely because there was no opportunity for their legal adoption before attaining the age of seven or nine years and then at 16 years being turned out unfitted to take their places in the <Col N="382" /> world except in menial posts.  There should be an opening in the Adoption Acts to permit of adoptions at a higher age than seven or nine years.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment very strongly.  We are all agreed we must approach with great caution any adoption after the age of seven, but I am quite satisfied there must be many cases in this country in which adoption could take place after the age of seven and any time up to the age of 16.</P>

      <P>When I said &ldquo;many,&rdquo; I was thinking of more than a handful. I am quite prepared to say there must be one case, and if there is one case where we can give a boy or girl a home, roots and a background, we should pass this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have all along said that there will be cases where this could be done with advantage, but I have gone on to say that I could not in the interest of a very small minority of cases do something which, to my mind, would undoubtedly involve a risk of interfering with the structure of the adoption system as a whole.</P>
      <P>To take the point made by Senator Dooge concerning the report of the Seminar quoted in the Dáil, if the Senator is accusing me of not quoting in full from that document, I, in turn, can accuse him of not quoting in full from what I said in the Dáil.  At the bottom of Col. 907, Vol. 206, No. 7 of the Dáil debates, I made it absolutely clear what I was doing.  I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is clear frorm the context, and otherwise, that what the report has to say about inter-country adoption applies equally to adoption inside the country.</P>
      <P>Of that I was fully aware, and I made it clear to the House that the report was dealing with inter-country adoption, but that it is also true that the reasoning applies also to adoption inside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> Senator Miss Davidson must not be familiar with the report of this European Seminar.  The Senator spoke about a child being made heir to a business.  That is the sort of thing that is specifically condemned by this Seminar.  If I may quote from page 8 of the report:</P>
    <P>With the trend away from the older concept of adoption as providing for the continuation of a family, providing an heir, to the more modem child welfare concept, adoption practice is increasingly based primarily on the interest of the child.  The traditional concept was focussed on parents, on fulfilling their need by providing a child for them, whereas the modern concept is focussed on the child, on providing substitute and suitable parents for the child.</P>
    <P>The importance of adoption being focussed primarily on the welfare of the child was repeatedly emphasised by the Seminar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to the Minister that I had not the full reports, but I still feel it would be no harm for that young boy to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators have referred to the practice in other countries. I am aware that many other countries have legislated to the effect that older children may be adopted. But these countries have legislated on the older concept that adoption is mainly a convenience for the adopters. Many countries are now moving away from that concept and closer to our concept, which is that adoption is primarily for the benefit of the child. They are acknowledging that it is the child's welfare which is important rather than consideration of family or inheritance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Seminar is very specific on that.  One of the things about which it was quite emphatic as not being a good reason for adoption was children in materially poor circumstances <Col N="384" /> but part of a family group being given to adoptive parents who could offer various kinds of material advantage.  When I am told of the higher ages at which children may be adopted in other countries, my reply is that their adoption code is on a different basis from ours.  In many countries, adoption orders can be revoked; in our case, adoption is irrevocable.  We are concentrating on the child and we are concerned with the interest of the child.  Our adoption code is designed to help make the child in every possible way a normal member of the family into which he goes.  It is for that reason we insist on infant adoption and that we resist opening the gates, lest we weaken the emphasis on infant adoption.  In so far as we can do so, we should try to ensure, in the interest of child welfare and because of this concept that it is the child that matters, that the age is not raised.</P>
      <P>I am the first to admit, and I have admitted in the Dáil, that somebody could produce cases where satisfactory adoption could take place at the age of ten or 11, 13 or fourteen, but the higher the age, the greater the risk of failure and it would not take very many failures to cast a shadow of doubt on the whole structure.  To my mind, the structure is so important and the continuance of the success we have achieved so far is so desirable that it would be wrong to raise the age, no matter what people may be persuaded, for sentimental and other reasons, to advocate.</P>
      <P>Most of the things I have said about this I have said already on the Second Stage, but perhaps I might repeat a few of the points.  Senator Dooge mentioned the Adoption Board.  I have already indicated that the Adoption Board have considered this matter very fully and, despite their original inclination, have, on reflection, agreed that the restriction of the age limit is desirable.  There is also in this country a number of registered adoption societies.  Not one of these societies has come forward in support of the proposition that the age limit should be raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be unfortunate in that respect because members of the House have received representations from registered adoption societies in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Registered adoption societies&mdash;I want to be careful about this.  There has been correspondence by persons who are members of registered adoption societies but the societies as such have not supported this correspondence or the arguments put forward. I do not know what correspondence Senators have received but, as far as I am concerned, if there is a single adoption society in the country which has a view to put forward on this, it is reasonable to expect that it is to me, as the person responsible for the framing of this piece of legislation, that the representations would have been submitted in the first instance. However, as far as I know, not a single registered adoption society in this country has supported this proposition. Neither have I received any representations from local authorities or from persons in charge of county homes, or institutions of that sort, in favour of the proposal.</P>
      <P>I do not know what practical experience the Senators who have spoken have of adoption work but I know that, if necessary, I can mobilise 90 per cent and probably even a greater percentage of persons engaged in practical adoption work in support of the ideas enshrined in this piece of amending legislation.  The reason why there has not been any volume of public support for my proposals is that the people who support them&mdash;and they are the vast majority of adoption workers in this country&mdash;do not believe that the best interests of adoption are promoted by public controversy of this sort.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the House to reject this amendment because if we were to enact it, we would be doing a bad day's work.  There are many arguments which may be put forward one way or another but my main point is that by accepting this, we would tend to weaken the whole valuable structure of adoption which we have built up so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate but I have listened to the discussion with an open mind and I am convinced of the correctness of Senator Dooge's amendment. I am in perfect agreement with the Minister when he says the purpose of adoption is the benefit of the child. Nobody disputes that and anybody who argues that is really pushing an open door.  However, Section 3 of this Bill does accept that there may be exceptions to the age of seven years, that there may be exceptional circumstances in which a higher age of adoption may be legitimate and successful. I do not see anything sacred about the age of nine years and, as Senator Ross has said, there are cases in which older children could benefit from adoption. If the age of seven years is to be broken at all, I see nothing wrong in raising it higher than nine years in certain exceptional cases.  I cannot see that the exercise of discretion under this section would in any way injure a child under seven years who is adopted or that it would conflict with the object of the legislation, the benefit of the adopted child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear Senator O'Brien misunderstands the position. It is not just a matter of raising the age from seven to nine or from nine to 16.  What is involved here is the age at which the application can be made to the Board for an adoption order for a child which has been placed before the age of seven years of age. The Bill provides that the child must be placed with the family before it reaches the age of seven but goes on to provide that the application for the adoption order may be made at any time before the child reaches the age of nine.  Thereafter the Board may make the order at their discretion. Normally the Board would make it within about a year or so but need not necessarily do so.  There is no limitation as to when they may make an order, but the Bill rigidly insists that a child, in order to be adopted, must be placed with the family before it reaches the age of seven.  Thus the age of seven remains the watershed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to <Col N="387" /> the European Seminar of the United Nations, I think the Minister's statement in the Dáil that what applies to inter-country adoption applies equally to adoption within the country is not a valid point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. May I quote what I said?  In order to rebut the Senator's suggestion that I was purporting to apply the Seminar's statements about inter-country adoption to domestic adoptions, I quoted from the Dáil report:</P>
      <P>It is clear from the context, and otherwise, that what the report has to say about inter-country adoption applies equally to adoption inside the country.</P>
      <P>The reference is to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much profit in quoting the report backwards and forwards to one another.  It refers to the recognised difficulties of the adoption of older children and the added difficulties of inter-country adoption, changes of culture, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point to which I would like to advert.  The Minister conveyed the impression&mdash;it may not have been intentional&mdash;that he thought that the various arguments brought forward here were based on what Senators had read in the public Press. I should like, as a member of this House who takes an interest in this Bill, to say that I feel I would be very wanting in my duty in regard to a measure of this sort if I relied completely on newspaper columns in the public Press.  I made specific inquiries from people I knew were active in this particular field.  I made them in many directions and I found conflicting views between them.  From the various views which those people, active in this field, put forward, I reached conclusions and put my views in good faith to this House.  I think the approach of Senators to legislation is that we do our best to bring forward in this House arguments based on information.  We have not got the facilities which the Minister has but we are not careless; neither do we rely on what we happen to read casually in the newspapers; <Col N="388" /> nor do we rely completely on the representations made to us by interested parties.  We make our own inquiries on these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister also remarked that certain of these arguments were based on sentiment.  They are based on sentiment in so far as they are based on a desire to see the welfare of children promoted.  There certainly are difficulties in regard to older children but I do not think they are anything like the difficulties which have to be faced by children who have to live their lives up to 16 years of age in an institution and then leave the institution in order to make their way in the world.  Anything that can be done to alleviate that position should be done.  I think basically we are agreed on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is utterly convinced that if he allows anyone over seven years&mdash;nine in exceptional circumstances &mdash; to be adopted, child welfare in regard to adoption is endangered.  He has not convinced me on that point, and the only thing for me to do is to press the amendment and let Senators express their opinions on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority and a national teacher with experience of children coming from institutions, I am in thorough agreement with the Minister's attitude on not increasing the age.  This Bill makes it easier to adopt children than it was before and anything that makes it easier to adopt children is very welcome so far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time as a teacher, I saw many boarded-out children.  We should try to get an alternative to that system as soon as possible.  I saw children who remained in institutions until they were nine or ten years of age and were then boarded out, and I can say that they were never as obedient to their foster parents as children who were boarded out at a younger age.  The very same thing would happen if we <Col N="389" /> agreed to a higher age for adoption. We should give the age in the Bill a trial.  I think it is quite sufficient because encouragement should be given to have children adopted at birth, if possible.  I do not support the amendment for that reason and because of my experience of children who were boarded out at a later age than eight or nine years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator McAuliffe has said is quite valid as an indictment only of boarding out and not of what Senator Dooge has recommended. It is not an indictment of adoption at a later age.  I have heard child psychologists say on several occasions that any kind of home is better than an institution.  As a matter of fact, the want that is experienced by children in institutions is being got around by suggesting that visitors to the institution should adopt the role of the father figure, that there should be some identification between the child and the adopter.  That does not happen in institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well-known fact&mdash;and the people who conduct institutions will tell you&mdash;that there is that want in the institutions.  Many children who pass through them do not turn out well and do not develop well.  It is far better to have a child in a family <i>milieu</i> where he can identify with one or two adults rather than have the amorphous situation which exists in institutions.  It is most important that children should be given the opportunity of adoption at a later stage.  I do not think there is any body of opinion now which could prove that adoption at a later age will be a failure.  If it were a failure in a <Col N="390" /> large number of cases, I do not think that would take in any way from the genuine efforts which the Minister is making to have adoption at the infant stage.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the raising of the age limit from seven years to nine years to persons who are relatives of the child.

      <P>I was attracted to the idea in the Dáil and particularly to the way in which Senator Jessop put his point of view in the Seanad.  I still have mixed views about it; it is still very much a matter of balance, but in view of the fact that quite a number of people seem to think that the balance of advantage is in permitting a relative to adopt a child older than seven or nine years, I think I should go some distance to meet that point of view.  If the House permits, I have an amendment here which meets the point and which I shall circulate now.  If adopted, it will meet the views of Senators Stanford and Jessop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point on which I should like reassurance from the Minister.  Is he satisfied that in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) the requirement that an applicant shall have had the child in his care is sufficiently broad so that a child who had spent a long period in hospital would still be legally in the care of the applicant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further point on section 3 (3).  Subsection (3) permits certain outstanding cases to be cleared up and many of these cases are now in an unfortunate position because originally we had no adoption legislation and even when we had the legislation of 1952 many people, particularly those who had not had the benefit of the help of an adoption society, were not aware of the exact extent to which things could be remedied under the temporary provisions of the 1952 Act.  There are many cases of children who had been, as it were, informally adopted under what was the old system and against all the canons of good adoption practice these children have grown almost to manhood unaware that they are not the children of the parents with whom they live and they have not been subject to an adoption order.  This subsection (3) is, as it were, a final chance to remedy these special cases and it is as a temporary and non-recurring provision that I want to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the effect of subsection (2) on such cases we see that, before making an adoption order in relation <Col N="393" /> to a child to whom section 3 applies, the Board shall give due consideration to the wishes of the child.  The position, of course, at the moment is that with 80 per cent of our children being handled through adoption societies and these adoption societies urging parents as to the best way gradually and carefully to make these children aware of their particular position in the home, no real difficulty does arise but in some of these outstanding cases, the provision in subsection (2) whereby the wishes of the child would have to be ascertained would mean, in fact, that a child, in order to be adopted legally under subsection (3), would, for the first time, have to be told and told rather suddenly of its particular position.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it might be desirable to amend subsection (2) to make it less mandatory, to give the Adoption Board a discretion so that in certain cases, where it was satisfied that it was in the best interests of the child having regard to the particular circumstances, the Board could dispense with the requirement of ascertaining the child's wishes.</P>
    <P>I put this forward, not as something that should be a permanent feature of adoption practice, but as something which might help to alleviate hardship in cases which have resulted because of the fact that we have not always had legal adoption and it has taken some years for people to get used to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a suggestion but I am afraid, on balance, again, I would be against it.  As Senator Dooge would agree, if I understand him correctly, in the normal case the proper thing for the adoptive parents to do is to inform the child and put things on a proper footing at the earliest suitable date.  I am not sure that in these special cases with which we are dealing here there should be any difference.  Most adoption workers are agreed that it is important that there should be no question of persons &ldquo;living a lie&rdquo;, that it is important that the adoptive parents should be frank with the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also, of course, the question <Col N="394" /> of the birth certificate.  The child would discover the facts of its adoption, if it came to look for the long birth certificate.  On the whole, I think it is better that the adoptive parents frankly discuss the situation with the adopted child and put the matter on a proper basis.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with children of 18 and 19, apart altogether from the question of good adoption practice and the relationship between the child and its adoptive parents, there is the fact that it is necessary and desirable that the child should be consulted because having come practically to man's estate he is entitled to have a say in his own affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just make a point?  What worries me is this: It is good adoption practice that the child should be made aware of its position, but, as in all matters of delicacy, this should not be a sudden frankness, but, rather, a gradual unfolding of what the position is.  It is the sudden element here that makes me somewhat nervous in regard to this aspect.  I take it the section as it stands is absolutely mandatory on the Board?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that in my Second Reading speech I dealt at some length with the proposal in this Bill to drop the requirement that an applicant for an adoption order must, unless he has resided here for five years, be an Irish citizen.  I explained that citizenship in that context was an unsuitable and, indeed, an inappropriate test as far as applications for adoption orders were concerned. I also pointed out, as Senators will recall, that we were the only country in the Council of Europe which prohibited resident foreigners from adopting children.  Still, it is clear that a number of people, including a number of the Senators who spoke here, are a little unhappy about the situation and suggestions have been made that this proposal will open the door to all sorts of undesirable practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to those suggestions I have maintained all the time that, of course, the Adoption Board is still there and <Col N="396" /> will grant adoption orders only in cases in which it is satisfied as to suitability, etc. and it has this solemn statutory obligation to be satisfied before granting an adoption order to anybody.</P>
    <P>However, there has been some confusion about it, as I have said, and there has been talk about people flying in here, adopting children and flying out again.  As I have said, that is a misunderstanding of the position. This cannot happen and the reason we are making this change is to try to open the way for suitable, desirable adoptions which at the moment are being prevented because of this more or less technical provision.  I might instance the case of foreigners residing here for two or three years who wish to adopt a child, who are absolutely suitable in every way, and who so satisfy the Board.  Because of this provision, they cannot do so for maybe three or four years more. Circumstances might change and they might even have to leave the country. That is the main reason why we are dropping this requirement.  Apart from the fact that it does not mean very much in itself, it also has the side effect of possibly preventing suitable adoptions.</P>
    <P>I realise that some people are still a little unhappy about the sweeping nature of the proposal.  In order to meet these objections, I am proposing to put in a one-year residence qualification. That is what is enshrined in my amendment.  Here, again, of course, I must accuse some Senators of taking conflicting positions.  On the one hand, they urge me to give the Board more powers and more flexibility and here, where I want to give the Board more or less freedom to decide these cases on their merits, without any statutory restriction, Senators are urging me to put statutory restrictions on the Board.</P>
    <P>In an effort to meet Senators who have spoken and taken an interest in this matter, I am putting forward this compromise proposal of a statutory obligation of one year's residence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading, <Col N="397" /> I gave my reasons for opposing the deletion of certain safeguards in the existing adoption legislation.  I stress them again.  It would be a most unfair action to open wide the door to non-nationals to come in here, make a short stay and then depart into the unknown with a small Irish citizen.  I know the Minister has said investigations were made and backgrounds studied, but in such an important matter, where the whole future of a child is concerned, can satisfactory investigations be made at such long range in the teeming cities of the world outside Ireland?  I hold they cannot.</P>
      <P>I understand that people here in Ireland seeking to adopt children are informed by some societies that there is a waiting list for children.  If this is so, why is there need for provision for adoption by persons from abroad?</P>
      <P>I felt it necessary that I should table an amendment to endeavour to hold up, to some degree, an adoption by a non-national in order that his character and background might be studied over a period of three years.  However, as the Minister has agreed to make provision that an adoption order shall not be made unless the applicants are ordinarily resident in the State and must have been so resident during the year ending on the date of the order, I will withdraw my opposition to the Section.  I offer the Minister my thanks for his action.</P>
      <P>However, I feel that I must say a few more words on the contents of the amendments.  I would ask if we have any moral right to permit children to be taken out of the country at all when we are constantly deploring the scarcity of children in our population and when, at the same time, we are working towards and hope soon to achieve a situation where there will be such a prosperous economy here that there will be a need for the hands and brains of all our children.  We are giving away a very valuable commodity.  I say all this at the risk of the Minister being offended by my insisting on this point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely there is nothing of doctrinaire theorising in this attitude, to repeat the Minister's castigation, and nothing <Col N="398" /> inconsistent in this approach?  Certainly, I am in favour of allowing more adoptions when these adoptions are favourable to the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he will examine the situation and see if it would be possible to have these children adopted at home.  Eithne Carbury sighed&mdash;&ldquo;They are going, going, going and we cannot bid them stay&rdquo;.  Here is an opportunity where I feel we can bid them stay and help to build up the prosperity of their own country.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if there is any way other than under the Adoption Act, through the adoption societies and with the sanction of the Adoption Board by which children are allowed to leave the country with persons other than relatives, persons who have spent a brief holiday here, with a view to adoption.  I ask for this information quite frankly because of a recent news item which seemed to indicate that children were being taken out of the country in contravention of Section 40 of the Adoption Act of 1952 and, as it seemed to me, in contradiction of the Minister's statement in reply to Senator Brady, where he said, as reported at Column 301, Volume 57, No. 5, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Nobody who lives outside this country can apply here under our law to adopt a child, Irish or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that one of the first things he did when he came to office as Minister for Justice was to take an interest in legal adoption.  All credit to him for that, but when I began to wage my private war to have a Legal Adoption Act put in operation, I doubt if the Minister was even in politics.  I was not successful in my efforts to persuade the Government of the day to do this&mdash;for what reason I do not know&mdash;and I have never been other than generous in the praise I have given to the Minister's Party for having introduced and passed into law the Adoption Act of 1952.  I consider that Act to be a good and useful one. My desire is to see it made an even better one.  For that reason, I am grateful the Minister has agreed to <Col N="399" /> tighten up somewhat on the qualifications of persons from other countries who desire to adopt Irish children.  I should like some information as to how these children are taken out and if there are any age limits covering them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Take non-nationals who come and reside here for a certain period and become eligible to apply for the adoption of a child.  Originally strangers, having spent so many years here, they qualify for consideration. Has there been any examination of the fact that, having adopted a child, they may then leave the country?  Has the Minister any view on that aspect of the matter?  It may not happen but it is possible.  In the event of its happening, are there safeguards because the child may be taken out of its own country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister's amendment but there is a point on which I should like some clarification.  I do not think there is any likelihood that any foreign person or couple will come and live here for a year just for the purpose of adopting a child.  Therefore, it seems that the period of one year is a perfectly safe period.  However, what is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;?  If it has the same meaning as the income tax meaning, I think it could mean a period in a financial year of greater than six months. &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo; seems rather an ambiguous phrase there.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what he has in mind.  If it means 320 days out of the 365 days in the year immediately preceding, or 11 months out of the 12 months immediately preceding the order, well and good, but if it means just over six months, it may not be so good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the applicant shall be ordinarily resident in the State and have been so resident during the year ending on the date of the order.  I presume it takes quite a while to get an adoption order through from the date of the application and under this amendment a person could come into the country today and apply for an <Col N="400" /> adoption order tomorrow and then everything would start moving from there.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be more reasonable to put down an amendment making it obligatory on the applicant to be ordinarily resident in the State for 12 months before the date of his application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise at the outset exactly what we are dealing with here.  There are two entirely separate matters involved. One is the question of persons adopting children here by our law; in other words, going through the procedure of getting an Irish adoption order.  The other set of circumstances is where some person, usually an American, comes to this country and takes a child to America for the purpose of adopting it under American law.</P>
      <P>Now, if we deal with the latter category first, the Act of 1952 provides that &mdash;and it is really illegitimate children we are concerned with here&mdash;an illegitimate child under the age of one year cannot be taken out for adoption at all; between the ages of one and seven, it can be taken out only with the consent of the parent or guardian.  That has always been regarded as a reasonable compromise between the desirability of having a child adopted and the natural rights of parents.  Do not forget that we as a Legislature must always have regard to the fact that the family is the basic unit of society and to the constitutional rights of parents.  When the 1952 provision was passed, it was regarded as a reasonable compromise.  You cannot of course stop parents who have legitimate children from sending them anywhere they wish.  They are their own children and they are free to look after their destinies and to control their lives as they see fit.  We cannot interfere with the natural rights of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of these cases where children are taken to America for adoption, that is, that they cannot go unless they are in possession of Irish passports.  The Minister for External Affairs will not grant a passport until he is absolutely satisfied about the conditions and the circumstances of the people and the surroundings to which the child is going.  This <Col N="401" /> is not an unreal or imaginary satisfaction. The Department of External Affairs have machinery whereby reputable agencies in the United States of America make the most exhaustive inquiries and are in a position to satisfy the Minister that it is in order for him to give a passport so that the child may go out to a particular American family to be adopted by them.  That is a satisfactory situation and I want to say to those people who think it is a bad thing that an Irish child should go to America to be adopted that I think it is preferable that a child should go to a suitable American home, about which everybody has been satisfied, and be adopted and grow up as a member of a family rather than spend his early life in an institution here.  There is no argument about that.</P>
    <P>If the time ever comes when there are more adoptive parents here than there are children waiting and suitable to be adopted, then we will certainly review the situation, but until that stage comes, it would be wrong for us to prevent the adoption by American parents who are suitable in every way of Irish children who would otherwise have to spend their early lives in an institution.  I can assure Senators also that the numbers involved each year are relatively small and with the safeguards there are, it is not a situation which need cause us any disquiet whatever. Indeed, in so far as it results in some children getting a satisfactory home life who would otherwise spend their early lives here in an institution, it is something we can be pleased about.</P>
    <P>I myself had experience of an exact case of this sort where a young Irish child was sent abroad to Irish-Americans and I know how satisfactorily that particular case worked out. I am satisfied that in view of the inquiries made by the Department of External Affairs, the situation is one which need not cause us any concern.</P>
    <P>Now we come to a different category entirely, that is, people resident in this country seeking to adopt children by Irish law.  The first thing we must think about in that connection is that <Col N="402" /> these are people who are prepared to submit themselves to examination by the Irish Adoption Board, who are prepared to have their circumstances and their background inquired into. It seemed to me that we should give the Board complete flexibility in this matter and not insist on any residence qualification because I felt that the residence qualification of five years was, by tying the hands of the Board, preventing the Board from agreeing to adoptions by suitable foreigners resident here.  I am not sure that that original idea was not right and that we could leave it safely to the Board to satisfy themselves as to the suitability of such people, but, as I say, I have allowed myself to be persuaded and I am proposing a period of one year's residence.  This, I think, should meet the majority of the fears which have been expressed in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards what constitutes ordinary residence, it would seem to me that that is a question of fact.  &ldquo;Ordinary residence&rdquo; would seem to me to mean exactly what it says.  This is something which would have to be interpreted by the Board in the light of experience.  They would probably decide that ordinary residence here means what the Senator said, 330 days out of 365, or something of that nature. I do not think the Board would ever interpret it in the strict legal &ldquo;income tax&rdquo; sense.</P>

It is not I, of course, who do the pushing.  It is not I who should get any credit. It is the adoption societies.  The better they do their work and the more devoted they are, the nearer they will get to a position in which we will have a queue here waiting to adopt the children available.  When that day comes, we will certainly consider whether we should prevent any children <Col N="403" /> being taken out of the country for adoption.</P>

If the statistics were included in the annual report of the Adoption Board, those sufficiently interested to read the report would be able to see the correct position.

I think these two figures should be shown in the report.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the Minister's amendment will prevent the gross abuse some of us fear.  In particular, I think it covers the case of the non-resident citizen.  That is a good thing.

      <P>On the Second Stage, I raised the point that the amendment in regard to the age of married couples creates a difficulty.  If placement were made two years before adoption, before the age of 25, we would get what might be the undesirable position of married people aged 23 years having children placed with them for adoption.  I do not think that would be a very good adoption practice and I bring it forward now as something to be noted.  It is something which might well have the attention of the Board.  It is typical of things which can be dealt with by regulation.  There are many points which are not really matters in regard to which the Legislature can lay down hard and fast rules.  It might well be that the Board, which, so far, has produced regulations only in regard to statutory forms, would consider certain guiding principles which could be made in the form of regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Minister for his explanation of the mix-up in the report.  As I said, it put me in a rather bad light with the Adoption Board and I am very grateful to the Minister for his explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the section, I have again examined the proposal in Section 8 and I have found nothing to change <Col N="406" /> my views expressed on Second Reading. I said then that the section is dangerous and is most unfair to a child.  In effect, it seeks to grant an interim adoption order in respect of a child where the Board is not satisfied that the applicant is, among other things, of good moral character and is not a suitable person to have parental rights and duties, but where the Board is of opinion that, before the expiration of the probationary period, the applicant is likely to come up to the desired standard.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister feels it necessary to put in a provision of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board feel they want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be related to his desire for increased suitable adoptions because it would be most harmful to leave a child aged up to seven years in what might be most unsuitable surroundings.  I feel it would be far too grave a risk to leave a child in such a place for any length of time in the faint hope that the doubtful atmosphere might clear away and resolve itself into a suitable home in which a child might grow up in happiness and security.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will agree to take out the offending section.  There can be no reason for its inclusion if we are honest in our desire that anything put into the Act must be for the good of the child concerned.  I was very sorry that our usually good-tempered Minister was somewhat intolerant on Second Reading in regard to the views put forward by some of us in these benches.  I should have thought he would have realised that not one of us is against him in the matter of legal adoption.  He might not have agreed with all our views but he should have known that such were put forward in an effort to improve the measure in the interests of the helpless child.  I, therefore, hope most sincerely that the Minister will give deep consideration to this obnoxious section and, indeed, that he will take it out of the Bill altogether as it can do nothing but harm to the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this section as drafted is objectionable.  However, I would not go quite as far as Senator Miss Davidson in expressing total objection to it.  I think it is at least careless drafting to say we find ourselves in the position that we are empowering the Adoption Board to make an interim order up to two years giving custody of a child to people where there is a doubt of their good moral character or where there is a doubt as to whether they have sufficient means to support a child.  I agree there is a case to be made for giving the Adoption Board power to make an interim order where there is some doubt as to whether the person is a suitable person to have parental rights and duties in respect of the child.</P>
      <P>The Minister, discussing this on the Second Stage at column 263, mentioned in regard to this section such matters as health and ability to establish parent-child relationship, where a trial period might be of some value.  There is some point in what the Minister says here; but to take Section 8 as drafted and to say that the Board can make an interim order when it is not satisfied in any of the provisions of the section of the principal Act&mdash;in other words, as Senator Miss Davidson says, to allow the Board give custody of the child to people whose good moral character or whose means is in doubt&mdash;is something which I think is objectionable. What should be done in regard to this section is that it should be amended so that the Board would be empowered to make an interim order only when it is not satisfied in regard to the third requirement, namely, that the applicant is a suitable person to have parental rights and duties in respect of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I have considered this matter.  I want to assure the Senators concerned that all of these points have received the most detailed, careful, long and anxious consideration by myself, by my advisers, by the Board and everybody concerned.  I think Senators are tilting at a windmill in this section.  First, some people have recommended the British legislation and others have spoken about what has been done by legislatures <Col N="408" /> in other countries.  The British legislation has this provision, perhaps not exactly as I am proposing it but very much on the same lines.  In many other countries there is provision for a trial period during which the suitability of the proposed adoption is on test.</P>
      <P>If the suitability is on test, it follows that the competent authority, whoever that may be&mdash;here it is the Adoption Board; in Britain it is the courts&mdash;is not completely satisfied about the suitability of the person concerned.  If the Board were to be completely satisfied beyond any shadow of doubt, there would be no reason for any interim order and they should make the final adoption order.  It is only in cases where they are satisfied as to the suitability of the home but want to have a further test period before making the final irrevocable adoption order that they have this interim period.  It is nonsense to suggest that the Board are ever going to tolerate a situation where a child is placed in a home completely unsuitable morally.  If we ever get to that stage, it would be up to myself or some succeeding Minister for Justice to remove a totally incompetent and inadequate Board from office.  If we ever get to that stage, we could throw our hat at the whole system of adoption here because it would be utterly meaningless.  Our whole structure of adoption is built around the Board and depends on the Board's discharging suitably and adequately their statutory functions and the obligations placed upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to accuse the Senators of some confusion of thought on this matter.  On the one hand, they urge me to give the Board more freedom and flexibility.  &ldquo;Leave it to the Board to decide&rdquo; I am told.  Here I am leaving it to the Board to decide.  I am giving them this discretion, this period in which they can have a further test and inquiries made and satisfy themselves beyond any doubt.  Yet Senators are objecting to this.  I think I am entitled to accuse them of that amount of inconsistency in their approach.  If we trust the Board to do their job properly, I feel there is absolutely no danger in this provision, and it can be a useful one in certain circumstances.  It is unthinkable <Col N="409" /> to me that the situation would ever arise in which the Board would permit a child to be placed in a home the morality of which was in any way subject to question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to help me fix my mind on this?  Can the Minister give me an example of where the Act as it stands was not complied with and where he felt it necessary to put this in in order to give an unsuitable home another chance?</P>

      <P>I want to explain that this is at the Board's request.  They want this.  I am doing here what they have asked for.  I am not wishing it on them.  The initiative did not come from me.  I would visualise a case of this nature.  The Board could have before them an application from a couple who appear to them to be very suitable and in respect of whom all the various testimonials and so on had been procured and about whom satisfactory replies had been received through all the usual channels of inquiry.  But on the day before the order was to be made, a suggestion might be made to the Board that the people were unsuitable.  That very fact would put them on notice.  They would say: &ldquo;Very well.  In this case, we will not make a final adoption order.  We will make an interim adoption order for a test period to give us further time to go into this, probably unjustified, suggestion&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I fully accept what the Minister says regarding the Adoption Board's attitude and the likelihood of its using its powers in the interests of the child under this Section but it reads badly when it is set out in the Act that the Board &ldquo;is not satisfied&rdquo;.  That is a rather categorical statement.  If some qualification were put in, for example, that the Board &ldquo;is not yet satisfied&rdquo; or &ldquo;not fully satisfied&rdquo; it would certainly read better and leave me feeling a little more satisfied that the matter would not be open to misinterpretation by other people.</P>

      <P>The Minister has for the second time said in discussing <Col N="411" /> a section of this Bill that Senators have been inconsistent in that we have looked for more discretion in certain sections and looked for less on other sections.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the power of the Adoption Board to adjourn.  It is my opinion that adjournment is less desirable than the interim order which is dealt with in Section 8.  Adjournment gives absolutely no legal custody or protection to the adoptive parents.  If a mere adjournment is made then the child who is being placed can be reclaimed within a very short period by a mere telephone call to the office of the adoption society.  We certainly should not be any looser in respect to adjournment than in respect to an interim order.  There is a limitation of two years under Section 17 (1) of the Principal Act to the period of an interim order, and there should be a similar limitation in regard to adjournment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of adjournment by the Board surely is to enable the Board to complete its inquiries.  A period of two years is reasonable in this regard and there should be a provision there for an overall limitation on adjournment. The Board should not be in the position of being allowed to keep the adoption society and the adoptive parents waiting for a very long period. If it has these shadows of doubts it should make an interim order and should not adjourn and adjourn without making an interim order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at it from the point of view of the adoption society, the parents and the child, it is likely that sometimes such a provision by forcing the Board to decide might force them to refuse, whereas by adjourning they might be able to <Col N="412" /> resolve the problem.  The adjournments would not so much be concerned with suitability as are interim orders. In the matter of adjournments I should like to see the Board having complete freedom because they might in a particular case be waiting for some circumstances to change through the effluxion of time.</P>
      <P>What are we worried about here? Are we worried that the Board will dilly dally and never come around to consider a particular case?  If the Board were to do that the applicants could apply to the High Court for an order of <i>mandamus</i> to make the Board decide the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Minister's faith in <i>mandamus.</i>  He may very well be correct.  The Minister has said that the Board instead of adjourning and adjourning in order to allow something to resolve itself would have to refuse the application.  This might be the best thing to do because the Board might adjourn and adjourn and then if the matter failed to resolve itself they would refuse eventually.  The child would then be older and would have formed emotional ties with the family with whom it has been placed.  If the Minister is not willing to place a statutory limit on adjournment, if he would undertake to convey to the Adoption Board that concern was expressed at the possible undesirable effects of continual adjournments, that might meet the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Although I know there is no need for me to say to the Board that it is undesirable to have unnecessarily protracted adjournments, I have no hesitation at all in undertaking to convey to the Board the views expressed here by Senators.  If Senator Dooge is aware of any case which was been unduly adjourned or protracted unnecessarily I would certainly undertake to have it investigated to the extent of having it brought to the attention of the Board.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> Before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 2 (4) of the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957, where the nursing and maintenance are undertaken with a view to adoption, notification to the health authority shall not contain any reference to the name of the child or the name and address of the person from whom the child is about to be or has been received.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill on the proposal to withdraw Section 2 of the Children (Amendment) Act where a child is being placed with a family with a view to legal adoption, I asked the Minister, if the local authority supervision were withdrawn, could the Adoption Board exercise a satisfactory supervision on its own. The question was not answered but I believe the Board has not got the necessary staff and if it were forced to recruit persons to carry out the inspections, it would be an unjustified expense when the local authority trained and experienced staff is there to do the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They will still be there.  The Adoption Board will still be able to avail of their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on that point in the Bill, he talked about duplication of inspection. He said: inspection by the Adoption Board, by the local authority, and I forget what the third was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about two different systems of inspection, one by the Adoption Board and one by the local authority.  The difference now is that there is only one system of inspection. For the purposes of that inspection the Adoption Board are perfectly free to avail themselves of the services of the local authority, if they so wish, but the inspection will be conducted by them, and the report will be to them and not to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on Second Reading that I did not think that there was any necessity for duplication <Col N="414" /> of inspection.  As I read the Act, I think the Board were intended to deal only with legal adoption procedures to meet applications from prospective adopters and that they were not intended to undertake inspections.  It would appear that the local societies are now going to undertake inspections. At least they will have to do so if we cut out the local authorities.  I think we should leave the local authorities in because they are especially well fitted by reason of their local knowledge to judge whether or not a person and his home are suitable to receive a child given by way of legal adoption. It would not be difficult to deceive an outside inspector about the circumstances of a place about to receive a child, as I said before, especially as the visit would be notified in advance. On the other hand, the local authority inspector would not be so easy to mislead.</P>
      <P>If the amendment I propose were accepted, it would meet the objection to any embarrassing details being given about the child while leaving him under the valuable local vigilance which Section 2 of the Children (Amendment) Act gives him.  I can appreciate the Minister's desire to ease the situation for the adopters when the child begins to ask questions concerning his background, but much as I should like to help in such a sad and difficult situation, I do not think the unfortunate child would find much comfort in being told by his adoptive parents that they did not know whether or not he was legitimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that we Irish being what we are, very few orphan children become available for legal adoption. Hence it is taken for granted that those children who are available for adopttion are, in the main, illegitimate.  The Minister's laudable concern that the child might be branded as illegitimate when it has to be notified to the local authority for supervision could be allayed by a simple amendment to subsection (7), Section 2 of the Children (Amendment) Act, making that section apply not only to illegitimate children but also to orphan children.  To do this would entail inserting in the section after the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; the <Col N="415" /> words &ldquo;or orphan&rdquo;.  That is how the section should have been worded in the first instance, and the amendment should be made without delay for the sake of the children to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>I understand that private adoptions are arranged.  Would the withdrawal of the Children (Amendment) Act mean that a person who arranges a private placement will also be exempted from the obligation to notify the local authority of the placing of a child with a view to subsequent legal adoption?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to say here that on re-reading Section 19 of the explanatory memorandum, one particular phrase disturbed me.  The phrase reads: &ldquo;As regards children placed by a registered adoption society, it is proposed that the exemption should be conditional on the Society's notifying the Board of the placement, so that the Board may, if it thinks it necessary, carry out an inspection forthwith.&rdquo;  I feel the words, &ldquo;may if it thinks it necessary&rdquo; are too loose.  It would be better to insist on inspection in all cases and the inspection should be before rather than after a placement. I therefore ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

With regard to the question of inquiries, in the First Schedule of the 1952 Adoption Act, paragraph 11, the Board are specifically empowered to make inquiries. The paragraph states:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Board may make such enquiries as it thinks necessary for the fulfilment of its function.</P>
      <P>(2)  A member or officer of the Board may visit the homes of the child, the guardian of the child, the applicants for an adoption order and the person to whom custody of the child has been given under an interim order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The Board may authorise an <Col N="416" /> officer of a Department of State or of a local authority to make enquiries and visits on behalf of the Board.</P>
    <P>The Board are specifically endowed with powers of inquiry in the 1952 Act, so it is a complete misreading of the situation to suggest that they do not carry out inquiries but confine themselves to some remote sort of process.</P>
    <P>A real objection, and probably the main objection, to this whole question of the local authority coming in is, as I said before, that it subjects people who are about to adopt to two systems of inspection.  Why should we do this? These are charitable people who are offering their homes to illegitimate or orphan children, who are going to make them members of their families, and why should we treat them, <i>prima facie</i>, as doubtful and suspect people whom we would submit to rigid inspection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the Minister for Justice.  That is the whole point.  It was not the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for adoption matters, who made this amendment.  This was done by way of amendment to the Children Act.  It was not done by the Minister for Justice but by another Minister. Unfortunately, at that time, regard <Col N="417" /> was not had to its implications on the whole system of adoption.  Otherwise, it would never have been inserted.</P>
      <P>The very fact that Senator Miss Davidson now has had to come along and put down this amendment to attempt to rectify the situation proves how ill-conceived the proposal was in the first instance.  Now Senator Miss Davidson is trying to mend her hand further by suggesting another amendment to do away with this thing which in fact the section does at the moment. Its very operation brands certain children as illegitimate who need not be so branded ever.  Why place on record that a child is illegitimate when we are trying to ensure that this fact need never be disclosed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We can let the watchdogs of the Department look after the question of extravagance.  Senator Miss Davidson's position is indefensible. If she is worried that the valuable services of these local authority officials will no longer be available to the Adoption Board, that is simply not so.  The Board will be able to call on the services of any official of a local authority.  Provision is made in the 1952 Act for that.  Not only will the services of local authority officials be available but those of other public officials will as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential difference is that the Children Act envisages completely different standards altogether from those required for adoption.  When we <Col N="418" /> are dealing with adoption we are dealing with background, education and other factors of that nature which do not enter into the inspection made by the local authority under the Children Act.</P>
    <P>The services of all these officials will still be available to the Board and the whole point is that they will be reporting to the Board and not to the local authorities who have no <i>locus standi</i> in these matters.  Local authorities are entitled to do adoption work themselves but, actually, three registered societies have been formed by some local authorities to do that work on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In other words, the local authorities themselves, in these cases, realised they were unsuitable people for adoption work and they went to the trouble of setting up and registering certain societies to do adoption work in their areas.  Surely that proves that local authorities realise they have no really suitable role to play in this matter of adoption.  Some people are supporting the Children Act provision for some doctrinaire reasons which I do not understand.  It achieves nothing but brings several disadvantages.  I say without fear of contradiction that adoption has worked heretofore because the local authorities did not implement the provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some knowledge of rural Ireland and of local affairs and I think it is undesirable that investigations into the suitability of prospective adoptive parents or children should be made by local authorities.  It is a delicate business in the country: it is something the parents who want to adopt children like to keep secret, and I think most parents would like to have the investigations carried out by a complete stranger rather than by perhaps a native of the locality in which they live or at at any rate a resident of the locality.  I fully appreciate the force of Senator Miss Davidson's argument that a local official would have more knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I believe the official who makes the investigations should be an officer of the Adoption Board coming <Col N="419" /> from Dublin.  That official can and will, I feel sure, use such means as he thinks are necessary to get the information he requires, but the people concerned will not be embarrassed by having the native, or resident of the locality, coming to see them.  There is no doubt that people considering adopting children would be embarrassed and are embarrassed by having local people coming to visit them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Profesor Stanford Profesor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Profesor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. There has been no major legislation for the prevention of cruelty to animals in this country since 1911 when the Protection of Animals Act was passed in the Westminster Parliament.  There have been some measures of limited scope but no wide-reaching Act.  The Bill now before the House aims at extending the law on a wider scale.</P>
      <P>The House may ask: why is this kind of legislation desirable?  There are two clear reasons: the first is that in the lapse of a half century, standards of living and standards of justice for human beings have changed, and animals are affected by those changes. The fact that there is greater affluence in a country means, for example, that people can buy more pets.  The fact that people are better off means that they can raise the standard of their treatment of animals.  The animal world and the world of mankind are indissolubly linked in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> Other changes in our mere physical environment help to make us eager to produce legislation of this kind.  To take a simple example: the increase in the number of motor cars means that certain people&mdash;not very many but there are some&mdash;who, when they are tired of a pet, can drive into the country very easily and abandon the animal in a way they could not have done when they had not a car to step into.  One of the clauses in this Bill deals with that point.  Again, as Senators are aware, there has been a great increase in the use of chemical substances on the land, insecticides of various kinds.  Some of us have read in American literature rather alarming reports of the effect of these insecticides on animal life, but there is nothing alarmist in what I have to say.  I think it is beyond dispute that the use of this kind of chemical substance on a greater scale may need special legislation. There are other factors I could mention, but it all adds up to this: changes in our standard of living demand changes in the standard of living&mdash;and I should say of justice&mdash; for animals.</P>
    <P>In fact, in other countries there has been a considerable amount of legislation since 1911.  I could quote many Acts from the whole of western Europe.  For one reason or another, in our country there has been no major legislation.  So, in this Bill, there is an attempt to meet the demands of the changed conditions in our lives and in the lives of animals.  The Bill has been drafted by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I wish to say with all the emphasis I can command that the society and I, as the mover of the Bill, are immensely grateful for the work done by various Departments in helping with the drafting of this measure.  They have been most helpful at all levels and stages, and the fact that the Bill is as good as it is is due, to a large extent, to the final touches of perfection which they put to it.  I shall refer to that again, but I should like to say it at the outset.</P>
    <P>In legislation of this kind, there are, I think, four main interests to keep in mind, four conflicting interests.  I am quite sure that later in the debate here these interests, with the one exception <Col N="422" /> of the dumb animals, will be represented very clearly.  First, there is the public in general, especially the weaker section, and especially the children. Four of the sections of the Bill will make things safer for children in the countryside and, to some extent, in the city when certain kinds of animals are muzzled and when certain kinds of contests are prohibited and when certain resolutions about the laying of poison are accepted.  That is an interest which we must keep prominently in mind&mdash;that the lives of our children will be safer&mdash;as we have done in the debate we have just had on the Adoption Bill.</P>
    <P>The second interest is that of the owners and users of animals.  Here, a certain psychological difficulty which may arise in the debate must be firmly faced.  I fear there is a certain feeling that those who attempt to extend the laws for the protection of animals are &mdash;to speak frankly&mdash;either interfering busybodies or impractical sentimentalists. There is that feeling, and there is some truth in it to the extent that some people who talk a great deal about cruelty to animals and even write letters about it, but do not do anything are, to my mind, sometimes interfering busybodies and impractical sentimentalists.  But I say that the serious-minded persons and organisations which devote much of their time to prudent and necessary effort to prevent cruelty to animals are not of that kind.  Their motives are certainly not officiousness or sentimentality. They do good work because they believe that humanity has an inescapable responsibility for the animals under their control.  They have taken great care to understand the point of view of the owners and users of animals, farmers and others.  They have gone as far as they possibly can in every case to understand their point of view and meet it.  The last thing they want to do is to impose unnecessary burdensome regulations on the owners and users of animals, but they do say that as times change both materially and psychologically, the law for animals will need to be changed also, just as, on a much greater scale, the law for human beings needs to be changed from time to time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I have now listed two of the four main interests concerned in legislation of this kind.  The third interest is the enforcers of the law, the police.  They have a great responsibility in the matter.  They already have considerable commitments.  Great care has been taken not to put any unnecessary burden on them, and in this we had the expert advice of the Department of Justice, and I think the framers of the Bill have gone the whole way to meet it.  We are aware that the Civic Guards are heavily burdened at the moment; we do not want to add to their responsibilities and troubles unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The fourth interest cannot speak for itself&mdash;the dumb animal.  This is not the time or the place to argue about our moral responsibility to them, or the desirability of that sense of kinship with the animal world which one finds in St. Francis of Assisi or, in a very remarkable way, in the hermit monks of the early Irish church.  It would be out of place to talk on the moral side, I need hardly say.  But since our business here is to make good laws for Ireland and, in this particular case, for the animals of Ireland, I shall take the liberty of referring to one eminent Irish Member of Parliament of the early 19th Century whose name and fame are respected wherever this history of legislation for animals is reviewed.  I refer, as many may have guessed, to Richard Martin&mdash;&ldquo;Humanity Dick,&rdquo; as he was called.  He was born in Connemara.  He went to the Irish Bar.  He became a Member of Parliament for Galway in Westminster and there he devoted himself to fighting for the cause of animals.  He was supported by another Irishman, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and he fought continuously.</P>
    <P>In the year 1822, he introduced A Bill to Prevent&mdash;I quote the Title&mdash;&ldquo;Cruel and Improper Treatment of any Horse, Cow, Ox, Heifer, Steer, Sheep or Other Cattle&rdquo;. There was much mockery in the House of Commons of Richard Martin.  The Bill was mostly greeted with laughter.  But he pressed on, and <Col N="424" /> in 1824 Martin's Act became law.  It was the first Act of the kind, so far as I know, in Europe; perhaps if we take parliamentary measures, in the world, although we do know that in the Old Testament there were certain laws for the protection of animals.  So probably the first Parliamentary Act for the protection of animals was promoted and put through by an Irishman.  He devoted the rest of his life to the same cause, spent a great deal of his fortune on it, and died just before a more comprehensive Act was passed in 1835. I shall not dwell longer on that.  It is a source of pride to any Irish person that the first effective legislation of this kind came from one of our own countrymen.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the contents of the Bill before us.  There has been an explanatory memorandum.  I shall merely add some comments, leaving detailed discussion to the Committee Stage and may I emphasise that on the whole&mdash;I imagine the House will agree&mdash;this is essentially a Committee Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say that all the sections in the Bill, with the exception of four which I shall mention, have been agreed to by the Departments concerned.  I shall mention those in particular later.  I shall go very briefly through the Bill now.</P>
    <P>The first two sections, the Short Title and the definitions are formal. Section 3 is the result, as I said, of the increase of the use of motor cars to abandon animals.  That is what it amounts to.  There is nothing to cover the abandonment of animals as specifically described in this section in the 1911 Act and there are a good many cases of cats and dogs being sent out of a car to stray away and die in cruel circumstances.  So, I think this is a section which should well commend itself to the House.</P>
    <P>I have been questioned a few moments ago about Section 4&mdash;the docking and nicking of horses.  It is a fact that there is very little docking and nicking of horses in Ireland at the present time.  But that is sometimes a matter of fashion.  It could come back again.  There is no legal means of prohibiting it at the moment.  This section would cover that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> Section 5 is not covered in our Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act of 1935.  It is a humane section and I imagine the House will not find anything in principle to disagree with in it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 imposes no restriction; it makes things easier in some ways.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 are opposed by the Department of Agriculture to a certain extent.  These concern the restrictions on spring traps.  I think all in the House will agree that these spring traps, if laid in the open, can be extremely dangerous to children and animals in general.  The Department of Agriculture urges that at the moment efforts to control the rabbit menace are a source of considerable expense in forestry programmes and programmes of that kind.  They say the most effective means undoubtedly is the gin trap and they would like this provision to be postponed for a while. Secondly, they think that the placing of these traps in artificial tunnels described as not exceeding 12 inches in height is too strict and they simply call for the deletion of &ldquo;not exceeding 12 inches in height&rdquo;.  It is a concession that might reasonably be made.</P>
    <P>Section 9 extends the Act of 1911 to include a dog and cat.  Previous to this they were not included.  It seems desirable to include them now.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives power to the Guards to destroy animals in agony in certain special cases.  Previously they had to call a veterinary surgeon.  That might take a considerable time in a lonely part of the country.  It seems a desirable provision.</P>
    <P>Section 12 extends the protection of the 1911 Act to all animals, that is, it extends it to wild animals.  It broadens the law to some degree.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is straightforward.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is definitely opposed by the Department of Agriculture. Section 14 is one of the really controversial parts of the Bill.  I think it would be better to postpone detailed discussion of it until the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on public contests <Col N="426" /> with animals is straightforward.  I do not need to comment on it.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is an important one.  This is to meet the difficulty of proving ownership in summonses for cruelty to animals.  The easiest thing is for everyone to disclaim ownership and in that way a great deal of clear cruelty goes unpunished.  There is a safeguard in this clause.  The presumption can be rebutted.  I hope the House will find it a desirable extension of the law.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a new departure.  What is going to happen a dog that strays away?  Its owner has no knowledge of it.  Is it never to have a legitimate owner again?  This section prescribes the means by which legitimate ownership can be established with certain safeguards.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with disqualification. I do not think I need delay over it.  Section 19 deals with the removal of disqualification.  Certain amendments will have to be made on Committee Stage to meet an oversight here.  I do not think I need go into it at this point.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of opposition from Bord na gCon, the Greyhound Board, to sections 20, 21, 22 and 23. Some of the sections they would like deleted; others they would like modified. Again, that is largely a matter to be argued out on Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is an important one&mdash;the use of anaesthetics in operations on animals.  This will make things easier for the veterinary surgeons of Ireland who, in fact, helped in the original drafting of the section.  At the moment, the regulations are stricter than those prescribed in the Bill.  They demand a general anaesthetic where, in the opinion of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and of the veterinary profession, a general anaesthetic is not needed.  So, in certain cases, if this goes through, the veterinary surgeons will be able to use any kind of anaesthetic which they think is satisfactory.  This eases the situation.</P>
    <P>In order to enlist the sympathy of the House as far as possible, perhaps I should now mention that in the original draft of this Bill, there were <Col N="427" /> two sections which were taken over for Government Bills and have been enacted as separate measures quite recently.  Some of the sections of the Firearms Bill which passed through this House this afternoon were in the original draft of this Bill.  It was taken out as soon as the society heard that there would be special legislation. There was another case of that kind, too, in which a Ministerial Order took over one of the original sections in the original draft of the Bill and it is not now in operation.</P>
    <P>In Part 5, sections 25 to 28 are the result of what we call the affluent state, largely.  Now that people are richer, they are buying pets on a much wider scale and I am afraid sometimes are treating them rather carelessly. This is an attempt to meet the changed conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is the other very controversial point of this Bill.  It is opposed by the Department of Agriculture.  It is opposed by commercial interests. The object is to make the killing of pigs more humane.  At the moment, in the bacon factories the methods adopted in some of them are&mdash;to the mind certainly of the Society&mdash;lacking in humanity.  I shall not describe them in detail but if necessary I shall do so on Committee Stage.  A good many of the slaughterhouses have adopted methods of humane killing, but the fact is that many of the bacon factories have not and are not eager to do it, apparently.  This is regrettable in one special way.  I am informed that if one uses some way of anaesthetising the animals, making them unconscious before killing them, the quality of the meat will undoubtedly be better, that is if the animal is relaxed when the actual fatal blow comes&mdash;it has something to do with the bleeding, which some members of the House will understand better than I do, and something to do with the state of the meat after that form of killing which makes it a considerably better commercial product.</P>
    <P>So, this Bill has wide reaching implications.  I imagine it will be heavily debated on the Committee <Col N="428" /> Stage.  The society is eager that it should be given full consideration.</P>
    <P>I must now go back to one other section.  I am afraid I did not give it the attention it deserved&mdash;No. 14.  This is the prohibition on the use of strychnine. This is opposed by the Department, but the Society feels that, on balance, it is important that not only valuable gamedogs and other animals which may be killed in agony by this brutal poison, should be safeguarded, and also we must consider the interests of children.  There is always the risk that this strychnine poison may get displaced.  In fact, there is one case on record that strychnine poison was laid in a certain town in black sausage meat, and another in a district not far from this House, where a man was fined who admitted he had put strychnine in raw sausages in his front garden&mdash;so I am informed.</P>
    <P>There is a frightful danger there, not merely to dogs but to our young children.  I should like the House to keep this very carefully in mind during the debate.  It is true.</P>
    <P>I received many letters, some of them very cranky and some very sensible, as the promoter of this measure.  As the writer of one letter said very forcefully, sheep are more important to this country than dogs. That is a very arguable proposition. But the lives of children are more valuable, and we must consider this matter very seriously.</P>
    <P>That is a rather rushed going-through the Bill.  As I emphasised, it is very much a Committee Bill.  I leave it now to the collective wisdom of the House for their alteration, their amendment and their improvement, I hope.  I should like to end by once again thanking all those who, besides the Society, have been concerned with the promoting of this Bill, especially the Department concerned and especially the Department of Justice. Frankly, it has been an education to me to go through the final draft of this Bill with a high official in the Department of Justice.  In future, when I am commenting on the drafting of a Bill I shall be very much more understanding than in former years.  I <Col N="429" /> see now that a good, conscientious draftsman will put as much care into the choosing of a word or the placing of a comma in an Act of Parliament as a great poet such as Shakespeare or William Butler Yeats would take in choosing a word or placing a comma in one of his poems or plays.  It is a very great thing for our country that such care and efficiency is available. I would add, further, that this was voluntary work.  It was adding to the work of many civil servants.  I am highly appreciative of what they have done and also, I need hardly say, to the officials of this House.  Finally, I should like to express my gratitude to the Senators who have been good enough to put their names down in support of this Bill in principle.  All I ask this evening is support for the general principles of the Bill; that our legislation for the protection of animals does need improvement.  Other matters will undoubtedly come up on Committee Stage.</P>

I believe it is a successful effort to bring legislation regarding the protection of animals up to date.  The legislation, as the House will see, has not been touched for about 40 years. That is certainly ample time to allow the weaknesses or gaps in the original legislation to come to light.  It is also sufficient time to allow public opinion to develop.  Certainly, public opinion has become more enlightened during these years.  This Bill has taken cognisance of that fact and contains provisions to deal with that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that in certain respects this Bill does not go far enough.  One has to be very practical in dealing with these affairs.  If too much is attempted, if the Bill is too ambitious and too extreme, the probability is that it will be ignored in practice.  Therefore, it is better to be prudent in what one attempts and to hope that what is provided in the Bill will be fully <Col N="430" /> carried out and observed by the public.</P>
    <P>It may be said, on the other hand, by some members of the House and some members of the public that this Bill goes too far, that it will cause great inconvenience, difficulty and even hardship for certain members of the public and certain sections of the public.  I do not believe that, in the main, it does go too far.  I think that most of the provisions should be acceptable to the public and I believe that it will be possible effectively to implement them.  Consequently I have much pleasure in recommending this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We wish to support this Bill because it is a considerable time since legislation of this kind was enacted in this country.  We do not agree with all the sections in the Bill but we will deal with those on the next Stage.  I am convinced that no person deliberately sets out to be cruel to either domestic or wild animals but unconsciously some people inflict unnecessary suffering on animals of all classes and this is the problem to which we should direct attention.  The enacting of this legislation will bring to the notice of the general public their duties and obligations in this regard.  All sports in which animals are hunted, caught or killed involve a certain element of cruelty but the big problem which we will meet in this Bill is where one person uses animals in connection with his livelihood and other persons consider that this usage of an animal is cruel.  Human nature being what it is, we shall always have that diversity of opinion and therefore we must take a realistic approach to the side effects which this Bill, as it is presented, can have on the lives and work of people, especially in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel it would be wrong to restrict or prevent by orders farmers from protecting their livestock and especially safeguarding their flocks of sheep.  We must agree that the sheep is the meekest of animals and it is wrong that we should protect interests of stray dogs or mongrels to the detriment of flocks of sheep.  Like Senator Ryan, although my name appears on <Col N="431" /> this Bill, I can claim no credit for it as I allowed my name to go on it only in order to facilitate its printing and introduction to the House.  As this is mostly a Committee Stage Bill, as Senator Stanford said, I feel that further comment at this stage is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to express mixed feelings in connection with this Bill.  As a member of this House since its inception under the Constitution of Éire, I have been nominated by the Veterinary Council to represent the Council here and I am glad to say that on most occasions I have been successful in doing that.  I regret I was not consulted, as such a representative, before the Bill was introduced.  I have read the Bill fairly carefully and some of Senator Stanford's remarks are certainly applicable; yet some of them seem to me to be contradictory in a way.  He spoke about the animal world keeping pace with mankind.  I must definitely express the opinion that it is to our credit that since 1911 none of us has brought forward an amending Bill as Senator Stanford and his colleagues have now done.  There have been several Bills dealing with the care of dogs and other amendments dealing with the control of poisonous substances but as far as dealing with cruelty and the protection of animals is concerned, it is to the credit of our people that we have not had the necessity for taking special action up to now and really there is no necessity for it now either except to fill in gaps here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading one part of the Bill, I said to myself that here is a gap that is being filled and that the first thing was to increase the penalties for various offences.  There is not really a greatly increased protection for animals but there are details of a whole series of Acts that are being amended in the Bill.  That is why I am inclined to call it a mixed grill.  In the first instance, it is an amendment of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, and there is then reference to the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1806, to the Ground Game Act, 1880, to the Animals (Anaesthetic) Act, 1919, a fairly <Col N="432" /> modern Act, and then to the Dogs Act, 1906, and the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this latter Act because I was one of those who had to supervise and enforce its operations for many years until I retired from the service of the Corporation of Dublin.  It was really an Act to provide for the humane slaughter of animals.  Now the slaughter of every animal naturally entails cruelty and pain and that Act was a very comprehensive one and a very satisfactory Act for the control of the slaughter of animals in properly constructed and specially equipped slaughter houses.  We are probably the only capital in Europe which has, through the purses of the citizens, provided a special abattoir under the Corporation of Dublin for the slaughter of animals under the Jewish system and also under the Moslem ritual. Citizens of Dublin provided a slaughter house at the North Circular Road, Dublin, for the slaughter of animals under the Jewish system.  To anyone who is not familiar with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not describe the Jewish system of slaughter.  It looks cruel but it is nothing like as cruel as it looks.  When the two carotid arteries are cut, the <Col N="433" /> animal loses consciousness immediately. The subsequent bleeding looks very cruel.  In the abattoirs provided by the citizens, there is no difficulty in complying with the requirements of the Act.  As I say, there are even facilities in connection with the Jewish ritual. It represented a tremendous advance when we ensured animals were slaughtered humanely and with the minimum of pain.  Every butcher who uses a humane killer has to have a licence from the Corporation.  I do not mind the causing of pain to the animal so much as I object to the effect on the person who causes it.  Our aim should be, I think, to educate all so that there will be no such thing as cruelty to any animal.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not a revolutionary measure.  Had I discussed its provisions with the framers of the measure, I should have drawn attention to the fact that there is no greater cruelty than that inflicted by dogs which worry sheep.  I have seen animals brought in after being worried by dogs.  Some were dead; some were so badly injured that the sooner they were put out of pain the better.</P>
      <P>I suggest there should be some system of identifying every licensed dog. All that is necessary is a collar.  I suggest that on 1st March each year every dog owner should be compelled to produce a dog collar with his name and address or his telephone number before he receives a licence for his dog. The Bill is not just the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 1963.  It does not merely amend the 1911 Act. It amends a great many others and from that point of view, there is no reason why it should not make provision for the registration and identification of the dog or dogs annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference is made to the muzzling of greyhounds.  Bord na gCon object to that provision.  Mostly I am against Bord na gCon.  It is ridiculous to see a young lad out on the road exercising six greyhounds, three in each hand. If a cat, or any animal, runs across the road that young lad cannot control those dogs.  Many accidents are caused by motorists trying to avoid animals and, in avoiding them, very often hitting <Col N="434" /> someone far more important than the dog or the cat.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal with the question of anaesthetics because that is more or less a professional matter.  Senator Stanford denied that he was either an interfering busybody or an impractical sentimentalist.  I do not claim to be either of these persons.</P>

      <P>They are.  I maintain that we should all be interested from the humane point of view and from the point of view of the public interest in the prevention of cruelty to animals.  We are the human race and we are guilty of far more cruelty to one another.  That was demonstrated in the First World War and demonstrated again, even more forcibly, in the Second World War. Thank God, we have not been guilty of such cruelty to our cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it will be a help generally.  It is not too restrictive and its implementing should not entail any very serious difficulties.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my general support to that of previous speakers for this Bill.  In saying so, I should like to make it clear that my support is very warm indeed.  I should like to congratulate Senator Stanford on having brought this Bill before the House and on the very fair way he presented it to us. Senator Ryan said he thinks that in some ways this Bill goes too far, but in other ways it does not go far enough.  It is a very fair compromise. We must consider the points in which, on the one hand, we think it goes too far and, on the other, does not go far enough.  These are the points, as Senator Stanford said, we will have to fight about on the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who are likely to think it goes too far are the farmers, because they want the greatest possible amount of freedom in protecting their crops and animals.  One cannot blame them for that.  One must see it is important that the food supply of the country <Col N="435" /> should be safeguarded as far as possible and the farmers given as free a hand as possible in doing that.  But there are certain points at which, I think, the line might be drawn and strychnine is one of the most painful of all ways of killing an animal. Strychnine convulsions must be the most painful way of dying.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the farmer who is upset by the constant worry of sheep by dogs is in a very difficult position. This usually happens in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning when he is asleep.  It is very difficult for him to protect his flock.  I have known farmers lying awake, going around their fields perhaps six or seven mornings a week and then staying in bed the next morning&mdash;and that is the time the dogs come and start this business of worrying the flock.  When the farmer in these circumstances finds a dead sheep, he puts some strychnine in it, and perhaps a dozen or so dogs are dead around that carcase the next morning.  That is an assurance, perhaps, that that will not happen again for a while.  But the pain these animals have to suffer in dying is really very terrible.</P>
    <P>I think the usefulness of strychnine should be considered very carefully, but I wonder if it should be completely abolished.  Should we not have some escape clause here where, if a farmer had a case such as I have described in which there was repeated damage to his sheep by dogs, he could not take steps like this to deal with this nuisance, having first informed the Guards specifically he was going to do this and worked out a method by which it could be done in such a way as to have the least amount of danger of the poison being taken by children or other animals?  Some amendment to this section of the Bill along these lines might improve it.</P>
    <P>As to the points in which the Bill does not go far enough, I have only one observation to make here.  I am sure it will raise a good deal of protest among some people, whether in this House or outside it.  However, I feel sorry that the Bill does not contain any clause which may restrict or perhaps even prohibit entirely coursing. <Col N="436" /> This is a sport which I have always felt to be in a different category from other sports of its kind.  You have a very harmless animal which does not, of itself, damage other animals but which may cause a minimal amount of damage to crops.  This animal is caught, kept and in cold blood released to be chased by greyhounds for the entertainment of spectators.  I have never been able to see any useful purpose at all in this sport.  I can see arguments in favour of almost every other sport like this, but not in favour of this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>Including cockfighting. The two cocks are there and have a go at each other.  The best one wins.  The situation as between the hare and the greyhound is very different indeed.  Cockfighting is not lethal, as far as I know.  There is no return as far as food is concerned from this sport.  The dogs, perhaps, eat the hare but one hare among a number of dogs is not very much addition to their diet anyway.  There are other means of encouraging greyhound racing. The greyhound is an attractive animal.  His speed is something we admire, and the breeding of greyhounds for greater speed is a technique which might be encouraged.  But in this particular way of demonstrating the greyhound's speed I think I find so much cruelty that I just cannot understand people wanting to follow it.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with Senator Ó Donnabháin regarding the degrading effect of cruelty to an animal on a human being.  I think the spectators at sports like this must feel, if they think at all, that there is something not quite decent about this whole practice.  The Senator spoke about the unfortunate sheep worried by dogs.  He thought that was the greatest example of cruelty one could imagine.  That is a terrible instance of cruelty, but I think the hare worried by dogs is just as bad a case.  I hope that somehow something may be done in regard to this problem.  I would say, in conclusion, that I support this Bill very warmly.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with those who have congratulated the sponsors of this Bill.  I should also like to extend those congratulations to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  The sponsors, in undertaking the task of preparing and introducing this piece of legislation, have given further concrete evidence of their practical humanity.  The text of the Bill was, as Senators know, made available in advance for examination in the various Government Departments concerned. It has been considered by the Government and I am glad to be able to say that, by and large, its terms are such as the Government can accept.  There are, as Senator Stanford pointed out when introducing the Bill, some proposals in it which the Government of necessity will have to oppose.  As it happens, the proposals to which objection will have to be taken are confined entirely to the province of the Minister for Agriculture.  In dealing with this Bill, therefore, I am deputising almost exclusively for him, because, as far as my Department is concerned, with one comparatively minor technical exception, we are quite satisfied with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that I should like to congratulate the Society on the work they have done here.  There were two possible avenues of approach to this matter.  On the one hand, it could have been a Government measure. The Society could have gone to the Government and said they wanted the Government to do so-and-so about the protection of animals.  The other approach was to promote a private Bill by their own efforts.  I expressed the view that this was the sort of thing which should, if at all possible, be done by a private group in this way.  I am very glad that suggestion was accepted, because I think this Bill will be far more valuable and acceptable in the long run if it comes to the Legislature in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford, in a quick run through the Bill, has mentioned the various matters which the Government will of necessity have to oppose.  On Committee Stage we shall be able to see how the various sections can be amended to meet the Government's <Col N="438" /> point of view.  When I say the Government will have to oppose, I know Senators will appreciate that we are not opposing simply for the sake of opposing and that we must have regard to the interests Senator Stanford mentioned and try to hold the scales evenly between them.  When we ask the Seanad to pass or reject some proposal in the Bill, I hope Senators will regard our action in that light.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with what has been said on the Bill here this evening because it does indicate a very sensible, realistic and, at the same time, humane approach to this matter. I am confident from what has been said already this evening that we shall get a very good Bill by the time we have finished our deliberations on it in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to say that in supporting the Bill, I do not go all the way with Senator Ó Donnabháin in attributing credit to the House and to Parliament because we have not had any Protection of Animals Bill in the past 40 years.  That is no great credit to us.  However, there is credit due to Senator Stanford and to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that this Bill has now been introduced.  This Bill is long overdue. It is the sort of Bill I should like to have seen&mdash;this is really not fair criticism of a private Bill&mdash;as a consolidating Bill. It is probably too late now for the Minister to produce a consolidating Bill.  There are the Acts of 1911, 1912, 1921 and we hope we shall have the Act of 1964.  It will be very difficult for anybody to read this measure without having to refer back to these other Acts.  It is time we had a consolidating measure on the protection of animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support, too, all the additions which have been suggested in the debate.  I agree with Senator Ó Donnabháin's suggestion that for dogs there should be a collar with the name of the owner on it.  This would be a safeguard with regard to the ownership of dogs.  I should like also to support Senator Jessop on the prohibition of coursing.  It will not do the <Col N="439" /> greyhound industry any harm if coursing is made illegal and I do think it is a cruel and a deliberately cruel sport.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we have to face criticism from the Press in Britain and other countries that we are cruel to animals. While much of this criticism is not fair, we have not got a completely clean slate in this regard.  I support Senator Ó Donnabháin's remark that the trouble lies to a certain extent in lack of education.  If it could be taught in our schools that it is important to treat animals properly and, as Senator Ó Donnabháin suggested, demonstrated to children that cruelty to animals is not only bad for the animals but bad for themselves, we might get a step further.  Much of the cruelty to animals stems from ignorance rather than a desire to be deliberately cruel.</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill and of the earlier Acts lies in their enforcement and enforcement lies absolutely with ourselves as a people.  This is a Committee Bill and I do not want to go into any points in great detail but there is one provision which causes me a certain amount of concern.  Under section 22 as drafted, a person under the age of 16 shall not exercise or lead any greyhounds in any public road. That is probably reasonable enough but section 26 says: &ldquo;If any person sells an animal as a pet to a person apparently under the age of 12 years he shall be guilty of an offence under this Part.&rdquo;  In the first case, it looks as if you could sell a greyhound as a pet to someone apparently over the age of 12 but that person would not be allowed to exercise it until he was 16, and in the second case, it seems that if someone sells a pet to a person of 16 but apparently under the age of 12, he is committing an offence.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the sponsors of this Bill.  It is a very useful measure with which we can all agree.  I should like also to support Senator Jessop in his suggestion that this Bill does not go far enough.  In regard to coursing, if I read subparagraph (c) of section 3 correctly, we are merely removing doubts in this connection, doubts which apparently exist as to whether coursing is an illegal sport.  Whether we should go so far as to abolish coursing or not is one thing but I cannot see that in a Bill for the protection of animals we can specifically legalise the alleged sport of coursing.  I should like to see that subsection go out altogether and coursing matters left as they were before. The principal Act was passed in 1911 and coursing has been going on for 53 years since.  We should leave the matter as it is and not bring it into this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much impressed by the statement made on this measure by Senator Stanford.  I was glad he referred to &ldquo;Humanity Dick&rdquo; Martin who, in season and out of season, fought gallantly against terrible odds for proper protection of animals.  I hope the kindly spirit of Richard Martin will smile on Senator Stanford.  I agree that it is right and proper that legislation on this matter should be kept up to date because of changing circumstances and changing times, but with Senator Ó Donnabháin, I am inclined to wonder is there much real need for it now.  I feel there is no crying need for the measure because there is no serious cruelty although there may be isolated cases of cruelty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, one real, practical reason for preventing cruelty to animals is to protect people from the effect of that cruelty on themselves.  My attitude is that if people are cruel to animals, they brutalise themselves, and hence it is only right and proper that there should be some control.  I fully <Col N="441" /> realise that there are people who, because of sadistic tendencies, would be cruel to human beings, and who because they cannot give way to those tendencies, might be cruel to animals. There is need for this legislation where there is genuine and calculated cruelty.  The farming community have a natural interest in animals and I think there are only isolated cases of real cruelty.  There may be some cases of neglect to a varying degree.</P>
    <P>The chasing of sheep by dogs is a form of cruelty.  One can easily imagine how worried a small farmer would be at the loss of sheep, but strychnine poisoning is the most painful form of death imaginable because it attacks the nervous system.  There may be snags in regard to potassium cyanide but it would be a quicker death for dogs.  If dogs are worrying sheep, it might be better to tackle the problem along that line.  All poisons are dangerous but strychnine is also very cruel.  Possibly arsenic might be better.</P>
    <P>It struck me that Senator Stanford was inclined to distinguish between domestic animals and wild animals. The only real difference is between animals which are ferocious by nature and animals which are not ferocious. All animals are wild until they are domesticated.  The question of muzzling dogs may be controversial because of the interests and organisations involved. I think there was an Act which made provision for the muzzling of dogs.  It may have been repealed, or it may have gone into the limbo of forgotten things.  It may be that it is still in force but not enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>It was a British law and the RIC enforced it when they wanted to persecute as well as prosecute. I think it was brought in, in the 1900 or 1910 period.  I do not agree with singling out one type of dog, the greyhound.  I shall not come down on one side or the other on the question of coursing and hunting.  I wonder if we are educated enough, or civilised enough, to make provision in legislation for the prevention of coursing and hunting.  It may happen eventually, <Col N="442" /> but things like that have to be done by easy stages.  When people try to do too much too quickly, they tend to defeat themselves.</P>

      <P>I should like to commence by congratulating Senator Stanford on his introduction of this Bill, the manner in which he introduced it and the very clear way in which he put it before the House. I welcome the Bill in so far as its purpose is to put an end to unnecessary suffering amongst dumb animals, and I am sure everyone else does too.  As has been said, it is mainly a Committee Stage Bill and we shall deal with it section by section on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fear is that in introducing this Bill we might seem to be accepting the charge which is sometimes levelled against us as a nation that we are cruel to dumb animals.  I do not accept that charge.  This is a country of farmers, a country in which a very high percentage of the people come into daily contact with animals in the course of their lives, and by and large the people of this country are kind to animals, kind to what I call agricultural animals and wild animals.  They are kind to the animals they use for agriculture, and by and large they are kind to their cats and dogs.  There is of course an exception to all rules.  There is the exception, the odd case, where cruelty occurs, and where people work horses or donkeys that are not able to work.  I should like to make the point <Col N="443" /> that that should be strongly discouraged.</P>
    <P>There is for and against what Senator Jessop said about coursing. There is a certain amount of cruelty inherent in coursing.  At the same time, when coursing is run according to the rules of the controlling body, the element of cruelty is reduced to a minimum.  The hares are properly fed; they are strong; they are properly trained; and if they are properly slipped, the percentage of mortality is very low.  We all know that at some coursing matches hares are hawked around from match to match.  That is discouraged by the controlling body. Accordingly, if the rules of that body are obeyed, the element of cruelty in this sport is reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>People pick on coursing and say nothing about fox hunting or about other forms of hunting which are equally cruel.  There is a certain amount of cruelty in shooting birds and wild animals.  If the animal is shot and dies instantly, the element of suffering is small, but suppose the animal is only wounded, strays into the reeds of a lakeside and lies around with a broken wing or leg, it may suffer considerably for a very long time.  Still, it is not proposed to outlaw fowling because that happens.</P>
    <P>One point struck me as an omission. I had expected&mdash;and I am sure thought has been given to this&mdash;that the introduction of infectious diseases among wild animals should be made illegal. Some years ago we had the horrible sight of rabbits dying slow, painful deaths along the roads and in the fields of this country.  It was suggested at the time that the disease was deliberately introduced in order to exterminate the rabbit pest.  The rabbit is a pest to the farmer since on many farms rabbits on a large scale consume the grass of a number of cows.  I think the average rural dweller was disgusted at the sight of these animals dying this slow and obviously painful death.  If a provision were put into the Bill to make the introduction of infectious diseases among dumb animals illegal, it may be argued that it would be impossible to enforce it.  I suppose it <Col N="444" /> would be very difficult, but it would be a demonstration that the Legislature does not approve of practices of that sort.</P>
    <P>These are some of the thoughts that strike me on the Bill.  The House and the country should be grateful to Senator Stanford and the others responsible for bringing this Bill before us for consideration.  I feel sure it will get the most careful, detailed consideration on Committee.</P>

      <P>In order to confine myself to at least half an hour, I shall deal with only a few of the points that have struck me in relation to the Bill. I welcome the general idea and with Senator Ó Donnabháin I agree it is a compliment to this country that there has been this 40 years' gap before the introduction of legislation.  I agree with Senator Ross when he says that some of the sections are legislation by reference, and I am afraid even the White Paper does not make it very much clearer.  In fact, Senator Stanford did not help to clear up some of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate this is a difficult thing to draft and I must say I have the greatest admiration for Senator Stanford for having produced it at all. It contains a great amount of reference to and amendment of sections in Acts and I should have thought it would have been far more simple to suggest the putting in of a number of words in some sections and the omission of words from others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for rising is to refer to Section 16.  If this section had come from the Government I could imagine Senator Stanford getting up and protesting that everyone was innocent until proved guilty.  This section insists that the owner or occupier of land owns an animal found on such land, that he is presumed to be the owner of that animal until he proves he does not own it.  In other words, he has to prove a negative.  It says the occupier or owner of the land is guilty until he has proved he is innocent.  I can see the Senator's point that it is necessary to try to clear up this point of ownership, but I do not think this is a good way of doing it.  Since I came into <Col N="445" /> politics, I have always opposed this. It is a matter on which a Government make strict use of Whips, and it has always been perfectly obvious that a great number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I said it is a matter on which Governments have been careful, I was not saying it was restricted to one side.  Senator Fitzpatrick is too innocent if he thinks so.  However, I welcome this tightening up and improving, but I did want to make that point on Section 16.</P>

      <P>I should also like to support the Bill, though I do not agree with every section of it.  It is a really good attempt and I congratulate Senator Stanford in framing it.  We all know that 99 per cent of our people are not cruel in any way, but the remaining one per cent cause a lot of trouble.  It is that one per cent who cause the need for such a measure as this.  Of course, sometimes people must be cruel to animals in order to be kind.  If they were not kind to the animals, they would not have them and would not make a profit out of them. That being so, you may depend that most of the people of this country are very kind to animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few sections in the Bill that I should like to deal with concerning agriculture.  There has been a good deal of poisoning and everybody is very anxious that the law as regards strychnine should be tightened up. People do not object to the proper use of this poison but they want to see its use controlled.  They want the Garda to see that nobody other than those <Col N="446" /> entitled to it will get strychnine under permit.  I believe that is a good thing. It is necessary for the protection of sheep, as many sheep are being slaughtered by dogs.  We can deal on the Committee Stage with any of the sections to which there is objection.  I am quite satisfied that with the help of both sides of the House we can achieve a worthwhile aim in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I shall not attempt to reply in detail to the debate but shall confine myself to thanking the House for the very cordial reception of the Bill and for the lively and wide-reaching debate we have had, and also for extending the time of sitting. I am particularly grateful to the Minister for being present and helping in the debate as his Department also did in the drafting and bringing forward of the Bill.  As far as the drafting is concerned, I came in only at the later stages.  Perhaps they were crucial stages but a great deal of hard work was done before that.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I am very grateful to Senator Ó Donnabháin who has special qualifications for helping with a Bill of this kind in a vocational House.  I should like to point out that the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, does not apply to pigs and the whole point here is to extend it to pigs.  I look forward with some apprehension to the Committee Stage, but at this point I am very grateful to the House.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage ordered for next sitting day.</P>
