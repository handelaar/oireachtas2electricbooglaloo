      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to reform and consolidate the law relating to the guardianship and custody of infants.  Its main purpose is to give both parents of an infant equal rights in guardianship matters and to declare in statutory form the principle that, in any proceedings concerning an infant or his property, the welfare of the infant is to be the first and paramount consideration.  The Bill also provides for the guardianship and custody of illegitimate infants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> At present, guardianship of infants is regulated by the common law as modified by statute.  There are four statutes dealing with the subject, namely, the Tenures Abolition Act, 1662, the Custody of Infants Act, 1873, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, and the Custody of Children Act, 1891.  The Act of 1662 was primarily a measure to abolish certain feudal systems of land tenure, but it also contained provisions supplementing the common law rights of the father as sole guardian of his infant children. It gave him a right to appoint a person to act as guardian of his children after his own death and it set out the powers and duties of a guardian so appointed. The three later statutes modified the common law rights of the father in favour of the mother and, in general, sought to improve the status of women in respect of the guardianship and custody of their children.  I shall have more to say about that aspect of the matter in a moment.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the Bill an infant is defined in section 2 as a person under the age of 21 years.  This follows the existing common law which has long regarded persons under 21 as not possessing full legal competence. During the course of the debates on the Bill in Dáil Éireann it was suggested that 21 years of age was too high a limit for determining minority in guardianship matters.  There may be something to be said for this point of view, but, having thought the matter over very carefully, I must say I am strongly disposed to recommend that the age limit be left at 21 years unless it can be demonstrated that there are very good and very cogent reasons for adopting a lower figure.</P>
    <P>I believe that most parents would object to any attempt to reduce the age to, say, 16 or 17.  It would, in my opinion, be undesirable to provide by statute for any lessening of the responsibility which parents have in respect of their children, especially in present-day circumstances when lack of parental control is generally regarded as a reason for increased juvenile delinquency. Another factor to be borne in mind is that 21 years is the age limit for reaching majority in Britain <Col N="566" /> and in certain other Western Europe countries, including France and Germany. I think there is a lot to be said for keeping in line with other European nations in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill sets out the general principle that, in any proceedings affecting an infant or his property, the court, in coming to a decision, must regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.  This is a well established rule of law which was always acted upon by the old Courts of Chancery when they exercised jurisdiction in matters concerning infants. The Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland), 1877, abolished the Courts of Chancery, and the jurisdiction formerly exercised by those Courts in guardianship matters is now exercised by the High Court and Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets out the jurisdiction of the High Court and Circuit Court in guardanship matters and provides for the rights of parents to the guardianship of their children, their right to appoint testamentary guardians, and the powers and duties of guardians.  The provisions of this Part reflect the principle that the father and mother of an infant should have equal rights in guardianship matters.  The Bill thus sets out the seal on the long process of the emancipation of women in regard to the guardianship of their children.  Senators may, perhaps, find it helpful if I trace very briefly the history of that process.  At the time the Tenures Abolition Act was passed in 1662, and for over two hundred years after that, the paternal <i>potestas</i> of the common law was absolute. It was settled law that the father was alone guardian of his children.  If the father appointed a guardian under the 1662 Act, that guardian took over the father's full rights to the complete exclusion of the mother.  If no such guardian were appointed the mother became guardian by nature and nurture, which, however, was not full guardianship.  The courts would not interfere with the father's paramount authority unless there were grave reasons for doing so in the interests of the infant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> It was not until 1873 that statute interfered with this absolute power of the father.  In the Custody of Infants Act of that year the power was given to the mother of an infant to petition the court for the custody of, and the right of access to, her infant.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, has often in the past been referred to as &ldquo;the Mothers Act&rdquo;.  It re-enacted the provision in the 1873 Act giving the mother a right to apply for custody and also gave her additional rights.  Now, for the first time, the mother was declared to be guardian of her child on the death of her husband&mdash;either alone or jointly with any guardian appointed by him.  The mother was given the right to appoint a testamentary guardian, although this was not the same right as the father enjoyed.  The guardian appointed by the mother could act only after the death of both herself and the father. She could also provisionally nominate some fit person who would be empowered by the court to act as joint guardian with the father, after her death, if the court was satisfied that the father was unfit to be sole guardian.  The court was given power to remove a testamentary guardian and to deal with guardianship and custody in cases of legal separation.</P>
    <P>The Custody of Children Act, 1891, dealt with applications to the High Court for the production of the child by a parent who sought to enforce his right to the custody of the child.  It limited that right where the parent had abandoned or deserted the infant or was otherwise unfit to have the custody.  While the provisions of the 1891 Act apply to both parents, in the early years they were usually invoked to limit the father's common law right to the custody of his children.</P>
    <P>As a result of these statutes, the original absolute power of the father in family affairs, although not totally abolished, was considerably reduced. In addition, since 1883 the tendency in the courts has been against a strict interpretation of paternal power.  The year 1883 was the year of the noted <Col N="568" /><i>Agar-Ellis</i> cases which represent the high water mark of the father's common law rights.  In later years, the courts have had an increasing regard for the mother's natural claims, particularly in the case of younger children.</P>
    <P>The position in this country is now affected by the Constitution, Article 42, section 1, of which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>In the Supreme Court judgment in the well-known <i>Tilson</i> case in 1951 it was stated that the principle to be derived from this Article is that the parents &ldquo;have a joint power and duty in respect of the religious education of their children&rdquo; and that parents in this context could not be construed &ldquo;in some generic sense that included only the father when he was living&rdquo;. This judgment marked the establishment of the legal equality of the sexes in guardianship matters.  The Bill accords statutory recognition to this equality.  Subsection (1) of section 6 provides that the parents are guardlians of their children jointly.  Subsection (2) of section 7 gives the mother the power, which only the father has at present, to appoint a testamentary guardian to act after her own death. Subsection (2) of section 8 enables the court to appoint a guardian to act jointly with a surviving father.  At present it can only appoint a guardian to act with a surviving mother.</P>
    <P>Under the common law an illegitimate child, being considered a <i>filius nullius</i>, has no legal guardian.  The mother, however, <i>prima facie</i> has custody.  The natural father has no rights.  In the Bill, it is proposed to make the mother of an illegitimate child the full guardian of the child. Subsection (4) of section 6 provides for this.  The effect of the provision will be that all the other relevant provisions <Col N="569" /> of the Bill will apply to the mother of the child.  She will be able to appoint a testamentary guardian and to apply to the court for directions on any question affecting the child's welfare.  This latter right is also being given to the natural father of the illegitimate child by subsection (4) of section 11.  This provision is aimed at the protection of the child.  Circumstances could arise in which the mother of an illegitimate child neglected or abandoned the child and the father, having the infant's interest at heart, wished to get the custody.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 6 of the Bill enables parents who are themselves under twenty-one years of age to appoint guardians by will.  At present, by reason of section 7 of the Wills Act, 1837, persons under twenty-one years cannot make a valid will. Previous to the Wills Act, the father could, by reason of the Tenures Abolition Act, 1662, appoint testamentary guardians although he was himself under twenty-one.  In effect, therefore, it is proposed to restore the law that applied between 1662 and 1837 and to extend it to both parents.  This proposal is not inconsistent with the general principle that persons under 21 years of age should be treated as infants for guardianship purposes.  If a person under 21 years of age marries and has children he becomes responsible in law for those children and it is clearly desirable that he should be able to exercise all the prerogatives of parenthood, including the right to appoint testamentary guardians.  Such a case is an exception which does not detract from the validity of the general rule.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 8 provides that the court may appoint a guardian to act jointly with a surviving parent where the deceased parent did not appoint a testamentary guardian or where such a guardian dies or refuses to act.  Under the 1886 Act the court could take such action only where the surviving parent was the mother.  The proposed extension of the court's power is in accordance with the principle of the equality of father and mother in all matters appertaining to <Col N="570" /> guardianship.  Fears were expressed in the Dáil that this provision might enable the courts to interfere unnecessarily and unreasonably with the natural rights of the surviving parent. I have since carefully re-examined the proposal and I am satisfied that these fears are groundless and that the provision should be retained.  It is an established rule of law&mdash;which will not in any way be affected by this Bill&mdash; that the courts must act very cautiously in exercising the jurisdiction to interfere with parental rights.  The rule is that the court must act in opposition to the parent only when judicially satisfied that the welfare of the child requires that the parental right should be suspended or superseded.  This rule was restated by the Supreme Court in the <i>Kindersley</i> case in 1943.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the re-enactment of the existing law dealing with the powers of the High Court in proceedings for the enforcement of the right to the custody of an infant. Sections 14 and 16 relate to the situation where the High Court has to consider an application by a parent for an order for the production of an infant, or an order for the handing over of the infant to him, in circumstances which <i>prima facie</i> indicate that it may not be in the infant's interest that the order should be granted.  I should like to emphasise that in these, as in all other proceedings under this Bill, the rule of law to which I referred a moment ago&mdash;which restricts the powers of the courts to interfere with the natural rights of parents&mdash;will apply.  Having regard to this rule and to section 3 of the Bill, which provides that the welfare of the infant is to be the first and paramount consideration, I think Senators need have no fears that the courts will interfere in unwarranted fashion with the affairs of the family or with the natural rights of parents.</P>
    <P>I believe that the principles which are enunciated in this Bill accurately reflect the attitudes and values of present-day society in this country.  The Bill deals in a progressive way with a subject which is of fundamental importance to society and I feel that, if enacted, it will represent a valuable <Col N="571" /> addition to the Statute Book.  I trust that the House will see fit to give it their approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, the provisions of this Bill are of vital importance to society and, therefore, require careful examination.  The history of this particular subject is an extremely interesting one, not alone from the point of view of the various legislative processes which it has undergone but also the great volume of case law that exists in regard to it.  Now, this is essentially a Committee Stage Bill, in our view, and is one on which Second Reading speeches need not be of any great duration or of any searching quality.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was largely historical in background and, therefore, helpful to those people who wanted to take an interest in this on Committee Stage.  While accepting the provisions of the Bill in principle there are certain sections that will require examination.  I have no doubt that the Seanad will give it full consideration and that whatever the result it will be one that will advance the status of parents and of children born in wedlock or otherwise in the society in which we live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that the definition of &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo; will in some areas include about half the dogs in the country.  A great many dogs in the country are half-bred greyhounds. It is quite a difficult matter to prove or disprove their parentage at all, and there are a great many people who actually like that type of dog.  Children, poachers and people in the country keep these dogs because they are a bit faster than pure bred dogs to hunt rabbits.  It is far too wide a definition: &ldquo;any strain or cross of greyhound or whippet&rdquo;.  Why whippet should be in the Bill I also do not know, and I should be glad if Senator Stanford could tell me.  It is a miniature type of greyhound and I do not think it would be a danger to any other animal or to any person.  I do not know very much about their temper but they look very timid and insignificant dogs, and to include them in all these regulations about greyhounds is going a bit too far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with Senator Cole.  If you accept that definition of greyhound, section 20 will mean that all those dogs when they are led on the public road will have to be muzzled and under control, that more than one person must lead more than four of those dogs, and that a person under 16 cannot bring one of them on the public road.  I have a lot of knowledge of greyhounds &mdash; perhaps too much at times&mdash;but they are timid, quiet animals compared with Alsatians, bulldogs, Kerry blues and other dogs. I agree with Senator Cole.  I think the term &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo; should not include &ldquo;any whippet and any strain or cross of greyhound or whippet&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that greyhounds can be particularly savage dogs.  I have two cases particularly <Col N="574" /> in mind.  In one case a lady was exercising her pet dog in the Phoenix Park, when suddenly two greyhounds came racing along and would have torn the small dog to pieces if the lady had not got into her car and managed to close the windows and keep the greyhounds outside.  In another case children had their pet dog more or less torn to pieces before their eyes.  I am open to further information on this, but I understand whippets have the same savage tendencies and are dangerous to smaller dogs.  Greyhounds are trained to chase small animals and that might include pet dogs.  That is the reason both are included here.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Cole, the law will be administered reasonably.  If a dog has 1/64th of the heraldic quarterings of a greyhound it will not be deemed to be a greyhound or a whippet for the purposes of the law unless it is recognisably a greyhound or a whippet.  I do not think that will arise, but I am open to further information on it.</P>

      <P>I think it is relevant to point out at this stage that I shall be moving an amendment which will delete the requirement that greyhounds be kept muzzled when in public places.  I hope section 20 will be amended by the House to provide that while greyhounds must be kept under control they need not be muzzled.  I shall also be opposing section 22, so the provisions in this regard will not be as draconian as they look at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that more than four dogs will be taken out by one person at a time, and in that case the definition of &ldquo;whippet&rdquo; or &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo; will not cause any hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this very wide definition of &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo; is unnecessary, and that it will probably give rise to trouble in the administration of the Act.  Greyhounds are usually confined to kennels, and when they are brought out for exercise they are on leads.  The fact that they are housed and allowed out only occasionally means that they are usually in <Col N="575" /> very high spirits, and are likely to pursue other dogs of the type Senator Stanford has in mind.</P>
      <P>As Senator Cole has said, there is a considerable number of half-breed greyhounds around the country and those animals are never confined.  They lie around the farmhouses like any other type of domestic dog, and they are not possessed of the high spirits of a thoroughbred.  They have no tendency to pursue other animals.  Therefore, I think the definition is much too fine and the regulations will apply to a type of dog which the framers of the Bill never intended&mdash;the type of dog which it is unnecessary to control in the manner in which it is sought to control them in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know what peculiar breeds of dogs there are in Cavan, but I think Senators have exaggerated the numbers of crosses of greyhounds.  I think it is no harm to include the word &ldquo;whippet&rdquo;.  I maintain the definition of the Bill is the best that could be arrived at.</P>

      <P>My only objection is to the vagueness of the provision, and whether it could be pursued at all.  I cannot imagine the courts being satisfied with such a definition.  It is all right for Senator Stanford to talk about heraldic quarterings, but he does not know what view the court will take.  It might be that someone who could not stand dogs might be prepared to accept less than 1/64th quarterings.  I do not like anything as vague as this.  I know the Minister has said he proposes to ask the Seanad to remove the provision about muzzling but even still it looks very untidy to see such a hazy definition in an Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>Greyhounds are trained to chase small animals by sight, and not by scent.  That is very important.  As soon as they see small animals moving they go for them. Scent is more discriminatory.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (c), page 4, line 26, to delete &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with this amendment, perhaps I should say a little about the meaning of this paragraph.  Paragraph (c) adds to section 1 of the principal Act which, among other things, provides a partial exemption from the ordinary regulations for coursing.  If I read section 1 of the principal Act aright, only coursing is exempted there but not hunting because it refers to captive animals. In this paragraph which we are proposing to insert&mdash;paragraph (c)&mdash;for the first time, I think I am right in saying, we are providing a similar partial exemption for hunting.  It seems rather odd that in a Bill entitled Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 1963, there should be an exemption of this kind to encourage or allow fox hunting which, whatever else one may say about it, is not an activity directly related to the protection of animals.  However, this paragraph now proposes that acts committed in the course of hunting or coursing will not be illegal unless unnecessary suffering is inflicted during the course of these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes to delete the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;.  Perhaps I should make it quite clear that I am not one of those sentimental cranks who believe animals are more important than human beings.  There are such people but I do not accept any such proposition.  I think it will be accepted by reasonable people that there are cases of, say, vivisection, <Col N="578" /> when, in the interests of medical science and in order to progress further, it may be necessary to inflict suffering on animals.</P>
    <P>We would all agree, as provided in legislation relating to cruelty to animals, that no unnecessary suffering should take place.  In the same way, we are all agreed that while the slaughter of animals for food for humans may iinvolve some suffering to animals, even with the humane killer, these things are necessary and all we can say is that there should be no unnecessary suffering.  The paragraph we are considering now is, I think, quite different.  Here is a case where necessary suffering, a certain amount of suffering, is specifically legalised in coursing and in hunting&mdash; activities which are in no way necessary and whch are a form of amusement.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it will be suggested that hunting is a necessary activity in order to rid the country of vermin but I think, really, that no more inefficient or expensive system of ridding the country of foxes could be devised.  If the only desire were to kill the foxes, there are a large number of much more practical ways of doing it.  I think we may accept, therefore, that both hunting and coursing are forms of amusement for people who enjoy that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why, in a Protection of Animals Bill, or in any other Bill, it should be ncessary to provide specifically for the infliction of suffering on animals.  To be fair to those who support these activities, I think it is true to say that hunting people and coursing people will always deny indignantly that these activities involve suffering.  One hears stories from time to time about dogs attacking foxes and tearing them from limb to limb but in any well-regulated hunt such things will not be permitted.  In the same way, in coursing, I think it would be fair to say that those running a meeting will take all reasonable steps to see that suffering is not inflicted on the hare.  Nor is suffering, I am sure, normally inflicted on a hare while it is in captivity.  Therefore, those who support hunting and coursing should <Col N="579" /> have no objection to this amendment because if the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; is deleted it merely leaves the position that in the course of hunting and during coursing meetings no suffering shall be inflicted on any animal, which I think is a reasonable proposition. It should not be objected to even by the most avid supporters of these sports.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why there should be such a thing as necessary suffering in this case.  There may be suffering in vivisection or slaughter but in an activity entirely for people's amusement I cannot see any reason why we should tolerate the legislative suggestion that necessary suffering may be inflicted.  Therefore, there should be little objection to deleting the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support either hunting or coursing but I must disagree with Senator Yeats.  If we leave out the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; we are prohibiting coursing, hunting, and so on, because it is impossible to shoot a rabbit and to prove we did not cause suffering.  It is also true that people say they suffer from loss of breath.  If we chase a hare, it is bound to suffer in that respect.  Therefore, I think it would be unenforceable.</P>
      <P>I can see what Senator Yeats is getting at but I think he is reading it in a rather peculiar way by suggesting that this paragraph as it stands at the moment legalises suffering.  I think it merely looks the fact in the face that people cannot do any of these things without causing some suffering.  We are being asked to ensure that people are not unnecessarily cruel.  I am sure that in court it would be bound to be held that you just could not course, hunt, pursue or capture or attempt to destroy any wild animal whatsoever without causing some suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with Senator Sheldon.  If this word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; is omitted the Act will, in effect, prohibit the pursuit, capture or destruction or the attempted <Col N="580" /> destruction of any wild animal.  It is impossible to attempt any of these without inflicting some degree of suffering.  If a rabbit, hare or any other wild animal is frightened, I presume that that is a form of suffering if it is impossible to catch it or to attempt to catch it without frightening it.</P>
      <P>I suppose one of the most humane ways of catching a hare would be to net it.  If a hare becomes enmeshed in a net no physical torture is inflicted on it nor is it physically injured or hurt but I would say it suffers.  So, too, if an animal is shot and not killed instantly then certainly suffering is inflicted on it.  I do not know whether or not Senator Yeats's intention is absolutely to prohibit all these activities but certainly he must admit and the House should realise and must agree that that is the effect his amendment will have if it is accepted.  Therefore, I should be against the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Yeats is misinterpreting this rather involved paragraph.  It is really consequent on the wording of the principal Act which allows coursing and this is prohibiting any unnecessary cruelty in coursing or hunting.  Nobody can argue that coursing is not cruel.  We just have to put up with it.  I should say at this stage that I have had discussion on the question of coursing dogs with muzzles on them, as we run muzzled dogs on the tracks.  We discussed that in a technical way and it seems that one of the dangers would be that a greyhound will trip himself with a muzzle.  I am told that on one occasion that occurred.  It is relevant at this stage because I am dealing with the question of cruelty in coursing.  If the dogs would course hares in the parks or in the open field with muzzles, I believe that it will gradually come, there will be no objection to it.  People who breed dogs at present would laugh but I think there are others, too, who will not laugh at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen coursing and I am not a namby-pamby person, and it is appalling to see two greyhounds coming up and tearing the hare to pieces.  This is <Col N="581" /> cruelty and this section is designed to deal with the prevention of unnecessary cruelty.  We cannot get over the fact that coursing is cruel.</P>
    <P>Unnecessary suffering is adding to the cruelty and we are trying to prevent unnecessary suffering.  We must remember that coursing permits suffering and, therefore, we are allowing cruelty.  The question is where the cure lies.  I cannot see any cure unless the dogs are run with muzzles on them.  I believe it is possible that when people get used to it and try it out they will find it is acceptable.  I know arguments are put up that a dog must be blooded, and so forth, because a dog is cruel and chases the animal to kill it, and the fact that he gets a kill makes the dog run all the faster.</P>
    <P>This is a sort of imaginary interpretation. We have coursing with a mechanical hare on the tracks with muzzled dogs.  Some greyhound owners will say that the sensible dog will not course the hare on the track. He knows it is not genuine and he knows he cannot kill it, but that does not operate to any great extent.  As we have coursing with mechanical hares on the track, I think the day will come, no matter what we have in this Bill, when we will have open coursing with muzzled dogs.  The principal argument that may be put up is that of the dog tripping at the turn. Three points are allowed for the turn, a point at each turn after that and one point is allowed for the kill.  If the kill were eliminated altogether coursing would be a pastime which we could all appreciate.  I think the Senator is misinterpreting the thing.  The word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; is essential in this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; is definitely necessary in this subsection.  I believe if we take the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; out of this Bill it will mean ultimately the end of coursing, hunting, fishing and shooting in this country.  In every one of these sports there is a certain amount of suffering.  We know there is a movement afoot already to put an end to coursing and hunting because <Col N="582" /> people claim there is so much cruelty in those sports.  As I see it, if the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; is taken out of this Bill it will put an end to all of these sports.  I do not want to legalise suffering and cruelty.  We want to have as little suffering as possible in any of these sports.  I believe we should leave the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; in and I am against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>One other point which strikes me is that the idea here is to cut out unnecessary suffering.  I wonder could the Minister give us any idea of what in coursing would be considered unnecessary suffering.  One particular type of coursing occurs to me as being undesirable.  I know it is not encouraged.  Indeed, it is frowned upon or, perhaps, it is made illegal by the controlling body.  That is, using an insufficient number of hares at a coursing meeting and coursing the same unfortunate hare three or four times a day.  I think if somebody put down an amendment on the next Stage, perhaps, that it shall be illegal to course a hare at any coursing meeting more than once on the same day and to impose a substantial penalty for such a practice, he would be doing something by way of eliminating that one type of cruelty which is certainly not unknown and which is not approved of.</P>

      <P>I just want to make a point and I may be anticipating Senator Stanford here.  I want to remind the House that this Bill is actually extending the protection of animals.  Up to now the prohibition of cruelty to animals has only been in relation to animals in captivity and this Bill is extending the prohibition of cruelty to animals, whether they are in captivity or not.  The Bill is making that very important humane extension and it is that extension that makes this provision necessary.  Unless the House decides that these sports shall be no more, we have to have this provision.  The point I want to emphasise is that the provision is only made necessary because of the extension we are incorporating in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for making this point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of cruelty, we would need more authoritative information than we probably have as to whether we would regard open coursing at any rate as cruel. Is it when the hounds get up to the hare or is there any cruelty long before they get up to the hare?  If it is a long course is it only when they reach the hare, and when the dogs have a hold of the hare, that there is cruelty?</P>

      <P>When it is suffering to the hare it may be suffering after one run but I do not think we need worry to that extent.  Is there all that suffering for animals, when the greyhound reaches the hare?  It is very doubtful.  Of course, we have to keep in mind, in so far as open coursing is concerned, that it is a very important industry in this country.  We have well organised sections dealing with coursing. I do not think we need worry too <Col N="584" /> much in regard to cruelty.  I agree it is necessary to have something along the lines the Minister states but I do not think it is that serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The killing of the hare is not the point in the case of coursing. Coursing and foxhunting are primarily amusements.  Therefore, they are on quite a different basis to ordinary hunting, fishing, and so on.  It is difficult to deal with one without dealing with the other.  I expect some element of suffering must exist in the case of shooting birds and rabbits or in the case of fishing and a provision that no unnecessary suffering should be caused is quite reasonable.  It is really a pity that this is done in such a way that we will also legalise suffering of animals purely as an amusement.  I think it is entirely wrong.  Senator Ó Donnabháin made it quite clear that the whole essence of coursing is that it is bound up with suffering to animals.  I am not at all impressed by the Senator who said that coursing is a good thing because it is an industry&mdash;so is bull-fighting in Spain.  I cannot see that that is any justification for it at all.  I agree with Senator Stanford that it is a brave man who sets himself out to abolish coursing and hunting.  The only thing I regret is that in future years the legislation we are now passing may well prove a guide to courts dealing with cruelty in coursing and on the hunting field. It may be taken as a defence for advocating these activities.  I think that is <Col N="585" /> something which we would very much regret.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's amendment to change the time from one hour to three hours. It might not be easy to get drinking water in certain places within an hour but it would be wrong to leave an animal longer than three hours without drinking water.  The wording of this whole section is terribly woolly to me.  From my understanding of what impounding is in Dublin city this matter is under the control of the Gardaí.</P>

      <P>It is not an ordinary field.  If cattle coming from <Col N="587" /> the country are transferred to a lairage overnight that is not a pound.  It is where stray animals are detained.  Anywhere from Cork to Donegal a pound is a certain yard or field or other place &mdash;but it is not a field in the city.  It is a place where animals are detained by the guards because they have broken loose or have gone astray or for another purpose.  It is under official control.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how you call it a pound unless it is a place of detention under official control, under the control of the guards, because the guards have put the animals in.  I have inspected pounds in Dublin city and others have been established since then.  If an animal strays from the markets or breaks away while it is being transferred to the North Wall it is taken to a certain place which is the official detention pound.  The phraseology in the section then is a bit woolly.  It is under official control, and it is the responsibility of the veterinary officers of the corporation as well as the guards, to see that animals are supplied with drinking water and with food if they are kept overnight.  The section does not appeal to me.  It says in a pound an animal should get drinking water if it is left three hours.  It should not refer to slaughter houses under the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935.  The whole phraseology is too woolly and is unacceptable.</P>

      <P>We would be very much obliged if the Minister could give us an official definition of &ldquo;pound&rdquo;. In Westmeath, in Mullingar, it is under official control, an area of an acre or two surrounded by a wall in which cattle, sheep and other animals are kept.  Can a lair, a yard, a salesyard, a wagon, a fair green, be called a pound under this definition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that by a pound we mean what an ordinary sensible man means by a pound: a field or yard in which seized animals are kept.  There is no suggestion here <Col N="588" /> in this section or in the 1911 Act that we are speaking only of official pounds. That is not so.  That would be nonsense. People could impound animals in unofficial pounds and they could be just as cruel&mdash;indeed are more likely to be cruel&mdash;than people dealing with official pounds.  The provision is meant to apply only to animals in the type of place described by Senator L'Estrange, a field, a yard or lairage used as a pound.  In my opinion it might in certain circumstances include a wagon.  I am a bit unsure of the meaning of the word &ldquo;receptacle&rdquo; and it is a word which we will have to look at again in the context.  In the 1911 Act it is used in a very narrow way to mean a place where animals are received but it might not be the right word in this context.  Perhaps Senator Stanford will look at it again.</P>

      <P>In the original Act the expression &ldquo;pound&rdquo; was used in relation to impounding or confining animals and it includes any receptacle of a like nature.  Since I was a young fellow a pound in the country or in Dublin city was a place officially designated for keeping animals under official control and it did not apply where there was no official control. Now it seems that the definition of pound is much wider than my interpretation of it which was that it applied in a country town or Dublin city to an officially designated pound.</P>

There may be something to be said for one hour rather than three as the provision for giving water.  If it is an hour the person in charge of the animal or the pound would provide it right away.  But if the provision gives three hours' grace he may say that the animal may be out of it in that time: he may be more likely to neglect the provision if there is a longer period than one hour.

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture estimates that it will take about four years for him to carry out the necessary tests so that he will be in a position to make an order under this section.  Therefore, the amendment proposes to substitute 1st June, 1968, for the original date proposed, 1st June, 1965.  We should all like to get rid of gin traps as soon as the Bill proposes, but I am afraid we are forced by the practicalities of the situation to wait another little while.

      <P>This means that the mills of the Department of Agriculture will be grinding rather slowly on this matter.  I must say at once the Department have been very helpful in general on this Bill, but they have known more or less for six years that it was intended to introduce legislation on this point.  Therefore, we had <Col N="592" /> hoped that perhaps something might have been organised to meet the date in 1965.  The year 1968 is a long way off.  I prefer not to yield on this amendment, and I hope the House will support the view that one year's time ought to be sufficient in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Very well.  The Minister for Agriculture considers it would not be possible to frame regulations that would permit the use of spring traps for the open trapping of rabbits in certain circumstances but not generally.  If the regulations allowed spring traps to be placed in the open, that is, with no cover over them, it would nullify the whole point of the section.  I think it is impossible to envisage conditions or limitations, indeed, that would alter that situation. The Minister for Agriculture does not object to a provision whereby he would be empowered to issue permits to individuals permitting them to trap rabbits in the open provided it is <Col N="593" /> made clear, as it is in Government amendment No. 11, that he is given the power to attach conditions to such permits.  The idea is that a permit might be justified if a farmer were infested with rabbits and trapping were the only remedy available.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after subsection (4), to insert the following subsection:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that in certain circumstances a person may be permitted to trap rabbits in the open.  I cannot see what is wrong with the present system.  Rabbits are trapped in the open as well as at the tunnels or rabbit holes as described in the Bill.  It will now be the position that the matter will be regulated by the Minister who will issue instructions.  Then there will have to be examination as to whether or not a person is entitled to get a permit and under particular circumstances he may not.</P>
      <P>The system is there.  It is well known that traps are laid in various ways to trap rabbits according as the people doing the trapping would decide.  The question of cruelty does not come into it.  They may trap them in the open or at the tunnel going up to where the rabbit has the burrow.  There should be no difficulty at all in allowing the system that exists at the moment to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <P>I am asking the House to reject this section entirely, first of all, because in my opinion it goes too far and, secondly, because the appropriate way to deal with this problem is by an order under the Poisons Act, 1961.  The Poisons Act, 1961, established the Poisons Council and I understand that they are considering recommending the strict control of strychnine.  That control would be given effect to by ministerial order under the 1961 Act.  I think the House might agree that this is obviously the right way to deal with this problem. The Poisons Council are the competent authority and they would examine all aspects of the matter.  On the one hand, they would have to have regard to the dangers and suffering caused by strychnine and the availability of suitable alternatives and, on the other hand, they would have to have regard to the fact that strychnine is a cheap protection for sheep owners and farmers against the ravages of dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also this to it.  Conditions will change from time to time and new drugs will come on the market which might render the use of strychnine, even in rat poisons, completely obsolete.  The section envisages the use of strychnine in rat poisons.  It is inappropriate to deal with a matter of this sort in a Bill of this kind, and it <Col N="596" /> is better to leave consideration of the whole matter to the Poisons Council.</P>

There is a clash of interests here.  We must face it.  The farmers want protection for their sheep to the utmost degree.  On the other hand, we know that valuable dogs, game and other wild life in the country are endangered and sometimes destroyed by the use of strychnine. The present law on the matter is laid down in the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, section 8 of which states:</P>
      <P>that the poison was placed by the accused for the purpose of destroying rats, mice, or other small vermin, and that he took all reasonable precautions to prevent access thereto of dogs, cats, fowls, or other domestic animals.  But in Ireland these provisions do not apply.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether that is a compliment to us or not.  This special exemption was given to us in 1911.  Now we feel in 1964, when most other countries prohibit it, that we should do so.  It is prohibited in Britain: under the Animals Poisons' Regulations, 1963 it is prohibited except for the destruction of moles. We found a situation in Tralee last year when many dogs were poisoned, the bait having been laid in the town in black sausage meat.  I must say that this is outrageous, and it should be prohibited, to put a bait&mdash;and I call it a bait&mdash;in a town to kill dogs as a kind of revenge for worrying sheep. Again, in Dún Laoghaire, a man was fined recently who admitted that he put strychnine in raw sausages in his front garden.  Under the present law that can happen, and we feel here and now we should try to bring in a provision to control it, and a section of this kind is necessary.  Perhaps it should be amended in some way, but to leave no protection at all for <Col N="597" /> children, dogs, valuable pets, and so on is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands in August, 1953, gave details of grants for the preservation of game reserves and he condemned the exposure of impregnated carcases and other poison media.  This is the kind of thing we want to avoid and the kind of thing the Minister for Lands condemned.  I can urge a strong case here.  I can assure the House there is strong weight of opinion behind this section. I should like to get protection for human beings, as well as for animals, who are in grave danger under the existing laws.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word about strychnine as a poison.  I think very few people would object to the sale of strychnine being prohibited altogether.  It is a dreadfully dangerous poison that has deadly effects for many years.  It has been known that strychnine has caused the death of a human being many years after it has been purchased, for, perhaps, a harmless reason.  I think the number of people who lay strychnine are few and far between.  There is general public opinion in the country against the laying of strychnine for poisoning animals.  I am in favour of this section as it stands.  It will reduce the possibility of strychnine being used to take human life.  As I say, most country people have a holy horror of strychnine, and, to use their own expression, it is unlucky to have it about the house.  I have heard that since I was knee high.  Therefore, I am in favour of the section for that reason.  If the Minister gives an assurance that it will be dealt with in another Act, or by statutory regulations, it might go a long way to allay the fears that Senators have.</P>

      <P>I have had some discussion in connection with this section and everybody I spoke to agreed that strychnine was a repulsive type of poison to use on any animal. Obviously it is a poison that has to be applied to prevent sheep being worried by dogs.  I said, on the Second Stage, that the most repulsive thing was to see the results of sheep being <Col N="598" /> worried, harried and bitten by dogs. Apparently, the remedy is to lay poison and warn everybody that the poison is laid.  Certainly, some of the poisons which are laid at present are dangerous to humans, whether the dog it is intended to prevent worrying the sheep, is killed or not.  It is very difficult to suggest an alternative poison that would not be immediately dangerous.  Sodium or potassium cyanide are quicker in action and less cruel to the animal but unfortunately they are volatile and dangerous to the person coming near them.  They are also dangerous to the person applying them.</P>
      <P>Then we come to the poisons which public authorities, including the Dublin Corporation, use for rats.  I wonder if such poisons could be used for the destruction of badgers and other vermin and for animals, such as dogs, worrying sheep.  I agree strychnine should not be used but, unfortunately, up to the present, nobody seems to have suggested an alternative that would be operative.  I agree with Senator Stanford that we cannot support this section until we have a proper alternative.  Let us hope that the Poisons Bill, which is under administration by the Minister for Health, will produce something that can be effective and that will not be so repulsive as strychnine is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I totally disagree with what Senator Stanford said on this section.  I personally know a farmer on the KildareLeix border who, less than 12 months ago, lost 70 sheep in one night because they were frightened by a pack of dogs which chased them into a quarry.  I believe the farmer must have some way of protecting his flock of sheep from being worried by dogs.  I cannot see that there is any justification for this House, or, indeed the Oireachtas, enacting legislation to protect mongrels and stray dogs.  If these dogs were of any value whatsoever, or their owners had any regard for them, they would not allow them to wander around hungrily at night to the detriment of the public.  The dogs, which wander around in any town, are a danger not only to the <Col N="599" /> passing traffic but also to cyclists and other people.  They chase anything that comes near them.  Naturally enough, sheep, being timid creatures, are frightened of stray dogs which happen to be in the same field as they are.</P>
      <P>I am also opposed to the section which stipulates that poison should not be laid within 100 yards of a public road or public place.  That is a rather severe burden on farmers because there are lots of farms in which the fields are less than 100 yards across and less than 100 yards from the road.  If this section is allowed to go through it will mean that there will be farms on which it would not be possible to lay poison, especially in small fields.  Surely the small farmer is as much entitled to protect his animals as the larger farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I see both sides of this argument.  As I said on the Second Stage, I wonder, as I suggested then, is there a compromise possible which might allow a farmer, who has had his sheep worried, perhaps more than once, to make a case to the local sergeant of the Garda for permission to lay strychnine?  In that particular case he would be supplied with the poison by the chemist on presentation of the authorisation from the sergeant. He would get a reasonable amount which would be satisfactory for the job and that would be the end of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <P>We are all agreed that strychnine is an extremely undesirable poison but, equally, there does seem to be a strong case for some sort of satisfactory poison to deal with dogs which worry sheep.  I wonder is it necessary to throw out this whole section just because the use of strychnine is allowed.  Would it not be possible to insert a provision, on Report Stage, that the use of strychnine would be prohibited except by regulations made by the Minister?  The section, as it stands, provides for personal application to the Minister for permits in cases where strychnine is to be used. I do not think that is really practicable. There might be hundreds of <Col N="600" /> applications coming in from farmers and each one would have to be investigated.  It would be a cumbersome procedure.  If the Minister will make regulations under which strychnine could be used, then that would be more practicable.  One obvious regulation which could be made would be the prohibition of the use of strychnine in towns.  I wonder would the Minister accept the section on the basis that the use of strychnine would be allowed where the regulations permitted it.</P>

      <P>We should all like very much to see the use of strychnine prohibited.  In the case of mountain sheep farmers their trouble is that foxes worry their sheep in the lambing season.  The trouble is to give poisoned bait to the foxes.  Foxes will not take poisoned meat because they like to do their own killing and very often a live bait has to be used.  I know something about that and I have discussed it many times with farmers.  They get a fowl and put the strychnine under the outer layer of the skin of the fowl.  It would take a considerable time before the poison would kill the fowl in that way but the fox comes along for the kill and is killed by the poison from the carcase of the fowl.  I asked was that not persecution to the fowl but I was told not.  There is a need for strychnine until something else can be got to replace it.  We would really like something to put dogs asleep until such time as we caught them doing the mischief.</P>

We all know the deadly effects of strychnine and that it is very dangerous but it would be difficult to suggest an alternative and I have never heard of human beings being hurt due to strychnine laid by farmers to kill animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is an agricultural country and according to the last statistics almost 60 per cent of our exports come from the land, so farmers and their property must be protected.  We can not expect them to build fences around <Col N="601" /> all their land or to stay up day and night with shotguns to keep dogs from worrying their sheep.  We are dealing with cruelty and unnecessary suffering but the greatest cruelty inflicted each year on animals is the cruelty inflicted by stray dogs on harmless sheep and lambs.  You may get half-a-dozen lambs with their legs broken and find the ewes with their throats torn out of them.  If people had any regard for their dogs it is hard to understand why they would not keep them at home or under control, but, unfortunately, until we can make the owners of dogs keep them under proper control farmers must have authority to use whatever method they think best and at the present time I do not know of any alternative for strychnine so I am opposing the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I should like to support the compromise put forward by Senators Jessop and Yeats. The killing of cattle by stray dogs is an appalling problem for farmers all over the country yet I cannot believe that this can be a simpler problem for farmers in Scotland, and in Scotland, I think, this portion of the English Act of 1911 runs while the section was kept out for us here and I cannot say why we did not have the section of the original 1911 Act.</P>
      <P>I do not say it is an appalling problem, but anyone who has a dog killed by strychnine knows the terrible agonies that animal goes through.  It is not true, as Senator McDonald tells us, that it is the stray mongrels that nobody cares about.  It frequently happens that dogs which may be mongrels, but which people do care about, and valuable dogs are killed in this most disgusting way with the greatest cruelty just as a result of picking up a piece of meat unknown to their master or mistress on an ordinary country walk or near the city of Dublin or any city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that a possible compromise lies in something which would restrict the use of strychnine.  It may be absolutely necessary to go on using strychnine in certain circumstances.  I should like subsection (4) of section 14 amended.  The Minister is given power <Col N="602" /> to issue permits on application for the use of strychnine for the destruction of rats and it should also provide that he could give a permit for its use for the destruction of dogs where sheep were worried.  In those circumstances I would expect that the permit would require the strychnine to be laid a certain distance&mdash;not necessarily 100 yards but a reasonable distance, 50 yards possibly&mdash;from public roads and possibly only in the hours of darkness.</P>
    <P>I think we must face the fact that the use of strychnine is cruel, horribly cruel, and that it kills many animals, many dogs, which it was never meant to kill.  In these circumstances if it is necessary some bounds should be put on its use and I suggest the amendment of subsection (4) of section 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in the ultimate the question of the greater hardship. That is the rule regarding a landlord and the tenant of a house.  I am one of those who were against the use of strychnine on the Second Reading. I fully realise the cruelty of death by strychnine but with all the advance of science and of chemistry it appears that no substitute has evolved.  I should like to hope that that would happen and that some satisfactory substitute would be found, so that people would not have to use strychnine in any circumstances, but until that is achieved I am afraid I must take the view that an examination of the greater hardship must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy for any person with an ordinary regard for animals and who is not cruel by nature to make a case to prevent cruelty, but if that is carried too far you can have packs of dogs, some well bred and some mongrels. Whether a dog has a pedigree or not affection can develop between owner and dog and nobody wants to see his own dog poisoned while he may regard other dogs as mongrels.  The tragedy is that people do not keep the dogs properly under control and the result is that dogs are inclined to hunt in packs.  In this I disagree with Senator McDonald.  A dog that may be a domestic pet will, when joined by a number of others, hunt with the pack and it appears to me that a mass <Col N="603" /> psychology, a mass mind, develops and they all hunt to kill.  Though a dog may be well fed and well cared for, when he is joined by others you get a pack that is dangerous and owners do not take sufficient steps to ensure that that does not happen.  There is an attempt to distinguish between one breed and another and there are certain controls for one breed of dog, but domestic pets should be regarded the same as others if they hunt in packs.</P>
    <P>Although I am against the use of strychnine because cruelty is involved until some substitute can be found, I would be against saying that it cannot be used at all.  It would be quite impracticable for the Minister to attempt to deal with 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 individual cases.  I am satisfied it is not as cruel as the hardship inflicted when flocks are attacked.  I have seen such things happen.  While I should like to see cruelty prevented, we must choose the lesser of two evils.  I hope some other poison will be found, but until that day arrives we must choose the lesser of two evils.</P>

      <P>Some time ago we dealt with another Bill for the protection of sheep and animals.  I proposed then that when any stray dogs had done damage to animals, the sergeant of the Garda should be allowed to declare a certain number of townlands in that area special areas for a special period, and that any dog found on land in that area would not be protected, let me put it that way, and might be shot. That proposal was not accepted by the Minister for Agriculture, and the chief ground for its rejection was that the dogs of neighbours might be shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some farmers keep greyhounds as a small commercial line.  They are known as the small man's racehorse, or something like that.  Now they are to be kept strictly on leads, and more than four of them may not be taken out together, just because it seems that one or two greyhounds have killed or chased small dogs.  Protection is to be taken from them simply because some people want to let their dogs roam around the farms at the lambing season.  I am strongly opposed to this <Col N="604" /> section because farmers who may depend to a great extent on lambs do not seem to be getting consideration. Only two mornings ago six lambs belonging to a neighbour of mine who owns about seven or eight sheep were killed by dogs.  I do not know what damage they may have done to the ewes that had not lambed.  Unless there is adequate protection I strongly oppose this section.</P>

I do not think it is necessary to argue on the merits of strychnine and the necessity for compromise between farmers on the one hand and dog owners on the other.  That problem will be dealt with.  In 1961, the Oireachtas established the Poisons Council, and I am assured that the problem of strychnine is under active consideration at the moment.  I cannot give any hard and fast undertakings to the Seanad that recommendations will be produced by the council by any particular date, but I can inform the Seanad that this matter is being actively considered by the council at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are asked to do in this House today might in six months' time prove completely unworkable or unsuitable because of some development. As I already mentioned, the section specifically envisages the use of strychnine for poisoning rats.  It is quite possible that within six or 12 months' time some new product will come on the market which will make it completely unnecessary.  The Poisons Council are in a position to keep an eye on developments and consider the situation from time to time as they see <Col N="605" /> it.  They are the proper body to leave in charge of the affair.  In view of that situation, we would be duplicating our efforts if having set up a Council to control and regulate these matters we in this Bill attempt to impose controls in this field.</P>
    <P>The debate has disclosed that this is a difficult area and that Senators have different views which they hold very strongly.  I think the proper body to deal with this particular matter is the Poisons Council.  They will have regard to all the considerations mentioned here by Senators.  They will have regard on the one hand to the farmer's interests and the necessity for him to protect his flocks of sheep and, as against that, they will have regard to the various other points put up by those who abhor strychnine as a cruel poison.  In view of the fact that the matter is now under active consideration by the Poisons Council and that we can expect appropriate regulations in due course, I think the thing to do is to drop section 14.</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose this section.  I can quite see the desire of Senator Stanford and the people who are with him in the matter of proposing this Bill being anxious that proceedings shall in all cases be taken where possible but I think this section goes much too far.  It is completely contrary to a very basic legal maxim that people in all cases would be considered innocent until proved guilty. This section means in effect that the persons referred to in the section are guilty until they prove themselves innocent and with that I cannot agree at all and I certainly oppose the section in every possible way.  I indicated on Second Reading that I was opposed to this section.  I was hoping that the proposers of the Bill might have found some other way.  I take it that when someone registers opposition the onus then falls on the proposers to find some other way of getting around the difficulty.  Nothing has turned up and I remain where I stood on Second Stage. This is the most objectionable section in the Bill.  This type of section is objectionable in any Bill.  It has turned up in legislation already I know.  I objected to it then and I still object to it.  The really operative legislation of this type relates to customs offences. Anybody found with goods in his or her possession is deemed to have smuggled unless he or she can prove otherwise.  Once the Department of Finance come into it you are up against a very strong brick wall.  In this case, the Department of Finance do come into it.

From whom else could a garda inquire except from the person in the house near where the dog was found?  Obviously, it would seem that the person who lives in that house owns the dog.  If the garda comes to me I can say that I do not own the dog and that it must have got on to my property in some way.  The section is innocuous.</P>

I can visualise calves being driven along a road and one dies and is dumped over the hedge.  The farmer is prosecuted for not burying the dead animal.  That can also happen in cases of abortion <Col N="608" /> where not only has he the job of burying the animal, but his land is affected by that contagious disease.  The farmer is supposed to own his land.  He is supposed to have fixity of tenure but the general public, and especially the urban population, think that the farmer's land is a commonage where they can roam at will.  Townspeople have quite a different view.  If the farmer comes in and even parks his car outside a town where there are houses there may be an objection.  I know of instances where people objected to persons leaving their bicycles against a wall while attending Mass on Sundays.  One experiences that attitude in every town, but when those people come out to the country they assume that they own the terrain.  I believe this is an unreasonable section and I, therefore, oppose it.  There are many instances in which the farmer is at a decided disadvantage and put to considerable expense by some sections of the public.</P>

      <P>I am convinced by Senator Stanford's answer on this section.  I agree that it is quite simple. If a farmer's sheep are being worried by dogs and one of them is recognised as being that of an acquaintance or neighbouring farmer, it is unreasonable to assume that he will go into court and prove that that particular farmer owns the dog.  How do you prove that anyone owns a dog? Because a dog is normally around a farm it would be assumed that the farmer owns it.  Then all that is required is that the farmer, if he does own a dog, will come and say so. Everybody knows that a great number of farmers have three or four dogs which are not, strictly speaking, family pets and which are normally around the place.  Whether or not they are owned by the farmer might be difficult to prove.  I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that in a case of that kind a farmer should come to court and say he does not own the dog.</P>

      <P>May I say a word?  I think I am as mindful of the liberty of the individual as any man in this House, but we are straining at an unreal difficulty in this case.  As somebody has already pointed out, we are not dealing with guilt or proof of guilt.  We are dealing with the ownership of a particular animal, and I think this is a section which is absolutely necessary if the Bill is to be a practical working proposition.  As Senator Yeats wisely pointed out, this <Col N="610" /> is a presumption which is the easiest possible presumption to rebut.  The presumption is that if the dog or the animal is on your land you own it.  If you do not, there is no great difficulty in rebutting the inference.  It is not your dog and never has been your dog and that would end the matter.  If we want to make the Bill work we must keep this section in it.  If Senator Stanford came here and said that a man is guilty until proved innocent it would be different.  He is not doing that.  He is making a presumption of ownership.</P>

Somebody else says: &ldquo;The dog has always been there.&rdquo;  Obviously it is his dog.  A simple statement must be proof until some evidence to the contrary is found.  If the person did not own the dog that would be the end unless somebody else said he did own it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I always accept simple answers but I am afraid Senator Yeats has made this matter too simple.  Let us suppose a dog strayed from a house, say, half a mile away, where it was presumed to be owned and came to another house and was adopted by the children of the latter house and stayed there.  After some time the people in the house to which the dog had come decided it might not be wise to have a licence.  There was no question of ownership.  The dog remained for some years.  That is a matter I can speak of from personal experience.  There are also people who <Col N="611" /> do not feed their dogs.  The dog, being a pretty cute animal, will scent out where he will have a good home.  If food is left available in a kennel or a house, other dogs will come in at night and they will adapt themselves to that house.  I know of a case where a dog came from another place half a mile away and it was six months before it was discovered where the dog came from.  At that time, the new owner, being a law-abiding citizen, in order to keep himself within the law, had taken out a licence for the dog and had put a name on him.  I should like to know from Senator Yeats, or anybody else in this House, when that dog becomes the property of the farmer to whom he came.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this section on principle for the same reason as Senator Sheldon opposes it. I think we have got a little confused here and we have entered into a discussion exclusively on dogs.  This section will not help to identify the dogs which are worrying sheep.  It has nothing to do with that, good, bad or indifferent.  This section will only help to identify the ownership of animals who have been cruelly treated.  I can see an animal can be cruelly treated if it is abandoned in a dying state.  If a person is to abandon an animal like that, he will likely abandon it on someone else's land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section the owner of that land may have to come into court and swear that the animal does not belong to him.  It is not sufficient for him to say to the garda that he is not the owner, because the garda will not accept it.  As a Senator said to me, a tinker may leave his dying animal behind on someone else's land.  The animal may be suffering unduly.  The owner of the land may be dragged into court to say on oath that he does not own it.  The important thing about it is that under the section as it stands, until he goes into court and says on oath that he does not own the animal, he is presumed to own it.  There is no guarantee, if the circumstances are suspicious enough, or if the garda is perhaps erroneously convinced that he does own the animal, that even his <Col N="612" /> oath will be accepted.  I am against this type of legislation in principle. The Minister says he is a great believer in the freedom of the individual.  The Minister says he is a great believer in the authority of the Executive and I think the trend in a lot of his presumptuous enactments here go to show that the Minister is also a great believer in the old rule that the Crown can do no wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Stanford said that this only involves mere ownership.  Surely in the case concerned, where cruelty has been inflicted on an animal, the ownership is the vital factor in obtaining conviction.  It is certainly far more serious than mere ownership of an animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The practical difficulty is this.  When some animal has been cruelly treated, he is often abandoned.  It is hard to establish ownership at all.  This would give some lever to the Civic Guards to go about establishing ownership and to say: &ldquo;Look, it is on your land.  This, under the Act, gives a presumption, which you can rebut.&rdquo;  They can eliminate certain possibilities and probably arrive at the truth by this weapon.  If you do not give them a weapon for arriving at the truth a good deal of the prosecutions that ought to be brought simply cannot be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to this debate, I do agree there is a certain tendency towards presuming guilt before it is proved, but it is perfectly clear from what the <Col N="613" /> Minister has said, that no one will suffer under this.  It will not be difficult, I think, to establish the negative point that you do not own the animal and you can swear on oath.  If two witnesses swear on oath, it is sufficient.  I appeal to the House to grant this small lever for those who want to check cruelty to animals, who are against the very practical difficulty that an animal cruelly treated, in an astonishing way, seems to lose ownership automatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with Senator Stanford in this matter, but to say, as the Minister says, that this is an administratively simple way to do it is no argument.  Senator Stanford's argument is that this is the way you find out who owns it.  That is all right here when we are talking in the air.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, it is not necessarily quite so simple when it comes down to brasstacks in any particular case.  I think Senator Stanford is allowing his sympathy towards animals to cloud his vision in respect of what I think is a very important principle of law.  I have a great deal of sympathy with his point of view and his anxiety but I think he is allowing it to go too far.  I do not think that an important principle like this should be upset for any reason.</P>
      <P>Those who feel deeply about a Bill before the Oireachtas on any particular subject would, I am sorry to say, be prepared to say: &ldquo;Ah, now; to do a great right, do this little wrong&rdquo;. It worked all right one time but it was only on the stage and it was against the law anyway.  I will not accept the argument that to do this great right, you should do this little wrong, because Ministers&mdash;I am not talking about this particular Minister; I know he is a very charming fellow and he would not dream of doing what I am about to suggest&mdash;by virtue of their position and their desire to see done whatever they consider good for the country are only too willing to seize these little threads and twist them into a rope which could be very dangerous for a lot of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just point out one thing in regard to owners of land <Col N="614" /> and occupation of land.  If animals of any sort come on to my land, there is a well established principle of the common law that if I drive them off, I am liable for any damage they cause. I am under very strict obligation to drive them to a pound or on to commonage, or on to the land of the man who owns them, if I can find it, I may not just drive them out and set them at large.  So the occupier of land, by virtue of his occupation of the land, has an obligation put on him. He may not just drive them out.  The occupier or owner of land by virtue of his ownership or occupancy has this old common law obligation to have care for animals on his land.  We all know that farmers are the backbone of the country and so on, but down through the ages it has been recognised that ownership or occupation of land brings with it certain obligations.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the debate on this section has shown that there is a lot of disquiet about the proposal.  There is a tendency nowadays to over-legislate, to try to dot the i's and cross the t's to the last degree.  The Minister has said that a certain amount of legislation covers the position and it seems to me highly unnecessary to add an amount of legislation to what we have already in the statutes.  We have got on very well so far in dealing with animals and land and I do not see any necessity to bring in the section at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>In 99 per cent of cases the occupier of any land upon which animals are is the owner of the animals.  If there is a prosecution for any cruelty to the animals because they appear to be ill-treated the person bringing the prosecution must prove ownership.  Suppose animals are found on my land, say a horse is found in a dying condition with a number of sores, He should have been destroyed; he is emaciated, obviously ill-fed, and should have been destroyed.  The guards, assuming they bring a prosecution, must prove before they can succeed that I own the animal.  That is a matter which is practically impossible to prove.  The onus is on the State to <Col N="615" /> prove every prosecution to the last iota. The only persons who can prove it in all probability are myself and the members of my family.  The section presupposes the animal is mine unless the contrary is proved.  The animal is presupposed to be mine and the guards come and investigate.  I am a man of truth, a man of honour, and am known to be a man of honour.  I tell them the animal is not mine and that they may if they wish ask my wife, my family, my neighbours and my workers.  The guards investigate and find that it is not mine, that it is an animal tinkers have driven on to my place, emaciated and ill-treated, so they do not prosecute me.</P>
      <P>If justice is to be done at all it is impossible unless you have a section such as this and it is a thing not unknown in statute law.  A similar principle appears in the Road Transport Act.  If I am carrying goods in a lorry with no trade plate I am presumed to be carrying them for hire and reward and they are presumed not to be my goods.  The principle is very well known and unless it is applied here you are bound to have an amount of unnecessary cruelty to animals which will avoid punishment.</P>

      <P>I respectfully disagree with Senator Nash.  I think the best argument against the retention of this section was made by Senator Stanford when he said that most animals which are cruelly treated are abandoned.  That is the point I want to make.  They are abandoned, left on somebody else's land, yet under the Bill the owner of the land on which the animals happened to be left is to be presumed to be the owner of the animals.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Nash when he says it is not even necessary for a man to go into court and prove on oath that he does not own the animals which he is presumed to own. It says he is presumed to own the animal until he proves in court he does not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

It very often happens and furthermore&mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the Principal Act has been in force since 1911 and there is no such presumptive provision in that Act. Prosecutions have been brought all down the years and presumably convictions have been secured.</P>

I think it was Senator Nash who said&mdash; and I was very amazed to hear the proposition from him of all people&mdash; that an innocent man could not convict himself by telling the truth and that it was no harm to make it an offence for a person to refuse to make a statement which might convict himself.

      <P>I suggest that Section 19 be deleted.  This is entirely a drafting matter.  It does not alter the principle involved in the original draft of the Bill.  By deleting Section 19, we can incorporate the necessary removal of disqualification in the new section which is down as amendment No. 20.

      <P>The section as it stands is the subject of some opposition from interested parties, particularly from Bord na gCon who have responsibility for the greyhound industry as a whole.  I suggest we would be going far enough if we accepted this amendment, the essence of which is to delete the requirement that greyhounds must be muzzled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> Section 20 (1) as it stands stipulates:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person shall not exercise or lead or cause or permit to be exercised or led or cause or permit to be at large a greyhound in any public road, open park, beach or other place to which the public customarily resort, unless such greyhound is both under control and muzzled.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, it has been pointed out that to keep a greyhound muzzled over a long period could in itself cause suffering.  My suggestion is that if we stipulate that a person may have only four greyhounds at a time and that they must be on leash we shall be going far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are arguments both ways as far as the muzzle is concerned.  On the whole, the Minister is meeting the situation fairly well by having four greyhounds on lead which is defined as a sufficiently strong chain or leash, cutting out the word &ldquo;muzzle&rdquo;.  There is an argument in favour of having the dog unmuzzled when he is walking a considerable distance especially if the weather is warm.</P>
      <P>Senators will know that, in exercising a dog on an ordinary day, he likes to have the tongue out and the mouth open.  If the dog is muzzled for a considerable period and is walking a distance of three or four miles I fancy the muzzle would be objectionable to the greyhound, as it is objectionable to Bord na gCon.  Therefore, if we agree to the four dogs, two in each hand, on lead by a youngster, be it a boy or a girl, we are meeting the situation fairly well.  I think Senator McDonald has an amendment in relation to age.  He suggests 13 years and the wording here is 16 years.  However, that concerns another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally accept the Government amendment that we delete the word &ldquo;muzzle&rdquo;.  I have seen a boy leading dogs&mdash;I cannot say now, from recollection, whether the number was four or six&mdash;which were muzzled.  They put a loose muzzle on them and, of course, there is no doubt but that a muzzled dog is a safeguard from the point of view of the prevention of cruelty to <Col N="620" /> animals.  That is the greatest safeguard they can have.  If a dog breaks away on seeing a cat or another dog, or even a youngster running across the road, he can do little harm if he is muzzled.  The fact of not having a muzzle provides the opportunity of doing harm.  It is with mixed feelings that I would accept the amendment, deleting the word &ldquo;muzzled&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we agree to reduce the number of greyhounds it would give a better chance of control.  If an unmuzzled dog breaks away from a youngster leading four dogs, two in each hand, the trouble we seek to avoid is worse than ever, because of the damage the dog may do when he is not muzzled.  I do not know whether Senator Stanford would agree with me in this but if we reduce the number of dogs on the lead and if we leave them unmuzzled we will be going half-way.</P>

      <P>On section 20, I take it we are dealing with amendment 13 only.  That is the amendment which proposes to delete the provision for muzzling greyhounds while being exercised.  As I understand it, it is necessary to walk greyhounds when in training for coursing or for the track, but particularly for coursing, a long number of miles each day.  I think to make a provision that those dogs should be muzzled over all that time is unnecessary.  I think probably it would make it more difficult to train the dogs. In other words, I think that walking a dog for that length of time when he is muzzled, and probably uncomfortable, would not have as beneficial an effect <Col N="621" /> on him as if he were unmuzzled and relaxed.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from Senator Stanford, or the sponsors of this Bill what the record is of greyhounds on leashes having attacked other dogs. Has it been a common practice or are there only isolated instances of it?  I must admit I saw one case myself, but I feel, that it is only on very rare occasions it has happened that greyhounds being walked along the roads on a lead have attacked other animals. I do not think we should legislate here for the rare occasions on which a dog breaks loose and perhaps damages or injures another dog.  I shall have something to say about the other sections of the Bill but I certainly agree with the Minister in this case that if dogs are under proper control it is not necessary that they should be muzzled as well.</P>

      <P>I have all my life had a little experience of greyhounds. They are really a most companionable dog.  They are very seldom vicious.  I have never seen one vicious greyhound.  Apart from the fact that they have a tendency to follow a small animal, they are certainly not vicious if they are loose in the street.  I cannot see why the greyhound is singled out to be led and muzzled while the Alsatian, which is possibly the most vicious and most dangerous animal, is not mentioned in the Bill.  I am absolutely satisfied that muzzling is not necessary in the ordinary exercising of a greyhound.  But I am positively frightened every time I meet an Alsatian and I have knowledge of Alsatians having attacked children, and they are allowed to run loose on the street or in the town.  They are a positive danger and I think that they are much more entitled to mention in the Bill than the greyhounds.</P>

      <P>The fact is that muzzling is an extra protection for the small animal or child in danger of being savaged by these greyhounds.  If the greyhound slips the leash or gets away the muzzle will be an added protection.  I told the House half an hour ago about a case where a lady was bringing her dog on a leash in a suburb of this city and a greyhound passing by on a leash made a snap at the small dog.  If the greyhound had caught the small dog it would have been badly injured.  Any small animal coming within range of an unmuzzled greyhound is in trouble.</P>
      <P>I want to make this point about greyhounds being specially singled out in the section.  I think it is admitted by most people that greyhounds, for the reason I mentioned earlier that they hunt by sight and not by sound, once they start going for something are more dangerous than any other dog. The Alsatian will go for people if it is cross and in a bad mood but it will not go instinctively for people, whereas the greyhound will go for a small moving animal instinctively and will not be held back by sensing that it is not a hare.  There is a definite biological and physiological distinction here between greyhounds and Alsatians and there is good reason for singling out greyhounds. People would welcome the muzzling of all dogs.  I personally would welcome the muzzling of Alsatians. Indeed, some members of my family have been attacked by them but I do not think it is practicable at this stage to advocate the muzzling of Alsatians.  I think there is good reason for beginning with greyhounds.  If the House thinks it is going too far that settles it, but the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals thinks it is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the House to reject this section the purpose of which is to ensure that persons under the age of sixteen years shall not exercise or lead greyhounds in any public road, open park, beach or other place to which the public customarily resort.  I have had very strong representations about this from Bord na gCon and other persons.  I think my main argument is a commonsense one. We want an Act which will be a practical measure and which will have public support.  Senator Stanford, right through the discussion, has said that there are things which he would like to do but he does not insist on them because he wants to get the maximum amount of support for the Bill.  I think that should be our approach too.  If the law is too restrictive then people will tend to evade it.  The more acceptable we can make this Bill the better it will be from the point of view of its implementation.  I think it is going a bit too far to insist that a young fellow under 16 years of age will not be allowed to exercise greyhounds in public.  If you permit a lad of 17 to exercise four greyhounds in public on a leash, as stipulated, then it is a bit unreal not to allow a lad of 15 to exercise even one greyhound.  I think we shall be going far enough if we provide that nobody may lead more than four greyhounds in public places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Greyhounds are all that Senator Stanford has said of them but they are also valuable animals and they do represent a source of livelihood to a considerable number of people.  The greyhound industry is important and I think it would be unnecessarily restrictive on greyhound proprietors if we prevented them having a young fellow of 14 or 15 years of age exercising them in public.  We are singling them out in this Bill as it is.  We cannot, I think, be too tough.  If we are too tough the tendency will be to evade the law and ignore it.  I think we should confine the restrictions to those I have mentioned and that we should delete Section 22 altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister in this amendment because I believe it would be wrong if the House were to enact legislation that would prohibit boys of say, 14 years of age, after school, from helping their parents at home.  The greyhound industry is a sizeable one in rural Ireland.  In most parts of the country, where there are greyhounds, these boys, when they get home from school, help in exercising the greyhounds. It occupies the boys to exercise the greyhounds.  When they have something to do it prevents them from becoming juvenile delinquents.  If his charge happens to be a winner the little fellow who exercises him, will be more proud of his job.  It is a good thing to give boys of tender years an interest in a job like this.  It serves to give them a purpose and something to do in their spare time.  Therefore, if we were to insist that a boy should be 16 years of age before he could exercise greyhounds I think it would be very wrong.  There could be extraordinary comparisons drawn, especially in rural Ireland, where lots of boys are able to tend cattle at fairs and make a very successful job of it.  For that reason I should like to support the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in the Bill at the moment a suggestion of 16 years and Senator McDonald wants to substitute 13 years for that.  I am very dissatisfied with the Government's point of view to delete the section. If we reject the section it means <Col N="625" /> that we will have a child of seven years going around with a greyhound on the public road.  As far as Senator McDonald's remarks are concerned there is nothing to prevent a farmer's son or daughter exercising his dogs for 10 miles around his own premises. It is when you have him coming on to the public road or public strand that the danger arises.  There is nothing to bar a young member of a family exercising his greyhounds on his own farm, or on his neighbour's farm if he wishes.  The section, as it stands, puts a ban on exercising them on the public road where there is a danger to other humans as well as to animals.</P>
      <P>Senators received a letter from Bord na gCon in which it was said they were satisfied with what the Government are doing but that section 22, which debars all persons under sixteen years from exercising greyhounds, would impose a severe penalty on the owners of greyhounds in rural Ireland.  There is no bar if they do not go out on the public road or go into a public park.  You would not have so many of them; you would have only the road.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any event difficulties of enforcement would be virtually insuperable&rdquo;. I do not know why they say that but it would not be easy for any person challenging a boy to know whether he was 16 or 14.  A fellow of 14 could be as big as myself.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a provision on these lines were deemed essential it was suggested that the limit should be fixed at 13&rdquo;.  The age 13 meets Senator McDonald's suggestion and 14 would strike a happy medium.  Fourteen is the school leaving age and up to that children have to attend to their lessons and school. Again, remember that it is a question of exercising dogs on a public road or place and there is nothing to stop them from exercising them on their farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na gCon would be satisfied with 13.  The Minister, in seeking to delete the section, is going further, which I do not think is fair, and I suggest that we agree that even in a public place a boy or girl of 14 years could lead two greyhounds in each hand. We have agreed about leading two greyhounds in each hand, that is, four <Col N="626" /> greyhounds, but 16 is a pretty high limit because a fellow at 16 is as hefty as Senator Stanford or myself sometimes.  To delete it altogether is going too far and I suggest that we take the Bord na gCon figure and Senator McDonald's, or 14, the school-leaving age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The further this discussion goes the more I am becoming convinced that the Bill has singled out greyhound owners, the greyhound industry and the coursing industry for unnecessary interference.  The greyhound industry is a valuable part of the agricultural industry.  We export a lot of greyhounds to both England and America and get good prices for them and the industry is giving good employment.</P>
      <P>I do not think any case has been made to establish that greyhounds are vicious animals or that they have unduly attacked other animals.  I think that any cases of greyhounds attacking animals are isolated ones.  Dogs run after cats and other dogs, and kill cats, but there is no outcry about that.</P>
      <P>It is simply unrealistic to say that a boy must be 16 years of age before he is allowed to walk a greyhound or two, or four greyhounds.  All of us who come from greyhound rearing districts have experience of exercising greyhounds on country roads but you would think that all greyhounds were exercised in exclusive parks in Dublin where small pet animals are exercised. Most greyhounds are exercised on country roads.  Each of us who comes of farming stock knows that a boy of ten or 12 years of age is given a horse and cart and sent to the creamery with the milk.  A horse is a dangerous animal, if it gets out of control, but there is no suggestion that legislation should be brought in making it illegal for a boy of 14 to go to the creamery with his father's horse and cart.  Boys are also allowed to change cattle from one field to another, or from one farm to another, and we know that if animals of that sort get out of control, they can be dangerous; but there is no suggestion that it should be made illegal to have the assistance of one's family in this way in running a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I intended to say something on section 21.  I missed the section but I do not think I am the only Senator who missed the opportunity.  I understand that Senator Stanford would like all stages of the Bill this evening and I certainly would like to facilitate him, especially when the Bill is discussed in the Dáil and I can avail myself of the final section to say what I had to say on section 21.  I think I will be in order.</P>
    <P>I did not make a deep study of the Bill but listening to the debate, I thought that an unreasonable attack&mdash; and I can use no other word&mdash;a well-intended, perhaps, but an unnecessary attack, was made and unnecessary interference sought with regard to a valuable part of the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I have no particular brief for Bord na gCon or for any particular kind of dog but I am in sympathy with this amendment which the Minister has proposed, seeking the delation of the section because, I think we have gone far enough in section 20.  We have laid down that these dogs be under control and when we say &ldquo;under control&rdquo;, it does not matter how many dogs are on the leash or what age the individual is in whose charge they are.  If they are under control, that is all we want.</P>
      <P>Age, after all, is not a very specific factor in the question of control.  You might have a boy of 16 who is not very strong, not nearly as strong as a boy of 14, so the age factor is not an absolutely certain method of determining that there will be control in any particular case.  If you specify that there must be control, whether the control is by a boy of 12, 14, 15, or 16 is, I think, a secondary consideration, so on the whole I am in favour of the Minister's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Jessop has said.  I do not think that section 22 adds anything at all to the provision already laid down in section 20.  The only reason for the suggested provision regarding age in <Col N="628" /> section 22 is to ensure that greyhounds will be kept under control, but that is already provided for in section 20.  The following section, section 23, lays down the same penalty for a breach of section 22 as for a breach of section 20 so that the owner of a greyhound who is having his dog exercised is liable to exactly the same penalties, whether he has sent it out with a youth under 16 or with an adult, if it is not under proper control.</P>
      <P>The only point of interest to the public is to ensure that greyhounds are under control and since this is provided for already, it does not seem very efficacious to have section 22 in the Bill.  The guards would be under an obligation to check the age of anyone who looked at all young who was exercising a greyhound.  As Senator Jessop said, there might be many youths unable to keep the greyhounds under control and boys under 16 strong enough to look after them, so I think we should leave it out.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with those who have objected to the section.  I think it should be deleted. I agree entirely with Senator Fitzpatrick when he states that this is an unreasonable attack on, undue interference with, an industry which exports up to a million pounds worth of greyhounds each year and is giving very good employment.</P>
      <P>I have plenty of experience of greyhounds, perhaps too much, but certainly the vast majority are not vicious animals.  They are quiet, timid and docile animals and it would be no trouble or hardship on any boy of nine, ten, or 11 to lead out three, four or five greyhounds.  I led them at that age and I see young boys and even girls leading them at the present time, and usually when dogs are being led, the trainer or perhaps the father of the children is with the dogs which they are leading along the road.  In any case, it is no hardship on any country boy of 11 or 12 to lead half-a-dozen greyhounds.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Minister and am in favour of his amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal in what Senator Jessop has said. Perhaps section 20 properly worked would be satisfactory.  I should like briefly to answer other suggestions made just now.  It was said that this was an unreasonable attack on a particular section of our citizens.  I do not think that this can be sustained.  I want to quote three cases which happened very recently of greyhounds attacking people.  These cases come from a body interested in recording all cases of attacks by any kind of dog.  In their experience attacks by greyhounds are much more frequent.  Here are three typical cases.</P>
      <P>On the 8th June, 1963, two valuable Cairn terriers, the property of So-and-So&mdash;I can supply the name if anyone wants it&mdash;were being exercised on leads on the Drimnagh road.  They were attacked by two loose greyhounds and very badly savaged.  The bitch is now so nervous that she will not lead and when mated had three dead puppies. An action is impending against the owner of the greyhounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>They were loose greyhounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that greyhounds in general belong to a particular category.  Here is another example.  Mrs. So-and-So was exercising two dogs in the Phoenix Park on 11th January, 1964.  She saw a boy unleash four greyhounds which immediately charged her dogs.  She just managed to get into her car and escaped in that way.  Again, the greyhounds were the attackers.</P>
      <P>Very frequently greyhounds are exercised beside the canals in Dublin. A lady was sitting on a path beside the river with her pet dog.  A man came along leading four greyhounds. Two got away and savaged her dog which got a broken leg and she was bitten on the shoulder.  The case was taken to court and she was awarded damages.  It is not that the society are singling out greyhounds.  The fact is that they do attack more often than other dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to quote now a person who is called &ldquo;one of the leading trainers in <Col N="630" /> the West&rdquo; in the <i>Evening Press</i> of Thursday, 27th February.  Mr. Murphy of Oranmore in County Galway is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>To my knowledge no man ever takes out more than four greyhounds at a time&mdash;it would be too much for one man.</P>
    <P>If more than four dogs can be too much for one man, can it not be argued that four dogs are always too much for a youth of ten, 12, 13 or 14 years?  There is certainly that implication if it is a full-time business and a full exercise of the strength for one man to hold four greyhounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that these dogs are tremendously strong. They are bred to be strong.  The strength is bred into them, and fed into them intensively.  During the war there were stories that when none of us could get brandy or eggs or meat, some Irish greyhounds were getting brandy and eggs and meat and doing very well on them.  They are very well fed animals, and they are the strongest animals pound for pound probably of any dogs in the country.  That is why this stringent restriction in regard to their exercise in public places is being asked for.  It may be that I am asking for too much.  It may be that under section 20 we can get what we are asking for in section 22.  I want to make the point that it is untrue to say that any section of the community is being singled out unjustly or to say that greyhounds are not uniquely dangerous in that respect.</P>

If a garda meets a very small boy toddling along with a lot of greyhounds, it is obvious they are not under proper control, and if a prosecution is brought under Section 20 it will be sustained.  I think the Minister is right in opposing the section and saying it should be withdrawn.  There is ample protection under Section 20.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Minister may after consultation with such organisations representing the veterinary profession or agricultural interests as may appear to him to be appropriate, by order vary any of the ages specified in paragraph 6 of the said Schedule.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the Bill, as originally before us, subsection (3) says:&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was thought, on further consideration, that the phrasing used here would be better, namely,</P>

Under the amendment, the Minister is obliged to consult only the veterinary profession or agricultural interests.  I should be happier if the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; read &ldquo;and&rdquo;.

      <P>I think this wording is much better than the original wording.  The original wording was <Col N="636" /> altogether wrong.  The terminology here better represents the veterinary profession.  There could be two bodies representing the veterinary profession but the one originally mentioned was the less suitable to this occasion because it is a member of the professional trade union, if you like, and that is called the Veterinary Medical Association in Ireland.  The word &ldquo;Medical&rdquo; can be deleted because it is superfluous.  It is far better not to have either Veterinary Council or Veterinary Association specified. &ldquo;Organisations representing the veterinary profession or agricultural interests&rdquo; is the most suitable wording I can suggest anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matters on which organisations are to be consulted are generally matters of agricultural interest.  As far as I understand the amendment, it is limited to a very specialised technical matter&mdash; the ages at which certain operations can be performed on animals.  It is a limited matter and a technical one on which I think the Minister should be capable of making up his own mind as it is limited solely to the ages at which operations may be performed.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Veterinary College of Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is no objection to that.</P>
      <P>and with such organisations as appear to the Minister to be appropriate (being organisations which in his opinion represent agricultural interests).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is simply not workable because the Veterinary College of Ireland is not in the full sense a corporate body. There are two schools of veterinary science, so it just was not workable originally.  I can assure Senator Fitzpatrick that there is no intention to alter the tone of the section.  It simply would not be operable under the old section.  The body is at the moment incapable of consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzpatrick.  If the Minister consults one he should consult the other.  The Veterinary Association, for example, have in the past, and I do not blame them, tried to keep drugs for their own use and have not allowed the farmers of Ireland to use them.  There are certain drugs on the market at the present time and the farmers would not have a chance of getting control over them but for the fact that the farmer's organisation kicked up ructions.  I do not blame them.  As Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin has said, that is their trade union.  From their point of view it is only right that they should try to get them.  They will give advice to any Minister which would be contrary to the advice which would be given by farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the amendments agreed on, I take it after a lamb is seven days old he would have to get an injection before he is cut or ringed. <Col N="638" /> I did not object at that particular time but I think that putting them on to 10, 12 or 14 days would not cause them any suffering or harm.  Now the veterinary people say nobody can give an injection but themselves.  If a farmer has 40 or 50 lambs to do the Veterinary Association could say to the Minister that the farmer will have to employ a veterinary surgeon to give those injections to lambs over seven days.</P>

Farmers deal more with lambs during the first week of life than at any time afterwards. The time is to facilitate contact by the farmer with the young lambs.  After a week elapses he has not the same facility of contact.  If he wants to take the tail off the lamb it is during the first week he does it.

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete subsection (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original draft of the Bill, with which the veterinary profession had nothing whatsoever to do, subsection (6) was inserted.  It gave to the veterinary profession the privilege of committing a cruel act at any age.  We do not want that.  That is the reason for deleting this paragraph.  Nothing in this section should apply to castration by a veterinary surgeon of a horse over the age of 12 months.  That <Col N="640" /> was a privilege afforded the veterinary profession because of some extenuating circumstances connected with an adult sire which could not be castrated easily by means of a local anaesthetic. Advances made in general and local anaesthetics have improved matters. There is no reason why this privilege should be afforded the veterinary profession and we do not want it.  If that will satisfy Senator L'Estrange I hope it will be some compensation to him for the remarks he has made.</P>

I suggest, at this stage, that we should have subsection (2) include all the operations referred to in the Schedule.  We could bring all the exceptions in the Schedule back into the Bill.

      <P>I raised a point on the Second Stage in connection with this matter and I thought an amendment would be put down.  It seems to me quite wrong that the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; should be here.  I think a person commits an offence if he sells to a child <Col N="641" /> under 12 years.  It seems to me impossible to implement this section.  It is a matter of opinion as to what &ldquo;apparently under the age of twelve years&rdquo; means.  I think the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; should be struck out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the object of leaving in this section at all?  Personally, I would always like to encourage young children to keep pets and I am sure a young child under 12 years of age if he or she has any money to spend on buying a pet will not treat it cruelly.  I think such children should be encouraged.  If those pets&mdash;guinea pigs, white mice or whatever they might be&mdash;are for sale I would encourage children to get them and spend their own money on them.  I would not prohibit children from having them. When children are over that age pets do not mean anything to them.  They have not had the experience of looking after and tending an animal.  Perhaps they are more callous about other animals later on.  I would rather encourage children to get pets out of their own money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The point here is this.  A child under 12 years of age gets 5/- from his uncle.  He thinks he would like to have a dog or a cat.  He runs around to the pet shop, without consulting anyone, and buys a dog or a cat.  He may leave the animal some place no one knows about.  After a few days the child gets tired of the animal and abandons it.  We should like to ensure not that a young child should be deprived of having pets&mdash;of course not&mdash;but that there should be someone, over the age of 12 years who knows about it and has control of it.  A more responsible person should know about the purchase of the pet.  That person would take responsibility for its interests as well.  The situation we want to avoid is that where a young child, in a moment of enthusiasm, buys a pet, loses the enthusiasm and leaves the animal to die or suffer in particular circumstances.  The Senator need not fear that the desire is to prevent children having pets.  In point of fact the child has simply got to say to someone over 12 years of age that he has 5/- and he wants to buy the pet.  We want <Col N="642" /> to avoid the casual going into a shop and buying a pet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Stanford's point is a good one.  If a child wants a pet the normal thing is to ask the parent to accompany it when making the purchase.  I think Senator Ross's point is a good one also.  If the child is under 12 years of age it is easy but it is very difficult if the child is a few days over or a few days under 12 years of age.  A child of 13 years of age could be refused a pet by the shopkeeper because he thinks he is apparently under 12 years.  This is a rather loose way of putting this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly common phrase and it has been used in other statutes.  The idea is not to split hairs over a day or two.  Whether a child is 11½ or 12, he may be apparently under 12 and if he is eight or nine he is obviously too young to have the responsibility.  That is why it is put in this particular way.  This form of words is used in other statutes quite frequently.</P>

      <P>The question arises here of who will enforce this or inspect in this case.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have inspectors but I do not see that they can inspect, or that they will be allowed to inspect these pet shops, and I think candidly that the local authorities should have the power to enter and inspect them.  There are health inspectors and I had a little experience of it myself in my time in the veterinary department of Dublin Corporation.  In the four main cities, there are veterinary departments and some of these people, or the local authorities anyway, should be responsible for the inspection and satisfactory running of pet shops.  There are not so many of them.  I do not know that their inspection would entail any great difficulties.  I am wondering who else can do it.  The guards will not do it and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals might be denied the right of entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>Before section 29, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A person in respect of whom an order under subsection (1) of section 18 or subsection (2) of section 28 of this Act is made may, at any time after the expiration of three months from the date of the <Col N="645" /> order and from time to time, apply to the Court by which the order was made to remove the disqualification imposed by the order, and on any such application the Court may, if it thinks it proper, having regard to the character of the person disqualified, his conduct subsequent to the order, the nature of the offence and the other circumstances of the case, by order remove the disqualification as from such date as may be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where an application under subsection (1) of this section is refused, a further application thereunder shall not be entertained if made within three months of the date of the refusal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This again is entirely a matter of drafting.  It is consequential on a proposal which was accepted, the proposal printed in front of amendment No. 13 and in the list of amendments.  This incorporates the two powers to remove disqualification into one section instead of having them separate.  It is a drafting measure with no extra principles added.  It simply makes this a tidier Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P>Before section 29, to insert the following section: &ldquo;For the purposes of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, &lsquo;instrument&rsquo; shall be construed as including a system of gassing.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that this is the last piece of obstruction I am going to indulge in this evening.  I am asking the House to reject Section 29 as it stands and accept this amendment and perhaps it would be as well if I said a word of explanation of the situation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, empowers the Minister for Agriculture to declare a particular type of instrument to be an approved instrument for the slaughter, or rendering unconscious for the purpose of slaughter, of animals of a particular kind.  It has not yet become <Col N="646" /> feasible to prescribe an approved instrument in relation to pigs.  The instruments approved for cattle and sheep are not suitable for pigs.  To that extent pigs are outside the scope of the 1935 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture agrees that provision should be made for a suitable humane slaughtering method for pigs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture himself favours a system whereby the pigs are anaesthetised in a carbon dioxide tunnel.  This is the method I would favour, not only on humane grounds but because in fact it is the best possible way of doing it from the point of view of the meat itself.</P>
    <P>A captive bolt type of instrument is used in some cases.  You may say: why not prescribe that this instrument be used on all pigs being slaughtered.  I understand that this is not a satisfactory system in all circumstances. I think there are some countries abroad which would not accept the meat of pigs that have been killed in that way.</P>
    <P>So the Minister for Agriculture favours the carbon dioxide gas tunnel method and I think most of the larger factories are, in fact, using that method.  The Minister for Agriculture gives a grant of 50 per cent of the cost of putting in one of these systems in a factory.  Unfortunately, they are quite expensive and we would not be justified at this stage in compelling every bacon factory to instal one, even with the incentive of the grant of 50 per cent of the cost from the Minister for Agriculture. So we cannot go the whole distance here even though we should like to.  My amendment has the effect of putting a provision in the Bill that the Minister may approve a method as well as an instrument.  At the moment it would seem from the 1935 Act that he can only approve an instrument and, as I say, my amendment would enable him to approve a method, if a suitable one can be devised, as distinct from an instrument.  As I said originally, this is the last thing in the Bill which I shall ask the Seanad to reject and I hope Senators may be able to agree <Col N="647" /> with me.  It is purely a matter of economics.</P>

      <P>Rendering them unconscious for the purpose of slaughter has been in operation in slaughter houses throughout the country so far as cattle and sheep are concerned since the 1935 Act and before it.  Pigs in Dublin are slaughtered, or rendered unconscious for the purpose of slaughtering, with a humane killer.  There was a certain amount of intimidation and a certain amount of appeal that it should be done because it prevents a lot of <Col N="648" /> squealing.  In co-operation with the Department of Agriculture the question of an electrolethale was introduced but it is difficult in the slaughter of pigs because there is a certain amount of contraction of the muscles from the electric shock and the bones of the thighs and the arms were broken.  I understand that can be improved now with greater electric shock.  It was the weaker voltage that caused some of the more violent contractions of the muscles.  The animals were rendered unconscious for the purpose of slaughter and subsequently bled.  In the bacon factories, the Minister cannot enforce that and that is why pigs are excluded.  No system of stunning or rendering them unconscious for the purpose of slaughter was capable of being utilised in the bacon factories.  Now we have gone a long way and it is grand to find in this Bill an encouragement to every bacon factory to do what others are doing, that is, anaesthetising pigs.  It is a fascinating method.  The pig comes down a conveyor belt in a tunnel, practically in the open air and the carbon dioxide puts him to sleep.  We cannot get that system of killing pigs in the ordinary private slaughter houses.</P>
      <P>The third system is the electrolethale. A tongs is applied on both sides of the head and the pig becomes as quiet as a lamb.  There are certain convulsions and contractions of the muscles.  That system is not in general use.  Pigs slaughtered in private slaughter houses should not be excluded from being rendered unconscious for the purpose of being slaughtered, even slaughter houses where only nine or ten pigs are killed.  They should have a system of stunning pigs the same as for other animals, namely the captive bolt pistol.  It would not be difficult to operate throughout the entire country.</P>
      <P>To my mind this is one of the best sections of the Bill.  I hope the system will be operated throughout the country as it is in some factories at present and on the Continent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment involves the deletion of section 29 and I take it I may refer to that at this stage.  The reason for section 29 is this.  There is a good deal of what may be called unnecessary suffering for pigs in bacon factories now.  I shall not go into lurid descriptions but I could.  Secondly, there is the economic fact that the quality of the meat does suffer, I understand, if the pigs are in a psychologically disturbed state when they are about to be killed or are being killed.  This sounds peculiar, but in fact the Danes, who go into this thing very carefully, are working in their research institutes on how they can avoid the pig being psychologically disturbed before it is killed. They are convinced it damages the meat.  Most experts agree with them.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if section 29 is retained, it puts a stop to unnecessary suffering and also may improve the quality of our Irish pigs.  We are in direct competition with Denmark.  They are ahead of us on this.  I appeal to the House that that is a matter to be taken into consideration as well as the protection of the animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why pigs should be left unprotected when every other edible animal is protected.  I gather that it is argued as a sheerly economic matter. It is stated that it would be too expensive to equip the factories with the necessary apparatus.  I should hope that the Department of Agriculture <Col N="650" /> would assign sufficient subsidies to get over that difficulty.  In this country, as I see it, we are inflicting unnecessary suffering on pigs.  We are also doing some damage to the quality of our bacon as a result of this.  For these reasons, I think it would be a pity if section 29 were to go.  Section 29 will become mandatory, under subsection (1), on first June, 1965.  The Minister for Agriculture does not want that, but I wish we could come to some compromise between the two.</P>

      <P>There is a series of amendments here in the Schedule and, as I said before, they have been discussed and approved of by the organisation representing the veterinary profession. I think they make the whole thing more operable though the ages generally are being reduced. The other amendment provides for alternatives.  The Schedule has been in existence for a long time and undoubtedly is very much out of date now with modem methods of general <Col N="651" /> and local anaesthesia.

      <P>We put in cats afterwards.  Dogs in the country are generally not castrated and dogs in the city are generally castrated by bringing them to the college or to a veterinary surgeon.  Amendment No. 24 concerns horses.  Some people may ask: &ldquo;Why not take out the age of the horse altogether?&rdquo; It is out of date and that is why we took it out.  Amendment No. 25 deals with bulls.  The castration of a bull up to 12 months is not very likely and to reduce to six months is not very hard.  In regard to amendment No. 26, the figure in the Schedule allowed the castration of a ram up to the age of 12 months without an anaesthetic.  That was ridiculous.  I do not know why it should be so high.  Anything in the nature of the castration of lambs will economically and more satisfactorily be done before the age of three months.  Amendment No. 27 concerns goats.  The kid is a very lively little animal and we do not like to see it going to three months.  Amendment No. 28 deals with pigs.  The question of castration in respect of seven months old pigs is preposterous.  It would never be done at the age of seven months and is generally done before the bonham is sold or marketed as a store.  Amendment No. 29 refers to cats.</P>
      <P>These amendments are being accepted by the Department of Agriculture and by the Department of Justice and they are being recommended by the veterinary profession.

    <P>I should emphasise that this is not a special privilege to the veterinary profession. I shall deal with the question of a dog.  I am told that dogs in the country are frequently castrated, and they should be taken to a veterinary surgeon.  In the city they should be taken to a veterinary surgeon or to the Veterinary College.  I am emphasising that there is nothing of particular interest to the veterinary profession here.  I want to emphasise that what we did before was to cut out a section where there was a special privilege in the veterinary profession.  They serve the community and expect justice and I recommend the Bill for adoption by the Seanad.</P>

The strength of a calf depends on the feeding and one fed on the cow would be heavier at eight or nine months than one fed on the bucket.  Calves may have been delicate or may have got ringworm and the farmer may not be in a position to have this operation attended to at six months.  I think we are not unreasonable in asking the Senator to compromise.  The Minister would apparently agree to eight months.  It is 12 months in the Bill and it is reducing it to half.

I think Senator Ó Donnabháin knows, where a sow <Col N="656" /> delivers two bonhams, at two months they would be much stronger, healthier and heftier than the bonhams of a sow which had a litter of 12 or 13 would be at the same age.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say one or two words before the Bill finally leaves this House.  Before doing so, I should like to compliment Senator Stanford again on introducing the Bill, on the way he presented it to the House and on the manner in which he steered it through the House.  It is no easy matter to prepare <Col N="657" /> a Bill like this, to come into the House and answer criticisms on it. Without in any way taking away from the Minister, it is much easier for a Minister of State to pilot such a Bill through the House.  He has his experts sitting at his shoulder.  For that reason I should like to compliment Senator Stanford on the very fine job he has done.</P>
      <P>I missed an opportunity of raising one matter on section 21 of the Bill. The section, as it now stands, and as it leaves the House, makes it illegal for any one person to exercise more than four greyhounds at a time on any public road.  I think that, in reducing the number to four, we have brought it too low.  Senator Ó Donnabháin made a point earlier that these greyhounds could be exercised on private property or in fields.  It is an acknowledged fact by people who are interested in the greyhound industry, and acquainted with the requirements of training, that a certain amount of road work must be put in and that it is necessary to walk these animals, particularly in relation to coursing matches, several miles a day, and, I understand, even twice a day.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in section 21 which sets out that these greyhounds must be under proper control.  I think that an adult strong man could certainly control six or eight greyhounds. Some people interested in the greyhound industry and with long experience of it, the Irish Coursing Club, think likewise.  I suggest that, where a person has, let us say, six greyhounds under his control, if he has to bring out four of them and walk four to five miles with them and then go back and bring out the other two or three, it is imposing undue hardship on him.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should take further advice on this section and should reconsider the section and its implications before the Bill leaves the Dáil.</P>

    <P>SECTION I.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), line 14, before &ldquo;, or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any person coming to the assistance of such member when so acting&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two reasons for putting down this amendment.  One quite simply, as I said on Second Reading, is that I cannot see why a member of the public who goes to the assistance of a guard should be put in a different category in relation to this offence. That is looking at it just from the point of view of a member of the public, but apart from that, I think there is an important consideration. Time and time again&mdash;fortunately not so often recently&mdash;references have been made to an objectionable type of incident, particularly in the city, where a member of the guards is attacked and members of the public stand around watching without taking part.  They do not come to his assistance, I mean, although they might be willing to take part in the affray. There are many who will not come to the assistance of a guard and it is very important to create an atmosphere in which the public and the guards are at one, so nothing should be done to separate them in any way, <Col N="659" /> and I contend that there is differentiation in the case of murder between a guard and a member of the public. This could tend to emphasise this probably already latent idea in the public mind that guards are a race apart.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is arguing too much, for instance, to cite the case of a guard who is attempting to apprehend an armed robber.  I, as a member of the public, go to the assistance of the guard and I am running a greater risk than he is because the robber could argue to himself that he might get away from one but his chance of getting away from two is very much less.  He might want to use the gun he has with him and I do not think it unfair to suggest that he would naturally choose to shoot me rather that the guard because he runs the risk of imprisonment only if he shoots me while he runs the risk of hanging if he shoots the guard.  Perhaps in these circumstances it is expecting too much of an armed robber to think all that out but he might have thought it out beforehand as an eventuality that would have to be met.</P>
    <P>If hanging is a deterrent, as the Minister says it is when it comes to shooting or killing a guard, I think the same deterrent should apply to someone who comes to the guard's assistance. I was fortified in my belief that the Minister may come round to my way of thinking when he said this evening that it was desirable that our law should be the same in relation to cruelty to animals as the law in England and other countries, because in England, I understand, if a member of the public who comes to the assistance of a member of the police force and is murdered, the same penalty attaches to that murder as to the murder of a member of the police force.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable attitude to take. We should encourage people to come very willingly to the aid of the police and we should not do anything at all which seems to put guards and members of the public in different categories, particularly in the case which I <Col N="660" /> envisage in which a member of the public is attempting to assist the guards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be helpful if I indicated my attitude at this stage.  I am opposing the amendment.  My position is fairly simple.  I want to get rid of the death penalty entirely, if possible, but I am afraid that in our circumstances it is not possible, and so I am retaining it to the most limited extent.  I think there are reasons which necessitate our retaining it in a limited number of categories and I want to keep the categories down to the absolute essential minimum and retain only the categories which I think necessary in the interests of the protection of society.</P>
      <P>There is a very great difference between a policeman and a person coming to the aid of a policeman.  The policeman has the duty and obligation to tackle criminals and therefore he is to that extent entitled to any element of protection which we can give him. An ordinary civilian does not have any such duty.  What we are dealing with here is the professional type of criminal and the main advantage I see in retaining the death penalty in this type of case is that the person going about his unlawful pursuits may be deterred from carrying arms by the death penalty in this particular instance.  The person he is likely to run up against is a policeman and as he comes against the death penalty afterwards for murdering a policeman, he is for his own protection and safety very likely to be deterred from carrying arms of any sort on him.</P>
      <P>That is a subsidiary consideration, but my main defence of what I am proposing and my main reason for opposing Senator Sheldon's amendment is that the death penalty should go completely, if possible.  If we cannot do that, we should keep the number of cases in which it is retained down to the minimum consistent with the safety, security and welfare of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no good quoting the British Homicide Act to me because I think <Col N="661" /> the British have made a mistake and have got themselves into a mess.  All sorts of anomalous situations can arise there.  Certain types of murder which would not be regarded as very bad attract the death penalty, while others, which most people would regard as being in a far worse category, do not.  I am anxious to avoid that situation.  I want to keep our Act as simple as possible and retain the death penalty only in the bare minimum number of categories which are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely with the Minister in his wish ultimately to abolish the death penalty but I cannot be persuaded by what he says.  Of course, he is right in saying that a member of the garda has a duty and obligation to tackle criminals but it seems to me that a member of the public, if called upon by a member of the garda or even should he see a member of the garda in difficulties, has the same duty and obligation to come to his aid.  Therefore, it seems to me that if in such circumstances he does come to his assistance, it is illogical that his murder should be in a different category from the murder of a member of the garda.</P>
      <P>I do not want to try to extend the capital murder categories any more than the Minister does, but I do think Senator Sheldon's amendment is a logical one.  It is quite wrong to put the same action, on the one hand, the murder of a guard, in the capital murder category and on the other, the murder of a member of the public possibly called upon by that guard and properly coming to his assistance, in another category.  The amendment is a logical and reasonable amendment, and I support it.</P>

I am sure that if I took the time to look at the pronouncements of the Minister for the past couple of years I should find that he had encouraged people to assist the police and said that it was their duty to do so; and I should think that he was perfectly right in saying that.  I should say the same, even to the extent of risking their lives if it were for the good of the whole community.  I cannot understand the Minister saying that he wishes to do away with the death penalty if he does not do away with it completely.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister at all.  He said he wants to get rid of the death penalty, if possible, and still retain it in a minimum number of categories.  He told us most of the enlightened countries in the world favour that.  I should prefer to be guided by Senator Boland, who has the courage of his convictions, with 15 years' experience as Minister for Justice.  I was surprised when the Minister said a policeman has a duty and obligation to tackle criminals which a civilian has not.  I think it is the duty of any civilian to <Col N="663" /> go to the aid of the Garda at any time.</P>

      <P>Last year we saw in the papers that a policeman had two criminals in a doorway, trying to arrest them, and, according to the papers, when he called for help, he was jeered at by many of the citizens of Dublin.  The criminals were encouraged to escape, and did escape. I believe any public-spirited person will go, and should go, to the aid of our policemen when they are trying to arrest criminals.  I think they have a duty to help the Garda.  There is a lamentable lack of civic spirit and we are now creating an atmosphere where there is one law for the Garda and another for civilians.  The garda is paid for and has a duty to tackle criminals.  If a criminal shoots him that criminal will be hanged for murder; but if a civilian, with the public spirit and initiative to help the garda, is shot&mdash;and he may have a wife and children&mdash;the criminal may get off, as has happened in the past, with two or three years.  That is completely wrong.  We should encourage civilians to be public spirited and help the police.  I am in entire agreement with the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable force in this amendment and I think it is very arguable.  The point is that, if we start making further exceptions, excellent arguments can be adduced for including other kinds of crimes that should be punishable as capital offences so, although as I say, it is <Col N="664" /> arguable and a good case can be made for it, I am against the amendment. A case could be made for hundreds of other categories as well as this one.</P>
      <P>The provision that the murder of a policeman is a capital crime was inserted for a very good reason.  It was not for the protection of the policeman as an individual, but for the protection of the policeman for what he represents.  It is in the interests of every person in the community that the police force should be as effective as possible.  It is in the interests of every member of the community that a member of the police should be regarded as sacrosanct, and that every criminal or person should regard it as the most serious thing he could do to attack a policeman, because a policeman represents law and order.  Consequently, there is a very good case for leaving the Bill as it stands, and for leaving the killing of a policeman as a crime which will still carry the penalty of capital punishment.  For that reason it is not a question of whether a policeman requires more protection than the person who comes to his aid, but a question of what a policeman stands for.  I am against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot support this amendment.  I made it clear on Second Reading that I am against capital punishment <i>in toto.</i>  That still remains my attitude.  However, I have great sympathy with the arguments put forward by those who support this amendment.  I can quite see the logic of those arguments.  Believe it or not, I have sympathy with the Minister in the predicament in which he finds himself.  He believes that capital punishment should be abolished, but he had not the courage of his convictions to go ahead and abolish it in this Bill.  The arguments he is forced to put up in opposing this amendment are a result of the attitude he has adopted. The Minister has said that the Garda have a duty to tackle criminals which civilians do not have.  I agree with him that there is no legal obligation on civilians to tackle criminals, but I hold that if a civilian sees a garda in difficulties with a criminal he has a <Col N="665" /> duty to go to the assistance of the garda.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill if a criminal is being brought to justice jointly by a garda and a civilian, he would be liable to execution if he killed the garda whose professional duty it is to apprehend him, but if he killed the civilian who was doing a brave act gratuitously, he would not be guilty of capital murder and would be liable only to imprisonment.  That is the sort of situation which going half way with this Bill creates and I think it brings forward the best possible case for abolishing capital punishment altogether.</P>

      <P>I wish to support in the strongest possible terms this amendment.  It is a most reasonable one and if any argument were necessary for it, it was provided by the Minister here tonight.  In fact, had he advanced the argument on the Second Reading he advanced in trying to propose this amendment, it might have saved many who voted for the Bill having to worry whether capital punishment is or is not a deterrent. The Minister says in this very case that capital punishment is such a deterrent that the criminal, knowing that if he shoots a policeman he will be guilty of capital murder, would thereby in some way or other be persuaded not to carry arms as it would be too risky.  That answers every query raised by anyone here as to whether capital punishment is or is not a deterrent.  Then we had the second case&mdash;again a most amusing statement&mdash;in which the Minister said that a garda had to go out and track criminals and that the civilian did not have to do such a thing.  He did not have to give the garda help&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no logic whatever in retaining the death penalty for a citizen who goes to the aid of a garda and not retaining it in the case of a man killed by a burglar.  If the proposer of this amendment wanted to retain the death penalty entirely, that would be logical.  I understand that point of view and I disagree with it. However, if I am to be accused of illogicality in the Bill, surely I can return the compliment in regard to this amendment?  Look at what Senator Sheldon wants us to believe.  He says we should retain the death penalty in the case of a person going to the aid of a garda so that people may be encouraged to go to the aid of the garda in situations involving an apprehension of criminals.  That presupposes that the person going to the aid of the garda expects firmly that he will be killed because the proposal affects him only in so far as he gets killed. Otherwise the retention of the death penalty in that context does not have the force the Senator wants it to have.</P>
      <P>I think there is logic in my position. If I were to do anything to make any change in this Bill I would abolish the death penalty for the murder of Garda officers or prison warders.  That is the sort of change I should like to make but I do not think I am Justified in making it at this stage.  The death penalty has some deterrent effect in this particular limited category and, therefore, we should retain it.  However, I shall not extend it one iota beyond what I consider to be the strict minimum which is necessary for the preservation of public order and peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister.  He is quite right when he says I do not want to see the changes that are made in the Bill at all.  That is true.  I think the <Col N="668" /> death penalty is a deterrent.  The Minister does not agree.  On that point we divide.  I cannot quite follow his suggestion that this is the thin edge of the wedge and that, if you do it for this category, why not for this, that and the other categories?  I do not think that is quite fair.</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels constrained to retain it, as he does&mdash;and I can quite appreciate that it is sort of against his will that he does it, holding his views on capital punishment&mdash;once it is retained for a member of the Garda Síochána in the execution of his duties, I do not think it is proper that anyone going to his aid should be put in a different category.  The Minister says that that presupposes the the person knows he is in danger of being shot.  The point is that the potential murderer knows he will get two very different penalties if he shoots a garda or if he shoots an ordinary member of the public going to the assistance of the garda.  When the member of the public is going to the aid of the garda he may not know that the man is armed.  He may rush out of a bank or some office and which of the two will he shoot&mdash;the fellow in uniform or the member of the public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the Minister in holding to his point of view on capital punishment. He is going to retain something in which he is not a great believer himself. Let us take a person involved in an armed robbery or a crime of that kind who whether in uniform or not has been detailed for the particular job.  Anyone who attempts to apprehend a robber ought to be protected whether he is detailed for the job or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>If we accept Senator Sheldon's presumption, namely, that capital punishment is a deterrent, his argument and his conclusion would, of course, be correct and the amendment could be accepted.  First of all, we have to agree that the retention of capital punishment is a deterrent and it will reduce the number of murders we are likely to have.  This is a matter upon which we can have two different viewpoints.</P>
      <P>Since the last debate I have gone to the trouble of looking up the percentage per million of the population in England, over the years since capital punishment was abolished there, to see whether there was any increase in the number of murders.  I found that prior to the abolition the average per million was 3.75.  Since then it has varied.  One year it was 4, the next 3.2, the next 3.7 and the next 3.6.  There really has not been any increase, taking the facts as we know them in the country nearest to us.  That forces me to the conclusion that in England certainly the retention of capital punishment, when it was there for all types of crime, did not act as a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not looked up the statistics for other countries.  Capital punishment has been abolished in many other European countries.  In Belgium it fell <Col N="670" /> into desuetude some 40 years ago and there has been only one case of an execution since then.  I think that was during the 1914-18 war.  That being so, I cannot agree with Senator Sheldon that the retention of capital punishment is a deterrent.  If one does not agree with him one cannot support his contention and one is bound to vote against it.  The next point is whether the Bill should simply say capital punishment should be abolished.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government simply, if you like, to influence public opinion and let us remember they cannot force their views on public opinion.  They must legislate as they believe the common conscience of the people require them to legislate.  Personally, I feel that the common conscience of this country, as in most civilised communities, is against the retention of the medieval concept of hanging people.  Public conscience has gradually reacted against all sorts of violence of that nature.  There was a time when it was general to engage in fueds in order to kill someone with whom one had merely a difference of opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon.  The reaction of human nature is against the public execution.  The gardaí deal with professional criminals.  A garda who goes out to patrol the streets of Dublin knows that if he meets a criminal in the ordinary course of events he is a professional criminal.  I hold that the death penalty should be abolished altogether, but public conscience might excuse its being retained in that case.  The criminal a garda meets at night, whether he is alone or is with somebody else, has decided to do a robbery or commit some other crime.  That crime is planned days in advance.  These criminals know that if <Col N="671" /> they are going to be tackled by anyone the only person they anticipate will tackle them is a garda.  Therefore, they have to consider whether they will carry weapons or not, whether they will carry flick knives or guns.  In cold deliberation they plan their crime.  If they carry flick knives or guns, in their excitement they will use them.  They say to themselves: &ldquo;Suppose we meet policemen and suppose in the excitement of the moment we use those knives or guns, we are faced with <Col N="672" /> hanging.&rdquo;  That may have some slight effect in arriving at conclusions in their deliberations.  It is possible that there may be some excuse for allowing the amendment but I think there is good excuse for extending it further than it has gone.  I find myself compelled to oppose the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), to add a new subparagraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) murder done in the course of a robbery or attempted robbery where the weapon used was brought to the scene of the murder by the accused;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this amendment in a slightly different way from that in which he viewed the previous amendments.  This is a case where the accused deliberately prepared himself for the eventuality that he will murder, if necessary.  You might say that he brings the weapon simply to frighten somebody out of his way.  I think he probably has it in his mind to use the weapon and to kill, if necessary.</P>
      <P>When we consider the vast increase in this sort of crime&mdash;robbery with violence or injury to the person&mdash;which has taken place across the water and, to a lesser extent, perhaps, here and the complete disregard for human life on the part of those carrying out the crimes, I think we should retain capital punishment as a deterrent in this case. I have limited my demands in the amendment by saying that only if the weapon actually used in the murder was brought to the scene of the crime by the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am excluding cases where the accused might lift some weapon or <Col N="673" /> some article that might be lying at hand where he was caught red-handed or surrounded to try to intimidate somebody who was going to capture him.  It must be only if he brought the weapon to the scene of the crime with the intention, obviously, of using it, particularly if it is a gun.  If he brought it there he was going to use it so far as he thought it necessary.  He was going to commit murder if necessary.</P>
    <P>I am, perhaps, encouraged a little bit by what the Minister said in discussing the first amendment to the Bill.  The Minister himself said&mdash;and was, I think, strongly supported in nearly the same words by Senator Nash&mdash;that this would deter criminals from carrying weapons; that is, that making the murder of a policeman a capital murder would probably deter criminals from carrying lethal weapons.  I think then that the criminal who does bring that weapon should be treated severely, as severely as the law can provide, as a protection for the ordinary citizen who must be the victim.  I think Senator Nash said practically the same thing when speaking against Senator Sheldon's amendment, that it would probably take the weapon out of crime.  I am asking only if the person brings the weapon with him that it should then be classed as capital murder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the amendment proposed by Senator Cole.  I am one of those who believe that the maintenance of the death penalty is a deterrent.  I am sorry I cannot agree with Senator Nash's statistics because you must compare like with like.  Years ago in England there were poor people who murdered because they were poor, because their wives and children were hungry, but that day is gone in England and in this country and with the coming of the affluent society things are different so it is wrong to compare what happened years ago with the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you had the death penalty in England at the present time, instead of varying between 3.6 and 3.8 the rate <Col N="674" /> might be as low as two per cent.  If a man carries a gun or a knife he is prepared to use it if necessary if he is apprehended by the police or by any other person.  If he goes to a place with the intention of using it and if he does use it to save his own life I think he should pay the penalty.  With that type of person it should be retained as I believe it would be a deterrent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the definition in a case like that?  Suppose a robber takes along a jemmy for forcing open a door; he is tackled and hits someone over the head with the jemmy. Suppose he takes a heavy torch, surely that could be a weapon, or if he took off his shoe and hit someone over the head or if he had a walking stick and hit someone.  All these are weapons. You are dealing with a very serious matter.  A case like this ultimately ends up with a person being tried for his life.  Everything must be defined very carefully because a human life is too serious a matter.  You should have a very careful definition of a weapon as otherwise a heavy torch a man brought with him for light, a jemmy for opening a door, a walking stick he happens to have with him, may be included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I am opposed to the amendment on the same grounds as I opposed Senator Sheldon's first amendment.  In principle I am against extending in any way the number of categories for which the death penalty is retained.  I did say on the Second Stage that if I were to ask Senators individually to indicate to me what was the particular type of crime for which they would like the death penalty retained I would get a different answer from practically every Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reinforced in that opinion because the distinguished Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord MacDermott, in a speech he made in Birmingham last year, indicated that he would wish to add to the categories of crimes which continued to attract the death sentence under the British Homicide Act of 1957 a number of other categories.  These included <Col N="675" /> murder in furtherance of rape or indecent assault, murder callously planned in advance and murder in the course of destroying evidence of any offence.  Once we start to extend the categories at all we can advance all sorts of sound, logical, reasons for having further extensions.  I do not think we should extend the categories at all. My approach to the problem is to get rid of the death penalty to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The British Commission on Capital Punishment which reported in 1955 after long study of the possibility of grading murders &mdash; and that is what Senator Cole is proposing here&mdash;with regret came to the following conclusion: &ldquo;The object of our quest is chimerical and must be abandoned.&rdquo; They came regretfully to the conclusion that they could not devise or recommend any system for the grading of murders.  I do not think we could either.  If we were to sit here in this House on this Bill for the rest of the year I do not think we would arrive at a satisfactory list of murders for which the whole House would agree the death penalty should be retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to give some reasons for reconsideration. We have reached a stage where serious robbery could draw anything from five to ten years penal servitude.  We have got evidence from the Minister's answer in the Dáil that the average length spent in prison by a murderer who was found guilty was six years. Therefore, if a criminal is caught in a major robbery he stands to draw a sentence of five to ten years but he does not stand to increase effectively the length of his sentence by one day if he shoots a person if that adds to his chance of getting away.  What is the justice of that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People I have spoken to in the last couple of weeks since this Bill came <Col N="676" /> up are in a grave state of uneasiness over the shocking record of the past two years: unsolved murder after unsolved murder culminating in a poor old lady battered to death in Dublin while the whole resources of catching criminals, identikits and everything else, were of no avail. There is great uneasiness at what is happening and at the way we are coping with the problem.  That uneasiness could be avoided by acting on Senator Boland's suggestion when he resisted the removal of the deterrent at this critical juncture.</P>

      <P>As regards the point raised by Senator Nash as to whether a torch or a jemmy is a weapon, it would be for the courts to decide whether it was a weapon carried to the scene of the crime by the murderer. The courts would be quite capable of deciding whether a torch was a weapon.  It is not a weapon as intended in my amendment.  Those things should be left to the courts.  If the Minister accepted my amendment the courts would have no difficulty in deciding on it.  It could be left to the jury, if you like, to interpret whether a jemmy or a heavy torch was a weapon brought to the scene of the crime.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on the figures quoted by Senator Nash.  He said there was no increase per 1,000.  Those figures probably do not include crimes previously classified as murder.  If the statistics were made out in the same form as before the 1957 Homicide Act, they would <Col N="677" /> probably be considerably greater.  I believe the Minister is making a mistake in not accepting this amendment. In his opening remarks on Senator Sheldon's amendment, he said that the British have got themselves into a mess over the Homicide Act, 1957.  I wonder if that is so, was it public opinion that drove them into that position.  If there had been a free vote in this House and in the other House on this matter, and if people were encouraged to express freely their views about this Bill, the Minister might have got a very different Bill.  In spite of what the Minister said on Second Reading, I think the majority of public opinion would be against the Minister on this Bill, and the Minister is there to interpret to a certain extent, what the public want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) A person sentenced to penal servitude for life pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall not be released until the expiration of twelve years at least from the date of the sentence, save on the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear before, and I want to repeat, that I am wholeheartedly in favour of the abolition of capital punishment.  I cannot over-emphasise that, but that does not mean, for one moment, that I regard the crime of murder as anything but the vilest crime that can be committed against humanity by any citizen.  Now that we are deciding on the abolition of the death penalty, it becomes very important that we should ensure that severe and adequate penalties are imposed on persons convicted of murder and, more <Col N="678" /> important still, that the sentences are served.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading, the Minister and I had words about the length of sentences served.  The Minister seemed to think I was trying to score some political debating point.  That is not so.  Nothing was further from my mind.  I agree that the figures given by the Minister, taken over a long period, are fairly consistent but they are consistent in that they show that very short sentences have been served. Perhaps the Minister had the 'flu or something like that on the last occasion, was in bad humour, and misunderstood the point I was trying to make.</P>
    <P>One point which has been brought before members of the Oireachtas and the public in general by the debates on this Bill, is that the average sentence served for murder is six years.  The minimum sentence is three years, and the maximum is 11 years.  I was shocked when I heard those figures, considered them, and realised what they meant.  I am also certain beyond doubt that the public at large are gravely concerned and disturbed to know that a man who commits murder in his early twenties is likely to be set free after three years, and that according to present practice he certainly will not have to serve more than ten years.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that any person who, but for this Bill, would be liable to the death penalty and instead is sentenced to penal servitude for life, will not be released from prison until he has served 12 years, unless on the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I think such an amendment to the Bill is necessary in order to restore public confidence, and to satisfy the public at large that adequate safeguards are available to them.  In the past, penal servitude for life was looked upon as a very grave penalty and something that was adequate to put a person guilty of murder out of circulation for the rest of his life, or most of it, but now people know that penal servitude for life means from three to six or nine years.</P>
    <P>In this Second Reading speech, making a case for the abolition of the <Col N="679" /> death penalty, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The situation which has thus developed is, in my opinion, quite undesirable.  In effect, the Executive have been deciding which murderers should be hanged rather than which of them should be reprieved.  I consider that the law should indicate what the penalty for murder should be and that that penalty, when imposed by the trial judge in accordance with the law, should be carried out unless there are extenuating circumstances which would justify the Government taking action to commute the sentence in a particular case.</P>
    <P>That is really the case I am making in my amendment.  I say that the law should prescribe the sentence which should be imposed on a murderer and when that sentence is imposed by the judge it should be carried out.</P>
    <P>It may be said that there may be special circumstances in a particular case.  If that is so, I have added a saving proviso to the section which enables the criminal to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal before the period of 12 years and ask that he be released. It is not alone essential that justice should be done but it is essential that justice be seen to be done and seen to be done in public.  I cannot emphasise enough that I am not making a political point out of this and that I am not saying that the Fianna Fáil Government are guilty of letting people out the backdoor any more than any other Government.  But, human nature being what it is, Ministers and Governments can be and are under pressure from time to time to exercise clemency and mercy in certain cases.</P>
    <P>If it goes out from the Oireachtas that the death penalty is abolished, that a person can go in and kill an old woman in an isolated part of the country for her money in the knowledge that he will be unlucky if he has to serve more than six years if he is caught, he can take two chances.  He can take the chance that he will get away scot free or he can take the chance that if he is caught and convicted he will have to serve three <Col N="680" /> years, if he is lucky, and with average luck he will get away with six years. That is something for which the public will not stand.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to exploit Senator Gerald Boland's speech but Senator Boland was Minister for Justice in this country for 15 years.  Certainly, if we were to take his speech literally, we should be shocked.  In the course of his speech in favour of retaining capital punishment <i>in toto</i>, he made a number of statements.  He said:</P>
    <P>We must have regard to the fact that there is no such thing as life imprisonment.  Under the British law it meant 20 years in jail and since the war it has been 11½ years and I think the maximum sentence was 10 years.</P>
    <P>But he said something that is even more alarming:</P>
    <P>The practice has been to just commit the murderer and he gets out after two or three years if there is a change of Government.</P>
    <P>Those are not my words.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the words of a former Minister for Justice in this country.  They are the words of a member of this House.  Senator Gerald Boland went on to say:</P>
      <P>I know of one man who got a death sentence reduced to one of manslaughter.  The court decided that and he was released after 14 months.  There was a change of Government and the man could go around after he had killed his enemy. I know several cases where people were knocking around after five or six years in jail.  I do not think that is right at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the words of a former Minister for Justice in this State.  They are not my words.  I say that if any change of Government can bring about that sort of thing it is a deplorable state of affairs.  I do not know what Minister was responsible for it.  I say with the greatest sincerity that I do not care what Minister was responsible for it; it is wrong and it should not be tolerated.  The only doubt I have about my amendment is that the term <Col N="681" /> of 12 years is inadequate and that I should have inserted 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The only case the Minister can make in opposing my amendment is that there are cases in which clemency should be exercised; that there are cases where the maximum sentence should not be served on account of the health conditions of the convicted person or on account of some other peculiar circumstance.  I concede that but what is wrong with leaving it to the Court of Criminal Appeal which is a court consisting of three High Court judges in this country to consider an application for a mitigation of the sentence; to consider it in open court; to let the accused person put forward his case; to let the Minister or the Attorney General give his views and to let the court make up its mind in public?  That is something that could be stood over, something that would be done in public.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not think it is necesary for me to prolong my argument in favour of the amendment.  I am supported by the public reaction to the statement by the Minister that people get out after committing murder from three, four or five years.  The sentences are here.  I am not making a political issue of this.  I shall go back to 1926, as the Minister did.  He gave figures. When replying to the Second Reading debate the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I shall go back through the years to 1926, 1927, 1929, 1930 and 1931, purely as an example, and read out the length of sentence served by persons convicted of murder during those years: six years; six years; two years; one year; seven years; six years; four years; three years and two years.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister came to the years 1946, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1954.  The periods served for murder during those years were three years, five years, six years, three years, four years, seven years, eleven years and six years&mdash;all comparatively small sentences for this dreadful crime of murder.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that when these sentences were served we had capital punishment and some people think that capital punishment is a deterrent. <Col N="682" /> I am against it whether or not it is a deterrent but we must admit that it has a deterrent effect.  Now we are removing it.  I say that in place of it we should have some statutory guarantee that people convicted of murder will suffer severe sentences. It should go out from the Parliament of this country to people who intend to indulge in crimes of violence which may end in the death of citizens that they will be faced with stiff sentences and that no amount of political pressure or public sympathy will get them out of jail unless they can convince a tribunal of three judges sitting in open court in this country that they are entitled to get out of jail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Senator Fitzpatrick has said about this although I do not agree with the method which he proposes for dealing with it.  I fully agree that it was a most extraordinary situation in recent years that a condemned murderer was theoretically, at any rate, in danger of being executed but that if his sentence of execution was commuted he might get out of jail in a comparatively short time, five or six years or possibly even less.  That was quite an unsustainable position. I am quite convinced that public opinion is against capital punishment but on the other hand I am convinced that people feel that a convicted murderer should be kept in jail for a considerable number of years.  I would say that in the ordinary course this should be in the region of 10 years.  Consequently, I feel there should be some change in the policy and practice in relation to condemned murderers.  I am aware that the approach to imprisonment is continually changing and there are psychiatric and other treatments now being brought into use which are very proper and which may eventually mean that people convicted of murder may be released.  It may be proper to release them after that treatment in a lesser time than 10 years but for the moment that time has not yet arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are taking a very big step and for the time being at any rate we should ensure that those who have <Col N="683" /> committed murder should serve sentences of something in the region of ten years.  Many people do not agree with this step, and to those who feel uneasy about it, it should be made clear that murder is still regarded as a very serious and dreadful crime and something for which reparation cannot be made by a few years in jail. Consequently, I am in favour of much of what Senator Fitzpatrick has said but I am not in favour of the method of approaching it, of leaving it to the Court of Appeal.  I see no reason why the power to remit some of the sentence should be taken from the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzpatrick's amendment and the only fault I have to find with it is that I believe 12 years is inadequate.  I would be more satisfied if it were either 15 or 20 years.  I believe that if the Dáil and Seanad in their wisdom abolish the death penalty we must substitute a penalty that will emphasise the terrible gravity of the crime of murder.  I also believe that we must restore public confidence because the majority of people were shocked and greatly disturbed when they read in the newspapers that life imprisonment meant from one to 11 years.  I was shocked myself because I thought it meant at least 21 years.  I do not agree with Senator Ryan when he says that public opinion is against capital punishment. If a referendum were held, or even a free vote of this House, I believe the majority would be in favour of capital punishment.  Even members of Senator Ryan's own Party spoke in favour of retaining capital punishment but afterwards voted against it.  It is very important that we should have adequate penalties and that those penalties or sentences are served.  I believe the power should not be left to the Minister, or to any Minister of Justice, or to any Government, to reduce sentences.  Sentences should only be reduced by order of the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of punishment is threefold, retribution, a deterrent, and reformation.  Surely in this day and age retribution no longer enters into the matter in a civilised country.  That is a thing of the past even if it were not contrary to the teaching of Christianity and of most religions.  It is reduced, therefore, to a deterrent and to reformation.  To take the average of anything I submit is most illogical.  You might as well say that no man would drown in a river because its average depth was one foot but it might be 18 feet deep at one spot and only one foot or six inches at another.</P>
      <P>Let us take the most prevalent form of murder.  It is that of infanticide by unhappy, unmarried mothers.  In those cases they can be tried for murder or infanticide and if convicted they would have to be sentenced to life imprisonment. As I say, in this day and age vengeance and retribution are things we should not consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">

      <P>If she commits murder deliberately, or abandons her child in such circumstances that she should reasonably believe&mdash;that a reasonable person would believe&mdash;that is is bound to result in the death of the child, that would be murder.  There is also murder which is committed at various degrees of responsibility.  The M'Naghten Rules, I am glad to say, no longer operate.  The test that was employed formerly was: does a man think or believe that it is something which is wrong?  That was the test, not whether a man was sane or insane, not whether he acted under some mental compulsion, but whether he believes it to be wrong.  Fortunately, those <Col N="685" /> Rules have gone but even so there are various degrees of responsibility.  There is the man who is barely beyond the stage of sanity.  Is he to be sentenced to a minimum period of 12 years? There is also the case&mdash;we had one in Cork&mdash;of the man who finds his wife in adultery and who acts on the impulse of the moment.  He is sentenced to life in those cases.</P>
      <P>Again, are we to be actuated by retribution or must we consider only the deterrent and reformation?  In all these cases I do think, while murder is a heinous crime&mdash;the taking of life whether by manslaughter or murder is heinous&mdash;we must take into consideration the mental outlook of the person.  In prison these people are kept under constant surveillance and if it is felt that they are unlikely to offend again, if there are certain extenuating circumstances, and after three, four, five or eight years as the case may be, they are recommended for release by the prison authorities &mdash;and I take it it would only be on that basis that they would be released, on the basis of their record&mdash;I think they should be released.  If they are married and have children, they and their families should not be subjected to the further disgrace, after seven or eight years, of going back to the court and having their crime made public again, a matter which would cause pain also to the family of the murdered person.  The proper procedure would be to have a confidential report submitted by the prison authorities to the Department of Justice.  We are all proud of our civil servants and the officials of the Department of Justice should be allowed to weigh the report and, having considered it in accordance with certain set principles, advise the Minister as to whether or not clemency should be extended.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzpatrick's amendment as I believe some emphasis should be laid on the gravity of the crime of murder.  While we must admire the efforts that are being made to rehabilitate prisoners in general, there should be a definite distinction drawn between convicted murderers <Col N="686" /> and other criminals and in this regard a definite deterrent should be placed in the legislation to replace the death penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the case made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  I am against capital punishment not because I believe it is a deterrent&mdash;I cannot make up my mind fully on that score&mdash;but because of my anxiety as to whether the State has the right to take life at all, just as the murderer has not the right to take life.  However, as Senator Fitzpatrick says, society must protect itself and I fully appreciate the necessity for stiff sentences. It is disquieting to find, according to the figures read out by the Minister and quoted by Senator Fitzpatrick, that people convicted of murder are released after a few years imprisonment.  There would be many people who would like to see capital punishment abolished but who would like to be assured that society is adequately protected especially in view of the increase in the number of crimes of violence.</P>
      <P>This is a matter on which we should all agree and not one that should be argued out to the point of having a division.  I should like the Minister to consider the view put forward by Senator Fitzpatrick and to some degree the counter view put forward by Senator Nash, both professional men in this sphere.  The more humane view has been advanced by Senator Nash.  The effect of his argument would appear to be that we should distinguish between the types of murder committed.  My view is that premeditated murder should be severely punished but that a lenient approach should be taken in the case of crime resulting from emotional upset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish briefly to support the amendment proposed by Senator Fitzpatrick.  The only misgiving I have is that, in a period of transition where the death penalty has been removed, a sentence of 12 years is perhaps too slight.  A figure of 15 or even 20 years could be inserted and in another five or ten years, when we see more clearly where we are going, the question of lowering that figure might be considered.</P>
      <P>The abolition of capital punishment is an abrupt change and I should hope that in the transition period a sentence of penal servitude for murder would mean something more than it has meant since the State was founded.  Of all the cases quoted there were only two cases where more than six years of a sentence were served.  Most of the cases involved imprisonment for three, four or five years.  That is a most unsatisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>What I want to emphasise, as I did in a previous amendment, is that the situation is doubly unsatisfactory in the light of the number of unsolved murders in the past two years, which must rank as the worst period of our history where such crimes are concerned. Glaring crimes that should have been within the competence of the police force to detect have remained unsolved despite headlines that appeared in the paper a year or two ago to the effect that our police force were armed with the latest in science and were being trained in this, that and the other.</P>

The same case could be made for intervention in other cases.

      <P>I know very well what he said.  As well as that, there seems to be a confusion of thought about two things.  If we are to have a degree of clemency retained, it should be just retained and not written down as a given period of time. An appeal to a court is not the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not care whether there is statutory precedent or not. Everybody fixes the precedent as it suits himself.  I am not to be taken as maligning the Senator: I would do it myself; the Minister for Justice does it frequently and so do many others, as and when it suits them.  The point I see in it is that this cuts across the doctrine of clemency, which should be retained.  From that point of view, I cannot say I like the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, first of all, to say I deplore and regard as contemptible the suggestion by Senator Quinlan that political considerations enter into this matter in any way.  I shall outline briefly for the benefit of the House what happens in a case where a prisoner serving a life sentence has the balance of his sentence remitted at a particular point of time.</P>
      <P>The initiative always comes from the prison, where the prisoner has been under constant observation from the point of view of his progress, his conduct, his rehabilitation.  Any suggestion of this kind has always emanated from within the prison.  The case is reviewed in all its aspects.  This includes consideration of the original crime and, if possible, the trial judge is consulted.  Police reports are procured. Finally, the proposal is put not to the Minister for Justice but to the Government.  It is an Executive function.</P>
      <P>To suggest that any responsible Minister for Justice would make a recommendation in regard to a prisoner serving a life sentence on any but the most legitimate grounds is to talk nonsense. The Government have before them the whole case from its very beginning. Every aspect in regard to the progress of the prisoner is brought before them and in the light of the full information, they make their decision.</P>
      <P>I have never encountered any suggestion of pressure from the public. Indeed one aspect of the situation that rather amazes me is that, while at the time a murder is committed public excitement is intense, from the moment the prisoner is sentenced the public lose interest in the case.  As far as the public are concerned, I have never seen any evidence of any pressure on the Government or the Minister for Justice to commute the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Sheldon has rightly pointed out, unless we are to do away with the prerogative of mercy, this amendment means absolutely nothing: if we are to retain the prerogative of mercy, this amendment is simply a waste of time.  I repeat that the decision must be one for the Executive. This, it must be appreciated, is not the <Col N="691" /> sort of decision to be left in the hands of the courts whose duty is to fix responsibility for a crime and impose the sentence laid down in laws passed by the Oireachtas.  The normal court procedure is not suitable for the exercise of this function particularly having regard to the desirability of avoiding publicity.</P>
    <P>The prerogative of mercy is not something that should be exercised by the courts.  In any country in the world I know of this function is with the Executive.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have been concerned about the short length of sentences that have been served in this country. I agree there is some cause for concern there.  I feel sure the average length of sentence for murder in this country came as a surprise to a lot of people.  I should, however, point out again that each case is considered on its merits.  I believe that where a prisoner has been completely rehabilitated and is no longer a menace to society in any way there is no justification for keeping him in prison to the point where he will become degenerate, either physically or mentally, or both, and where the process of rehabilitation will be undone.  At this point he may be unfit for anything but to remain in prison for the remainder of his natural life.</P>
    <P>Senators have been concerned about the short sentences which have been served and with the implications of such short sentences on the desirability of protecting society against the recurrence of the crimes which the criminals concerned had committed.  The facts, however, do not show such concern to be necessary.  In no case since 1925 has the release of a prisoner resulted in his again committing a similar type of crime and there is no evidence that the commutation and remission of sentences has, in fact, had any effect on the protection of society.</P>
    <P>When a Government considers the question of releasing a prisoner all these circumstances are taken into account &mdash; the original nature of the crime, the culpability of the prisoner, his mentality, the whole question of whether there is any possibility of a recurrence of the crime, the effect of <Col N="692" /> continued imprisonment on the prisoner, the environment into which he is going to be released and, of course, the necessity for ensuring that the sentence does have a deterrent effect.  All these factors are taken into account.  It is only when the Government are satisfied a person is fully able to take his place again, in society, without the slightest risk to that society, that he is released.</P>
    <P>Does any Senator seriously suggest that when a man has expiated his crime, rehabilitated himself and is ready to take his place again in society, he should be kept for any period of time in prison simply and solely that he may be further punished?  I appreciate that when a crime has been committed and when a person has served four, five or six years and the question of his release comes before any Executive, there is a tendency to forget the enormity of the crime and consider on humanitarian grounds only the human being seeking to be released. Nevertheless, I would like to quote the following occurrence as an indication of how objectivity can be achieved.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the Government in commuting a death sentence to penal servitude for life, said in effect: &ldquo;We feel we should commute this sentence, but we also consider this man should serve a long sentence.  We want, if ever the question of his release from custody comes before a future Executive, to have this opinion of ours brought to their notice.&rdquo;  I think that type of decision could be taken more often and could go a considerable way towards meeting the objections Senators have to the comparatively short sentences which down the years have been served by people who have had their sentences commuted.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter which should be brought into this Bill in any shape or form.  The exercise by the Government of their prerogative is something for which the Government can be criticised in the ordinary way by the Oireachtas.  If the Seanad or Dáil feel the Executive are overlenient as a matter of policy in this matter, then the Executive can be criticised and brought to task by the Oireachtas for maladministration of one of its particular <Col N="693" /> functions.  I think we can do no more than that.  It will certainly go out now from this House and from the Dáil to Executives of the future that the Oireachtas are perturbed about the comparatively short sentences served in the past and future Governments will have regard to that.  In deciding any particular case they will keep in mind the long-term effects of comparatively short sentences.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Fitzpatrick has really achieved his purpose by the discussion which has been evoked here on his amendment.  As far as there is public opinion on this matter, we will have <Col N="694" /> to rely on that public opinion to ensure that Governments from time to time exercise this prerogative in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I agree completely with those who maintain that the primary purpose of all punishment should be rehabilitation and that, where a person has fully rehabilitated himself and is ready again to take his place in society as a useful citizen without any danger to that society, it is nothing more than inhuman cruelty to keep him in prison.</P>
