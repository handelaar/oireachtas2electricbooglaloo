    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides statutory authority for the pensions increases granted in 1962 and 1963 to various public service pensioners.  Civil pensions payable from the Exchequer and from other public funds, are covered in the Bill, including pensions paid by local authorities and harbour authorities, as well as pensions paid by various statutory <Col N="950" /> bodies.  Similar increases in Army retired pay, Disability pensions, Special allowances and Military Service pensions are being authorised by separate legislation.  The increases in Exchequer pensions, both civil and military, have already been paid in practically all cases under the authority of additional estimates passed on the 18th July, 1962, and the 28th November, 1963.</P>
      <P>The White Paper circulated with the Bill explains the provisions in some detail.  The unusual feature of the Bill is the departure from the basis adopted in previous pensions increases, which consisted of percentage additions varying with the amount of the pension or the date of the pensioners' retirement, so as to provide a larger increase in the smaller pensions or for the longest retired pensioners.  The 1962 and 1963 increases, on the other hand, operated to bring all pensions currently payable to persons who retired before a certain date, up to a level related to a common standard of post-retirement pay.  Thus, the 1962 increases raised pensions to 1955 pay level, and in addition, added a further 6 per cent to these pensions and to pensions granted subsequent to the 1955 pay increases but before the general pay increase of 1959.  The operative date for the 1959 pay increase in the case of the Civil Service was 15th December, 1959, and for other services December, 1959, or early in 1960.  The 1963 increases raised pensions higher still, to 1959 pay level, so that all pensioners who retired before the dates when the 1959 pay increases became operative have now been brought up to the level of pension based on 1959 pay.  The older pensioners have benefited considerably from these increases and those longest retired have received a substantial addition to their pensions under the 1962 and 1963 increases over and above the increases already granted to them under the four earlier Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1950 to 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These revisions have been more costly to the Exchequer than any pensions increase previously granted.  The estimated total annual cost of the 1962 increases was £820,000 with a further £320,000 for the 1963 increases. Allowing for some savings on account <Col N="951" /> of deaths since August, 1962, the annual cost of the 1962 and 1963 pensions increases at the present time is estimated to be of the order of £1.1 million, and, including the 1964 increases, the annual cost is raised to nearly £1.4 million.  The estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of earlier pensions increases was £212,000 for the 1960 increases, £130,000 in 1959 and £180,000 in 1956.  The estimated annual cost of the increases granted in 1949 was £240,000.</P>
    <P>The number of Exchequer pensions covered by this Bill for the 1962 increases is 10,106 divided into the following categories:</P>

    <P>The total annual cost of increases in these pensions in £462,000 to which must be added approximately £42,000 for recoupment of the Exchequer share of the 1962 increases in local authority pensions, making a total of £504,000 for the estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of the 1962 increases under this Bill.  The 1963 increases payable under the Bill are estimated to cost a further £211,000 in a full year, of which £48,000 is for Civil Service pensioners, £60,000 for National Teachers, £79,000 for the Garda pensioners and £9,000 for RIC and other small groups of pensioners; the remaining £15,000 is for recoupments to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Increases in Army and Military Service pensions, Retired pay and Special allowances, which are being covered by separate legislation, will bring the cost to the Exchequer in a full year up to the figures of £820,000 and £320,000 already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention also to section 29, under which future increases in civil pensions of the type covered in the Bill may be authorised <Col N="952" /> by statutory regulations made by the Minister for Finance and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This provision will relieve the House of the necessity of passing an Act to validate every new pensions increase. It will not, however, lighten the work of the Minister for Finance, who will always have the task of co-ordinating the many proposals for expenditure which constantly come before him, with the revenue available to him. In this situation the Minister for Finance must hold a balance between the various sectors of the community so that the incidence of taxation and the distribution of benefits will tend to be fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The needs of pensioners will continue to be sympathetically considered but regard must be had, however, to the overall capacity of our resources upon which, in the final analysis, depend the benefits that can be provided for the various sectors of the community, including pensioners.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the approval of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally welcome this Bill.  I consider it will do a considerable amount of good and I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of thanking the Minister for the sympathetic <Col N="953" /> way in which he has approached the question of pensions already by the numerous steps he has taken over the past few years.  We are afraid, even though the Minister has looked sympathetically at this question of increased pensions, that the increases already given still leave pensioners far behind, in equity, from the point of view of purchasing capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in section 29, is seeking power to alter pensions by laying the regulations relating to the alterations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He is getting away from the Victorian straitjacket in which the legislature has found itself for a number of years &mdash; the straitjacket of the Victorian era, where there was little change in price levels, and the cost of living rarely changed.  In the post-war era, where there is inflation and soaring prices, it is necessary to face up realistically to the plight of pensioners with regard to the cost of living.  If it is necessary to rewrite the value of salaries it is logical and sensible also that the intrinsic value of pensions must also be rewritten from time to time.  We are glad the Minister has broken out of the straitjacket and can deal more expeditiously in the future with increases.</P>
    <P>Under section 29 of the Bill the Minister in seeking power does not state how, when or what the nature of the increase can be at any particular time.  We suggest in the motion, which will be moved later on, that he might write, as guidance to himself and his successors, into that section, the principle that all pensions paid out of State funds to persons who have equivalent length of service and rank should have equivalent value.  It is a principle that is fair and equitable and one which nobody can argue against.</P>
    <P>The increases granted over the years were totally inadequate to adjust the pensions of people in retirement and bring them to the same purchasing capacity as would be enjoyed by those who retire currently on pension. National teachers would require a 49 per cent increase to bring their purchasing power to that of a teacher who would retire at the present time. That would refer to married men, but <Col N="954" /> in the case of a single man or woman it would require 50 per cent.  In relation to the gardaí, it would require 63 per cent.  In the case of a sergeant it would have to be 59 per cent and for a superintendent 51 per cent.</P>
    <P>In regard to the army, NCOs would require 37 per cent and officers 45 per cent.  These figures indicate the position in regard to these people, who are powerless to a certain extent, inasmuch as they cannot take industrial action.  They are not members of trade unions who can act for them, and they are dependent on the sense of duty and the moral obligations of the Legislature.  All of us here are members of the Legislature.  We are all responsible for the levels of pension which are given to pensioners.  We here, together with the members of Dáil Éireann, make the law and all of us have an individual duty in this matter.</P>
    <P>Many of the people for whom we speak are people who have been there since the foundation of the State. They have seen the State grow and they contributed significantly towards the development and wellbeing of the State.  Many of them have no negotiating machinery.  They have no conciliation and arbitration machinery to fight their case.  The satisfying of the needs of the community is the norm of social justice, not the satisfying of the needs of the few.  If people who give service have their needs satisfied from time to time by adjustment in salary levels, so also should the needs of those on pension be satisfied.  It is a lopsided approach to social justice to have the needs of one section of the community only satisfied.</P>
    <P>The motion which will be discussed later on, I can assure you, is entirely non-political.  The level of a person's pension does not depend on, or in any way colour, political principles.  The principle enshrined in the motion affects people of all political shades of opinion.  It should be looked on objectively. It should be considered that society owes a debt to those who have given honourable and loyal service to the community.  A pension is in relation to basic salary and we contend that the State's obligation to a person who has rendered service does not <Col N="955" /> cease when a person steps out of the service.  There is a moral obligation on the State to see that that person is protected against rising costs and inflation.</P>
    <P>One cannot put a person's service aside as if it were a mere chattel or piece of merchandise.  A person who has given service to the State or the community generally is entitled to a share in the prosperity he has helped to create.  When a person gives a service he gives part of his personality and his individuality to that service and leaves an imprint on it.  This applies to anybody who has helped in the development of this State for the past 40 years.  Many people in public life have contributed very significantly to the development of the State and brought it to its present position, which is, indeed, the admiration of many countries abroad.</P>
    <P>The principle of broad equivalence with the currently awarded pensions has been respected in many countries. A doubt is cast on this but it is understood from people who have investigated the matter that the principle has been accepted in France and Germany. Pensions are in that way helped to retain their intrinsic values.  Due to the turnover tax and the ninth round increases the position of pensions is very precarious at the present time.  I saw at a meeting with other Senators here today pensioners from the various services&mdash;Garda, army, the teaching profession and so on.  It was most pathetic to see people of 70 and 80 years of age coming in at that hour of their life looking for protection against rising costs and inflation.  The fact that they have to fight at this hour of their lives is most pathetic to see.  Apart altogether from a reasonable increase, there has been the usual rise in the cost of living, as indicated by the February index figure, since 1960 which reads consecutively as 144, 149, 154, 160, 165.  There is a gradual rise. I should like to mention that the Minister is looking on the whole question sympathetically, but the measures taken to date have not been adequate.</P>
    <P>Pensioners have the right of protection against losses sustained through <Col N="956" /> inflation.  They should also be protected, and not placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> other people who are already in the service.  Even if the Minister cannot concede the principle in full today, we would still like an expression of opinion from him that he would at some stage be inclined to have a phased approach to this question.  Even though the principle set out in the motion is not in existence in any country, we, as a Christian people, could do a lot in this matter and see that those who have given valuable and honourable service to the community are not left out in the cold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by acknowledging&mdash;in fact, I have been asked to acknowledge&mdash;the contribution made by the Minister for Finance to some reasonable and permanent solution of the problem of pensions.  I think, in fairness, the Minister should get credit for a number of steps he has taken in recent years to put this matter on a proper and equitable footing.  Like Senator Brosnahan, I am sure other members of the House are concerned with the deplorable standard of pensions, generally speaking, payable to employees of the State.  They still lag very far behind what, in fact, they should in all justice be entitled to receive under present conditions.  I shall not bore the House by repeating the figures already quoted.  The figures are on record and they can be checked and they will be found to be accurate. The fact remains that if we were to do justice to this group of people today we would, in fact, require an adjustment of pensions along the lines of something like 50 per cent in some cases to 63 per cent in others and in no case less than 36 to 38 per cent. What we are doing in this Bill, I understand, is making a uniform adjustment of something like five per cent on the present level of pensions. That is a situation, I suggest, about which no responsible member of this House can be absolutely content or complacent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this House should take cognisance of the fact that the people we are endeavouring to cater for in <Col N="957" /> this Bill have given the greater part of their lives, technical skill and knowledge in the service of this State. It should never be forgotten&mdash;I hope it never will be forgotten&mdash;that many, if not most, of the men and women who are today solely dependent, in most instances, on the meagre pensions paid from State funds for their continued sustenance, if not existence, are the same men and women on whose integrity and skill the very foundations of our State were laid, and with whose help the whole complicated pattern of law and order as well as administration was fashioned and built, over the past 40 years.  Even more than we owe to posterity, the present and immediate future generations of our people owe a deep debt of gratitude to our surviving pensioners from all the State services.</P>
    <P>It has been truly said that the social conscience of a people can best be judged by the manner in which it looks after the welfare, in the spiritual and temporal senses, of its elder generation. Let it not be said of us, therefore, as Pádraig Pearse said in another context of some of our elder patriots: &ldquo;We killed them by neglect ... and then went in reverend procession to their graves when they were dead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Over the period of the past 15 to 20 years, the problem of inflation and its consequent detrimental effect on the levels of pensions, which were generally related and equated to outdated terms of actual money values, has created acute and heartrending difficulties for the overwhelming majority of our State pensioners, in common with all other categories of retired employees.  The State, however, has the duty and clear obligation before God and man in seeing to it that its obligation to its former employees in this respect is, at least, fulfilled.  That obligation can only properly be fulfilled by equating the current level of existing and future pensions with the corresponding purchasing power which those pensions were primarily intended to provide in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that the present Minister for Finance has, in <Col N="958" /> fact, publicly admitted the equity and justice of that claim.  In his Budget statement of 1962 the Minister foreshadowed a more enlightened approach by the Department of Finance to a proper solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Brosnahan, I welcome the provision in section 29 to provide that in future the problem of pension adjustment will not have to await the preparation of new legislation and its introduction both in this and in the other House.  That is a badly needed and long overdue reform and I think every member of this House should welcome the provision in the Bill to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It does not, however, get away from the fact that the pensions we are discussing are related to 1959 standards, that is, five years ago.  Likewise, we should not forget, in addition to the erosion of money values from other directions which we have had over that same period of five years, that there has been a minimum adjustment of 35 per cent on the average income by way either of wages or salaries to every other section of the community. That gap will have to be closed if justice is to be done to the State pensioners.  I strongly urge on the Minister the desirability of at least intimating to the House exactly when that problem will seriously be faced by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not think any over-elaboration of this problem is needed to convince the members of this House that a just case exists for the claim which is made by the State pensioners.  In all fairness, if we are to do our job by the people who sent us here we should be first publicly to acknowledge that the claim is just, equitable and overdue.  I join with Senator Brosnahan in appealing to the Minister&mdash;if he is not in a position actually to make provision in this Bill for the adjustment&mdash;to give the House an indication when his Department will be prepared to face up to the problem seriously and determinedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill as a move in the right direction.  I welcome it heartily in so far as it increases the pensions <Col N="959" /> payable to State and local government pensioners.  The pity is that it has not gone much farther.  I should like in particular to say that I agree with section 29 of the Bill which will make it unnecessary in future to bring before the Oireachtas proposals to increase pensions of retired civil servants and Local Government officials.  When the Bill becomes law, the Minister will be able to adjust pensions by regulation. That is a most desirable state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with the motion standing in the name of Senator Brosnahan and others.  I wish to give it my full and absolute support. Long before I entered the Seanad I thought for many years that it was only fair and reasonable that the pension of a retired civil servant or a retired local government official should be related directly to the current salary of a successor in office.  I have always held that view and I am very glad to be able to speak to a motion and support a motion which advocates that principle.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the pensions of people who rendered great service to this State and to this country, people such as retired teachers who took over the educational system from the British in the early 1920's and gave us the system of education which we have today.  We are dealing with the pensions of superintendents, officers and men of the Garda Síochána who, again, in the same period, took over the maintenance of law and order from the British on the foundation of this State and gave us a new type of police force, an unarmed police force&mdash;a police force that has been a credit to the country ever since.  It has been admired throughout the world.  They were young men, inexperienced men, and men who took over at a very difficult time.  The same can be said of the Army and, indeed, the same can be said of the retired civil servants who took over the various Departments of State, and some new Departments, and moulded them to suit the new Administration and the new Irish outlook to the discharge of public duties and public office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> It is really sad to read this circular which we have been sent and to note that it would take as much as an increase of 59 per cent, or 63 per cent in some cases, to bring some of those pensions up to the rate of pension enjoyed by those retiring today.  Some years back it was a great hardship on retired pensioners not to enjoy what I might call current pensions.  If that were true a few years ago, how much more true is it today when the value of money seems to be decreasing in leaps and bounds, and when the cost of living is, admittedly, rising rapidly.  Some years ago that was a gradual process, but now it happens that something that cost a given figure a few months ago costs as much as 25 per cent or even 50 per cent more.  Therefore, the hardship of those people is all the greater.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister is considerably improving the position in the present Bill, yet he is able to bring the standard of pensions up to the 1959 level only.  We must bear in mind that since the 1959 level, we have had the eighth round, in 1961 I think it was, and we have had the 12 per cent this year.  Therefore, the pensioners are still lagging behind, and lagging behind very considerably.  No one would begrudge the Minister the necessary finances to do justice to these people who have served the State so well.  No one would begrudge the Minister the necessary finances to bring the level of the pensions of retired civil servants, retired Local Government officials and others up to the current pension rate.</P>
    <P>As I say, I welcome the Bill as a move in the right direction, and I wholeheartedly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill and to support the principles of the motion.  On the question of pensions, it is very difficult to avoid dealing with particular cases, and I should like, in my address, to make a plea on behalf of the professional classes who are in a particular difficulty.  I feel I will be able to satisfy the House that in their case special circumstances exist which will require special consideration. I would hope that something <Col N="961" /> might be done to bridge the gap between 15th December, 1959, and 1st August, 1960.  As I understand it, all pensions prior to 15th December, 1959, have been subject to a 6 per cent increase under the 1963 Act and now all pensions will be liable to a 5 per cent increase under the current Budget.</P>
      <P>I am making a plea to the Minister to consider applying the 11 per cent to local authority officers and servants who retired after 15th December, 1959, and before 1st August 1960.  From 1st August, 1960, certain restitution was made to officials of local authorities whose salaries had been depressed in every increase granted since World War II.  Those officials were the very men who took over a wholly undeveloped country and, in fact, a devastated country after our freedom was achieved.  Without any special training, but with the utmost devotion and enthusiasm, they organised and devised the systems under which our country was built up and rehabilitated. Let me remind the House that there were no &ldquo;Music While You Work&rdquo; conditions applying to the service in those times.  There was no 48-hour week, or five-day week.  I have personal knowledge&mdash;and I am sure members of the House will not contradict me &mdash;of men who, during that period, worked as much as a 70-hour week, seven days a week.  Then when the emergency conditions came, local authorities and public servants gave tremendous service in fuel production, emergency services, in Army and fire fighting units, in the LDF, the LSF and all other services.  All those services were willingly given, and without stinting.  No questions were asked, and no increases sought.  Loyalty and service were the keynotes.</P>
      <P>After World War II salaries were first adjusted in 1946.  It was described as a salary adjustment, and we can assume that salary adjustment was given after full consideration of the merits of the case.  After that, from 1946 to 1st August, 1960, various temporary allowances were granted, but in every case between 1946 and 1960 a ceiling was applied.  The professional officials had their salaries clamped down at a certain figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Judging by the change of heart in connection with the ninth round, when all increases were applied at every level, it would appear as if we now recognised the injustice that was done between 1946 and 1960 when a ceiling was applied and upper salaries depressed.  I have here a reply to a Parliamentary question which will bear out what I have stated.  The second round increase after 1946 was given in 1948 and it was 7½ per cent of basic salary subject to a maximum increase of £100 per annum.  In other words, there was no increase above or slightly below the salary of £1,400.</P>
    <P>The third round applied to 1950. In this case the 7½ per cent was raised to 20 per cent of basic salary, the total temporary allowance payable being subject to a minimum amount of £60 and a maximum of £250&mdash;again, no increase being applied to a salary of £1,250.  The fourth round, in 1952, raised to 30 per cent of basic salary the previous 20 per cent, or £75, whichever was the lesser.  The total temporary allowance payable was subject to a minimum of £90 and a maximum of £325, again keeping the figure of £1,250.</P>
    <P>The fifth round in 1955 brought an increase of 10 per cent on the first £300 and 6½ per cent on the balance of existing inclusive remuneration. Again, the ceiling was maintained. The sixth round in 1958 brought a flat increase of 10/- per week not to be given to anybody in respect of salaries of more than £1,240.  The seventh round in 1959 gave an increase of 8.4 per cent on the first £343 15s 0d and 5.3 per cent on the balance of existing inclusive remuneration excluding the flat 10/- per week.</P>
    <P>The eighth round took place on 1st August, 1960.  It was the first time a 20 per cent increase was applied to all salaries without ceiling.  Right along, from 1946 to 1960, the upper salaries were depressed.  As I have said, in 1960 the 20 per cent increase was granted for the first time all round. That seemed to show that the Government were anxious to make some restitution.  Let me say, though, that the 20 per cent in 1960 did not arise from any sudden increase in the cost <Col N="963" /> of living at that time; it was really to make up for the amount of money withheld in salaries from public and State officials from 1946.</P>
    <P>Between 1946 and 1960 persons who went off were not all given restitution because the period of restitution begins, or ends, on 15th December, 1959.  Officers who went out between 15th December, 1959, and August, 1960, get no benefit.  The man who went out after 1960 has his pension based on a salary increased after that date.  In a great number of cases the money to pay for those increases, particularly in cases of local authority officers, must be provided by the local authorities and I have no hesitation in saying the local authorities will honour their obligations in this matter if the Ministers for Finance and Local Government give them the necessary statutory authority.</P>
    <P>I worked 41 years for a county council.  During that time we had neither strike nor lock-out and the local authority paid the maximum salaries and wages they were entitled to pay.  I am perfectly satisfied they will do the same now.</P>
    <P>Let me point out another matter in connection with pensions which again inflicts grave injustice in certain cases. Civil servants, officers who entered the State employment at the age of 18 or 19 years, are on pensionable service. A professional man of my own profession, doctors and others working under local authorities or the State, after the age of 18 have to go to a university to get their professional qualifications and it is well known to the Minister and members of the House that it is rare for any professional man to get a permanent appointment under the age of 30 years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if he goes into the service of the State or of a local authority his pensionable service commences at the age of 30 years.  It is a fact that in computing his pension certain years may be added, but in computing his lump sum allowance no years can be added.  Therefore, the person who enters the service at the age of 18 has the required service to enable him to <Col N="964" /> get the full lump sum allowance, which is 1½ times his salary plus half his salary as pension, whereas the professional employee never reaches his maximum lump sum allowance.</P>
    <P>The number of officials for whom I speak, particularly those who retired between 1959 and 1st August, 1960, would not be very great but because the number is not very great the injustice is all the more marked.  In my county town we have a local paper whose motto is: &ldquo;Be just and fear not&rdquo;.  Thousands of years ago there was another motto: <i>Fiat justicia ruat coelum.</i>  If the Minister gives these matters his sympathetic consideration neither the heavens nor the State will fall, and I make my appeal in all sincerity.  When dealing with pensions, and in considering the motion before the House, the case of officials who retired between December, 1959 and August, 1960, should be looked into.</P>

      <P>As I see it, the Bill does not propose to give any pension increases to any retired servant.  It simply authorises increases which have already been paid.  The increases which have already been paid, as I see it, restored or brought the level of pensions up to the level of the salaries obtaining in the employments from which the people retired resulting from the seventh round of wage and salary increases, in other words, the level of salaries obtaining in those employments as a result of the increases negotiated in late 1959 or early 1960. Those seventh round increases have resulted in an adjustment in the pensions paid in those same employments, but the pensions were not adjusted until November, 1963, when, no doubt, the ranks of the retired people had been thinned by death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of and acknowledge the Minister's sympathy for the retired people.  He has done a great deal and there is every indication that he will do far more but what I want to advance is not a plea for sympathy. I know that sympathy is there.  What I want to advance is an acceptance by this House of the right of people who are compelled by reason of the conditions <Col N="965" /> of their employment to retire at a certain age to maintain the standard of living relative to that employment. Let us try to put this in its proper context.  Those retired people are not people who have opted out of the community.  They are still part of this community, still part of this nation.  We have boasted with all the turns and weavings to the left from various Parties at the moment that the prime aim is to advance the economy of the country, advance the wealth and wellbeing of the community, and people, for example, who are in employment can expect through the strength of their organisations and their trade unions to benefit and participate in the development of the economy.  I am not simply talking about compensation for the change in the value of money which we now recognise as being inevitable, but a participation or sharing in the increased wealth, in other words, a real advance in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>We as a Christian community should be prepared to acknowledge that all parts of the community should share in this advance, not simply people who could do so through the organised strength of their trade unions, not simply farmers who can do so through their own organisation and their acknowledged voting power, but also the other weaker and less well organised sections of the community.  What I am trying to advance here is that these people surely have an expectation to participate in the development and increase in the wealth of the country. They should not have to expect that they must wait for four or five years to participate and share in, so far as any of them are left, the advance, because here, as I said, what we are authorising and giving our blessing to under this Bill is an advance given to those people in accordance with the seventh round.  Since then there have been an eighth and a ninth round, and I have no doubt that the people covered by this Bill, or as many of them as will survive, will eventually benefit by the eighth and ninth rounds. What I am trying to put to the Minister is that those people should not have to wait, that we, the Houses of <Col N="966" /> the Oireachtas, the Ministers and the Government, should acknowledge that people who retired from employment because they had to retire, because it is a condition of their employment that they retire at a certain age, should benefit by any increase relating to that employment in subsequent years as long as they live.  In other words, they have a right to an expectation of the standard of living that they had gained by their work and their development in the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to labour this point, that they are not people who have opted out of the community.  They are not people who have decided that they do not wish to work any longer and that they will go into retirement.  Too many of us assume that people who retire do so willingly and gladly and say: &ldquo;I am finished working.  I am very happy and I will not do anything further.&rdquo;  In fact as we all know, that is not the situation.  Generally speaking, when they come to retiring age they would much prefer to stay on at work and possibly would be happier, would feel that they would, obviously, be better employed if they stuck on in the job to which they have been accustomed and participated in the work.  But they are compelled to retire. The people we are speaking about here, people covered by the motion, are, generally speaking, people who have not opted out but people who have been compelled to retire at a certain age because they have reached that age and have no wish to go out but have been told: &ldquo;You must go at this point in your life.&rdquo;  We in this House should be prepared to acknowledge that that section of the community are entitled to participate in any development of the economy and not simply entitled to have compensation for any change in money values in the cost of living but as well are entitled to have their share in the economic advance which we hope will continue.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept this motion.  It would be in line with the sympathy he has shown for those people down through the years.  I appreciate that it puts him <Col N="967" /> in a difficulty.  We all appreciate this because he cannot pull these further benefits out of the air.  It means in fact that somebody else has to go a little short.  This is simply a sharing out of the well being of the economy.  If we give more and a just portion to this section somebody else has to be a little short and get a little less.  We in this Christian community referred to by the mover of this motion should be prepared to accept that.  We know the difficulty of these people, and equally they have a right and an expectation to maintain the standard of living appropriate to the employment from which they have retired.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will find it possible to show his sympathy further and to show that he could accept the spirit at least of this motion.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I welcome this Bill because there is grave dissatisfaction throughout the country among the pensioners in the various national services.  A Bill to increase pensions for the various types of people covered by this Bill is a very welcome measure, indeed, and most desirable in the present circumstances of rising prices and increased cost of living, especially in view of the increases that have taken place over the past few months.  The Government must accept responsibility for those increases and the increase in the cost of practically every commodity that those people have to buy.  After all, the first category to suffer from those increased prices are the people who are living on low fixed incomes.  Those are the pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One section of pensioners, in particular, for whom I really feel, is the members of the Garda Síochána.  Those men tackled almost impossible tasks in this State.  They were an unarmed force who worked hard and long hours, risking their very lives, in order that the people could live normal and civilised lives.  It is a terribly unfair situation where those who risked their lives and suffered great hardship to bring peace back to our country are in receipt of £200 per annum less than their colleagues, probably with the <Col N="968" /> same level of service, who retired only a few years after them.</P>
    <P>I am told a garda with 33 years' service, who retired in 1960, gets a pension of £290 per annum and that his colleague, who retired this year with the same length of service, will receive £472 per annum, £182 more than the man who retired only a few years ago. I understand the same injustice arises throughout the different services.  Our Constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens but here we find those who devoted their lives to the service of the country and to building up the State from scrap get the least return for it.</P>
    <P>I, personally, think that those who fought for the State in the early years did a tremendous job.  They laid very solid foundations and the people who followed them, more or less, had the same hard task.  It is regrettable that the people who worked for the State in the beginning should be penalised in this fashion.  While I welcome the Bill I do not think it goes far enough, and it is to be regretted that the upward adjustment of pensions is very little. The Minister, of course, can say he is increasing the funds by over £1 million. I think, if the Minister really wanted to, he could straighten out this matter once and for all.  I should like, sincerely, to support the motion on the Order Paper over the names of Senators Brosnahan, Crowley, Murphy, Ó Conalláin and Dooge.  I feel it is only right, in all social justice, that these pensions should be brought up to the present level of prices.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion.  I want to say Senator Brosnahan has so fully and convincingly dealt with the subject that my rising to speak at all is merely to indicate my wholehearted support for the principle enshrined in this motion.  I feel everyone in this House is convinced of the justice of this principle.  I feel the Minister himself is convinced of it.  Therefore, I would be labouring the obvious to go back on any of the arguments that have been introduced in favour of it.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me, therefore, to make reference to the sterling service given by people, who are now on pension, to the State, or to bring in figures &mdash; everyone can bring in figures&mdash;to show that the people who are now retired are being unfairly dealt with by comparison with people at present retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall confine myself to one aspect of the case which I think has not been mentioned yet.  Pensions are generally regarded as deferred salaries and, particularly in the case of contributory pension schemes, it is obvious that a grave injustice is being done to people who, during the course of their service, pay a valuable premium towards their pension and then, when they retire on pension, find that the <Col N="970" /> money they get in respect of their premiums is much lower in value.</P>
    <P>If we look on the question of pensions on that basis, I think the case for equating pensions to those of people currently retiring is completely unanswerable. The figures quoted by Senator Brosnahan are percentages that would require the bringing of pensions to the purchasing power of people retiring now.  These figures must shake even a Minister of State out of his attitude of complacency. The most striking group of all was omitted from that list, that which would show the highest percentage required. That is in relation to the secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is obvious to anyone who knows the basis on which the secondary teachers' pension is calculated.  In the first instance, there was no pension scheme in their case until 1929.  Therefore, a year of service prior to 1929 was not calculated as a year of service for pension purposes at the ordinary rate.  It was calculated at a reduced rate.  For that reason, the people who served in the secondary education branch of teaching over the last 40, 50 or 60 years retire on very reduced pension.  While retirement is normally at 40 years' service, it seldom happens they go out with 40 years' service or anything like it.  Their case, therefore, would give even a more alarming figure than any of the figures given by Senator Brosnahan.  It accentuates the need there is today for something to bring the principle enshrined in the motion into operation and into legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us merely gives statutory effect to something that has already been done.  Like other Senators, I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes, but with the others, I regard it as quite inadequate.  I also commend the attitude the Minister has adopted towards this.  He has taken three steps towards alleviating the condition of pensioners.  The first is the percentage increase and the second relates pensions to salaries a few years in arrears.  The second step has gone some way towards adopting the principle enshrined in the motion.  But, even the Minister must <Col N="971" /> agree that it has not gone nearly far enough, and we hope, when he is replying to this debate, he will be in a position to say that he accepts this principle and that he will do all in his power to bring in legislation in the future or, as he proposes to do, make statutory orders to bring about a state of affairs which will leave pensioners without a grievance.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to express my approval and support of the motion by Senators Brosnahan and Crowley.  I should also like to say that I approve of the Bill which, I think, merely gives statutory effect to what has already been done for a couple of years.  I strongly approve of section 29 of the Bill because it gives the Minister power, without coming before the Oireachtas, to make all the changes and all the advances of which different Senators have spoken today.  There is no ground left that has not already been covered by speeches already made.  I would appeal to the good, warm and sympathetic heart of the Minister to take advantage of section 29 in order to put into effect as far as in him lies, whether immediately or over a period of time, all that has been asked for in the motion before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as has already been said, is an instrument authorising increases already paid since last year. Most of the speakers have already indicated that the Minister is in favour of the motion.  It is good to hear that because I know the Minister, over the years, has been associated with the pensioners and their deputations and he has been more than courteous to them.  He has, to use his own words, with the finances at his disposal, done his best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally conceded that the lack of money is the cause of the Minister's inability to give effect to parity which the pensioners all over the country are anxious to achieve.  It would appear that Deputy Dr. Ryan favours this, but the Minister for Finance finds difficulty in implementing it.  I am sure Deputy Dr. Ryan and the Minister for <Col N="972" /> Finance will get together and help the pensioners.</P>
    <P>There are 25,000 ex-State pensioners in this country.  They have met the Minister, through their deputations from time to time over the past few years, and they have had a measure of satisfaction with each increase they got.  Sadly, what happens when he is giving an increase is that a short time after that the increase is of no monetary value to them because creeping inflation carries on despite everything.</P>
    <P>It has been said that these pensioners are really servants of the State.  The Minister, and everyone in this House, is fully aware of most of the things which have been said so far.  Sometimes they bear repetition.  At other times, they become boring.  But, in a matter like this, everybody acknowledges the fact that just at the moment the current pensioners are the men who participated in the founding, the nurturing and the bringing to adulthood of this nation.  We looked at this matter from a Christian point of view.  A Senator claimed that if this is treated in a Christian way, then those outside will have pensions comparable to the ranks they hold in the service.  I commend that, and every member of this House commends it.</P>
    <P>A most extraordinary thing about pensions, whether they are State pensions, IRA or Army, is that there is complete unanimity in both this and the other House on the matter.  It is probably unique inasmuch as it is a measure to which there will be absolutely no opposition, no matter what Government introduce it.  That is the extraordinary feature of it.</P>
    <P>Inflation is a disease that began, I believe, with the century.  It accelerated slightly after the First World War and the momentum gathered tremendously from 1946 onwards.  In this morning's paper we are told that the £ note of 1951 has decreased by 2d short of one-third.  A £ note is now 6/6d less in purchasing value than it was 13 years ago.</P>
    <P>Some economists tell us that inflation is a very pleasant experience for <Col N="973" /> those who are organised and can buttress themselves against it because they get more money and are able to meet the increased costs as they come along.  We, the mover of this motion and those who support him, speak on behalf of those who have no organisation and no instrument by which they can enhance their financial situation. They are utterly dependent upon the Oireachtas.  There is no organisation outside that can strike on their behalf. There is nobody to whom they can appeal except to the Oireachtas and, in the last analysis, to the good nature or the good heart of a Minister who, naturally, says in effect: &ldquo;Certainly, I shall give it to you, but it is difficult to find the money.  I cannot find the money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are all over 21 years of age in this House and in the other House also and we know that money can be found for most extraordinary things.  I believe that with the good heart of the Minister money can and will be found to implement the concepts embodied in this motion.  These 25,000 men are entitled to our support because they produced ordered institutions in this country&mdash;not those men over there or these men over here, but these men themselves.  They gave their whole lives to this work.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that no member of this House or of the other House wants to see an old State servant in poor circumstances.  In company with other members of the Oireachtas, I attended the representative meeting of these 25,000 people.  I was and still am mainly concerned&mdash;be it generally known&mdash;with Army pensioners.  It is unbelievable that there are people who served this nation for 40 years who are now living in what used to be described as shabby gentility.  It is up to each and every one of us to do our best to ensure that their economic situation is improved.</P>
    <P>Anything that could be said about this has amply and ably been covered both by the mover of the motion and subsequent speakers but there are two matters to which I wish to refer before I conclude.  When the organisations constituting the State servants sought <Col N="974" /> parity, they found difficulty in representing the Old IRA pensioner in that field because they cannot compare him with existing grades.  With profound respect to those men who have given their services on the various local authorities, these men&mdash;some of them are still in this House&mdash;gave sterling service for 24 hours a day and never thought of pensions: that did not arise at all.  However, that is a difficulty that will confront the Minister if he ever gets around to the happy day when he decides to sort out this parity question.</P>
    <P>The Minister could relate the Old IRA pensions to the grades existing in the Army so that when the Army get a raise, then, as time goes on, the Old IRA pensioner will automatically be associated with that Department.  Damn it all, if he is not associated with the Department he created, he is not associated with anything.  Most of the Old IRA elements are fading away like the proverbial old soldier.  The Old IRA are diminishing in numbers day by day.  We are fast approaching the time when a couple of thousand pounds will pay for the lot of them. It would be a wonderful gesture on the part of the Minister and on the part of the Oireachtas so to relate these men to the Army grades that they can have some sort of quasi-security in not the twilight but the late evening of their lives.</P>
    <P>A number of Army personnel successfully competed in examinations and came into Government service. These men are now suffering a loss of money inasmuch as their pensions are reduced in some measure and in some cases, I think, have actually been stopped.  I should like the Minister to go once again into that matter and to adjust it in favour of these men.  After all, you can have a pensioner from another Army in a State job here and he does not suffer any disability financially.  Why, therefore, should our own men suffer it?</P>
    <P>No words of mine can possibly illustrate the gravity of the situation in respect of a great number of these 25,000 pensioners.  I commend their situation to the House and to the <Col N="975" /> Minister.  As I said earlier, the Bill is, first, an instrument to give effect to pension raises already in operation, and the motion is a plea to the House and to the Minister over the names of a group of Senators, and I have pleasure in supporting that motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>At election times there is probably no louder catch cry than that of pensions of one kind or another, more often than not, old age pensions.  Listening to this debate, I was very pleased to hear no political catch cries in relation either to the Bill or to the motion.  All of us in the House are agreed &mdash; I hope we are agreed &mdash; on the principle of the motion.  Even the Minister in his capacity as Minister (as opposed to his personal capacity) sympathetically accepts this form of motion.  He said in the Dáil that the needs of pensioners will continue to be sympathetically considered and that he hoped it would be possible to effect further improvements in their position from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Minister's difficulty is, of course, as other speakers have said, the difficulty of finding the money.  As a number of Senators have said, pensioners as a whole are powerless to make themselves felt.  Quite frankly, I did not realise how great was the differential in some pensions until I heard the figures quoted by Senator McDonald.  It appalled me to learn that a garda retiring in 1960 will get £182 less than a garda retiring this year.  This is at the point virtually of subsistence level.  A sum of £182 may not make a real difference to a man who has got a substantial pension of £1,000 a year or more, but what a difference it makes to the man who gets only £290 a year as against his colleague retiring four years later at £472 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a factor of great seriousness and of terrible import to the people who are vitally concerned.  I do not want to add any more to what other Senators have said.  I think the House is in favour of the principle of the motion but I should like to make one suggestion to the Minister.  As all <Col N="976" /> Parties are agreed on the principle, indeed nearly everyone in the State is in agreement with the principle, and those who are thinking about it know that the real question is finding the money.  If that is true, I believe that the average elector and the average taxpayer would accept some additional tax in a future Budget if it were specifically related to bringing this disparity of pensions into the proper line.</P>
    <P>If the problem were properly explained to the people, and if a specific sum were assessed in say income tax&mdash;it could hardly be more than 2d. or 3d.; although it might even be 6d., I have not gone into the figures&mdash;and if people were told what the position was, I believe there would not be nearly so much political opposition as the Minister, or any Minister for Finance, might think.  I make that suggestion because if we are all agreed on the principle, surely there must be some way of putting it into effect, and putting the principle across to the people in a form which they would accept.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill and am very glad it has come before us. As we all know, there was great need for increases in pensions to compensate for increases in the cost of living and for the dwindling value of the £.  If the figures quoted by many Senators are correct and there is a disparity of £200 in many pensions, I suggest the Minister would be very wise to look into it. As I said, this is a Bill I wholeheartedly support.</P>

      <P>I was not here when the debate opened but I assume from its trend that the Bill has been very well received.  I, too, am satisfied it is a good Bill and I welcome it as such. Senator Ó Ciosáin asked where the money was to come from.  That question is a hardy annual.  If we wanted to buy a new jet in the morning, we could get £1¼ million; if we wanted to buy five of them, we could get more than £6 million without any trouble.  In fact I understand we are thinking of buying them.  If we send our butter or our bacon to England, we can find money to subsidise it. Therefore, I see no reason why we cannot find the money to give pensioners, who have given such good service to the country, a fair crack of the whip at the end of their days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> I would compliment the Minister particularly on section 29.  While people may not benefit from it at the moment, in future when increases are given to meet increases in the cost of living, the pensioners will also get increases without the necessity to introduce new legislation.  When the Minister for Finance put that provision into the Bill, I am quite certain he was sincere.  It is something we shall learn in the future when compensation is given for an increase in the cost of living&mdash;that the Minister will immediately make use of section 29 for the benefit of pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes the Bill but I am afraid my welcome for section 29 must be a little guarded. I was astonished to hear members of Parliament being so anxious to welcome the removal of the normal financial procedure from the Bill in favour of procedure by regulation and order.  Senator Brosnahan said it was getting rid of a Victorian straitjacket. That was parliamentary control over expenditure, one of the things parliaments have voted for during many years.  I should not like the Minister to get a rush of blood to the head and come in here again and say the Seanad was trying to do things by order and not by statute.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, it looks very well in relation to a matter such as pensions because it is difficult to imagine Senators or Deputies complaining that pensions were fixed too high.  There is, however, one point which Senators would be well advised to remember in relation to the new procedure.  It will certainly speed up the readjustment of pensions from time to time but it will mean this is the last occasion on which there can be a debate of this kind in the Seanad.  Most of the things said on this Bill would not be in order on a motion to annul a regulation made under section 29.  As long as Senators realise that when they welcome section 29, they are welcoming the fact that never again can they have this debate, then they are all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the Bill was introduced by me, I agree with what Senator Sheldon said in regard to the Victorian provision&mdash;or was it before that?  British Parliaments thought that all expenditure was provided by the king and after that by Parliament.  In fact when we came to office in 1932, the Government had to get an order from the Governor General before they could spend money.  That, of course, disappeared subsequently. These things were regarded as safeguards for the people, the taxpayers. I agree we should not depart too lightly from them but I can assure Senator Sheldon the Seanad will have an opportunity of discussing any increases that may be given to pensioners because any Order made must be laid before both Houses.  For that reason, I think that break from the Victorian custom is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various figures were quoted and I need not tell Senators who have experience in these matters that outstanding figures are usually quoted. There are occasions when a pensioner who retired some years ago notices that a person retiring now, in the same position as he was when he retired, gets a pension of 50 or 60 per cent higher. That is not usual.  I calculated recently what it would cost to implement this motion, to bring every pensioner up to the same level and found it would average out at about 25 per cent. Against that, I had calculated what it would cost to compensate 1959 level pensioners for increases in the cost of living in the meantime.  That would only cost about half that roughly.  I <Col N="980" /> daresay if it were put to the test and had to be calculated very minutely and accurately my figures might be one or two per cent out but, roughly, that would be how we would stand, that on the comparison of the level of retiring now it would be an average of 25 per cent down but on the cost of living basis it would be about 12½ per cent down.  I may not have got the figure quoted by Senator Crowley properly but I think he said that under this Bill an increase was being given to about five per cent.  He may have gathered that from my speech but in my speech I took the 1962 Act first and said that all who had retired before 1955 were at the end of the 1955 level and under the 1963 Act those who had retired before 1959 were all up to the 1959 level.  The 1964 proposal gave a five per cent increase on the 1959 level and that would roughly bring everybody up to the point at which people retired at the end of 1961.  We, therefore, have pensioners generally at the level of those who retired in 1961 and our problem is to deal with them from that time on.</P>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with the views expressed in regard to the good service rendered by those pensioners, whether they were civil servants, teachers, gardaí or Army personnel. They all gave very good and faithful service and I appreciate that very much.  I would remind the Seanad that since 1957 I have, as Minister for Finance, provided five increases which cost in the aggregate something like £1¾ million.  Before my time the total amount of the increases was £420,000 so that I could, therefore, make a case to the Seanad that I have done much better than my predecessors and as well as could be expected in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would remind certain Senators who spoke warmly on behalf of the pensioners that when I came to look for £1¾ million they always voted against me.  Practically everyone who spoke on that side of the House in favour of those pensioners voted against me.  The point we have to keep in mind is that the money has to be got and that sympathy without good works will not go very far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> There are two points we must keep in mind in regard to pension increases. First of all, it has been a Victorian rule, if you like, and observed more or less up to the present, that in Government pay they never take the initiative in starting a round of increases that everybody else would be inclined to follow but they do follow increases given outside as faithfully as they can. They follow the old Irish proverb &ldquo;Ná déan nós agus ná bris nós&rdquo;.  This was a good rule for a Government to take. If the Government were to give better terms to their employees than people outside they could be accused, indeed, of distributing largesse that did not belong to them.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to keep in mind is that just as we want to be careful with regard to pay we also have to be careful in regard to our pension schemes.  There are many outside firms that have pension schemes established in recent years.  All these schemes by individual firms outside are based on a certain contribution, a percentage of the pay, and then the pension is provided based on the number of years' service and on the retiring pay.  It is all actuarially done, worked out nicely, and if the pay remains constant over the next 40 years there would be no difficulty and no mistake in the calculation of that pension.  The pensions would work out admirably, the money would be there to pay them. Even where pay has gone up in those firms the fact that the contribution has gone up also because it is a percentage of pay enables the fund to stand the increased pensions that those people retire on.  But they have never provided for any increase for the pensioners who have gone out, and there is no means of providing for that as far as I can see.  Therefore, if we were to set a standard that would be difficult for outside firms to follow we would make great difficulties for those outside firms in preserving their pension schemes. They could, of course, put a higher percentage on their employees, but the employees would know that that was to increase the pensions of their predecessors who had gone out and I do not think that they would be very pleased to contribute to that.  In the <Col N="982" /> same way we have an exact parallel to that that when the State is asked to increase pensions the money is coming from the taxpayer and when we ask him for the money he is not very pleased to contribute it.  Certainly those who speak for the taxpayer both in the Dáil and here are surely not pleased to do it because they turn us down every time.  You always have this difficulty. It may be said, of course, that those who turn us down in the Dáil and here are probably glad that they are beaten because they know that the money is there and they can go back and say to the man drinking the pint: &ldquo;We voted against the 1d on the pint.&rdquo;</P>

I should say that when a person on this side of the House, as some of our people did, advocates more sympathetic treatment for those pensioners that person is sincere because when I ask for the money he will give it to me, but I cannot say the same about the sincerity of the people who ask for these increases but at the same time would not allow me the money to provide them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I put about 25 per cent on pensions, it would be about £1½ million and if it is on the cost of living, it would be about half that amount.  When I met pensioners' organisations three, four or five years ago, it was accepted generally by those who spoke for them that it was the cost of living that affected them.  There was always talk about the cost of living going up and pensions not going up and I think there was a case for that.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Carton who made the case that a pension can be regarded as the deferred part of a person's salary.  If you look at it that way, I think there could be a case made for the person who retired saying: &ldquo;I paid a certain part of my salary towards my pension in expectation that for the rest of my life I would get two-thirds or half of that.&rdquo; It would enable him to buy the same amount of goods and services.  Perhaps a good case could be made in regard to the cost of living basis and I am inclined to aim at that goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is want of money which keeps me from doing that.  I cannot go the whole way.  Therefore, we had to get down to a basis first. We could not use the cost of living basis for those who came in in the 1930s or 1920s and retired maybe ten or 15 years ago.  We had to bring them all up to the 1959 basis first or around that time.  On the 1959 basis, we can deal with a percentage increase whenever we have the money to do it.  We can, I hope, relate that percentage increase, as soon as funds permit, to the cost of living.  In fact, the increase proposed in this year's Budget of five per cent to those who retired before 1959, and, in fact, up to 1961, was designed to bring everybody up to the end of 1961 level.  I hope it may be possible, in future Budgets, to bring them up another two or three years <Col N="985" /> until, eventually, each year we will be able to increase them by 2½ per cent or whatever it may be and keep matters straight on that basis.</P>
      <P>Senator Carton spoke about a matter which is not altogether relevant but I will just say this because I know he is very interested in abatements.  I am preparing a Bill on abatements and I hope to bring it in here after the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross said everybody seemed to be in favour of doing something for the pensioners and he thought if we set a specific tax aside for that purpose, the taxpayer would agree to it if he thought it would be devoted to pensioners. I do not want to take from Senator Ross's proposal by saying it is not the first time that suggestion was made.  It may, I am sure, be original on Senator Ross's part but it has been made before.  In fact, it was made this year in the Dáil in relation to social services.  I think the same case could be made for social services.  We could name a certain tax, which would bring in £2 million, or whatever it may be and say: &ldquo;This is for social services.&rdquo; We would expect everybody to agree to that.  We would put on another tax for pensioners.  Perhaps everybody would agree on a tax to raise money for agriculture so we have only a few odds and ends left.  It may amount to a few hundred thousand pounds more and it would be an extremely difficult thing to do from the point of view of accounting.</P>
      <P>In Government financing, they always make estimates of what to expect.  The estimates may be too high or too low so where you have a saving on one, you have at least built up another one that was estimated too low.  I think the system of having a special tax is a very desirable object, but it would be very hard to act on it. We might have to say, perhaps about February, before the year is out, that this tax is exhausted so the pensioners will have to do without an increase until we get a new tax on 1st April. From that point of view, and from an administrative point of view, it would be an extremely difficult thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senators will certainly agree <Col N="986" /> that if it were once started, there would be so many advocates for so many desirable objects that we should have to have special taxes for many objects and it would be almost impossible to work.  I have to say what my attitude is on this motion.  I should like to agree to the motion if I had the money, but I have not got it.  I would have to say to Senators that they will not give it to me.  If they gave it to me I might take a different view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from finance, there are other objections.  The person going into the Service gets a pension after 40 years' service of half his retiring salary. Let us suppose he will know that the retiring salary will be given to him in real money for the rest of his life, that is, he will be compensated for the rise in the cost of living.  I think that would be a fair guarantee.  We are hardly called upon to say that a person who is retiring now should be entitled to get the same pension as the man who retires in ten years' time.  If there is an increase in the cost of living, he will be all right.  I think these two points should be kept in mind.  That is why I could not, as Minister for Finance, agree with the motion.</P>

I should like the Minister to clarify the figures he has given us. <Col N="987" /> As I understand it, the position is that if pensions were to be increased all at the same level now, it would represent a 25 per cent overall increase.

      <P>The fact that the Minister has broken down the Victorian straitjacket which required legislation to increase pensions is a good thing.  I do not think anybody can <Col N="988" /> reasonably say there will be a rush to spend the taxpayers' money on increases in pensions.  That is the experience all of us have had in the past few years.  If we had the opposite experience we would not have found it necessary to move this motion today. There cannot be any rush to spend the taxpayers' money on increasing pensions.</P>
      <P>In the main, I welcome the Minister's statement about his intentions. His record in the past, in the matter of looking sympathethically at this question of increase in pensions, has been very good, indeed, and the promise contained in his statement on the introduction of the Bill is helpful and encouraging.  I should like to say, however, that when the matter was being discussed it was a pity a certain political atmosphere had developed. The matter enshrined in the motion put forward affects all shades of political opinion and it is shortsighted for people in political life to make political issues out of everything.  This is a clear-cut principle which should be looked at objectively and in a neutral fashion by everybody.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of sincerity, I proposed this motion out of the blue as it were and there was no suggestion as to how taxation would be passed.  I put the motion forward in all sincerity and I am prepared to face up to my responsibility in the matter.  It would be shortsighted of me as a person employed out of public funds to uphold legislative proposals for taxation. The motion was put forward in all sincerity.  I withdraw the motion because I should not like it to go on record in this House that it was voted against.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is needed to modernise the law governing the grant <Col N="989" /> of patents for invention.  Our existing law is substantially unchanged from that enacted by the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, which itself derives from the British Patents Act of 1907.  During the fifty-seven years since 1907 many countries have made important changes in their patent laws, mainly intended to avoid the grant of unjustified patents and to increase the value and validity of those which are granted. During recent years international discussions have been working towards still further changes.</P>
      <P>Since 1950 Ireland has shared in efforts by patent experts of many countries to formulate patent laws which could be adopted uniformly by all countries.  Last year the members of the Council of Europe reached agreement on a Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents.  Ireland was in agreement with the solutions adopted in the Convention, and, on 11th March, 1964, added its signature to those of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom which had already signed it.  In 1962, experts of the members of the European Economic Community published a draft Convention setting out the law under which European patents common to a number of countries might be granted.  This law is consistent with that of the Council of Europe Convention, and shows clearly the direction of modern thought in Europe. Further, certain minor matters agreed to by our representative at the Lisbon Conference for the Revision of the International Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property, held at Lisbon in 1958, necessitate some small changes in our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes some changes of principle in our law, particularly as to the criteria to be adopted in determining whether an alleged invention is novel and a patent granted on it valid. These changes are designed to bring our law into line with the European Conventions to which I have referred. But I do not propose them merely for <Col N="990" /> the sake of uniformity with foreign views.  I am satisfied that they reflect modern conditions of communications and industrial activities, and get rid of some old concepts which have been outmoded by the advance of science. I think the changes are in the best interests not only of inventors, but also of the general public who may suffer from improper monopolies.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant change is the adoption of what is often called the concept of absolute novelty.  Under our law, which, like that of the British, conceives of a relative degree of novelty, an invention is considered to be new and patentable if it has not been published or worked within the State itself.  In some cases, even, only publication in the State after a certain date is destructive of novelty.  Most industrial countries, however, now consider that if an invention has been made available to the public anywhere, at any time, it ceases to be novel and should not afterwards be patentable. This is the test of absolute novelty adopted in the Conventions of the Council of Europe and the European Economic Community.  The Bill adopts it by means of the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; in section 2 and the grounds in section 34 under which an invalid patent may be revoked.  It will be appreciated that in each case it will be a matter for proof and evidence that a particular disclosure was of such a character as to make the invention available to the public.  Because this test may involve difficult questions of proof, the Bill applies it only in section 34, under which it is the duty of the court to decide on validity.  This change in the law met some criticism in the Dáil on the ground that it would prevent some things from being patented in Ireland.  I think, however, that this result is desirable.  With modern communications, an invention published in the United States, for example, will very quickly become known to interested persons in Ireland. It is wrong that any one of those persons should be allowed to monopolise an invention which he did not make and which otherwise would be available to all.</P>
    <P>Another important change of principle <Col N="991" /> concerns the treatment of what are often called, for convenience, copending applications.  These are applications in respect of similar inventions one of which is made so shortly after the other that the one of later date is filed before the earlier one has been published.  At present the law allows the later inventor to get a patent for any subject-matter which the earlier one has described but has failed, by inadvertence or otherwise, to claim. There is no logic about this position, depending, as it does, upon such chance factors as the speed at which applications can be processed in the Patents Office.  Recent High Court and Appeal Court decisions in London are thought to have made the existing law, in section 21 of the 1927 Act, nugatory, and we have had representations that its operation can be unfair to the earlier inventor who, as the first in the field, has the better rights.  Accordingly, the corresponding section 13 in the Bill has been amended to take account of matter described as well as that claimed.  There are corresponding provisions in sections 19 and 34.  This solution of the matter is consistent with the two European Conventions to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As it is not feasible for the Patents Office to make a substantial search for novelty, the law requires an applicant for a patent to provide some evidence that his invention has not previously been published in a British patent specification.  The Bill in section 8 (6) empowers the Minister to prescribe by Rule different forms of evidence as to novelty.  This will enable a stricter test of novelty to be applied when an application is examined, and at the same time the applicant can be given some freedom of choice as to the form of evidence most convenient to him. Another change designed to prevent the grant of defective patents is in section 19, under which third parties may intervene to oppose the grant of a patent.  The Controller is given new power, in subsection (1) (e), to refuse a patent if he is satisfied by evidence that an alleged invention is too obvious to merit a patent.  Until now, this ground of objection has been available <Col N="992" /> to the court only in proceedings for the revocation of a patent.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues, in section 39, the existing powers for protecting the public from the abuse of his monopoly rights by a patentee.  There are small amendments necessitated by the Lisbon Revision of the International Convention and intended to prevent unfair treatment of the patentee.  The existing provisions under which a Minister may use a patented invention compulsorily when this is necessary for the well-being of the State have been strengthened in section 92, particularly in view of a recent decision in the English Court concerning drugs used in the Health Service.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives to the Controller new powers to deal with several matters which hitherto have been reserved to the court.  The most important concern petitions for the extension of the normal term of a patent, section 27, disputes between joint owners of a patent, section 52, and disputes between an employer and his employee as to rights in an invention made by the latter.  The aim is to provide a cheaper and easier jurisdiction on certain questions which usually involve technical rather than legal problems. There will in all cases be right of appeal to the court.  Hitherto, some of the many issues, which the Controller is called upon to decide from time to time, have been appealable to the Attorney General and some to the court.  Section 75 of the Bill provides that in future appeal shall lie always to the court.  It will be noted that under the Bill the Attorney General has advisory functions in relation to the Controller.</P>
    <P>Section 86 continues the existing provisions for restricting the practice of patent agency to registered agents with prescribed qualifications.  A new feature is power for the Minister to authorise temporary exceptions in exceptional circumstances.  This is because of the very limited number of qualified men now available.  Section 93, which deals with powers for reciprocity in patent matters under international agreements, has been drafted so as to provide for additional Conventions which may be made in the <Col N="993" /> future as well as the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, within which Ireland has always worked.</P>
    <P>In addition to these main points of principle, the Bill includes many minor changes of law intended to help applicants, or patentees, or the administration. Most have been in the English law since 1949 without, it is believed, giving anything but satisfaction. Sections 77 to 85, which continue the present provisions for the establishment of an Office and a Controller and his staff, are designed to cover all the activities centred in the Office and the Controller, those in connection with trade marks, designs and copyright as well as those concerning patents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, this Bill is introduced for the purpose of replacing the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, and bringing the patent law up to date.  I think it is correct to say that the various matters dealt with in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, have now been dealt with by more modern Acts, that is, trade marks, copyrights and now patents. Therefore, it might not be out of place at this juncture, and before saying farewell to the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, to place on record our appreciation of the foresight and ability of the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Minister who presided over it, in introducing, very shortly after the State was set up, and when we were not very commercially-minded, an Act of Parliament which has served the State for 37 years, and which only requires to be replaced because of the vast changes in industry and commerce down through the years.</P>
      <P>In his explanatory memorandum the Minister states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law relating to patents for inventions is intended to encourage invention by giving to inventors exclusive rights of exploitation for a limited term of years, while at the same time providing adequate safeguards for the general public against <Col N="994" /> unjustified and faulty patents and against abuse of monopoly rights.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with that statement. The law relating to patents is a highly technical, and highly specialised field. The fact that a person has legal qualifications in a general way does not presuppose that he is an expert in this branch of the law.  In fact, many legal men live their professional lives without ever being called upon to advise on, or to implement the law on patents. There is a small group of specialists in this country known as patent agents who specialise in this branch of the law, and who do not engage themselves in any other branch of the law. In fact, they are not qualified lawyers.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable, therefore, that when specialists in a field like that make suggestions they should be listened to and their suggestions given serious consideration.  As I understand it, since the Bill was first published, this small band of specialists submitted to the Minister about 30 suggestions for the improvement of the Bill, in the interests of the public in general.  The Minister and his advisers did not see fit to accept any of those suggestions. I think I am correct in saying that, although he may have accepted one very minor amendment or suggestion. I find it very difficult to believe that all the skill and wisdom are on one side, that is, in the Department.  I believe that very often people dealing with these matters every day in a practical way, and coming up against practical difficulties that have to be solved, are in just as good a position, if not much better, to advise and make valuable suggestions as people who are looking at it purely from the official side.</P>
    <P>I understand it has been agreed to take the Committee Stage today and, therefore, I do not intend to go into the Bill in great detail on this Stage. However, one of the matters to which serious objection is taken by those in a position to know is the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; in section 2.  Heretofore &ldquo;published&rdquo; meant &ldquo;published within the State.&rdquo;  Now, for the purpose of section 34, which provides for revocation of patents, &ldquo;published&rdquo; is taken <Col N="995" /> to mean &ldquo;published anywhere in the world.&rdquo;  That means that if it could be proved that the subject-matter of a patent, a novelty, or an invention, has been published in China, Japan or anywhere else, someone can come in and have the patent revoked.  It is suggested that that is not in the interests of industry and commerce in Ireland, and that it might well act to the disadvantage of the country.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been made is in regard to section 12.  Hitherto it has been accepted that anything published in an application for a patent to the Patents Office more than 50 years ago was not taken into account, or not regarded as having been published at all.  That 50 years limit is abolished in this Bill.  Again, that is considered to be a move in the wrong direction.  Section 27 provides for the extension of the term of patent.  Normally a patent is protected for 16 years.  That may seem to be a considerable time, but immediately an invention is thought of, or worked out, it is patented, and it often takes some years to get it put on the market, and to get the subject matter of the patent marketed.  Therefore, 16 years is not a very long time.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the 1927 Act for granting extensions of patents in certain circumstances, but I understand that the terms of the section were so stringent that it has not been found possible to avail of it.  In fact, during the 37 years that the 1927 Act has been in force, less than half a dozen applications to extend a patent have been made.  I believe the reason for that is that in order to succeed in an application to the court to extend a patent, it is necessary to show what profits the patentee has received or earned from that patent.  It is necessary to show what the profits are not alone in this country but all over the world and that, in the past, has not been found possible.  My suggestion is that on an application under section 27 it should be sufficient to show what profit was earned from the patent in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is the section which deals with the revoking of patents, which enables the courts to revoke a patent <Col N="996" /> if it can be shown it has been published in any part of the world.  That is a very serious matter, one which needs a lot of looking into.  Section 42 was referred to by the Minister in his opening speech.  It provides, among other things:</P>
    <P>Where a patent is in force in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a substance capable of being used as food or medicine or in the production of food or medicine; or</P>
    <P>(b)  a process for producing such a substance as aforesaid; or</P>
    <P>(c)  any invention capable of being used as, or as part of a medical, surgical or other remedial device,</P>
    <P>the Controller shall, on application made to him by any person interested, order the grant to the applicant of a licence under the patent on such terms as he thinks fit, unless it appears to him that there are good reasons for refusing the application.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, this is a new section, a new approach to the granting of licences.  I suggest to the Minister and the House that that is not calculated to encourage invention in this all-important field of medical research, because if a person discovers some medicine or drug which he wants to patent, and he has spent a lot of money on research, he may be faced with an order granting licences to all and sundry a very short time after he has his product on the market.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is in the interest of medical research, certainly chemical research, and it could lead to a great deal of harm.  I am not to be taken as favouring the proposition that a person who has as a result of research found a drug which is very useful to humanity should be allowed to monopolise that or charge a prohibitive price for it, putting it beyond the reach of the average person to purchase. I do say, however, that section 42 is not necessary to give that protection, because section 39 deals with the abuse of monopoly rights under patent.  Section 39 is designed to meet a situation where a person who has <Col N="997" /> made a discovery which is of use to suffering humanity tries to exploit the people who need to avail of his discovery. Under that section, any person interested may apply to the Controller for a licence under patent or for an endorsement of the patent on the ground that there has been an abuse of monopoly rights of patent.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can seriously say section 39 is not an adequate protection against the abuse of a monopoly granted by a patent. In this field of medicine and chemical research, it is all the more necessary to encourage people to carry out this research because the way things are looking in the world today, a drug is not very long on the market until a more effective drug is discovered, rendering the first one obsolete.  If an inventor who has gone to a lot of research expense cannot be assured of a few years in which fairly to exploit&mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;fairly&rdquo;&mdash;his discovery, certainly there is no encouragement for anybody to go to the trouble and considerable expense of research.</P>
    <P>There is just one other general question I should like to ask the Minister to deal with when he is replying.  It is obvious that this Bill, probably in company with other legislation with which we have dealt, has been introduced in anticipation of our entry to the Common Market, in anticipation of a world trend in that direction.  The Minister has told us several members of the Council of Europe have signed a Convention signifying their agreement that patent law should be brought into general line among them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister how many of these countries have introduced or enacted measures such as this, giving expression to the views each of them expressed when signing this agreement? Has Britain introduced as yet any such measure and put it in the Statute Book?  Unless most of the countries concerned have done so, we are placing ourselves at a disadvantage in rushing in.  We as a small country should move slowly because if we throw wide open our patent laws and remove restrictions in favour of our own nationals, it <Col N="998" /> will work to the disadvantage of this country and in favour of the larger industrial countries where there is much more knowledge, much more wealth and many more inventors.  That is my contribution to the Bill in general.  I shall have something to say later, section by section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Fitzpatrick has said, this is a highly technical Bill in a highly technical field and there are very few lawyers who have very much to do with patents in the ordinary way. We are to a great extent dependent upon more technical people than ourselves. In this Bill the Minister has in one way to be congratulated in that from time to time we have criticised him or his predecessors, the Department or the Government as a whole, because our law in technical fields, such as company law, trade marks law, patents law and in commercial fields generally was very out of date. The Minister in his period of office has done a very great deal to bring that law up to date, but it seems to me that to some extent he may have gone a little too far in this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill arises out of our own Act of 1927 and is based on it and to a great extent on the British Act of 1949 with a number of notable exceptions. The exceptions are fundamental.  As the Minister said in his opening speech, this Bill is designed to bring our patents law into line with the convention on the unification of patent rights which has been signed by a number of European countries.  Although it has been signed by a number of European countries, I do not think it has been ratified by any European country so far.  Senator Fitzpatrick asked a very pertinent question, and I am sure the Minister will answer it, as to how many countries had ratified this Convention, and how many countries have actually introduced legislation to implement it.  I believe we are the first to do this.  In many ways that is very praiseworthy, but I wonder should we as a not very highly industrialised country throw open our <Col N="999" /> patents law in the way in which this Bill anticipates.</P>
    <P>We have the Control of Manufactures Acts and the Encouragement of External Investment Act which, to some extent, protect our industries from foreign domination and investment. We know that those Acts will go over the next 7 years.  That is what the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> says, and probably they may go before that.  It is right that they should go and that we should prepare ourselves for freer trade activity and freer investment activity. This Bill before us is probably the right Bill in general principles, but the Bill may be a little bit before its time.</P>
    <P>It would be different if we were a highly industrialised nation, but we are trying in every way possible to encourage foreign investors to come here and set up factories and, naturally, if they bring secret processes of one kind or another they will want to protect those processes.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I should like to see this Bill introduced in two or three years' time, or perhaps at the same time as the Control of Manufactures Acts are repealed, because at present it seems to be a bit too big a step in the right direction, a bit too early.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick dealt with some of the general points arising on the Bill, particularly where it has developed away from the British Patents Act of 1949 and is more in keeping with the Convention.  I share with him his fears about section 12 particularly when that section and, as I think, section 34 are linked to the question of publication.  The Minister, I know, dealt with the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; in section 2.  When the Bill states that a patent is published when it is made available to the public by written or spoken word or by public use or any other way and leaves out any reference to publication in the State it means, and deliberately means, published anywhere in the world.  That, in effect, throws open the whole principle that we have had up to now of publication in the State <Col N="1000" /> being a protection for the manufacturer. This is one thing which the manufacturer, seeking a patent process, would normally look for.</P>
    <P>I do not want at this stage to go further into section 34.  That matter has been adequately dealt with by Senator Fitzpatrick.  A rather different principle arises in sections 42 and 92 because these to some extent deal with manufacturers of patent medicines of one kind or another, food, medical and surgical devices and so on.  The principle of a patent is to give protection for a minimum number of years to the owner of the patent.  This principle is clearly set out in section 39, but in section 42 there is a specific exception.  In this section where a patent is in force in respect of food or medicine or medical, surgical or remedial devices and where the Controller has power, on an application being made to him by any person, who is interested, to order the grant to the applicant under the patent on such terms as he thinks fit unless it appears to him that there are good reasons for refusing the application, it is quite possible, and I think it is quite arguable, that in certain patent medicines, foods and surgical devices of one kind or another there is a need for some different treatment from the treatment given to normal patentees.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is only fair to remember that a great number of these patent medicines have been discovered as a result of very substantial research and very substantial investment in research.  Penicillin is a typical example.  It took nine years from the research to the actual marketing stage. A great deal of that time was taken up in extensive research work at enormous expense.  The firms who patent this type of medicine have to undertake tremendous expense in their research laboratories.  I imagine that in a great number of cases the research is in part done in this country but very often these companies are subsidiaries of other companies outside Ireland and much research is also probably carried out outside Ireland.  There is a number of companies who carry out quite extensive research in Ireland and spend a good deal of money in relation <Col N="1001" /> to research on medical supplies of one kind or another already.  I am quite certain there will be a number of others.  Such companies view with considerable anxiety the possibility that, under section 42, they might lose the right to their patents to some other person.</P>
    <P>This section is to some extent carried forward from section 55, subsection (2) of our 1927 Act and is also not dissimilar to another section in the British 1949 Act.  In certain circumstances it may be wise and right that a patent may have to be taken from these companies and thrown open to some other person in the interests of public health generally, particularly if the product is being sold at what appears to be an excessive price.  The significant difference between the new section 42 and the equivalent section in the British Act is that when the Controller has to settle the terms of the licence he gives under subsection (2), he has to endeavour to secure that food, medicines and medical, surgical and other remedial devices shall be available to the public at the lowest prices consistent with the patentees' deriving a reasonable advantage from their patent rights.  The British equivalent in the 1949 Act specifically refers to giving the manufacturer due reward for the research leading to the invention.</P>
    <P>This is a very important definition and, in my view, subsection (2) would be right and proper if there were some addition to it to allow for the giving of a due reward to the company who have the ownership of the patent, taking into consideration the research which they have carried out.  It may be taken as an extreme example to have mentioned penicillin but there are plenty of other examples in which medicines of one kind or another have taken a number of years to develop before they were available on the market.  Such medicines have been of the greatest benefit to mankind but the research companies have to charge something in respect of the money spent on research.  This is not taken into account in this section.  I think we should have some phrase there to take account of such research.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> Section 92 is a somewhat similar section.  It covers the use of patented inventions for the service of the State and says:</P>
    <P>A patent shall have to all intents the like effect as against the State as it has against the citizen.</P>
    <P>In other words, the State stands in the same position in relation to a patentee as any other person.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;provided that any Minister of State may, by himself or by such of his agents etc. use, exercise or vend the invention for the use of the State.&rdquo;  On the one hand, the State is in the same position as the citizen and on the other hand it proceeds in a couple of pages of the Bill to take all those similarities away and puts any Minister of State in a highly privileged position.  It gives any Minister of State the power, not only to make and use an invention for any purpose which the Minister thinks necessary or expedient, but it goes further again than the British Act in giving power to vend, that is an unhampered power to sell.</P>
    <P>In the British Act I think the power of vending is power to vend only in a state of national emergency.  We have gone a good deal further.  We have given any Minister of State power to sell these patented goods at any time and for any purpose which seems necessary or expedient to the Minister. This seems to me to be going too far, particularly because the use of these goods and the power of these patentees to vend the invention in the service of the State means by definition under subsection (9) of section 92 &ldquo;a service financed out of moneys charged on or advanced out of the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas or by a local authority,&rdquo; which is very wide indeed.  Particularly in the immediate future when we are anxious to encourage foreign manufacturers to set up industries here, the sections mentioned can mean a serious discouragement to those of them who want to have full protection for the secret processes which they want to produce.</P>
    <P>There is one other part of the Bill to which I should like to refer.  This is subsection (10) of section 86.  This is <Col N="1003" /> the part which refers to the appointment of patent agents.  It is interesting to note&mdash;I do not understand the reason for this but I am sure the Minister will explain in due course&mdash;that a patent agent is not put in quite the same position as a trade mark agent under the Trade Marks Act.  I do not know why this should be.  In subsection (3) of section 86 a person who may be appointed as a registered patent agent is set out as a person who &ldquo;resides in the State,&rdquo;&ldquo;has a place of business in the State&rdquo; and &ldquo;possesses the prescribed educational and professional qualifications,&rdquo; and &ldquo;complies with the prescribed conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Trade Marks Act, there is a requirement that the patent agent is not to be an alien, but there is no such provision in this section.  As far as I know, patent agents and trade mark agents are, in this country, invariably the same people carrying on the same practice, and it seems that either the requirement &ldquo;is not an alien&rdquo; should be put into this section or, alternatively, some amendment should be made in the Trade Marks Act.</P>
    <P>Another point which requires clarification, and would, I think, require an amendment, is the reference to &ldquo;has a place of business in the State,&rdquo; as being a qualification.  I understand the Controller of trade marks has taken the view in connection with a similar section, or similar wording, in the Trade Marks Act that this means any person who has his own place of business in the State rather than &ldquo;any place of business.&rdquo; If that is the case here, it will make it difficult for any person to apply to act as a patent agent.  The normal procedure for qualification is the same as the normal procedure in any profession.  An employee of a patent agent takes the necessary examinations, gets his qualifications and then he goes on the register.  In due course he probably goes into partnership or sets up on his own.  How is he, under the present wording&mdash;if the ruling of the Controller of trade marks is to be followed &mdash;to have a place of business in the State without being qualified?  I cannot see how this can be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> It seems to me that for persons to qualify in future, it would be necessary for section 86, subsection (3) (b) to read &ldquo;has a place of business or employment in the State&rdquo;.  Otherwise, it is difficult for them to become qualified and have a place of business, before they are qualified.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzpatrick said, the association of patent agents, which is a small body composed of experts in their own field, have a number of pertinent comments to put forward on this Bill.  Some, if not all, of them have probably found their way to the Minister. I remember, when we debated the Trade Marks Bill, Senator Fitzpatrick and I asked the Minister if he would be good enough to see a deputation from this body, and he did.  I think it was to everybody's benefit that he did so, between the Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill of such complexity and such technicality that we feel justified in asking the Minister if he would again receive a deputation from this body.  I have, however, learned during the tea interval that it was intended to take all Stages of this Bill tonight. With respect, Sir, I would have hoped that this was too serious and too complex a Bill to take all Stages tonight. Possibly we could take the Committee Stage tonight and if points of serious issue arise on the Committee Stage we might perhaps persuade the Minister and the House to see a deputation of these people between Committee and Report Stages.  We could then go on to Report Stage at another sitting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been assured by the Minister and by other speakers that this Bill is needed to bring our legislation on patents into line with that of other countries.  I am fully prepared to accept that assurance.  I am not really competent to deal with the measure which is very comprehensive indeed but there are two or three points to which I should like to refer.  I think they will probably be referred to in more detail on the Committee Stage but I should like to mention them now.  Two of these points have already been mentioned <Col N="1005" /> by Senator Ross.  The first is, again, section 42.  This section singles out food, medicines and medical, surgical and remedial devices for special treatment. Perhaps they are special, as he said, to a certain extent but I wonder if this section does not go a bit too far.  The words used are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...the Controller shall, on application made to him by any person interested, order the grant to the applicant of a licence under the patent on such terms as he thinks fit, unless it appears to him that there are good reasons for refusing the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no indication of what the reasons may be.  There is no mention of excess cost.  I think this gives the Controller too much power.  I am not saying or suggesting that it would be abused but I think, that a pharmaceutical industry wanting to establish a base in this country might look at this part of the Act with considerable suspicion.  I think, and I believe that the Minister may agree with me, that the pharmaceutical industry is at this time of special interest to this country. It happens to be an industry which does not need a lot of raw materials which we do not possess and which we would have to import.  It does not need heavy machinery.  However, it does need brains on the chemistry and pharmacological sides of the industry and such expert knowledge is made available by our universities.  It is, I think, a very good outlet for the experts we produce in our Universities. If we developed out pharmaceutical industry we could keep many of those people and the technicians needed to assist them employed in their own country instead of allowing them to emigrate.  This is an industry that already flourishes in at least three small countries.  Denmark, Holland and Switzerland have very successful pharmaceutical industries.  A number of these industries now show an interest in this country.  One very large concern, with headquarters in Copenhagen, has recently established a considerable factory here and there is evidence that this will continue.  I wonder if these people will be put off by this section.  I wonder if the Minister <Col N="1006" /> is not a bit worried about that. I should like to ask him, further, if this section goes farther than the corresponding sections of legislation in other countries.</P>
    <P>I have similar fears about section 92 which gives any Minister power to take over an invention.  It does neutralise the opening statement of the section which seems to put a Minister on the same plane as everybody else. Immediately afterwards, he is given powers which place him on quite a different plane.  I am thinking, in particular, for instance, of the Minister for Health.  Everybody is perturbed about the enormous amount of money spent on drugs in the National Health Service by practitioners and hospitals. I think we might find the Minister for Health tempted to try to cut these costs down by taking over the sale of the more expensive drugs and very often, unfortunately, these are the more effective drugs used in the treatment of patients.  I am not a little worried about this section also.  I think that the principle behind these two sections is surely satisfied by section 39.  I think that the interests of the public <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manufacturer who is exploiting a monopoly are protected by section 39 which gives the Controller the power to intervene if such monopoly is being exploited or abused.</P>
    <P>The last section to which I wish to refer is section 91 which makes it possible for an inventor to assign his patent to a Minister.  This a presumably in order to facilitate the further development of the invention.  There is always a difficult and a costly stage between the invention and the point at which it becomes available to the public.  In the past this has stood in the way of many good inventions ever bearing any fruit.  If an inventor assigns his patent to the Minister, it is within the Minister's power under this section to develop this invention.  I wonder, however, if this will make it necessary for a number of Government departments all to set up machinery for the development of inventions. Some of these departments, such as the Minister's Department, would be very well able to do this through contacts with industry: others would have <Col N="1007" /> far fewer facilities in this regard.  In England, this situation is met by having a central authority&mdash;The National Research Development Corporation, which has been set up by the Government and is Government financed and to which inventors may assign their patents.  This authority takes whatever steps are required to develop the patent and that is true whether the patent is one of importance to industry, to health or to other public interests.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we could not do something along the same lines in this country.  Perhaps the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, or some such body, would act as a common organisation with which the inventor could have preliminary discussions before deciding to assign his patent.  It is always open to an inventor to assign his patent to an industry. He makes the best bargain he can. However, some public spirited people might want to assign it to a central authority in the interests of the country.  In that case, it would be a good thing if they knew beforehand the authority with which they would have to deal.  I suggest that a central authority which all Government departments would recognise would be better than inventors having to deal with a number of Government departments about perhaps different inventions. I am not comptetent to say whether or not this Bill is really needed at this stage.  I respect Senator Ross's opinion about this but I daresay that if the Minister assures us that we must do something to bring our legislation into line with that of other countries, then something should be done.  Certainly this Bill at this early stage is very comprehensive and I am worried about sections 42 and 92.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A complaint which has been made&mdash;in so far as it is a complaint&mdash;by speakers on the Bill is that it is a good Bill, but that we are doing a bit more than was done in the past, and probably doing it too soon. Senator Fitzpatrick asked in particular if any other country has introduced legislation of this nature to conform <Col N="1008" /> with the Council of Europe Convention which was signed by us and by many other countries.  We signed the Council of Europe Convention because we saw in it articles that appealed to us and to our economic and industrial development, and not because we wanted to be good boys in the eyes of the Council of Europe and have our names on the list of signatories.</P>
      <P>I do not know what countries, or how many countries, have introduced legislation to ratify the Convention they have signed.  We are now introducing legislation to enable us to do so, again, not because we want to be called good boys, but because we feel that the legislation before the House is desirable and necessary in our present state of development.  I put it before the House because I think it is good legislation. If the Council of Europe Convention contained things with which we did not agree, we would not have signed it.  In any event, I do not think there is any special merit in waiting for other countries to pass legislation, and then passing legislation passed in other countries.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have engaged on a pattern of law reform, not because we wanted to be different, but because we wanted to have laws operative in this country suited to our conditions and suited to our people.  There is nothing wrong with that.  On the contrary, there is every merit in it.  There is nothing in this legislation which is inconsistent with our existing practice or with the practice in industrial and commercial property abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have more to say about those matters later on, but I want to take the points in sequence.  The next complaint made by Senator Fitzpatrick was that the representations made by the patent agents were, in the main, ignored.  He said that about 30 representations were made, but I think it would be more true to say that three times 30 specific representations or items were put forward for consideration.  The great majority of their recommendations were accepted and written into the Bill now before the House.  All their representations were seriously considered, and I can assure the Seanad that, <Col N="1009" /> where they were considered good, they were accepted.  All that, of course, was done at a very early stage.  No suggestion was made in the Dáil that there were any serious outstanding defects which the patent agents wanted redressed.  No suggestion was made that they wanted to see me personally, nor, so far as I know, has there been any such suggestion since.  So much for Senator Ross's request that the Bill be postponed in order to allow the patent agents to come before me.  On that point, I was given to understand that there was agreement on both sides of the House that all Stages of the Bill would be taken this evening.</P>
    <P>The next major point made was in connection with the definition of the word &ldquo;published&rdquo;, in other words, the concept of absolute novelty.  An invention is by its very nature a novelty.  In olden times inventions may have evolved in one country or another, without the knowledge of the people in that one country or the other.  In those times there were not the same means of communications that there are now.  Since travel and communications are now swift, as we all know, it is reasonable to assume that publication in a scientific document in a country perhaps thousands of miles away will very quickly and very readily be available in this country, and if there is reference in it to a novel device or invention, I do not think anyone in this country should claim that device as his own.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; is in line with current international practice and it is in accord with the principle of universal novelty required by the Council of Europe Convention.  Senator Fitzpatrick suggested that the conception of absolute novelty introduced in this Bill would prevent industries from being established here.  There is no evidence whatever in my Department or, indeed, anywhere we could seek that the conception of limited novelty contained in the existing law has added in the slightest to the establishment or development of industry.  Any industry that would be established on the basis of limited novelty would necessarily, in any event, be small and catering most likely for the Irish market only.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Senator Fitzpatrick criticised section 27 which deals with extension of term. The Bill was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil in order to meet one of the points made by the patent agents.  It is possible now&mdash;and it was not up to this&mdash;to bring before the Controller an application for an extension of the term of the patent.  I do not know what criticism there is of that provision.  I do not know whether Senator Fitzpatrick is aware that the case made in this respect by the patent agents was accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware it was amended to the extent of making it possible to put a case to the Controller but the objection is that under section 27 it is necessary to show, in order to bring oneself within the section, what profits have accrued from the patent not only in this country but throughout the entire world, and that is an impossible task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

Surely that implies that the applicant for the extension must establish in some way that the profits which should accrue to him have not so accrued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 42, Senator Fitzpatrick said it was new and Senator Ross rightly pointed out it in effect repeated section 55 of the 1927 Act.  Section 42 is the section which enables an applicant to come to the Controller and ask for a licence to use a patent in the case of food and drugs.  The Senator will agree that <Col N="1011" /> patents applying to food and drugs are of a very special nature as their purpose is to serve mankind generally in a special way.</P>
      <P>I accept that these patents, these formulae, are capable of causing very heavy expenditure on the part of the company or person developing them and that there should be a reasonable prospect for that company or person to recoup that expenditure and make a reasonable profit.  Section 42 is not only not new, to use a double negative, but there is an extension in it over section 55 of the 1927 Act in favour of drug manufacturers.  This relaxation makes it possible to grant patents for chemical substances as well as processes.  Hitherto, processes only were patentable.  However, there is a further point which was made to me since the Bill passed through the Dáil by pharmaceutical firms, some of them native, some of them from overseas to establish industries in this country.  I hope during Committee Stage to introduce an amendment further relaxing the section in favour of drug manufacturers.  That should answer the point made by Senator Ross, as well, but I may add that there is no essential difference between section 42 as we now have it and the corresponding section in British law.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt any of the Senators many of whom said they will deal in more detail with these matters on Committee Stage, and I suggest the Senator might refrain from this system of cross-examination. I was about to say that would apply&mdash; the amendment I propose to introduce at Committee Stage&mdash;to a point made by Senator Jessop as well.  Senator Ross made a number of other points, among which was the suggestion that we were throwing open our patent law, making it difficult for manufacturers to patent secret processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is so.  This Bill will make it difficult to patent processes which are not secret but this will in no way discourage industrialists <Col N="1012" /> who wish to come here to set up industries in the pharmaceutical industries. Senator Ross also made points in connection with the distinction as to qualification between patent agents and trademark agents.  In the case of the trademark agent, if he has a residence here and a place of business, he may, nevertheless, be an alien.  It may ultimately require amendment, not of the Patents Bill but of the trademark legislation.</P>
    <P>They were the main points made. One matter I neglected to deal with was a suggestion Senator Jessop made in reference to section 91 that a special agency might be set up in one of the Departments or in the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards to assist inventors in their inventions. There has not been any necessity up to now to set up such an agency.  As the House is aware, the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards has powers to assist inventors in the way the Senator desires.  These points can be dealt with more fully during Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make the point I wanted to make now.  In reply to the Second Stage debate the Minister said that there was really no virtue in introducing a Bill here if Bills had been introduced or passed in other countries solely for the purpose of bringing the law here into conformity with the law in other countries.  As I understand it the real purpose in bringing this Bill before the House was to bring the law into line with the Council of Europe Convention.  I asked <Col N="1014" /> the Minister on the Second Stage debate whether any other countries had brought in legislation to implement the Convention, and as a result of what he has said I am taking it that in fact we are the first.  It does not appear to be in our interests if we throw wide our patents law here.  If our definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; means published throughout the world and if the definition in Great Britain of &ldquo;published&rdquo; means published within Great Britain surely that is to our detriment. I suggest, therefore, that the bringing of this Bill into operation should be delayed until such time as other countries have implemented or ratified the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>What would happen if everyone waited for everyone else?  I can see no weight in the argument at all.  It would strike me very much as if we were signing a Convention and then sitting back and doing nothing. The fact that we have moved more quickly than others is possibly in our favour.  Perhaps they are sitting back waiting for us to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more to it than that, while I agree entirely with what Senator Sheldon has said.  The review of our law on industrial and commercial property started long before these conventions were signed, and the fact that we were able to conform with some of the articles of these conventions is to some extent coincidental with the fact that we wanted to conform to them.  We have already passed our trade mark legislation. They may or may not be in advance of the stage reached in other countries.  Apart from conforming to international conventions the purpose of this legislation is to suit our own conditions primarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of throwing our patents law wide open, on the contrary we are giving ourselves more protection in that if we take an example of a firm in Britain who having fastened on to some device or invention patented in some other country but not here could come in here and then try to exploit the device or invention in this country that would be to our detriment <Col N="1015" /> not only nationally but internationally. I do not think there is any question of throwing our law wide open.  On the contrary, we are bringing our law up to realistic modern requirements.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where this point arises of the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo;. The section says that it means &ldquo;made available to the public by the written or spoken word or by public use, or in any other way&rdquo;.  My understanding is that at the present time published means published within the State and that a person can apply for a patent for something that has been published so to speak in America, in China, in Japan or in Europe.  If the definition of published is allowed to remain as it is it means that a patent which is granted here can be revoked under section 34 merely because the thing is spoken of or has been spoken of in America.  I think that is unreasonable, and those who have considered this matter carefully think it is unreasonable and do not think it is in the interests of this country.  The definition of published in Great Britain at the present time means published within Great Britain.  I have made my point on this on the Second Stage and I do not want to prolong the discussion on it, but I would seriously suggest to the Minister that we are travelling too fast with this legislation. If there is all that benefit to be gained from it it is extraordinary that some of the highly industrialised countries have not moved in the matter.  I cannot help thinking that the Council of Europe Convention was prompted by the belief that some of those countries which approved of it then would be entering the Common Market much sooner than would now appear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Some countries that signed the Council of Europe Convention signed it because their law already generally complied with the articles of the Convention or they proposed to <Col N="1016" /> bring the law into alignment with the Convention.  The fact is that most of the highly industrialised countries already have these provisions in their law.  It would be ridiculous to continue this outmoded definition of published in this country whereby, to take what I will admit is an extreme example, if a firm patented something in, say, Newry and because it was not patented here, published in the 26 Counties, somebody in Dundalk could apply and could not be denied a patent under existing law.  That is ridiculous in modern circumstances.</P>

Perhaps the case of the fellow in Dundalk is one extreme, but there are other extremes too of publication whereby although made known abroad it could not be regarded as sufficient publication as to render an application for a patent in this country unacceptable.</P>

I know that each regulation made must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if it is annulled within usually 21 days that is the end of it.

That is the Journal that is published among a very limited circle, I am sure, by the Patents Office.  From my reading of subsection (3) I think that the rule or order will probably only be published after it has, in fact, become law.  At least there is no obligation on the Controller or the Minister to publish notice of his intention to make a rule or regulation.  I suppose I may be told that it must be laid before the Dáil and the Seanad and that in that way notice will be given.  As I said on the Second Stage, this is a very technical branch of the law and there are very few people capable of understanding it or taking any interest in it.</P>
      <P>I think it should be a condition precedent to making a rule or regulation that the intention to do so should be published in the Journal in order to give those who have the technical knowledge to do so an opportunity of considering the rule or regulation before it is made.  If it is only going to be brought to the notice of those concerned after it has been made, and after it has been brought before the Dáil and Seanad, and it becomes final, there will be no opportunity of making representations about it.</P>

      <P>The first answer to Senator Fitzpatrick's point is that this is the law already.  The definition has not been found to be unworkable in practice.  The second point is that it is the practice of the Controller to have discussions with the interested people before he drafts these orders for presentation to the Minister.  In fact, quite a number of discussions have taken place with the Patent Agents Association about the rules and regulations to be made under this Bill.  So, there will be no reason for not adopting a practice made for a number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see what point there would be in doing this.  The practice is that discussions take place <Col N="1018" /> prior to the drafting and the Controller tries to meet the legitimate wishes of the people immediately concerned. Anyway, the safeguard is there of having an order published in the Journal which, of course, is a specialised journal, and is available to the people interested in the branches of industrial and commercial property. In the final analysis, if the Controller wanted to recommend these regulations, without consulation with these people, he could do so.  If he notified them in the first instance it would not be of any great advantage to them.  I think the present practice is preferable and has, as I said, worked well over a long number of years.</P>

Even if this matter has been disclosed within the court over more than 50 years ago it is still taken into account.

      <P>I must admit this section is not too clear to me.  It is a section which provides that unless certain steps which it is necessary to take before the patent is registered are taken within the prescribed time, which is three months, the application becomes void.  I think that is the meaning of it but subsection (2) gives the Controller power to extend the time, provided the application for the extension is made before the time expires.  I think a general discretion should be given to the Controller, or even to the court, to extend the time even after it is expired in cases of exceptional hardship or difficulty. Such a discretion is vested in most of the courts in this country under the various rules of court and this seems a very harsh, and a very hard section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>The existing law lays down a period of three months in respect of which the Controller has discretion.  I might say, in passing, that the existing law has never given rise to any hardship.  There is no experience whatever of any applicant for a patent being in any way embarrassed by the terms of the existing law.  The law which is now being made will be an easing of the situation which, from past experience, does not require any easement.  In other words, it can be fixed by regulation and, if hardship arises in particular cases, the regulations can be altered.  I do not think, having regard to previous experience, that is likely to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section I stated I would mention again, when the Minister queried me in his reply. The part of this section, to which objection is taken, is subsection (5) which states:</P>
      <P>The Court or the Controller, in making decision, shall have regard to the nature and merits of the event in relation to the public, to the profits made by the patentee as such, and to all the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that it may be quite impossible to prove what profits have been made over a number of years and it is necessary, under this section, to show what profits have been made, not just alone from the commercial use of a patent in this country.  The Minister did say to me that this is a matter which has been raised by the Association of Patent Agents.  I do not want to get into any deep controversy with the Minister but I must say, in view of information at my disposal, and of a document in my possession, I am amazed to hear that practically all the representations made by the patent agents were acceded to.</P>

      <P>My information is that of all the points raised only one solitary one was acceded to and that is the point referred to in section 27 of giving the Controller power in certain circumstances.  My information is that in the opinion of the patent agents this Bill is much more objectionable having come from the Dáil than when it was introduced in the Dáil. I should like to make that point in order to clarify the position.  My information is that of all the submissions made before the Bill was introduced only one solitary minor recommendation has been adopted.  That is the provision for the extension of term of patent in section 27.  Every other recommendation has been completely <Col N="1021" /> rejected.  After its passage the Bill itself will be more objectionable than heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the objection is that a man must be reasonably rewarded for the result of his research. If this patent is used abroad it is used under licence, and a patentee is paid so much per article, or a fee, which, in fact, is returned for income tax purposes in this country.  Therefore, it would be a simple matter for him to return not only his profits in this country but his profits abroad.  The total amount of his profits must be a figure of total profits taken, not the profits in this country.  There are certain items which would be relatively small in this country and the real profits would come from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In extension of what Senator Nash has said, the establishment or ascertainment of these profits is a matter that ultimately may be decided by the court, so that nobody, such as the Controller, will be put in an arbitrary position in this respect.</P>
      <P>I return to the point made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  I think he has not been fully or properly briefed in this respect.  In particular, he hit on the truth of the situation himself in his last remark and that is, before this Bill was drafted the patent agents saw the Controller, put a number of points to him and, so far as they were acceptable, they were embodied in the Bill. When the Bill was ultimately introduced and circulated they came and made other points.  The fact that the Bill was printed in the form in which it was was an indication that some of the points made by the patent agents were not acceptable.  That is all it proves, and naturally they, having made points before the Bill was printed, came along and made the same points afterwards.  It is not fair to suggest that of all their recommendations made only one point was listened to.  I do not think it is quite fair for Senator Fitzpatrick to represent the matter in this way.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister, it is probably true that a number of recommendations were made verbally. Later on they were made in writing. The difficulty in which Senator Fitzpatrick and I find ourselves is that we got a copy of the memorandum which the registered patent agents sent to the Controller.  There are over 18 pages in it and this is probably the document to which Senator Fitzpatrick was referring.</P>
      <P>I may take it that at this stage, as indicated by the Minister earlier, no application was made by the patent agents to see him.  I think, in fairness to them, they felt that they were following the right procedure in seeing the Controller.  They thought the position would be the same as it was in the case of the Trade Marks Bill and that after the Bill passed through the Dáil and got to the Seanad they might again have an opportunity of seeing the Minister because he had been gracious enough to see them on the other Bill, with great benefit to all parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 34 I want to repeat the point I have already made.  This is the point which allows a patent to be revoked if it can be proved that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, is not new having regard to what was published before the priority date of the claim.  I made that point several times and I do not wish to delay the House now.  I think it is a good point but I think it is throwing the patents law wide open at this stage.  The Minister will probably not agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzpatrick on this.  It seems to <Col N="1023" /> be a case in which the patent law is thrown open rather wide.  It is not a question of registering a patent, but the revocation of a patent and, in effect, section 34 allows a patent to be revoked on the basis of knowledge which is not available to people here and is only available outside the country. This really is a case in which I should have thought that the words &ldquo;publication&rdquo; or &ldquo;where published&rdquo; should be followed by &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;. This is a different point from the one raised earlier on &ldquo;publication&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Senators mean by throwing our patents law wide open in this respect.  Is it not better in the interests of the public, and in particular in the interests of the public in our own country, that they should get the benefit of a patent that has been published somewhere, rather than that someone should establish a monopoly in this country in the use of this patent?  I do not follow what they mean by &ldquo;throwing it wide open&rdquo;.  As I said, the question of publication is one that must be established.  Publication can vary between perhaps the spoken words in a language unknown here and the written words in a fairly widely circulated brochure in another country.  It would be a matter for the court to decide what publication is between these two extremes. I think the court can be given that authority but with a reasonable degree of assurance on our part that it is exercised fairly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the Second Reading some Senators complained about section 42 as being possibly restrictive of the establishment of industries in this country by highly sophisticated pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is a repetition of section 55 of the 1927 Act with an extension in easement of drug manufacturers. Under the section as it stands, the Controller is given power to license the use of a patent by the person who applies to him.  In the ordinary course, the patent owner would be entitled to compensation by way of royalties and otherwise.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that if a manufacturer of drugs establishes an industry here and if, having established such an industry, he obtains some formula for use by the public and a person seeks a licence from the Controller for that formula or device then the Controller must have regard to the effect on the development of industry in the giving of that licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment meets an objection made to me by the pharmaceutical firms, native and non-native, about the effect of section 42 as it stood.  The Industrial Development Authority were also interested in it.  A number of these pharmaceutical firms have seen the Controller and I understand they will be satisfied with the terms of the amendment I now propose.  The Industrial Development Authority are satisfied, too, with this amendment. <Col N="1025" /> The section will in no way deter industrial development in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for myself, this amendment is certainly a big improvement on the section as it stands.  Representations were made to me about it by some of the interests mentioned by the Minister.  I did not know until today that this amendment would be introduced.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that it meets the objection which the Industrial Development Authority had to the section as it stands.  It is interesting to know that they had objection to it.  I am sure that if it meets their objection it is probably all right.</P>
      <P>I also accept without reservation the Minister's statement that he understands from the Controller that the other laboratories concerned are satisfied that the amendment meets the objectionable provision of this section. It is a vindication for taking Bills seriously in this House.  If we had only one Chamber and this had left the Dáil and was now signed by the President we know it would be to the detriment of the encouragement of industry in this country.  Not alone have some manufacturers been concerned about it but the very State-sponsored Industrial Development Authority, whose function it is to encourage industry here, had fears about it and rightly so.  Therefore, I would say that we should continue to take Bills seriously in this House.</P>

      <P>Still, I apologise.  I understood, when the Minister was replying on the Second Reading, that this amendment would answer my point on section 42.  However, I do not think it does so.  My point arose on section 42 (2) in relation to the settling of the terms of licences.  The subsection says that the Controller shall endeavour to secure that food, medicines, and medical, surgical and other remedial devices shall be available to the public at the lowest prices consistent with the patentees deriving a reasonable advantage from their patent rights.  As I pointed out on the Second Reading, the British Act of 1949, I think, makes specific reference to the fact that the Controller must allow to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention.</P>
      <P>It may be that in drafting the Bill the Minister had in mind that &ldquo;Reasonable advantage from their patent rights&rdquo; would cover this point, but research is so important a part of the development of patent medicines, and so expensive a part of their development, that some reference should be made in the subsection to research costs being taken into account in arriving at the terms of a licence. This is an extremely important point.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether this section affords adequate protection to the applicant or the registered proprietor of a patent.  I think it does but I object to the words in brackets.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>Where any discretionary power is by or under this Act given to the Controller, he shall not exercise that power adversely to the applicant for a patent or for amendment of a specification or the registered proprietor of a patent without (if so required within the prescribed time by the applicant or registered proprietor) giving the applicant or registered proprietor an opportunity of being heard.</P>
      <P>If that means what it says, the Controller must give notice to the applicant or the registered proprietor of a patent if he so requires.  The words in brackets are new.  The Minister may tell me they are not new but if they are not new they do not appear in the British Act.  This is pretty meaningless. It would be a better and a neater section without those words.  I do not know what they mean.  Do they mean that a person must say in his application: &ldquo;I wish to be notified of steps which you are taking which are adverse to my interest?&rdquo;  If he merely makes the application and says nothing about being notified, the Controller may notify him or he may not. I should like to hear the Minister's explanation, and I may have another word to say, or I may be satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the section means what it says.  While it may not be exactly on all fours with the wording of the British law, it has <Col N="1028" /> the same import and certainly is on exactly the same lines as our existing law.  The section gives an applicant for a patent, or a patentee, the right to be heard before the Controller makes any adverse exercise of the discretionary powers given to him by the Act.  This has worked well.  Since the words are reasonably clear to me, and apparently have been interpreted without any adverse effect on an applicant for a patent or a patentee.  I do not think there is any good reason why we should change them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The section really does not mean what it says, because if the words in brackets mean anything they mean that a person need not be notified unless he asks to be notified. If the words do not mean that, I should like to be told what they do mean.  The counterpart in the British Act reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to any provisions of this Act requiring the comptroller to hear any party to proceedings thereunder, or to give to any such party an opportunity to be heard, the comptroller shall give to any applicant for a patent, or for amendment of a specification, an opportunity to be heard before exercising adversely to the applicant any discretion vested in the comptroller by or under this Act.</P>
      <P>Anybody who can read or write English knows what that means.  It is as simple as ABC.  Perhaps the section in the Bill means the same thing but it is a bit muddy.  We have followed the British Act in certain respects and I think that very clear section of theirs would be much preferable to ours.  I would ask the Minister again to explain what the words in brackets mean.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that, in practice, the person is always notified that the Controller is about to exercise his discretion and that the person affected is told of his rights and that he will be heard if he so requests. The section as it appears is, as I have said, the section that has been in force for upwards of 35 years.  If it has worked well in practice, I do not see why we should change it now.</P>

      <P>Sometimes it is hard to keep one's patience when one is told by this or that Minister: &ldquo;That may look objectionable but it will not work that way because there will be a reasonable approach by the Controller or there will be a reasonable approach by somebody else&rdquo;.  Why give him the machinery, if that is so?  I shall not crossexamine the Minister and I do not wish to appear offensive to him, but it is quite obvious to me that he agrees the words in brackets mean that a person must demand notice, and that, if he does not demand notice, he may not get notice.  In the section in the British Act dealing with the same topic, it is as clear as ABC.  A child going to school would know his rights and would not be prejudiced.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice often gives similar replies.  He says: &ldquo;That is possible under the section but in practice it will never happen&rdquo;.  It could happen in the future.  You could get an unreasonable Controller who might stand on his rights, who might become difficult, who might say: &ldquo;If this man has not asked me to notify him, I shall not do so&rdquo;.  When dealing with legislation, it is up to us to make it as clear, as simple and as unambiguous as possible.  I hold section 71 in my right hand and give you its equivalent in British law in my left hand and I ask any fairminded person in the House to say which is the clearer, which is preferable, which is the more ambiguous.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Fitzpatrick for not losing his temper.  I am reasonably even-tempered myself, but if tempers are to be lost, we can all have a go.  I can only repeat that this has worked in practice. I may add that if the Controller <Col N="1030" /> acts unreasonably, there is an appeal to the courts so that no concession or right is lost, that is, if there is a cantankerous Controller who might interpret the law unreasonably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be dealing with that matter on another section. By all means, you can go to the High Court or the Supreme Court, but you cannot get costs against the Controller. You go there at your own expense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides that you can get the best of the Controller in the High Court, but at your own expense.  The section says:</P>
      <P>In all proceedings before the Court under this or any other enactment the Controller shall neither be awarded nor ordered to pay costs.</P>
      <P>I know that cuts both ways.  If you go to the High Court and you lose, you could be ordered to pay the Controller's costs, but if you meet a difficult Controller, as the Minister told me on the last section I queried, you can march him up to the High Court and get him, but entirely at your own expense, notwithstanding the fact that the court may think the Controller was absolutely unreasonable.  It may be this is taken from some other Act, that it is not new, but surely we are here to improve on things as we go along, and if we find things in a previous Act that we do not agree with, now is the time to put them right. People will not go lightly to the courts and will not bring the Controller to the High Court, unless they are advised on fairly good legal authority that they will succeed.  I do not know whether there is an appeal to the Supreme Court from this or not.  I believe there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person might go to the Supreme <Col N="1031" /> Court, might win there, and probably will if he is advised by somebody specialised in this field.  If he goes there, he cannot be awarded costs. There should be something written into this section giving the court, even in exceptional circumstances, discretion in regard to costs.  I think such a provision as that would protect the public against an unreasonable Controller and would, in turn, protect the Controller against an unreasonable member of the public.  I am prepared to go so far.  I feel pretty strongly about this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick has said we should improve things as we go along.  That is what we are doing here.  Under the existing Act, the costs of the Controller were at the discretion of the court but it contained the counter-provision that the Controller could not be ordered to pay the costs of any other party.  Now we are saying the Controller cannot get costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>I raised a point on this section on Second Reading.  I do not know how a person who wants to be a patent agent can have a place of business in the State before he is a patent agent.  It seems to me that is what subsection (3) requires.  That is why I should like to have inserted here words such as &ldquo;has a place of business or employment in the State&rdquo;.  I am informed that where the phrase &ldquo;has a place of business in the State&rdquo; appears in the Trade Marks Act it is interpreted by the Controller of Trade Marks as meaning that the person owns a place of business.  If that <Col N="1032" /> interpretation is to be followed you could not possibly get any new person appointed as a patent agent.  Would the Minister accept the words &ldquo;his place of business or employment&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely support Senator Ross on this suggested amendment. I understand that the interpretation of section 3 (b) as it appears in the Trade Marks Act is that the person must have a place of business of his own in the State.  I agree that this is an unreasonable interpretation but it could be put beyond doubt by saying &ldquo;his place of business or employment in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this provision which is in the existing law has not given rise to any difficulty of the nature suggested by the Senators and that a person who is about to set up as a patent agent and having the necessary qualifications is given his licence or whatever is given to him to enable him to practise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the interpretation is that the person must be in business and have a place of business of his own in the State.  It is not enough if he has a place of business in his employer's office.  That, I think, is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat that the section is already in our law and has given rise to no difficulty in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not have given rise to any difficulty on the question of patents but we are told very clearly that it has given rise to difficulty in trade marks, and if it has in trade marks surely the same wording is likely to cause the same difficulty when it comes to patents?  The reason that it has not given difficulty in patents is that it has not arisen, but when it arises then it will be too late if the Bill remains as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the interpretation of &ldquo;place of business&rdquo; is not necessarily a place of business of his own.  If he has the requisite qualifications the interpretation could be applied to practice in his employer's <Col N="1033" /> place of business and he is given his licence without difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister that the two things seem the same but I understand that the powers that be take a different view and that the Controller takes a different view.  The Minister should not have any control over the Controller, but if the Minister could put in those two words even now surely it cannot take away from the section and it will put it beyond doubt and leave everybody happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some reasons I believe why the words of the section should not be interfered with, and I am advised that it is better to leave them as they are because if a person is ambitious of becoming a patent agent then he has to take certain steps to conform with the requirements of the section and when he has taken those steps to ensure that he is genuine in his intention of becoming a patent agent, he is confirmed when he complies with the law.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister is the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards competent to accept an assignment of a patent in circumstances such as under this section, and if it is could it somehow be incorporated in the section as well as those various Ministers who may accept an assignment from an inventor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If a patent is assigned to a Minister I understand that he can employ any of his agencies, and I do not think there is any doubt about the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards accepting such an assignment on behalf of the Minister, as the Senator knows.  As I mentioned in reply to the Second Reading, the Institute has certain powers to assist inventors or people who hope to become patent holders and I believe <Col N="1034" /> it will be possible for the Institute to accept such an assignment in the name of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not feel that the Institute should be entered in this section as a body recognised for this particular purpose? I am thinking of the position of an inventor.  If I were an inventor and wanted to assign my invention to a body for the purpose of developing it in the interests of the State, I would like to be able to go to that person, to this or that authority, to discuss the conditions of development of this invention and reach a certain stage of agreement before the actual assignment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The point I want to make in reply to the Senator's argument is that there are other Ministries. The Minister for Agriculture, for example, has specialised organisations under his control.  Take the Agricultural Institute.  They have certain facilities whereby they can undertake developments for the benefit of agriculture. The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have certain facilities too and, what is more, they have the power to spend money on the development of inventions.  Therefore, I think there would be no point in singling out the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in this section because there are so many other agencies that a number of Ministers could employ for this purpose.  I do not think there is any necessity for specifically mentioning the Institute. I am satisfied that it can do all that is necessary in connection with the development of a patent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister insert in this section, possibly after subsection 5, an amendment similar to the one he has already so well incorporated in section 42?  Subsection 5 would then read: &ldquo;The right to use an invention for the service of the State under the provisions of this section shall include the power to sell any articles made in pursuance of such right which are no longer required for the service of the State and shall only be exercised having regard to the desirability of encouraging inventions and inventors in the growth and development of industry&rdquo;, etc.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, would be undesirable in that it would tie the Minister's hands.  I may say that this right has never been exercised within the State but it is important that it should be there and at the Minister's discretion to use it.  The Minister is there as a representative of the people in a particular Department and I think there are sufficient restrictions on his activities.  He is exposed to all kinds of questions so that he can render an account of everything he does and the names of the people within his power. It would be wrong to tie the Minister as the Senator has suggested.</P>

      <P>At this stage I should like to say that I was not aware of any arrangement on this side of the House and I do not feel I was in any way bound by it.  This Bill is a Bill of great importance, as I said on Second Stage.  In this House we could have made some amendments to it.  We have debated it for about four hours today in one way or another and we have not added anything to it.  We may have clarified our minds on a number of points but this House did nothing except agree to the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to which this House could have added something, if we had taken the Bill in rather slower stages. I must express my disappointment that the Bill has been rushed through the House in this way.  I am not in any way trying to blame the Minister because the Minister, as I appreciate, came in on the understanding that no points would be raised or amendments made.  At the same time it is a Bill of such importance that we should not have rushed it through in this way. I feel the House is not being properly used in the way it should be in rushing through a Bill of this sort.  This is a Bill which should have been considered on Second Stage and possibly in Committee with a pause between the two Stages.  We could have clarified our minds on a number of points and then brought forward a number of amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>At this stage, I want to support what Senator Ross has said. I would strongly urge, in seeking to make better use of this House, that the most effective way to do so is to have Bills of this type initiated here.  The House has not been sitting for a number of weeks and we are now faced in the next couple of weeks with quite an <Col N="1037" /> impressive list of legislation which will have to be put through before the summer recess.  I strongly urge on the Government, through the Minister, that far better use could be made of the House if Bills of this type were initiated here, with great advantage to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister may have been disappointed at the length of the debate on the Bill this evening.  There was an understanding between Senator Hayes and the Leader of the House that all Stages would be given this evening.  As I said earlier that arrangement did not mean there would not be a discussion on the Bill and I am perfectly satisfied that neither the Minister nor the Leader of the House would expect the Seanad to pass a Bill like this without a discussion.</P>
      <P>I think while we had, in one way, a short debate it was a useful one.  I think the debate we had this evening goes to show that some people in the Seanad are prepared to go through highly technical Bills like this and discuss them even though in their private lives they might never be asked to have anything to do with matters of this sort.  I thoroughly agree with Senator Crowley that the proper way of dealing with a matter like this is to introduce the Bill in this House and spend several days over it, taking it gently.  There seems to be a feeling abroad that, when a Bill comes to the Seanad, it should fly right through it and should be regarded as a matter of urgency.  That is bad for the Seanad and it is bad for the Oireachtas.  I honestly believe it is bad for the Bills and bad for legislation generally.  We all should resign ourselves to taking Bills seriously here and dealing with them fully.</P>

There are not many people in this House who are capable of discussing a Bill of this sort but Senator Ross and others have shown they are quite competent to speak on it.  We should not have to rush Bills through the House.  This has happened before.  I <Col N="1038" /> am not concerned now because I had not anything to say on the Bill.  I am not putting all the blame on one side of the House.  The Bill was rushed through by agreement.  The same thing happened in other years when people who could speak with authority and probably sincerely improve the Bills have been unable to do so because the Bills were put through at this time of the year in rather a hurried fashion. I agree with Senator Ross.  He was trying to improve the Bill and he was not afforded a reasonable opportunity of considering the matter.</P>

I should like to go back to Senator Ross's opening speech when he said this matter now represents the last piece of legislation to bring industrial and commercial law up to date.  There is one outstanding matter to be dealt with and that is industrial designs.  That is being considered at the moment and I will have to come to this House again with another Bill.  If arrangements were made to finish at this hour I was not a party to them.  I did not want to shorten the debate in order to finish today.  I do not object to what Senators said.</P>
