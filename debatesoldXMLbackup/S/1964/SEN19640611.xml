    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1) (a), lines 29 to 31, to delete &ldquo;served notice of his intention to do so on the accused or the Attorney General, as the case may be,&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;notified the accused or the Attorney General, as the case may be, of the application,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it unnecessary to have notice of the intention to apply for a transfer of trial formally served on the Attorney General or on the accused, as the case may be, by the means prescribed in the Circuit Court Rules, that is to say, by personal service, or by delivery at the residence or place of business of the person concerned, or by sending the notice by prepaid post addressed to the person at his last known residence or place of business. It will be sufficient for the Attorney General or the accused to be notified by any means of communication whatever.  Such informality is desirable from the point of view of the accused, who may be in custody and not legally represented.</P>

      <P>There is a lot to be said for this amendment.  The section as it stood visualises a formal notice that would be served I suppose by post or by personal service.  On the <Col N="1040" /> other hand, the amendment substitutes any sort of notification.  I suppose it is possible that there could be a misunderstanding about that but in the event of such a misunderstanding the accused would get the benefit.</P>

      <P>This is another practical matter.  Senators will be aware that this subsection deals with the mode of proving service by registered post.  It provides specifically that the statutory declaration shall include a statement that the envelope has not been returned undelivered to the sender.  To allow time for the return of the envelope to the sender if undelivered, it is provided that the statutory declaration shall not be made until 7 days at least after the posting of the envelope.  We are now advised by the Post Office authorities that, in exceptional circumstances and particularly if the name and address of the sender do not appear on the envelope, the return may take up to 10 days. The amendment proposed is necessary to cover this eventuality.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the extension of compulsory <Col N="1042" /> registration of title to all land in the State.  Provision is also made for various alterations in registration procedure and practice, and for the consolidation, with suitable amendments, of the existing law dealing with the subject.  To assist Senators in their examination of the proposals a detailed explanatory memorandum has been issued with the Bill and, in addition, the Bill itself includes brief side notes indicating the provisions which are new to the law and the existing statutory enactments which are being consolidated.</P>
      <P>Registration of title is a system of State registration of ownership of land. It provides a permanent record of title which is guaranteed by the State and can be relied upon by a purchaser with absolute safety.  All relevant particulars concerning the ownership of registered land are entered on registers maintained in the Land Registry.  In conjunction with the registers there are maintained registry maps on which plans are drawn of the parcels of land of which the ownership is registered. The identity of any registered land is established from the particulars in the register and the plan on the relevant registry map.  The big advantage of registration is that it dispenses with the need for a separate, exhaustive investigation of title by private individuals on the occasion of every dealing for value. This repeated investigation of title in the case of unregistered land is wasteful of time and energy and involves inconvenience and expense for the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>Registration of title is in operation in many European countries including Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Hungary, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, most of Canada and many of the States of the American Union. The system is in course of being extended throughout England and Wales and its introduction in Scotland was recommended last year by the Reid Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system has been operating in this country since 1892.  It was introduced for the purpose of providing a cheap, simple and effective system of recording transactions in land bought out under the Land Purchase Acts. <Col N="1043" /> Land acquired in this way was made compulsorily registrable under the Registration of Title Act, 1891, and it is estimated that approximately 80 per cent of all land in the country&mdash; chiefly rural land&mdash;is now registered. The superiority of the system for all purposes is such that I am satisfied that its extension to all land in the State is fully warranted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, experience both here and in Britain shows that a system of voluntary registration will not succeed and that the only way in which registration of title can be extended to all land is by compulsion.  Provision is, therefore, made in Part III of the Bill for the gradual extension of compulsory registration to all land. The property affected by this proposal will, in the main, be that comprised in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The principal new machinery for the extension of compulsory registration is contained in sections 24 and 25 of the Bill.  Section 24 provides that the Minister for Justice may make orders applying compulsory registration to individual counties or county boroughs or parts thereof.  In an area in respect of which such an order is in force, registration will be compulsory on the occasion of any conveyance on sale of freehold land or grant or assignment on sale of a leasehold interest.</P>
    <P>To ensure ample warning for all who may be affected, the operative date for an order will have to be not earlier than six months after the making of the order.  Section 25 provides the sanction for the enforcement of compulsory registration.  The effect of the section will be that, in any case in which registration becomes compulsory, a conveyance on sale or grant or assignment on sale will not vest the estate or interest purported to be conveyed, granted or assigned unless, within three months, the purchaser becomes registered as owner.  This period may be extended by the Registrar or the court where circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>One advantage of introducing compulsory registration following a sale is that the title to the land will have been examined by the purchaser's <Col N="1044" /> solicitor and the documents of title will be available.  The investigation of the title by the Land Registry will thereby be greatly facilitated.  Another advantage is that applications for first registration will be kept to manageable proportions.  Quite obviously, the rate at which compulsory registration can be extended will be limited by the capacity of the Land Registry to handle new registrations and it will be necessary to proceed cautiously in the initial stages so as not to overburden the system.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 23 of the Bill for compulsory registration of all land acquired after the commencement of the proposed Act by Government Departments, State-sponsored bodies and local authorities.  This provision will apply irrespective of whether the land is situated in a compulsory registration area.  I consider that it is only fitting that public bodies should set a headline for private landowners by helping to extend the system of registration of title as rapidly as possible to all land in the State.</P>
    <P>Existing procedure for the voluntary registration of urban property provides only for registration of ownership with an absolute, or good, title.  While it may be anticipated that, in the majority of cases of first registration under the new compulsory provisions, the owners will be able to show a good title to their property, it is inevitable that some doubtful or defective titles will occur, the registration of which with an absolute title would prove difficult and troublesome.</P>
    <P>To enable titles of this kind to be registered in compulsory areas without undue difficulty or delay, it will be necessary to amend existing registration procedure so as to provide for the registration of ownership with qualified or possessory titles.  Suitable provisions to this effect are contained in sections 33 and 40 of the Bill, which relate, respectively, to freehold land and leasehold interests.  These provisions will enable a qualified title to be given where it appears to the Registrar that the title can be established only for a limited period or subject to certain reservations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> Where neither an absolute nor a qualified title can be given the Registrar will be able to give a possessory title on the basis of such evidence as may be prescribed.  As the name implies, a possessory title will be dependent upon actual occupation of the land or upon receipt of the rents and profits issuing out of the land, and not necessarily upon a documentary title. Registration with a possessory title will not prejudice the enforcement of any rights subsisting or capable of arising at the time of registration and, that being so, a purchaser will have to investigate the title prior to registration in the same manner as if the land were unregistered.</P>
    <P>Registration with a qualified title will not prejudice the enforcement of rights specifically noted on the register as excepted from the effects of registration.  In the case of leasehold land it is proposed that registration may also be effected with a good leasehold title.  This would be appropriate where the title of the lessee to the leasehold, as distinct from the title of the lessor to the freehold, is sound and can be approved by the Registrar. The precise effect of registration with each class of title is indicated in sections 37 to 39 and 44 to 47.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the aim that, in due course, all titles on the registers should be absolute ones, and machinery is, therefore, provided in section 50 for the conversion of qualified and possessory titles into absolute or good leasehold titles and for the conversion of good leasehold titles into absolute titles.  The process of conversion may be carried out either in consequence of the production of additional evidence as to the title, or as a result of the lapse of time, or both.  The Registrar is to be given a general power to convert where he is satisfied as to the title.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the case of urban land registered with a possessory title, there will, after fifteen years, be automatic conversion of the title on the registration of a transfer or other disposition for value.  The period of fifteen years is selected as an adequate and appropriate period within which <Col N="1046" /> third parties may substantiate claims or by the expiration of which defects in title may be deemed to be cured. By comparison, the ordinary limitation period for actions to recover land is twelve years.</P>
    <P>In the case of land bought out under the Land Purchase Acts, that is to say, most rural land, special arrangements are provided in section 50 to expedite the elimination from the registers of the notices of equities to which the bulk of such land is subject.  I should explain that land bought out under the Land Purchase Acts is registered subject to equities because, owing to the large number of transactions under those Acts, the Land Commission could not examine the title of a purchaser to his previous tenant interest in the land.</P>
    <P>Instead, the fee simple vested in him by the Commission was deemed to be a graft on his previous interest and he was registered &ldquo;subject to equities&rdquo;, that is to say, subject to the rights of any other persons having claims against this previous interest.  Existing law provides for the cancellation of the notice of equities on application by the registered owner, but the number of cancellations effected annually is relatively small and it is estimated that about three-quarters of all existing registered holdings are still subject to equities.  Indeed, this is one of the main shortcomings in our present system of registration of title, as the existence of the notice of equities throws on persons dealing with the registered owner the onus of investigating the title prior to first registration.</P>
    <P>I consider it essential for the satisfactory operation of the system that equities should be cleared from the registers as quickly as possible. Accordingly, subsection (3) of section 50 of the Bill provides for the cancellation of equities at the discretion of the Registrar, in two types of cases: firstly, on the occasion of any change of ownership or the creation of any charge where the land has been registered for more than thirty years; and, secondly, on the occasion of a transfer or charge for value where there has been a previous registered transfer <Col N="1047" /> for value more than twelve years before.</P>
    <P>In the first case the period of thirty years is selected because it is the maximum limitation period of actions to recover land, being the period applicable in the case of disability.  The second type of case is so devised as to ensure that the title will have undergone two careful and independent scrutinies, separated by a period adequate, in the ordinary course, to cure any latent defects.  It is envisaged that, under these proposals, cancellation of the equity notice will be virtually automatic in the great majority of cases, while, at the same time, the Registrar will have discretion to leave the notice undischarged in the exceptional case where it appears to him that cancellation would cause injustice to a third party.</P>
    <P>In addition to establishing machinery for the extension of compulsory registration, Part III of the Bill provides for various amendments of the law relating to registration.  The object of these amendments is to cure defects, which, over the years, have manifested themselves in the existing law and generally to improve the system of registration of title so as to enable it to cope with the conditions expected to be encountered in registering urban property.  The proposed amendments, are, for the most part, technical in character and do not involve any subsantial matters of principle.  I propose, therefore, to refer very briefly only to a few of the more important ones.</P>
    <P>Section 49 relates to the acquisition of registered land by adverse possession against the registered owner.  It provides that the Statute of Limitations shall in future apply to registered land in the same way as to unregistered land and that the Registrar shall have power to register a squatter as owner without a court order declaring his title.  I consider that there is no good reason why persons who have acquired a title to registered land by adverse possession should be forced to incur the trouble and expense of applying to the court for an order declaring their title.  Under existing law, cases <Col N="1048" /> based on adverse possession are regularly dealt with and decided by the Registrar on applications for first registration and for the discharge of equities and where the personal representative of a deceased registered owner claims to have acquired by possession the shares of the other next-of-kin. In all these cases the possession on which the claim to title is based is adverse to an unregistered interest in land so that the Statute of Limitations applies in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of section 61 proposes to relieve the Registrar of the responsibility of ensuring that the personal representatives of a deceased registered owner are acting correctly and within their powers under an assent or transfer.  At present, on the production of an assent or transfer from the personal representative it is the practice of the Registrar to examine the will of the deceased in order to satisfy himself that its terms are being properly interpreted and implemented. If the owner died intestate the Registrar similarly satisfies himself that the rules of intestate succession are being observed.  I consider that it is not appropriate that the Registrar should have any responsibility for ensuring that the personal representatives are acting correctly in such cases.  His position <i>vis-á-vis</i> personal representatives should be the same as that of a purchaser. A purchaser from personal representatives is not concerned with the terms of the will of the deceased or the observance of the rules of intestate succession but is entitled to assume that the personal representatives are acting correctly in selling the property of the deceased.  It is no part of the duty of the Registrar to supervise the administration of estates; and if a disposition of registered land is made which is not in accordance with the terms of the will or the rules of intestacy, the responsibility must be solely that of the personal representatives.</P>
    <P>Section 81 provides that a right of residence in or on registered land, whether a general right of residence on the land or an exclusive right of residence in or on part of the land, shall <Col N="1049" /> be deemed to be personal.  This provision is designed to cure the anomalous situation resulting from a majority decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the <i>National Bank v.Keegan</i> [1931] I.R. 344, in which it was held that an exclusive right of residence, such as a right to the exclusive use of a particular room or rooms in a dwelling house, conveyed an equitable life estate in the property, entitling the grantee, for example, to let the rooms to strangers.  In the vast majority of cases this would be quite contrary to the intentions of the parties.</P>
    <P>The accuracy of registered titles will continue to be guaranteed by the State.  Thus section 120 of the Bill provides for the payment of compensation by the State in respect of loss incurred by registered owners and others as a result of official errors in registration.  Paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of this section is a new provision and provides that a person who suffers loss by reason of the inaccuracy of any office copies of a register or registry map, or of documents or plans filed in the Land Registry, shall also be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the devolution of registered land on the death of the registered owner and the rules of beneficial succession to such land where the registered owner dies intestate. The provisions of this part are mainly for the purpose of consolidation. In relation to succession of intestacy, however, an important change is proposed in section 111 which provides that all registered land shall be distributed as if it were personalty. This will chiefly affect freehold land in urban areas when it becomes registered under new compulsory provisions. Instead of, as at present, descending as realty to the heir-at-law, it will, under the new proposal, be distributed amongst the next-of-kin.  Existing compulsorily registered land is already distributed in this manner.  I hope during the present session of the Oireachtas to introduce a comprehensive new Succession Bill which will provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the complete assimilation of the law respecting real and personal property, so that all realty, whether <Col N="1050" /> registered or unregistered, will be distributed as personalty.  In the meantime, I am proposing that the change should be effected under this Bill as respects all registered land.</P>
    <P>To enable the Land Registry to cope with the additional work that will arise as a result of the extension of compulsory registration, I am making arrangements to augment the existing staff&mdash;legal, mapping and clerical&mdash;in the central office and to provide additional accommodation.  In the past, transactions in the Land Registry have, unfortunately, tended to be subject to delays, but I must emphasise that this has been due to shortage of staff and other administrative factors and not to any defect in the system of registration of title.  The situation is now being remedied and I can assure the House that I intend to see to it that the organisation of the Registry will in future be maintained at maximum operating efficiency.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the cost of operating the Land Registry is at present recoverable in the form of registration fees, and the net charge on public funds is not significant.  The existing policy of, so far as possible, fixing Land Registry fees at such a level as to make the Registry self-supporting will be continued under the new legislation.  This is provided for in section 14 of the Bill. It is sometimes suggested that the fees are unreasonable and excessive.  This criticism is in my opinion completely unfounded, as the following example chosen at random will serve to show. In the case of a typical suburban dwelling house, the market value of which is, say, £3,000 and in respect of which the poor law valuation is, let us suppose, £30, the fee on first registration in the Land Registry would be £4 5s.  On a subsequent registered transfer on sale, the fee would be £12 6s.  I think most Senators will agree that by no stretch of the imagination can either of these fees be said to be excessive, either in relation to the value of the property or having regard to the advantages accruing to the parties from the registration of the title.  It should be remembered, also, that registration fees constitute only one of the items going to make up the <Col N="1051" /> costs and outlay involved in the transfer of property and that, when account is taken of legal fees, the total cost of transferring registered property&mdash; assuming the title to be an absolute or good one&mdash;is appreciably lower than in the case of unregistered property. In the case of the house mentioned in the example which I have already given, the total costs involved in the transfer on sale, that is to say, the combined costs of the vendor and purchaser, would be of the order of £202 if the property were registered, as compared with £266 if unregistered.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if the legislative proposals embodied in this Bill are adopted they will constitute a far-reaching and valuable reform.  Land is vital to the needs of society and to the economic activity of the nation.  It is essential, therefore, that titles to land should be clear and certain and that land should be capable of being transferred in a cheap, simple and secure manner.  What this Bill proposes to do is to extend to the whole country the system which has proved itself superior for all these purposes, namely, registration of title.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in many respects, a technical and difficult one and, for that reason, any detailed discussion of the measure would, perhaps, be more appropriate to Committee Stage.  When we reach that Stage, I shall, of course, endeavour to furnish any additional information or assistance which Senators may need to enable them to examine and assess the various provisions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's closing words that this is essentially a Committee Bill, highly technical and difficult and requiring the closest scrutiny.  As far as it is a codifying and consolidating measure, it must have our full and active support. Such dealings with legislative proposals make it easy not alone for the people affected but for those who administer it and interpret it as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus far so good.  I am not satisfied, however, with the principle introduced <Col N="1052" /> into this Bill by which the Registrar of Titles is given the power to declare a possessory title or register a squatter on the mere submission of a document through the post from an office in any part of the country to his office.  I am not suggesting by that that the Registrar would not do a perfectly good job, but justice must not alone be done but must be seen to be done.  The land in this country is not alone vital to society, as the Minister says, but is very much bound up with our history. The people are closely associated with their land and love it.  Any effort to make a dealing with land of that kind that interferes with somebody's property is something that should not be done lightly or even attempted.</P>
    <P>While it may be said it was cumbersome to go to the court, as we did under section 52 of the old Act, nevertheless the notice headed &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; and the fact that documents were served on the proper contesting parties meant people were put on notice that the dealing with the land was transacted in open court, and adjudicated on by a judge who had the assistance of counsel and solicitors. Very often in the course of such a hearing something transpired that was not thought of by counsel and solicitors, or even by the judge.  As the thing worked, justice was effectively done. I object to its being done, as it were, behind closed doors.  I do not attach any sinister significance to that; it is just a question of its being done privately.</P>
    <P>This is a very substantial dealing in land.  Any dealing in land, or any interference with the title of another, whether he has it in law or not, is a grave inroad into the person's fortune and property.  I would strongly urge the Minister&mdash;perhaps he has done so already; in fact I am sure he has&mdash; to consider further the constitutionality of this measure in respect of allowing somebody, who is not a judge, appointed as judges ought to be appointed, to perform a judicial act. This is nothing of mere limited application; this is something which goes to the very root of people's livelihood.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it should be further investigated.  I shall come <Col N="1053" /> back to it again on Committee Stage and I hope to produce authority to the Minister to support that, or at least to convince him that this proposed alteration in the practice is a violation of the constitutional rights of citizens. This has been said, of course, about other measures and it has been ignored, but later when the measures were challenged in the courts, it was often found there was something unconstitutional in them.  Here is the place to put it right if there is any constitutional interference and it should not be impossible to find agreement in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rest of the Bill, I think the provisions of Part IV regarding the devolution on death and descent on intestacy contain no very sweeping change.  Of course, when it becomes known, this will have the effect that there will be less intestacy and more wills.  People will arrange the distribution of their property in such a way that they can appoint the person who is to get their property and see that justice is done.  You could have the case of freehold land on a sizeable farm which was destined by a man for a certain son, one of three, let us say, the other two sons not having been any great help.  In fact they had dissipated whatever they got and had possibly gone away.  If that man had died without making a will, before this Act, his freehold land went to the eldest son.  Now the free holding, once it is registered, will be divided amongst the good and the no-goods. That is something we should not do lightly, either.  It can be got over by the making of a will, of course, but not all people do that.  Sometimes hardship results by reason of this but I know we cannot legislate for isolated cases.</P>
    <P>This is essentially a Committee Stage Bill and we will have to come back and examine it very minutely.  As I said at the beginning, and as the Minister said, it is a reform, and any time the word reform is used, it means that very fundamental changes are being brought about.  There is certainly a big change here in this interference with title, in that it is done quietly instead of in open court.  I want to <Col N="1054" /> repeat also that I am doubtful as to the constitutionality of the provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we spent some hours dealing with the Patents Bill which turned out to be a highly technical piece of legislation.  Today we are presented with the Registration of Title Bill, another highly technical measure.  The difference between the two is that the measure we dealt with yesterday concerned very few professional people and did not directly concern many citizens, while the Bill we are dealing with today is one which will affect the daily lives of the legal profession, all the members of it, and indeed of every citizen, or the great majority of the citizens at one time or another.</P>
      <P>It is a highly technical measure which is replacing a measure introduced in 1891 and amended only once since.  It is a great pity the Minister did not see fit to follow the good example of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the Companies Bill and refer this Bill to a Select Committee of both Houses.  I am sure it has had the very careful attention of the officers of his Department and that they have produced the best measure possible from their experience.  However, I feel that if the measure had been referred to a Select Committee consisting of professional people and some lay people, we would have got the opinion of a cross-section of the people concerned and would have had a much better measure. Having said that, I must say I agree with the Bill in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two objectives in the Bill: the first is to consolidate and bring up to date the law relating to the registration of title which was first enacted, as I said, in 1891, and the second, to make registration compulsory.  Since 1891, we have had a limited form of registration confined in its compulsory effect to land purchased or bought out under the Land Acts.  As I say, that was limited in its scope because it was compulsory to discharge equities and the Land Registry map was conclusive. Therefore, looking at it solely on the basis of title, you could not find (a) that the title was perfect in all cases <Col N="1055" /> and (b) that the boundaries were accurate.</P>
    <P>This measure proposes, and I am glad it does, to encourage the discharge of equities, and it gives the Registrar power to discharge equities on a transfer or a sale where the land has been registered for more than 30 years or where the sale has taken place over 12 years since registration.  I agree with that.  It simplifies the investigation of title and reduces cost.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anywhere in the Bill any provision for certifying the boundaries and putting a note on the folio that the boundaries are conclusive. I know that there is power given where land has been purchased from the State or from the Land Commission or the old Landed Estates Court, and also that there is another section in the Bill that where a farm is subdivided the boundaries can be certified as between the part sold and the part retained, but I cannot see any provision in the Bill for certifying or making conclusive the boundaries as between a registered owner and all his neighbours.  I may be wrong on that and maybe the Minister will correct me if so.</P>
    <P>It remains to be seen, too, whether compulsory registration in cities and built-up areas in general will work as well as it did in rural areas.  In cities where boundaries are very small and the areas of holdings extremely small it may be difficult to define them. There is also the question of storing hundreds of thousands of tons of documents.  The Minister will have to go slowly and will have to provide large storage space.</P>
    <P>I have not gone into the Bill in detail, but at this stage I would suggest that it is a Bill which should not be rushed through the House.  Reasonable time should be given between now and the Committee Stage.  Sometimes the Committee Stage is taken the week after the Second Stage but I do not think that would be possible in a Bill of this sort.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters of detail I should like to draw the Minister's attention to.  It is provided in the Bill that a conveyance or transfer of land <Col N="1056" /> which is subject to compulsory registration shall be voided if the document is not registered within three months. I know that there was considerable discussion on this in the Dáil and that the Minister told Deputy Michael O'Higgins that he would reconsider this aspect of the matter with a view to extending the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing so sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  As a country practitioner I know that the period of three months can be quite short.  You could, for example, send a document to the United States to be executed.  It could be executed there before a consular officer and dated.  We do not like to get them dated.  They sometimes come back dated from America.  By the time you would get through the Adjudication Office and various other offices and perhaps put it on the long finger three months could have elapsed, and I think that period should be extended.  I say that from the experience of one who is dealing with these things every day of the week.</P>
      <P>Another point which arises is this section of the Bill which gives the Minister power to apply compulsory registration to a county, a county borough or portion thereof.  For the sake of simplicity it is a pity that the Minister should have the power to divide up a county or a county borough.  As somebody said in the Dáil, the divisions of counties and county boroughs are notoriously well known but when you start dividing up baronies or parishes it will be difficult to know whether you are dealing with an area which is subject to compulsory registration or with another such area.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the point that there should be provision made to enable a person to apply to the Registrar to have the boundaries declared on the Land Registry conclusive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that they only dealt with where land was purchased from the Land Commission <Col N="1057" /> or the Landed Estates Court, or where a man divided his holding the division between A and B could be certified. Is there provision for certifying the boundary between a man and all his neighbours?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that.  There is one very small point then, this thing about photostatic copies.  It is perhaps too small a point for discussion on the Second Stage.  There should be some uniformity between various Government Departments.  At the present time if I am sending to the Land Registry I can get a certified photo copy but if I go into the High Court and produce this document I shall get a proper telling-off.  I am asked: &ldquo;Are the Land Registry people not aware of my ruling in this matter?&rdquo;  If the Land Registry are prepared to certify a document there should be an obligation on a court of law to accept that document as evidence.</P>
      <P>I was not too clear about the discharge of equities but I am quite clear now that there are encouraging provisions in the Bill to discharge equities.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the decision in the National Bank and Keegan has been reversed.  That is long overdue.  It is in keeping with the tradition in the country.  When a man retains a right of residence in favour of himself on a farm he has given to his son it was never the intention that he should be able to bring a stranger in or let the rooms to strangers if he and his family disagree.  That is a good provision and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>About fees I agree that the fees mentioned by the Minister of £4 5s and £7 on a £3,000 sale are quite reasonable and I hope that they will continue to be so.  Perhaps we can have an assurance from the Minister that when the Bill passes we shall not have the fees jacked up unduly.</P>
      <P>That is really all I have to say on the Second Stage in detail but I would repeat that I think the House would like reasonable time before the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am happy that the Bill commends itself to the Seanad in principle.  Indeed, that is what happened in the Dáil, when most Deputies agreed that the registration of title was a superior system, and welcomed the introduction of this legislation which would make possible the extension of the system to all lands in the State. The points which have been made by the three Senators who spoke are, in fact, as they themselves readily admitted, Committee Stage points. Therefore, I do not propose to delay the House at this stage by dealing with them in any detail.  Undoubtedly, they will come up again when we are dealing with the various sections of the Bill in detail.  With regard to the question of power to define boundaries, may I direct the attention of Senator Fitzpatrick to sections 87 and 88? When we come to the Committee Stage we can look further into those two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 87, yes, but section 88 gives the Registrar power to do it where a transfer is taking place.  Section 56 and section 15 deal with the question of the court accepting Land Registry documents. Senator Lindsay mentioned the new functions which are being given to the Registrar in relation to the registration of titles which arises by virtue of <Col N="1059" /> occupation.  The new functions which are given to the Registrar in the Bill are given under section 49.  While I do not want to argue it in detail at this stage, I suggest that it should be considered in the light of the change in the law which has been effected by the section, under which the Statute of Limitations will, in future, apply to registered land in the same way as it applies to unregistered land at the moment.</P>
      <P>As Senators will realise, the situation of the occupier of registered land is disadvantageous when compared with the situation of the occupier of unregistered land.  Indeed, all we are doing is, if you like, bringing the situations in regard to the two types of land into conformity because, at the moment, in regard to unregistered land a squatter can acquire title by the effluxion of time.  In the case of registered land he has to go to the court.  We are proposing that in regard to registered land in future he will go to the Registrar as distinct from the court.  Senator Lindsay finds this <i>prima facie</i> undesirable, but I think if he goes more closely into it he will realise that the Registrar already has a number of important functions of a similar nature which he has been exercising down the years without any cause of complaint arising.  Of course, there has always been, and will still continue to be, appeal to the court from any decision of the Registrar in that regard.</P>
      <P>As I say, we shall undoubtedly be going into the various points in the various sections in much greater detail, and possibly a little more argumentatively, when we come to Committee Stage, and I shall not delay the Seanad any further in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick said he would like some time to elapse between now and Committee Stage.  I agree with him that this is a technical measure and, therefore, Senators are entitled to as much time as possible to consider it fully, and to enable them to prepare any amendments they wish to put down.  On the other hand, I am anxious, for a variety of reasons, to <Col N="1060" /> get on with the Bill as quickly as possible, particularly because the Succession Bill will be coming along.  For that reason I would ask the Leader of the Seanad to suggest to the House that we would tentatively fix Committee Stage for next week, and if there is any Senator who feels by this time next week that he has not had time to put down amendments, we would automatically agree to postpone it for another week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident the Bill will be regarded as a non-controversial measure when I explain that its purpose is to increase the salaries of judges and district justices in the light of the adjustment which has taken place in the general level of remuneration since the present rates of judicial salaries were last fixed in 1962.  The percentage increases proposed are 6 per cent for the Chief Justice; 10 per cent for the President of the High Court, Supreme Court judges, High Court judges and the President of the Circuit Court; and 12 per cent for ordinary Circuit Court judges and all district justices.  The figures arrived at by the application of these percentage increases have in all cases been rounded to the nearest £5.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the general level of salaries and wages, both in the private sector and the public sector, has in recent months been raised by 12 per cent as a result of a comprehensive settlement between employers and employees.  This ninth round increase has been applied to the various public services with effect from 1st February last, at an estimated annual cost of about £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals now before the House represent the result of careful examination by the Government of the question of judges' pay.  Having regard to the substantial nature of the increase given to other persons paid from the public purse, and to the prospect of stability held out by the recent general agreement, <Col N="1062" /> the Government felt that increases of the order now proposed are unavoidable unless long-established relationships in the matter of pay between judges and other groups are to be upset in a fundamental manner.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is proposed to apply a flat increase of 12 per cent to all judicial persons up to and including ordinary Circuit Court judges.  In relation to the judges of the Superior Courts, the Government felt that there was scope for some modification of the general ninth round pattern; hence the proposal to fix the increase for Supreme Court and High Court judges at 10 per cent and the increase for the Chief Justice at 6 per cent.  The effective date in all cases will be 1st February of this year, the date from which the ninth round increases were applied to the other public services.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will agree that against the background which I have outlined the present proposals are not only reasonable but unavoidable.  The total annual cost will be slightly less than £19,000, and I trust that the proposals will commend themselves to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in agreement with the Bill.  Indeed, I find myself in agreement with the Minister's arguments except that I would have put them slightly differently.  The Bill arises because of the necessity for increased wages to offset increases in the cost of living and a decrease in the value of money largely caused by increased taxation imposed by the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>The judges, naturally, have to get increases in their salaries to correspond in some degree to what other people are getting.  The judges deserve these increases.  We have inherited a judicial system with the working of which our lawyers and citizens were familiar but not always satisfied.  In 1924 certain changes were made, particularly the setting up of the district court which has worked extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though favouring these increases, I do not at all argue that judges have to be extremely well paid to keep them honest.  If they are not naturally honest <Col N="1063" /> and well selected, they will not prove to be as good as our judges have been. People referring to this subject should remember that judges administer the law as we frame it, but at the same time the outlook of judges is of very great importance to everybody.  It should not be considered that this is a matter very far up in the air, away from the life of the ordinary citizen.  It is not.  The judges and the role they play concern all of us, rich and poor, big and small.  They have a considerable influence on our lives and on the law itself.  Therefore, I do not think they should have to make a case to have their salaries increased.  In the light of the work they do, this Bill is a suitable measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, we are asked to agree to the application of the ninth round increase to the judges, appropriately scaled off at the higher level.  This ninth round was not, as Senator Hayes said, simply a compensation for increases in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Senator is not a simple man.  It was not simply&mdash; I am not quoting the Senator&mdash;compensation for cost of living increases. There was an element of such increases in it but there was also an element of a share in the benefits of increased productivity for the workers.  It was in that context the national agreement was negotiated between the Congress of Irish Trade Unions and the employers. I do not think we ever thought we were negotiating for judges at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, as we are now asked to apply the ninth round to them, we should have some explanation from the Minister as to increased productivity in the application of the work of judges in this country.  I must confess, or may I boast, that I have not very much experience, but from what little I have it appears to me we are being asked to apply a level of salaries appropriate to the 1960s to a Victorian system.  I thought the Minister might have been in a <Col N="1064" /> greater hurry to do something about the system rather than applying this higher level of salaries to the judges.</P>

I looked through a list of about 1,500 electors in that area and found that out of that number only 270, or 18 per cent, were jurors.</P>

      <P>I believe in the independence of the judiciary but more so in the dignity of the judiciary.  It is undesirable that at frequent intervals we should have Bills introduced here to deal with judges' salaries.  The Bill with which we dealt two years ago was <Col N="1065" /> introduced by the Minister on that principle, in that atmosphere.  We opposed the Bill then because it was introduced at a time when there was a pay pause or wage freeze for all other sections of the community.

It is a reflection on Government policy that they admit that in order to pay the judges in real money the same salaries they were getting two years ago it is necessary now to introduce this Bill, substantially increasing their salaries in order to restore them to the position in which this House and the Dáil placed them two years ago.</P>
      <P>One point I want to make is a point I made at considerable length when the other Bill was going through the House.  I cannot see why a rural district justice should be paid less than his city brother in Dublin or Cork. All ordinary justices throughout the country should be paid the same salary.  Under this Bill a district justice presiding in a rural district is paid £170 less than his colleague in Dublin and Cork.  I do not believe district justices and judges should be paid on the volume of work they do.  In fact, it might be evidence that they were doing their work better and that they were better worth the money we are giving them, if they had less work to do.  It might be evidence that the administration of justice was having its desired effect and that, certainly on the criminal side, it was acting as a deterrent.  I do not believe either that a country district justice has less work to do than a city district justice.</P>

      <P>If the Minister thinks that a salary of £2,690 is fair and reasonable for a district justice in the city of Cork and if his majority in the House agree with him, I say he <Col N="1066" /> should consider paying the same salary to the district justice presiding in District No. 5 and every other district in this country.  It is as simple as that. This Bill seems to suggest that a justice should be paid on the volume of business going through his court.  I do not agree with that.  I think he is paid for the responsibility he has, for the work he does and for the work he is ready and willing to do.  If the Minister is convinced there should be a difference because one has less work to do than the other, I say a rural district justice has a greater variety of work to do.  The man in the city may deal with road traffic cases, Rent Act cases and children's cases in the same court every day of the week.  By and large, he has the same work to do and he has less thought to give to it.  Today a rural district justice may be dealing with smuggling, the following day road traffic cases, fishery cases, civil cases, poteen cases, cock fighting or anything like that.  Perhaps he has a more interesting time, but he certainly has to bring his mind to bear on a far greater variety of matters.  I think this difference between the rural district justice and the city district justice should be removed.</P>

      <P>I have often heard that a judge, when giving his decision, should never give his reasons, because his judgment may be right and his reasons wrong.  It seems to me that all of us are unanimous that these increases should be granted, but we all believe that they should be granted for different reasons.  Senator Hayes and Senator Fitzpatrick believe they should be granted because they say the cost of living has increased by 12 per cent in two years.  Senator Murphy thinks they should be granted because productivity has increased by 12 per cent.  As I understand the situation, this increase is a furtherance of a definite principle and policy.  Up to last January whenever increases were to be granted anywhere there was an unseemly scramble for the national cake, even amongst the workers themselves. The largest national trade union is not only very loyal to its members but has always borne in mind that it has a <Col N="1067" /> national duty.  For that I and, I am sure, most Irish people would like to pay them tribute.  Other trade unions, with, perhaps, a lesser sense of responsibility, demanded most extravagant increases which could not possibly be considered, thereby, perhaps, acting to the detriment of those who took the broader view in the interests of their members, in the interests of the nation at large and in the interests of the common good.</P>
      <P>If this country is to progress&mdash;and we all sincerely hope it will progress&mdash; we must forget we belong to different sectors and sections.  One and all, we must be prepared to do what we can in the nation's interest.  Any benefit which accrues to any sector of the people naturally helps every other sector.  The Government apparently appreciated that the two sectors with the most conflicting interests are obviously the employers and workers.  The net result was that in 1962 they established the Employer-Labour Conference.  Various attempts were made to bring together the employers and workers and get them to agree on some definite principle that would apply to all.  The negotiations broke down and the parties were brought together a number of times.  Ultimately, to the credit of the Federated Union of Employers and the Congress of Irish Trade Unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a result of this conference, agreement was ultimately reached in January of this year.  The Taoiseach then made it perfectly clear that this was being paid by reason of the increase in the national wealth and that it should be applied to every other section of the community&mdash;gardaí, teachers, civil servants, to everybody from the top to the bottom.</P>

      <P>That is the real reason why this Bill comes before the House today.  On that principle we should all agree, and be wholehearted in our agreement, that this increase be given. Reference has been made to jurors.  A juror gets nothing for a criminal case and gets £3 for a civil case, which may go on for many days.  A 12 per cent increase would be an insult to a juror for acting as a public-spirited citizen.</P>

      <P>There are just a few points arising out of the discussion. Senator Murphy made a point about productivity and asked what was being done to ensure greater productivity in regard to the judiciary.  I think Senator Fitzpatrick gave what is the fundamental reply to that question.  We do not want rough and ready or rapid justice.  We want in this country sound, fundamental decisions.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy may know that I have established a Committee on Court Practice and Procedure under the chairmanship of a Supreme Court judge to examine the whole practice and procedure in our courts.  They also will see in what way the administration of justice can, on the one hand, be expedited and, on the other hand, be made cheaper for litigants.  The Committee are working away assiduously and have already presented one report.  At the present time, they are dealing with the question of juries and examining the whole basis of the jury system.  I am sure they will make recommendations in that regard.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with Senator Murphy that the obligation to deal with jury service is a very serious burden on citizens.  I hope we may get recommendations from the Committee which will enable us to lighten the load of those called upon, at the moment, to render this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Fitzpatrick's point about the status of the provincial district justices as against city or urban justices, the situation is that in <Col N="1069" /> 1953 a Committee of the Oireachtas established this whole situation for a long time to come.  It went into the whole question of the status of justices and judges and laid down a certain basis for the future.  The Oireachtas, from time to time, grant increases on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, more or less, to the various members of the judiciary on the basis of the status which was established in 1953.  I would not think it would be appropriate in the circumstances to do anything about that in this Bill.  It merely applies the ninth round more or less automatically to judges and all other sections of the judiciary.</P>

      <P>No fundamental rearrangement or re-assessment has been made since then.  If any change were to be made in the basic pattern, then there would be a case for establishing another Oireachtas Committee to go into the question all over again and re-establish the fundamental basis as it was in 1953.  At the moment, all we are doing is following an established practice and applying an all round increase to the judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked whether we got more productivity from the judiciary. <Col N="1070" /> In so far as the district court is concerned we reduced the number of districts from 30 to 23 so we now have 23 doing the work of 30.  That represents an increase in productivity of 25 per cent approximately.  As I said also in regard to another point raised by Senator Murphy, a Committee on Court Practice and Procedure was established to inquire into the whole question of juries.  It is ridiculous to suggest that the ninth round increase is made necessary by a rise in the cost of living.  As we know, the increase in productivity enabled an increase in wages and salaries to be given to different sections of the community.  This agreement was come to on the basis of what it is hoped will be a comprehensive and stable arrangement.  The Government undertook that whatever increase would be agreed on it would be applied to all the services.  It is now being applied to the judiciary.  Owing to the long established pattern in this field, we could not possibly contemplate otherwise. As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill is, in fact, unavoidable if we are to keep to the long established relationships on the matter of pay between judges and other groups.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
