    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary to make statutory provision for increases in pensions and allowances, following the 1963 Budget, which have been paid since 1st November, 1963 under the terms of a Supplementary Estimate approved by Dáil Éireann on 28th November, 1963.</P>
      <P>All pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1962 are being increased under the provisions of the Bill and net cost to the Exchequer is £28,000 per annum. Disablement pensions unrelated to pay and married pensions are being increased by 5 per cent as are allowances payable to widows, children and other dependants of deceased persons. Officers whose disablement pensions are related to pay and who retired before 16th December, 1959, are receiving increases which will bring their pensions up to the level of an officer retiring on 16th December, 1959.</P>
      <P>Gratuities payable to widows on remarriage and to persons with wound disablements of less than 20 per cent in degree are being increased by 40 per cent approximately.  These gratuities have not been increased since 1956 and the various percentage increases in pensions and allowances since then are now being applied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> Special allowances are being increased by £4 per year.  Increases in certain Social Welfare benefits and in military service, Connaught Rangers and disablement pensions are being disregarded in the calculation of means for special allowance purposes.  These latter concessions to special allowance recipients are not of course included in the Bill.  They are dealt with by way of amendment to the joint directions governing the grant of special allowances.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that this Bill does not provide for this year's Budget increases which will become payable from the 1st October next. Separate measures will be taken for this purpose.</P>
    <P>If Senators require any further information about the Bill, I will endeavour to supply it when concluding.</P>

      <P>Fé mar a deirtear, muna leor le daoine áirithe an Bille seo, is maith ann é.  If this Bill should be regarded by some people as not sufficient, at the same time it is well to have it.  The amounts mentioned in the Bill are already being paid and it does not include the further amount mentioned in this year's Budget.  Therefore, I think it should have as speedy a passage as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  However, it should not be necessary to come to this House at this time of the year when the amount involved is so small and when an increase given under the Budget is now almost due.  I asked the Minister on a previous occasion here whether some fund could be set up to deal with the burial expenses of persons who were entirely dependent on special allowances and were, therefore, unable to make any provision for themselves. The Minister should seriously consider that, if he has not already done so.  We will be glad to see him here again shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>No member of the House will oppose this Bill.  We cannot disapprove of it.  If it called for any criticism, I think it would call for the <Col N="1413" /> comment that the percentage increase it provides is not adequate.  The Minister is not to be blamed for that, as an individual at any rate.  The fact is that he can adjust the pensions only by the amount made available by the Government. So many appeals have been addressed to the Government in regard to the question of pensions that I do not propose to take up the time of the House by adding to them.</P>
      <P>I believe some more expeditious method of dealing with the whole problem of pensions is called for.  We have about five other Bills on the Order Paper which are necessary because of the manner in which the problem of pensions is dealt with.  I strongly urge on the Minister the desirability of examining the problem in order to facilitate the adjustment of pensions by a more up to date and expeditious method.  I am aware that the Minister for Finance has already indicated in a Bill dealing with the pensions of State servants that he has certain powers which enable him to make these adjustments by Ministerial Order, and I suggest that these pensions could be dealt with in the same way.  It is high time the Government realised their responsibility in regard to putting these pensions on the proper level.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an mBille seo.  Deirim gur ceart córas níos fearr agus níos seasmhaí a bheith ann le h-aghaidh na h-oibre seo.  Ní ceart go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar an Aire teacht anso isteach gach uair a bhíonn méadú mar seo ag teastáil.  Dá mbeadh aon Bhille amháin údarásach ann chun an méadú is cuí do thabhairt de réir mar a bheadh gá leis, is dóigh liom gurab é sin an córas ba cheart a bheith againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fé mar a adubhrathas tá an méadú &mdash;an méadú ar na liúntaisí speisialta&mdash; beag ach mar sin féin is méadú é agus má leanann an tAire sa tslí sin, dhá mhéadú ó am go chéile, beidh obair mhaith dhá déanamh aige.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil cuid mhór dena daoine sin ag stracadh leis an saol mar go bhfuil teipithe ar a sláinte agus caithfimid cuimhneamh air sin.  Dá mbeadh sé de chaoi ag an Aire ba mhaith liom dá dtabharfadh sé breis <Col N="1414" /> ar an méadú atá le fáil ag na daoine seo seachas an méid, cuir i gcás, a bhíodh dhá fháil deich mbliain ó shoin agus fiche bliain ó shoin.

      <P>An pointe seo a bhí ag an Seanadóir Crowley agus ag an Seanadóir Ó Ciosáin i dtaobh teacht go rialta anso go dtí an Seanad ag iarraidh údaráis ar na méadaithe a cheadaíodh sa Cháinfhaisnéis, tá mé ar aon intinn leo.  Ach tá a fhios acu agus tá a fhios ag gach duine den Oireachtas gur rud cinéal nua é méadú a dhéanamh ar chor ar bith ar phinsin.</P>
      <P>Is mar seó a bhí an scéal maidir le pinsin go dtí tar éis an chogaidh&mdash;go raibh sé ar aon mhéid ó ceapadh é go dtí a bhás.  Tá rud nua againn anois le blianta beaga anuas agus tá méadaithe pinsin ag teacht go réasúnta rialta de réir mar a bhíonn gá leo.  Fé mar adúirt an Seanadóir Crowley, thug an tAire Airgeadais foráil isteach sa Cháinfhaisnéis dhá dhéanamh neáriachtanach Billí speisialta do thúirt isteach le méadaithe áirithe pinsin a údarú.  Táimuid-ne sa Roinn Cosanta ag súil go n-éireoidh linn, ar ndó, buntáiste na forála seo do chur ag obair mar mhaithe le na pinsin atá luaite anso agus cé nár tháinig muid ar an réiteach sin fós, fé mar adúirt mé, támuid muiníneach.  Ansin, ós rud é anois go bhfuil sé de dhúchas againn pinsin de chuile shórt do mhéadú beagnach gach bliain féachfar le é do dhéanamh tré rialacháin.  Ní feidir liom bheith deimhneach dearfa ach tá mé dóchasach gur mar sin a bhéas an scéal.</P>
      <P>I am appreciative of the kindly welcome which Senators have given to our efforts to help those referred to in this Bill.  As Senator Crowley said, we have to make do with the amount of money which is provided for us.  When a global sum is provided, it is our job to divide it as best we can.  No matter how we decide to divide it between the various categories, we do not always give satisfaction. That is our difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the smallness of the percentage&mdash;five per cent&mdash;it is not correct to compare it with, say, the recent 12 per cent increase because, in recent <Col N="1415" /> years, we have had about five or six increases, one of which was 20 per cent.  Therefore, the aggregate of these increases does, I think, compare favourably with the general increase in remuneration which has been secured in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other point which I can usefully deal with at the moment.  I take it, as Senator Hayes said, that the Seanad will be agreeable to give us all Stages.  If there are any points on the sections as they arise, perhaps I shall be able to give further information.</P>

      <P>The pension for 100 per cent disablement is £4 17s. 6d. per week.  Such a pension seems to be very much out of line with corresponding awards in civil cases.  For instance, if a person is disabled in an accident, the compensation runs into several thousands of pounds, giving an annuity up to ten or 15 times this amount.</P>

In the case of soldiers, with £4 17s 6d, there are usually a married pension and children's allowances which considerably increase the total income to the recipient.</P>

The increase is 5 per cent, the same as that granted generally to State pensioners, and it is being paid with effect from the 1st November, 1963.  A Supplementary Estimate approved by Dáil Éireann on the 28th November, 1963, enabled the payments to be commenced.</P>

      <P>This Bill makes statutory provision for an increase of 5 per cent in the services and disability pensions payable under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts, 1936 to 1962.  The increase is similar to those provided for State pensioners generally in the 1963 Budget and is costing approximately £100 per annum.</P>

      <P>The number, I notice from the Minister's statement, is very small and the amount of money involved is also very small.  How is the increase of five per cent worked out, remembering the history of the Connaught Rangers, and assuming that this is to meet the increase in the cost of living?  I know there has to be some basis for the increase and I presume that is the basis the Minister is going on now.  Why is it so low?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no lower than the other pensions administered by the Department of Defence.  The five per cent increase this year applies all round.  I do not consider the Senator has made a case for any discrimination in favour of the Connaught Rangers as compared with, say, the Old IRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that the increase here also appears very small.  The Minister's reply to me, regarding the Connaught Rangers, was that it was in line with other increases and that I did not make the case that it should be changed.  All of us who remember that period have the greatest respect for all these people. The five per cent increase, in view of the service given by all these people, is very low.  I certainly do not want to change it, if it is uniform regarding all the pensions.  I consider the five per cent increase too low for the amount of service these people gave the country. I suppose most of us would like to give the greatest increase to the Old IRA.  That would be quite natural.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply, in regard to the Connaught Rangers, was that I was only interested in them. <Col N="1419" /> That was the Bill which was before us at that time.  I had left the House when the debate took place on the earlier Bill.  This increase is very small, no matter what group is involved.  The five per cent is very low indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Desmond but I want to tell him that for a number of years back we have had almost annual increases, whether the public at large got increases or not. We had, I think, six increases almost consecutively.  If the percentage increase in a particular year seems small to the Senator the aggregate of these increases is considerably greater.  In fact, as I mentioned earlier, it was as high as 20 per cent one year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the adequacy, or otherwise, of the pensions I think that we have met the case, which was put forward for years, in the provision of special allowances.  If somebody comes along and says a man has a service pension of £20 or £25 a year and that he is now no longer able to work&mdash; perhaps he has reached the age of 65 or 70 years or he is suffering from deterioration in health&mdash;we have this special allowance and it is all the same to the recipient whether his pension or his allowance is increased.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Senator that the average special allowance is as high as £80 and that that can be added to the pension.  While I should like to see this increased further, I think we have made reasonable provision, as things have gone, up to the present. Should there be a necessity for further increases as a result of an increase in the cost of living, and provided that it can be so arranged in the Budget, there will be, I would say, further increases, if a case can be made for them.  We get a lump sum from the Minister for Finance and our job is to divide it.  I can assure Senator Desmond that if he sat down in my place and divided it he too would have very big difficulties.  Therefore, what we usually do, is say we will give a flat increase all round.  While this is not entirely satisfactory, at least it seems to me to be the best alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to continue, in permanent form, the existing temporary provisions for rates on fisheries.  These provisions, which are due to expire at the end of September next, enable boards of conservators to strike and collect rates on fisheries within their districts.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to recall that fishery properties have been liable to rates in one form or another for more than a century.  The Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848, enabled the boards of conservators established by that statute to strike and collect rates on fisheries over and above the local authority rates payable on the fisheries under the then poor law relief provisions.  This fishery rate was an amount equal to the difference between 10 per cent of the valuation of the fishery and the licence duties for engines used in fishing that fishery. These 1848 rating provisions have been suspended since 1925 but appear in the comprehensive Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as section 63 which is being repealed by section 3 of the present Bill.</P>
      <P>In 1925, as part of a drive to put fishery protection services on a more effective footing, the present system of fishery rating was introduced and fisheries were exempted from local authority rates.  This system, which has since been continued from time to time, enables boards of conservators to strike on all fisheries within their districts rates of such amount per cent of the valuations as will, with their estimated income from other sources, be sufficient to meet the estimated amount of their expenditure for the fishery year to the end of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities, to whom <Col N="1421" /> fisheries had also been rateable up to 1925, receive compensation from the Exchequer for that loss in their rates. Where, by reason of the exemption of fisheries, a local rate on other property would have to be increased by more than 1d. in the £, the local authority receives an amount equivalent to that which would be produced by such an increase.  The total amount of these compensatory payments from the Fisheries Vote in the last financial year was approximately £33,500.</P>
    <P>The produce of the fishery rate is an important item in the revenue of boards of conservators.  Out of the boards' total receipts of some £103,000 in the fishery year ended 30th September last, £36,000 came from fishery rates, close on £29,000 from licence duties and £23,000 in the form of grants from the Fisheries Vote.  The State grants are first paid into the Salmon Conservancy Fund and indeed form the main income of that Fund an account of which is published annually with the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, this Bill merely continues the existing provisions for rates on fisheries.  I do not claim that the system of fishery rating is perfect but in its present form it has proved of considerable value to boards of conservators and has come to be accepted as a permanent feature by all concerned.  I can therefore confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of a certain section of the community, whom it is not part of the function of this House to protect, the work of the boards of conservators has given general satisfaction and there has been general recognition of the good work being done by them. Accordingly, there can be no objection to this proposal of the Minister, in which he asks that the fishery rate, which is about one-third the income of such boards, should now, having been merely a temporary provision, pass into part of the permanent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, apparently, is satisfied with the working, and there has been no indication from any source that this <Col N="1422" /> is not desirable.  Accordingly, we have no reason to disagree with the proposal in this Bill.  Towards the end of his speech, the Minister said he did not necessarily think that this particular system was perfect, but he thought it something to go on with for the time being.  It is, however, going into permanent legislation, and I should like to ask the Minister whether he intends to review the whole system of the financing of boards of conservators in the near future, or after what period of time would he consider such a review to be necessary.</P>

      <P>It is correct to state that I intend to review the whole system as it at present exists.  Some of the laws and regulations dealing with the boards of conservators are archaic.  It is also necessary, I feel, to increase their scope, particularly in the protection of fisheries throughout the land and of course to provide a suitable system to give them the necessary sinews of war for that purpose. Detailed examination is being made of the whole system, and I hope to have legislation introduced at an early date when a full study has been made of the system.  In the meantime, this Bill is necessary for them to carry on, and I am very glad that it is acceptable to the House.  As I have said, in due course I shall come here, having reviewed the working of this whole system, and ask the Oireachtas for the necessary legal powers to implement the changes I have in mind.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed primarily to give legislative effect to the increases in the rates of non-contributory old age and <Col N="1423" /> blind pensions, widows' pensions and unemployment assistance from 1st August, 1964, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 14th April last.  The opportunity is also being taken to bring about some further extensions and improvements of both the Social Insurance and the Social Assistance schemes which it is desirable and possible to make.  The wording of some of the Sections in the Bill is necessarily technical and, accordingly, an explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Budget increase proposed in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions is 2/6d a week, which will make the new weekly rates of these pensions range from 37/6d at the maximum by steps of 5/- down to 7/6d at the minimum according to the means of the pensioner as set out in the table in Section 2.</P>
      <P>In regard to unemployment assistance, which is dealt with in section 3, the increase proposed in the Budget is also 2/6d. a week, but this applies to both the personal rate of assistance and to the allowance payable in respect of an adult dependant.  Thus the maximum rate of unemployment assistance for a married man with a dependent wife will be increased by 5/- a week to 52/6d. a week in an urban area, and to 44/6d. a week in a rural area.  The increase in the maximum rates of unemployment assistance by automatically raising the means limit for assistance purposes, will bring within the scope of the scheme persons who at present fail to qualify for assistance because their means are a little in excess of the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase of 2/6d. a week is also proposed in the rates of widows' non-contributory pensions.  As a result, the rates of pension for a widow with no dependent children would range from 36/- a week at the maximum by steps of 5/- down to 11/- a week according to the means of the widow.  However, a widow whose means were just over the limit for 11/- pension would get no pension even though the margin by which her means exceeded the limit <Col N="1424" /> might be considerably less than 11/- a week, and to obviate this the scale of means and rates of widows' non-contributory pensions is being extended so as to add a new rate of pension of 6/- at the minimum.  This new rate is included in the table in section 4.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the Budget increase, the Bill will bring about some desirable improvements and extensions of the Social Welfare Schemes.  The first of these is the payment with old age pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, of increases of pension in respect of qualified children, which are dealt with in sections 5, 8, 9 and 10.  It is anomalous that a person approaching the age of 70 could be in receipt of disability benefit or unemployment benefit, which included an increase for children, but that immediately on reaching that age and becoming entitled only to an old age contributory pension, no increase could be paid in respect of the children.</P>
    <P>A similar anomaly arises in the case of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance or widow's non-contributory pension who qualify for non-contributory old age pension at the age of 70. To rectify this position, the Bill proposes to provide for the payment of increases of pension to old age (contributory) pensioners for qualified children at the same rates as are paid with disability benefit, unemployment benefit or widow's (contributory) pension, i.e. 13/- for each of the first two qualified children and 8/- for each additional qualified child, and for the payment in respect of qualified children of non-contributory old age pensioners of increases at the same rate as those which are paid with widow's (non-contributory) pension and unemployment assistance, i.e., 10/- for each of the first two qualified children and 5/- for each additional qualified child.</P>
    <P>In addition to extending the scale of means and rates of non-contributory pension, section 5 will enable £39 of any earnings from insurable employment to be disregarded in assessing means for pension purposes in respect of each qualified child.</P>
    <P>The same qualification conditions <Col N="1425" /> will obtain in respect of the increases of pension for children, as applies for the general Children's Allowances scheme and as obtains in respect of children under the other forms of Social Welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in sections 5 and 8 for the making of an order bringing these increases into force.  For administrative reasons it would not be possible to bring them into payment concurrently with the Budget increases, but it is anticipated that payment will commence at the beginning of November next.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for two amendments of the Social Insurance scheme.  The first of these relates to the insurability of pensionable teachers in the training colleges for national teachers who are at present compulsorily insurable for all benefits under the Social Insurance scheme, where their remuneration is within the insurability limit.  Provision is made in section 6 of the Bill to enable the Minister to make regulations treating these teachers for insurance purposes in exactly the same way as pensionable teachers in national, secondary and vocational schools who are insurable for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes only.</P>
    <P>The other amendment in relation to the Social Insurance scheme dealt with in section 7 refers to the overriding limit of half a million pounds on the amount which may be paid by way of treatment benefit in any financial year. Treatment benefit is now limited to dental benefit, optical benefit and medical and surgical appliances benefit the appliances in question being contact lenses and hearing aids.  Expenditure on treatment benefit is increasing and it could happen that unless the overriding limit is removed the scheme might have to be terminated or suspended during the course of a financial year for lack of money.  Section 7 proposes, therefore, to remove that overriding limit and leave the amount to be spent in any year to be agreed upon between the Minister for Finance and myself, the amount involved being, of course, included in the year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 of the Bill effect <Col N="1426" /> improvements in the Unemployment Assistance scheme.  Under the provision in section 11, persons applying for unemployment assistance can be paid retrospectively where favourable decisions revising earlier decisions have been given.  This will ensure that the time taken to deal with cases will not detrimentally affect the amount payable to the applicant where his application or appeal is successful.  The amendment will also clarify the law in so far as it relates to overpayments of unemployment assistance arising in the converse situation where a revised decision results in a reduction of the unemployment assistance payable, and fraud is involved.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 12 is intended to give some relief to the persons who are employed seasonally as fishermen either working on their own account or on a share basis.  This matter has been a source of considerable grievance over the years.  Earnings from employment under a contract of service are not regarded as means for the purpose of unemployment assistance but a fisherman working on his own account or on a share basis is not normally employed under a contract of service.  Accordingly, any income which he derives from his fishing is treated as means and may deprive him of a qualification certificate, without which he cannot get unemployment assistance, or make his means such as to reduce the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him, and it has been claimed that this bears unfairly on these seasonal fishermen. It is now proposed to reduce the impact of such earnings on title to unemployment assistance by allowing a proportion, up to an overriding limit of £80 a year, of the income derived from seasonal fishing to be disregarded in assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill proposes an improvement relating to the minimum age limits for widow's non-contributory pension.  A widow cannot qualify for a non-contributory pension if she is less than 48 years of age, unless she has a qualified child or children and, if a widow with a qualified child or <Col N="1427" /> children has not attained the age of 40 years within six months after her last or only qualified child ceases to be qualified, she loses her pension.  Both of these minimum age limits can have rather harsh effects.</P>
    <P>The only real argument for them is that a widow without children should be in a position to provide for herself by working.  Circumstances may, however, prevent such a widow from working, for example, incapacity for work, lack of suitable employment locally, domestic responsibilities, which the minimum age limit cannot allow for. It is proposed therefore to remove the minimum age limits, thus leaving the question of title to a widow's non-contributory pension to be determined on the basis of the widow's need as measured by the means test.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Senators may find a summary of the cost to the Exchequer of the various proposals which I have outlined above of assistance.  On the Social Assistance side, the total costs are estimated to amount to £1,290,000 in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer.  The annual cost of the proposal for payment of increases in respect of children of old age (contributory) pensioners which will for the present all fall on the Exchequer, is estimated at £73,000, thus bringing the overall cost to the Exchequer to £1,363,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this measure for favourable consideration by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>We can well leave the question of the amount of Government expenditure devoted to social welfare to debates on the Finance Bill and other debates on general Government policy and so confine ourselves in discussing this Bill to a consideration in detail of the social welfare provisions which are amended here and the general operation of the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, as the Minister has outlined, a number of improvements with regard to the social welfare code contained in the Bill before us at the <Col N="1428" /> moment but, looking through the Bill and listening to the Minister speaking, the main effect, on me at any rate, was a sense almost of shock to find that the anomalies which the Bill is now removing had been there at all. The various improvements being made here are startlingly necessary and should, indeed, have been dealt with long ago.  Take for instance, the provision under section 5 dealing with persons when they reach a certain age and pass from being dealt with under unemployment assistance or some other code to the old age pension code.  Apparently, up to this, persons who had dependent children on reaching the age at which they passed into the area of the old age pension code would actually suffer a loss in income. It is, indeed, commendable but it is also high time such an anomaly was removed.</P>
    <P>When we come to section 11, I find myself even more disturbed to think that we have had in the past a social welfare code which needs to be amended by what is proposed here in section 11.  I shall read subsection (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Where, as a result of a reversal or revision of a decision, a person becomes entitled to hold a qualification certificate under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 to 1964, the person shall, for the purposes of those Acts, be deemed to have been the holder of a qualification certificate as on and from the date on which the decision as so reversed or revised came into effect.</P>
    <P>Apparently, unless I completely misread this subsection and misinterpret what the Minister has said, the position up to now has been that a decision could have been given and a person could have got that decision reversed at a considerable period later but the reversal of this previous decision did not benefit that person in respect of the intervening period.  It was a shocking thing to have existed in our social welfare code for so long, that the person could get the benefit only from the date of final determination and not from the date of which the initial mistake was made, be it an error of judgment or be it what it may.  It comes as a matter of <Col N="1429" /> shock to me that we should have in this day and age to enact a section like section 11 in this Bill.  Accordingly, we should do so very hastily indeed in order to repair a very serious defect in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>One of the other benefits conferred by this Bill is one which commends itself very much to me, that is, the one provided in section 12 in regard to seasonal fishermen.  This is a very commendable section.  Indeed, as I say, we can all welcome the provisions of this Bill and I personally have the feeling that there are many things being done in this Bill which should have been done long ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to welcome this Bill, partly, as Senator Dooge has said, because it corrects anomalies that were present heretofore, but also because it is a step further in the improvement of our general social welfare services.  We have a long way to go yet before these can be described as in any extent adequate but every step we can take towards making them a bit more adequate is, of course, therefore, all the more welcome.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of this matter which I have mentioned before in this House but which I take the liberty of mentioning again because I do not think it is sufficiently realised, that is, the importance of the impact that social welfare makes on the health services. I mention this with a due sense of responsibility.  I do not want to delay the House or to be irrelevant but it is important to realise that what we can do for sick people is in inverse proportion to what we have to do for people who are not really sick but who have to be confined in hospital because of inadequate provision of social welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more hospital beds in this country than in any other country per thousand of the population.  This is because we have many people in hospital who need not be there because to a large extent they do not really require the acute services of a hospital. This refers particularly to children and old people.  Mothers bring their children to hospital.  They may be ill in <Col N="1430" /> the first instance but they are left there long after they are well because they do not want them at home.  They have no help and have not that provision of social welfare service to cope with them.  The same applies to elderly people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the officials of his Department will remember this when they are looking at the general provisions of social welfare and consult, as I am sure they do, with the officials of the Department of Health because this is a very important area in which the two services overlap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, everybody should be pleased to see any increase being given by the Minister in social welfare benefits.  It is well that there are what might be classed as all-round increases for social welfare recipients.  I know the Minister is tied to the amount he has available for distribution but I think the amount is too little, that what each social welfare recipient gets is entirely too low.  It should be very much more than it is at the moment.</P>
      <P>I review the figures.  We have to have extra taxation and all that kind of machinery working but since 1957 we have had some £81 million of extra taxation.  Then we examine how that is being distributed towards social welfare. Of the £81 million, the amount spent in increased social welfare benefits was just £9 million, or little more than one-tenth.  In 1957, the weakest sections of the community received 25 per cent of the total tax revenue in the form of social welfare. So there would appear to be a very steep downward tendency in the amount directed towards social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government took office in 1957, the proportion was 25 per cent and in 1964, it has sunk to 19 per cent, a reduction from one quarter to less than one-fifth.  Although the cost of living has moved up&mdash;nobody has disputed that&mdash;and the value of money has dropped the social welfare recipient has still only that small amount with which to purchase the necessaries of life, and they would need much more if we are to provide proper social <Col N="1431" /> welfare services.  The people in receipt of social welfare benefits are entitled to at least sufficient to purchase the necessaries of life.  Some people will say that taxation would not stand that. Of course it would and the large numbers of social welfare recipients would be better off.</P>
    <P>The Minister might examine the social welfare code in relation to the means test.  There is a severe means test operating in regard to certain payments from the Social Welfare Fund to people badly in need of help from the State.  Take the case of the woman whose husband dies and who has, say, a family of four young children.  She gets children's allowances and, as her husband was an insured worker earning approximately £16 per week, she gets a contributory widow's pension of 37/6 per week.  She certainly will not keep a home on 37/6, plus what she gets in children's allowances.  She must keep the family, pay the rent, and so on.  She goes to work but can only take up casual employment.  When that temporary employment ceases, she, as an insured worker, can sign at the Social Welfare Department's office and draw benefit.</P>
    <P>Because she has a contributory widow's pension, there is immediately a reduction of practically half the benefit she would otherwise receive. According to the regulations, she may not receive two full payments out of the Social Welfare Fund.  If she were working in order to supplement her husband's earnings, she could sign for social welfare benefit and receive full benefit.  When there is a higher income coming into the home, she gets full benefit but because she is a widow in receipt of a pension, the amount is cut down.  That is an unfair regulation.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to deal fully with that question today but I should be glad to hear what is his approach to it.  I am sure that regulation was there when the Minister took office but I certainly think a means test as severe as that should be examined, apart altogether from the low amounts of social welfare benefits in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Bill <Col N="1432" /> before us is designed to correct certain anomalies and to remove certain injustices, it can be welcomed.  However, it would be hard to find any other commendation for the steps which this Bill proposes to take.  The increases which the Bill provides for non-contributory pension recipients are meagre, to say the least of them, but, like Senator Dooge, it would be unfair to the Minister this afternoon to repeat some of the criticism which has been levelled already at the general attitude and policy of this Government on the whole question of social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, nevertheless, to remind the Minister that this Bill, if it is an indication of the future attitude and policy of the Government, is, if anything, a retrograde step.  As far as I can gather, the actual proportion of tax revenue which is devoted to social welfare has been reducing steadily since the Government took office in 1957.  I estimate that the proportion expended on social welfare benefits in 1957 amounted to 24 per cent.  Last year that figure had dropped to 20 per cent and it is clear from this Bill that the proportion will be lower still in 1964.</P>
      <P>Those figures speak volumes.  They say a lot more than we could say this afternoon on this aspect of Government policy.  I conclude by saying it is hardly evidence of any serious intention on the part of the Minister and his Government to move to the left.  There is plenty of room for improvement here in social welfare benefits and I strongly urge on the Minister the necessity for improvement by not, in fact, taking, if anything, more out of taxation and applying less of it to necessary benefits of this kind for the people who need them most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for the expeditious way they have dealt with this Bill.  I respectfully agree with what Senator Dooge said regarding section 11 being overdue.  It is, in fact, bringing the case of old age pensioners into line with the general practice.  As Senators may be aware, no matter <Col N="1433" /> how long it takes to investigate an application for an old age pension, when the pensioner does get it, if he succeeds, it is retrospective to the date of the application.  The same holds good for an appeal but for some reason or other this aspect of the code was neglected but it is being put right now. For many years there has been agitation about share fishermen.  Outside the hardship of their application they suffered also because they could not get qualification certificates.  In the case of many of them, their earnings for the whole year would have been taken into consideration.  This matter is being put right now, at least to the extent of relieving them of up to £80 of that income.</P>
      <P>We do not say that this is the end of our social services charter.  We are not in any way complacent about these amounts but so far as the economy can afford it, step by step we are improving our social services and bringing them up to date.  I shall give some figures in a moment to show Senators, or remind them, of what has been happening every year, except in 1958, since this Government came into office.  In regard to Senator Jessop's point about people being in hospital who do not need to be there, I shall have his suggestion passed on to the Department for examination.  I believe many people are in hospital who should not be there but the reasons why they are there is another matter. In some cases I feel families in this age are not inclined to take the interest in the old folks they took long ago.  It is a wide social question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case was made by Senator Desmond about reduced rates of unemployment benefit paid to a widow in receipt of contributory pension.  It is a principle of the social insurance schemes that payment of two benefits simultaneously should not take place.  I am informed, for instance, that in Britain a widow in the circumstances mentioned by the Senator would not be paid unemployment benefit at all.  The present arrangement was a concession introduced by Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Social Welfare in the Social Welfare Act of 1952.  There is no <Col N="1434" /> question of a means test as such involved.  Taking the position generally, with these improvements and the renewing of them annually in each year and each Budget so far as practicable, we are improving the whole social welfare code.  For instance, the increases given to all classes last November more than covered the cost of living increase due to the turnover tax and what we have here now is still a further increase that more than covers the 12 per cent increase given in wages, with one single exception in which I believe I worked out the percentage increase as 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Act of 1957, the operative date of which was 15th May, 1957, the noncontributory old age pensioners received 1/-; the assistance applicants received 1/- for themselves&mdash;I am speaking of increases&mdash; and 1/- for an adult dependant; 1/- for the first child dependant.  The non-contributory widows' pension under this Act was increased by 1/- for the widow herself and 1/- for the first child dependant.  Under the Social Welfare Act of 1959 which became operative on 1st August, 1959, there was an increase of 2/6d. for old age pensioners and for persons receiving assistance there was an increase of 2/6d. for those with an adult dependant.  In widows' pensions there was a 2/6d. increase for the widow herself.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1960 an additional 1/- increase was given to the old age pensioners and assistance recipients got an extra 1/- for themselves; an extra 1/- for an adult dependant and an extra 1/- each for the first and second child dependants plus 1/- for each child in excess of two without restriction as to number. Prior to that, payment for children was restricted to two children.  Non-contributory widows got an increase of 1/- for themselves; 1/- for each of the first and second child dependants plus 3/6d. for each child dependant in excess of two without restriction as to number.  Prior to this, payment for children was restricted to two.</P>
    <P>Under the 1961 Act an extra 1/6d. was given to the old age pensioners: an extra 1/6d. to the assistance recipients <Col N="1435" /> for themselves; 1/6d. for adult dependants and 1/- each for first and second child dependants and 1/6d. for each child dependant in excess of two without restriction as to number.  Non-contributory widows got an extra 1/6d. for themselves and a 1/- each for first and second child dependant and 1/6d. for each child dependant in excess of two without restriction as to number. In 1962 another 2/6d. was given to the old age pensioners and the assistance recipients got an extra 2/6d. for themselves; 2/6d. for adult dependants; 2/- for the first child dependant in urban areas and 3/- in rural areas.  They got 3/- for the second child dependant in urban areas and 4/- in rural areas and 2/6d. for each child dependant in excess of two in all areas.  The non-contributory widows' pension was increased by 2/6d. with an extra 1/- for the second qualified child where there were two or more qualified children.</P>
    <P>In 1963 there was a further 2/6d. increase for old age pensioners, non-contributory, and the unemployment assistance classes also got a 2/6d. increase for themselves, 2/6d. for an adult dependant.  The non-contributory widows were granted an extra 2/6d. for themselves.</P>
    <P>From that it will be seen that in each year except in 1958, a steady extra amount is being provided in each Budget for social welfare classes.  It has been made quite clear by the Taoiseach that as far as the Government in the future are concerned, so far as we can improve social services, it is our intention to do so.  We find at Budget time that while everybody argues for increases in social welfare of this kind very many of these people are most reluctant to agree to provide the wherewithal by voting for the necessary additional taxation involved. The true test of belief in this principle is publicly standing over the provision of the additional moneys which such improvements in our social welfare involve.  I have emphasised that we are in no way complacent about these figures but, in so far as this Bill deals with an improvement in our social welfare, it is the amount we feel the <Col N="1436" /> economy can afford at the moment.  I am confident that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, will continue to improve the benefits step by step in the future.  I am grateful to the Seanad for the expeditious way they have dealt with this Bill on this Stage.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides that the remuneration of the Comptroller and Auditor General shall, with retrospective effect to 1st November, 1961, be the same as the normal salary for Secretary of a Department.  This general linking of the rate to the normal rate for Secretary of a Department from that date would enable eighth and ninth round pay increases to be made to the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose present rate of remuneration (£2,850) has not changed since it was last revised with effect from 1st January, 1959.  The revised rates payable to him would be £3,375 with effect from 1st November, 1961, and £3,780 with effect from 1st February, 1964.</P>
      <P>The office of Comptroller and Auditor General is provided for as the Seanad is aware, in Article 33 (1) of the Constitution, which reads:</P>
      <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's salary, like the remuneration of the judiciary, is determined by statute.  Up to 1962 his salary was increased on each occasion on which <Col N="1437" /> the remuneration of the judiciary was increased (1947, 1953 and 1959). Following the increase enacted for the judiciary in 1962, legislation would have been proposed for an increase in the Comptroller and Auditor General's remuneration were it not for the intervention of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> early in 1963.  The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1964, has recently authorised a further increase for the judiciary with effect from 1st February last.</P>
    <P>Since, 1923, when the Comptroller and Auditor General's salary was first fixed, it has been increased only on the occasions of and with effect from the same date as increases for the judiciary. However, although increases for the Comptroller and Auditor General have in timing been associated with those for the judiciary, their amount has been determined by reference to the normal rate for Secretary of a Department.  When first fixed in 1923, the Comptroller and Auditor General's rate was slightly in excess of that for Secretary.  The relationship between the two rates has varied from time to time over the years but the various reviews of the Comptroller and Auditor General's salary resulted in its coming approximately into line again with the Secretary rate.</P>
    <P>The fact that from time to time the Comptroller and Auditor General rate lagged behind the Secretary rate is attributable to the delay inherent in the method of adjusting his remuneration by statute, whereas the rate for the civil servants was, of course, increased by direct action.  While there was a case for the system of statutory adjustment&mdash;in that it highlighted the Comptroller and Auditor General's independent position&mdash;when changes were infrequent, such a system is in danger, in the light of the experience of recent years, to lead to unreasonable delays in future in adjusting his remuneration. To avoid such delays, provision is being made in the Bill for permanent identity between his rate and the normal Secretary rate; future adjustments in the latter rate would thus automatically become payable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>The Appropriation Bill, which is a recurrent annual measure, affords the Seanad an opportunity of discussing the various Estimates for the Supply Services which are contained in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Bill this year is in the usual form.  Section I supplements the issues from the Central Fund authorised in the Central Fund Act, 1964, and brings the issues from the Fund for 1964-65 up to £189.65 million which is the total of this year's Estimates Volume and the Supplementary and Additional Estimates passed to date.  This sum, together with £9.44 million in respect of Supplementary and Additional Estimates for 1963-64, is appropriated to the specific Supply Services as set out in Schedule B to the Bill. The Bill also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts as appropriations in aid of specific services as set out in Schedule B.  Section 2 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow amounts required for the Supply Services in addition to the amounts which this year's Central Fund Act authorised him to borrow.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to approve the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is certainly a master of brevity when he thinks brevity suits to his purpose. He can spread himself when he wants to.  As well as being a master of <Col N="1439" /> brevity, however, he is also a master of reply, particularly of irrelevant reply.</P>
      <P>This bill is the biggest bill that has so far been presented to the Oireachtas. I do not intend to deal with the economic aspect of it.  I intend to deal with another subject but, before dealing with the other topic, I should like to say that the expenditure envisaged in this Bill is taken from all taxpayers of every political persuasion and every type.  Arrangements have been made by the Minister's Government, through indirect as well as direct taxation, to ensure that everybody, no matter how poor, pays something in taxation.  It is only fair in that situation that expenditure should be for the whole people.</P>
      <P>Recently we have had principles laid down which seem to be at variance with that.  The Taoiseach, speaking last Monday night, said: &ldquo;The first condition for social and economic progress in Roscommon and Leitrim is that the people must vote for it&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Lenihan, said: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil must be given another seat in this constituency&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in Roscommon-Leitrim&mdash;&ldquo;if these counties are to get their share of the rising Government expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether we could take it that it is now the Fianna Fáil policy that unless people vote for Fianna Fáil they will not get their share of the rising Government expenditure?  The expenditure is rising and if you want to get your share of it, you must support the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party because no other Party, in their judgment, are worthy of support.  That is an entirely new principle. The Taoiseach modified it, but when you are speaking to people at an election, what they take from you is the clear statement I have read out, that the first condition for active progress is that the people must vote for them&mdash;meaning that the people must vote for Fianna Fáil&mdash;not the reservations that might be made in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the principle is only what you might call election enthusiasm, or perhaps election zeal, or perhaps fear of the result of an election, <Col N="1440" /> but there is another subject on which I should like to say a few words. I do not propose to make an exhaustive statement on it because when one talks on the subject at all one is immediately open to misunderstanding and misrepresentation.  The Taoiseach, in the course of his statement to the Dáil on 1st July, referred to the report of the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language and explained the immediate Government policy upon it.  Now, I welcome that statement but I do not welcome the fact that the Taoiseach took a strong political Party point of view.  Perhaps he was influenced by the imminence of the voting in Roscommon.  He said, as reported at column 1342 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>In the last general election, when Fine Gael tried to organise for itself, in competition with the Labour Party, the support of those who are hostile to Irish, or who have become indifferent to it, or are tiring of the effort, the Government went out to meet them too in the open.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention of the Taoiseach to make the Irish language a political issue in which Fianna Fáil is wrapped in the green cloak of Caitlín Ní hUallacháin, and Labour and Fine Gael are against it, that could be fatal for the Irish language.  He has another point.  While he is stoutly Gaelic and all for Irish, he angles for votes.  He has a great belief in a plan but it seems to me that the analogy between economics and either of the plans for economic development, and the Irish language revival movement is quite false.  There is a radical difference between them.  In the case of the Irish language, anybody who speaks as a realist, no matter what knowledge or experience he has, is open to be told he has not got the right spirit.  The right spirit is more important than knowledge or experience, but what has to be done in regard to the language is something quite different from what has to be done for economic development.</P>
    <P>We are not a bilingual country in the sense that Belgium is, or Switzerland, which indeed has four languages. <Col N="1441" /> We are not bilingual in that sense, that a great number of people perforce speak two languages.  The problem is to make English speakers speak Irish and we must go a good deal further than that.  You have to teach people Irish and you have to make them want to speak Irish and to understand its background and to make them love it. All that is very difficult.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's commonsense broke out at one particular point in his speech, even though he had displayed some over-zealous adherence to the Gaelic idea in the attempt to catch votes.  He said that if there were 1,000,000 people really interested in Irish in a real personal sense, the Government would have no need of a programme. In that he was right, and indeed the Taoiseach could have gone much lower than a million.  If there were 100,000 people interested in a real personal sense in the language, the Government would not need a programme and we would all have very little trouble.  The truth is that all kinds of people are willing to state that they are in favour of the Irish language and they do not mind who revives it&mdash;civil servants or others&mdash;but they themselves will have little to do with it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach at column 1341 said:</P>
    <P>The Government are now considering the contents of the White Paper to be published this year in order to implement a policy for completing the task of extending the use of Irish.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading that and knowing nothing about the facts, or about the state of affairs in the country, would come to the conclusion that a great deal of progress has been made and that the Taoiseach proposed to continue that progress to completion.  I do not think that any argument at all can be made to the extent that substantial progress has been made in the last 40 years.  Before I say a few words, which is all I propose to say, about this Commission I should like to take up their origins.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1942, on the Central Fund Bill, I suggested that there was a need for an inquiry and later on, the Irish National Teachers Organisation <Col N="1442" /> published a plan for Irish, and I spoke on that, but the then Minister for Education was not prepared to consider it at all.  In 1958 in this House, Senator Baxter moved and I spoke on a motion in these terms&mdash;it is reported at column 1452 of the Seanad Debates for 30th January, 1958:</P>
    <P>That in the opinion of Seanad Éireann the Government should institute an inquiry into&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the various steps taken since 1922 for the restoration of the Irish language,</P>
    <P>(b)  the measure of success which has been achieved, and</P>
    <P>(c)  what other or further steps or changes of methods may be desirable.</P>
    <P>On that motion everybody agreed that we had an excellent debate from different sides.  We had present the then Minister for Education, Deputy Jack Lynch, and the then Taoiseach, now President.  Both of them were vague and dealt with arguments which had been made in another place and on another subject, but did not deal with what was said here.  They did not make clear in their replies what was to be done and the Taoiseach appeared to want to restrict it to an inquiry into teaching only.  Senator Baxter and I were asked to see the Taoiseach and we did.  He asked us what kind of a committee we had in mind and we said a committee of seven or nine people.  He thought it should be representative but actually in the end 35 people were appointed to this Commission. Thirty-five people are close to being a public meeting.  The 35 were all representative people.  They were all committed to the objective and not only that&mdash;we are all committed, if you like&mdash;they were all fully committed to the methods which had been employed from 1922 to 1958.</P>
    <P>Their terms of reference would have allowed them to assess what had been accomplished.  Their terms of reference were not the same as those which were set out in our motion.  They were:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the position at present reached in the endeavour to <Col N="1443" /> secure the restoration of the Irish language</P>
    <P>&mdash;that again begs the question to some extent&mdash;</P>
    <P>to consider and to advise as to the steps that should now be taken by the community and the State to hasten progress towards that end.</P>
    <P>I think that would not have prevented the Commission from investigating what had been done, from setting out the various things that had been done and making some endeavour to discover what progress had been made. But they did not do that.  Their report appeared after nearly five years.  It is an interesting report.  The people themselves were interested, honest, sincere and they were enthusiastic, I suppose. But the report in a nutshell simply means that the objects we had in our minds, that we all had in our minds in 1922 and before it, are attainable and that they are attainable by reinforcement of the methods which have been employed up to now.  They give some very interesting historical facts and retrospects, most of them well known to interested parties but useful to have in one volume.  It is a mystery to me how any body of people could take five years to decide that what we want to do to revive the Irish language is to do more of what we had been doing already.</P>
    <P>The object they state in the Irish version is that the Irish language should become &ldquo;gnáth-mheán cumarsáide ag muintir na hÉireann athuair&rdquo;. This means to have the Irish language again as the ordinary medium of conversation for the ordinary people.  Does anybody realise what that means?  I frequently pass Milltown where Shamrock Rovers have their grounds.  At certain hours on Sunday afternoons, you can neither walk nor drive past when the crowds come out from the soccer match.  By what process and in what space of time is it expected these people will use Irish in their ordinary conversation? The same applies to Lansdowne Road.  The same applies to Croke Park.  At what time does anybody expect the people coming out of an <Col N="1444" /> All-Ireland hurling final will be all talking Irish?  At what time is it expected, for example, that the broadcast at 10 o'clock on Sunday nights about Gaelic games will be in Irish?  I was in hospital recently and I had a radio. I am not very given to radio, but in hospital I do things I do not do normally. I turned on the soccer news, although I am a real Gael&mdash;I never saw a soccer match or a rugby match in my life.  The truth is that except for an introductory sentence and a concluding sentence&mdash;&ldquo;Sin a bhfuil agam díbh anocht, a cháirde&rdquo;&mdash;the soccer broadcast contained as much Irish as the GAA broadcast.  In other words, it is not possible to broadcast only in Irish to people, because they do not want it.  The same thing applies to a programme I listen to constantly because, along with learning Irish, I was very enthusiastic and not a bad performer of traditional music at one time.  I listen in to the Gael-Linn programme at 8.30 on Monday mornings. They announce in the programme the results of their draw, but they never at any time trust the Irish language alone.  They say: &ldquo;An chéad duais&mdash; first prize&mdash;Bean Éamon Uí Chiosáin&rdquo;. Then they give the address.  Or they say &ldquo;An chéad duais&mdash;first prize&mdash; Bean Mhichíl Uí Aodha&rdquo;.  They never rely on the Irish language alone.</P>
    <P>You do not solve difficulties by ignoring them.  You do not answer arguments by classifying the person who puts up the argument.  The Irish report, which I have read rather carefully, is full of things which I used to hear long ago and which, as I grew up and as I made progress in the Irish language and other languages, became less and less full of meaning to me. &ldquo;Slánú na haigne dúchais.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  The preservation of the native mind.  A very amiable, amusing priest in Ring College, Dr. Richard Hennebry, was always talking about the &ldquo;aigne Ghaelach&rdquo;.  I never got to know what it was.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any necessity for any argument with regard to Irish about the kind of language it is&mdash;its antiquity, its flexibility, its beautiful literature.  There is only one reason for spending Irish money, time and effort <Col N="1445" /> on the Irish language and that is because it is the Irish language and it is there.  There is no other reason.  That is the reason that inspired the people who spent their lives working for it. It is the reason which inspired some of us to learn it&mdash;and to learn it at a time when it was not the medium through which they were making their living. I do not think there is any necessity for anybody making a report nowadays to proceed to give explanations as to why we ought to revive Irish.  It is a question of method.  The Commission are not precluded from going back and saying what had been done and what had been accomplished, but they made no such effort.</P>
    <P>During the last debate, it was stated that one of the great casualties in the Civil War was the Irish language. A member opposite, Senator Ó Donnabháin, said the atmosphere after the Civil War was detrimental to Irish.  In 1922 the people who were most enthusiastic about Irish were most bitterly and deeply divided.  To my mind, that did irreparable harm to the Irish language and to the enthusiasm for it.  In 1925, an effort was made&mdash;I was one of the people who made it&mdash;to achieve some kind of healing with regard to the Irish language part of it.  The President of the Gaelic League in 1922&mdash;he was a member of this House for a time&mdash;was one of the most vicious propagandists against his fellow countrymen and signed his documents in America always as &ldquo;P.T. McGinley, President of the Gaelic League of Ireland&rdquo;, which certainly brought the Gaelic League into politics of a very objectionable type.  In 1925 an attempt to revive the forces for Irish was broken up.</P>
    <P>One of the great analogies, which, I am sure, the Taoiseach thinks is correct, is that the British Government destroyed the Irish language and that an Irish Government can restore it.  I do not want to give a history lecture, but it is very doubtful if it is true that the British Government destroyed the Irish language.  They certainly got assistance from circumstances.  But, whether they did or not, it is absolutely true that an Irish Government cannot <Col N="1446" /> restore it.  They cannot take in reverse the measures about the Irish language the British Government took because the Irish Government are responsible to an Irish Parliament and the Irish people and the British Government were not.  I do not think you can simply say that the British did certain things and we can do the same, apply the same compulsions.</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's plan&mdash;perhaps we should postpone any proper discussion until we see the plan&mdash;there are a great many points which one could pursue.  Whether bilingualism is a good or bad thing I am not sure, and in this context I am not particularly interested. I am prepared, as I was prepared in 1922, to accept harm being done for a period if it would result in a real revival of the Irish language.  I would not mind harm being done in those circumstances. People who say we are a bilingual country are quite wrong.  Unfortunately, we are not a bilingual country.  One of the most potent forces working against the Irish language is that English is the language of Irish nationalism, including Patrick Pearse.  Everyone knows of Patrick Pearse's oration in English over the grave of O'Donovan Rossa.  Everyone who propagates political doctrines propagates them in English.  I do not think the words in the Constitution of 1922 or the Constitution of 1938 really make much difference.</P>
    <P>Changing people from using one language to another is a matter of very great difficulty.  We can think of a number of things we do and wonder is there any use in doing them.  Where I live, new houses are being built and we have new names like Greenlea Road and Lakelands Park.  How would you put them into Irish?  Is it worth while to put them into Irish?  We have in this building a most excellent translation staff.  I was one of the people who founded it.  They are first-class people.  They know Irish, and they have translated Acts of Parliament into Irish.  They have overcome immense difficulties in rendering modern legal jargon into Irish, which is a medieval and a rural language.  When we started this translation staff, the <Col N="1447" /> then Clerk of the Dáil, Colm Ó Murchadha, and I thought the time would arrive when Irish would be freely used in the courts and that all these legal documents would be an advantage and would be of great interest. Now, after 40 years, Irish is not used in the courts.  I wonder whether the translation staff with their experience, their ability, and their energy, could not more usefully do something other than translating into Irish legal documents which will never be read in Irish.  So far as I remember, the only use that was ever made of the Irish version of the Constitution or of Acts of Parliament was to argue in court on the basis that the Irish version was different from the English version.</P>
    <P>There is also a most foolish idea that you can lecture through the medium of Irish if you have the Irish terminology.  You can lecture through the medium of Irish only if you know Irish.  The real snag is not the terminology but the getting of people for universities or schools who have a sufficient knowledge of Irish and the subjects to teach them through Irish. What is sometimes happening is that people who have not got a sound knowledge of Irish are supplied with the terms, and then go and give lectures. That is not rational or reasonable.</P>
    <P>I can give the example of a single sentence I wrote to my son who was a solicitor: Is agat a ba cheart é seo a bheith.  Quite a number of solicitors could not read that sentence.  Some of them could not read it, they said, because it was in the English script, as it is called, but when it was pronounced slowly, they could not understand it.  The supposition that, having passed a test, a solicitor can take instructions from a client in Irish is wholly unfounded.  It is not true.  He cannot do it.  It is possible to know a language well in a certain sphere, and not know it in another sphere.  An example is that the first French Minister who came here, who was a charming man, was understood by nearly everyone.  He talked international politics.  He was very gracious and he spoke very slowly.  People who tried <Col N="1448" /> to talk to his wife found the position quite different.  Her vocabulary was full of concrete nouns.  She explained how she went into shops and could not get certain things.  People who tried to talk to her wilted.  I watched them wilt, so to speak.  People can talk Irish for certain purposes and not talk it for other purposes.</P>
    <P>What progress have we made? Another example is that I was annoyed at one time at something someone said, and I replied to the debate in Irish in this House, and I got a version of what I said, which was not comparable with my words.  I was asked to repeat what I had said but I could not repeat it because I had spoken with a certain amount of impatience. If one talks in cliches and talks slowly, one will be understood.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach is issuing the White Paper on the Irish language, I hope he will remember first and foremost what the position is and not what he conceives it to be.  He spoke of continuing the progress which has been made to its completion.  The truth is that anyone who was alive in 1922&mdash; and I think the Minister will agree with me in this&mdash;envisaged under an Irish State much greater progress than has been made.  The school is not as important as it was then.  Immense efforts have been made in the schools. Teachers have done amazing work in primary and secondary schools, and I do not think the results are commensurate with the work they have done.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to talk about getting better methods of teaching.  The real problem is not the method of teaching, but how to preserve the Irish that is learned in school when the person leaves school.  I know that anyone who talks as I am talking now will be challenged and told that he is getting tired, that he has not the right spirit, or something like that.  I have seen my children and grandchildren, and I have seen the children and grandchildren of my friends who are enthusiasts for the language.  For 30 years I have had knowledge of people coming into University College, Dublin with Irish. I am dissatisfied with the progress that has been made and I am certain no <Col N="1449" /> further progress will be made go bhféacfaimíd idir an dá shúil ar an bhfírinne, that is, until we look the truth straight between the eyes.</P>
    <P>This report is interesting, and it was made by people who are genuinely interested in the language.  The fault I find with it is that it fails to look the facts in the face, and until we look the facts in the face there can be no real progress.  However, I shall leave over greater details until I see the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the cause of the Irish language was very dear to the hearts of a great many Irishmen.  It would be very difficult to make it a success even if we had unanimity on it, but if it becomes a political bone to &ldquo;chaw&rdquo; on, I do not think any success will be possible at all.  Some people adopt a &ldquo;holier-than-thou&rdquo; attitude which is very unrewarding.  If we want to make any progress, we cannot succeed by shutting our eyes to the facts.  I hope the White Paper will be sane and realistic, and will prove worthy of support.  One can be an enthusiast and a realist at the same time.  The people who refuse to face the realities are taking refuge from the facts and from facing them.  That is a very bad policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the two occasions in the year when the Seanad has the opportunity of discussing public expenditure.  On the Finance Bill, we discussed expenditure in general and on this debate we have the opportunity of discussing particular objects, if we wish.  We cannot go over the whole of the Estimates in this debate.  Actually, many of these Estimates took several days in the Dáil.  They are all more or less squeezed into this one Appropriation Bill.  This is the only time they come to the Seanad and one could not possibly cover the whole field here.  It would mean a debate on the whole of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Finance Bill, each individual item of Government expenditure may be very easy to justify and may be very difficult to criticise but the total may be very large.  The sum total may perhaps present a bill for the Minister for Finance which it may <Col N="1450" /> be very difficult to reduce or to abolish each individual article.  It is very much easier for us in the Seanad to suggest things on which more money could be spent than things on which less money should be spent.</P>
    <P>There is one consideration regarding Government economy which it is not unfair to make.  Is it possible that the whole machinery of Government is not itself unduly expensive?  Is it possible that the whole machinery of the collection of taxation is not unduly expensive? The formulation of policy, and so on, has grown up from the time when the Government finances in every country were far less important than they are today.  It is just possible that the Minister might be able to effect some economies in his Department. Every business nowadays calls in industrial consultants.  No business, however efficient, is ashamed to call in people who may be able to improve its efficiency.</P>
    <P>I would suggest in a very general way that one method of effecting some economies in the total Budget would be by an overhaul of the method of public administration itself.  The machinery may possibly be a bit outmoded. A great deal has been done. I should like to refer to the good work of the Institute of Public Administration which has done a great deal to improve the art of public administration but a good deal more needs to be done.  Whilst I shall not suggest cutting down expenditure on any broad front, I suggest that the whole machinery of collection might itself be made more efficient and, therefore, a certain amount of cuts in public expenditure might be caused by that means.</P>
    <P>What I say is closely related to the type of person in the public service and that is closely related to the type of education people receive before they enter the public service.  That brings me to consider the question of education as a whole and the few remarks I propose to make on this Bill will be on the subject of education.  I do not propose to refer to any other Vote and I do not propose to say a great deal about it.</P>
    <P>The amount spent on education has <Col N="1451" /> been doubled during the first programme for economic expansion. Therefore, nobody can say that the Government have not been aware of the importance of education.  It is just a matter of interest at this stage, in referring to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, to consider the test of proper Government expenditure on education.  I suggest the answer would be that the sort of education we give is the sort of education necessary for the implementation of the Second Programme because the Second Programme for the moment, has been accepted generally as the aim of Government policy.  I do not propose to discuss the Second Programme in detail even in regard to education (1) because it would take a very long time and (2) because I do not think people in general have the time or the opportunity to study the Second Programme since it appeared in more detail a few days ago.  There are, however, certain things which I think can be said about it.</P>
    <P>Some of the most acute critics of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in the press have criticised it on the grounds that the amount to be spent on education is inadequate to reach the targets of agricultural and industrial output.  If that should be so, obviously the amount spent on education should be increased.  Everybody is prepared to admit the importance of education.  On page 193 of Part II of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, there is a very strong passage indeed:</P>
    <P>A society which rates highly spiritual and moral values, and seeks to develop the mental and physical well-being of its people, will devote a substantial part of its resources to education.  There are, in addition, social and economic considerations which reinforce the claim of education to an increasing share of expanding national resources.  Improved and extended educational facilities help to equalise opportunities by enabling an increasing proportion of the community to develop their potentialities and raise their personal standards of living. <Col N="1452" /> Expenditure on education is an investment in the fuller use of the country's primary resource&mdash;its people&mdash;which can be expected to yield increasing returns in terms of economic progress.</P>
    <P>A similar commendation on the necessity for education is to be found in the Taoiseach's speech last Wednesday, as reported in the Official Report, column 1338 of 1st July, 1964, when he was moving the Estimate for his Department.  He said:</P>
    <P>This brings me to the subject of education.  A remarkable feature of Irish society in recent years has been the lively public interest displayed in regard to the improvement and extension of facilities for education. Experience everywhere, in every country, seems to indicate that as the economic circumstances of a nation continue to improve one of the most direct consequences is a demand for increased educational facilities reflecting a very healthy impulse among parents to secure for their children a better educational foundation than they themselves were able to afford.</P>
    <P>I could quote more of that but I think I have quoted enough to indicate that the framers of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and the Taoiseach are enthusiastically in favour of a great deal of education in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have in this discussion is that we cannot really debate the question of education and the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> until certain reports which are now being prepared are available to be read.  There are three important reports.  Again, I refer to page 193 of the Second Programme:</P>
    <P>The proposals&mdash;</P>
    <P>for further education</P>
    <P>&mdash;are necessarily incomplete&mdash;and, in some respects, tentative&mdash;pending the completion of three studies at present in progress.  These are the Investment in Education Survey, the Scientific Research and Technology Survey and the investigations of the Commission on Higher Education. <Col N="1453" /> The first two are conducted jointly with OECD.  The Investment in Education Survey, which will be completed later this year, will determine the needs of an expanding Irish economy in skilled manpower at all levels over the next ten to fifteen years, assess the investment in educational services required and suggest alternative economic ways of meeting these needs; the other survey, which will be completed in 1965, will assess the need for scientific research and technology in relation to economic growth; the Commission on Higher Education, which hopes to report before the end of 1964, is investigating all aspects of higher education.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on this subject must be tentative, and not conclusive, pending the issue of these reports.  The only thing I should like to say is that we all hope, when these reports are published, whatever suggestions they make for the extension in education at every level will be included in the official Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>At I have already said, expenditure on education has been increasing in recent years and is still increasing.  The Finance Bill this year makes adequate allowances for education expenditure. I should like to mention one or two of the outstanding recommendations of the Second Programme to indicate to the Seanad the broad views which are being taken in regard to this very important matter.  It is recommended, in respect of primary education, that there should be more schools, more teachers, that the school leaving age should be raised and that the school week should be lengthened.  There are also important recommendations, which have been put forward by the Government, for post-primary comprehensive schools in certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to that, I should like to refer to the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil last Wednesday.  He says, at column 1340:</P>
    <P>The Government must have regard in the field of education as in all other fields to the rights of all members of the community.  Our <Col N="1454" /> acceptance of this fact has led us to make provision so as to ensure adequate facilities for post-primary education where they do not now exist or where they are inadequate to meet the public needs.  This resulted in the decision to establish comprehensive post-primary day schools in the areas where they are needed, mainly in the west, north west and the south west.</P>
    <P>That will be a very valuable aid to the educational facilities of the country.</P>
    <P>In regard to secondary education, it is foreseen in the Programme that the number of children receiving secondary education will continue to increase, as it has been increasing in recent years, that the number of schools and the number of teachers will also be increased, that the academic year will be lengthened by the shortening of the vacations, that capitation grants will be increased, that the teachers' incremental salaries will also be increased, that there will be more scholarships available for higher education and that, in particular, the teaching of science will be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In regard to vocational education, the Second Programme has a fair amount to say.  In the first place, they recommend the setting up of a Technical School Leaving Certificate which will testify to the satisfactory completion of a course of general and technical education that will fit the holder for entrance to certain university facilities or advanced courses in a college of technology.  On page 205, there is provision made for bringing industry and technical education closer together.  It says:</P>
    <P>In addition to providing technical education to meet the demands of industry, the aim of Government policy will be to ensure that industry, by defining its needs and cooperating in the measures required to meet them, will make full use of the vocational schools to develop a skilled labour force.  Liaison between industry and the Vocational education authorities has heretofore not been very extensive.  An important advance has been made with the establishment of An Cheard-Chomhairle. <Col N="1455" /> Industry and the vocational education authorities are represented on this body, which defines the conditions to be fulfilled in apprenticeship training for designated trades.</P>
    <P>The object of these measures is to ensure that a lack of skilled manpower will not limit the modernisation of industry and its adaptation to competitive conditions in the years ahead.  The facilities proposed will be expanded in step with the demands of industry for technical skills of all kinds.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to weary the Seanad by going further into this matter.  I simply want to indicate what the Second Programme says in regard to education. The chapter on Education is smaller than the other chapters.  This is so, pending the issue of these reports, but it does cover a very wide field and holds out great hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The only other point I should like to make is that success in every type of education, primary, secondary or vocational depends on the type of person who actually gets it.  As many of these people in the future, more than the present, will be graduates, this will depend to a very large extent on university education.  I wish to recognise the generosity of the Government to the Irish universities and to state that it would be unreasonable to expect any further help until the report of the Commission on Higher Education is published later this year.  More and more graduates are being employed in both public administration and private business.  Therefore, it becomes a matter of national importance that the right type of graduate should be provided.</P>
    <P>If I were to discuss what is the right type of graduate, it would involve me in a very long debate.  If I were to discuss the best type of education to give the young people to prepare them for business and industrial life, it would also involve me in a long debate. There are various schools of thought on this.  Some people still believe that a good general education with a minimum degree of specialisation may be the best foundation and that boys or <Col N="1456" /> young women who get that sort of education will be able to absorb specialised knowledge easily when their minds have been trained.  I must say this is a view with which I have considerable sympathy.</P>
    <P>There is just one matter on which I should like to say a word, that is, whatever may be the best type of general education for young people as a whole&mdash;it is a matter on which there is a very considerable difference of opinion&mdash;everybody is agreed on the need today for provision of some higher education in management. Great strides have been made in this matter in the United States and in Great Britain and I am glad to say measures have been taken in this country to provide the same type of higher education for business.  I should like to call attention to the provision of management education, both at undergraduate and post-graduate level in the two Dublin colleges, and in particular to the institution of a new degree&mdash;the Master of Business Administration, MBA.  This post-graduate course is meant to qualify people who come up in business from other types of professions, accountancy or secretarial work, to take part in the higher management of business.  It is generally agreed by everybody who studies this matter, and it has been studied very widely in recent times by the people concerned in the Dublin colleges, which are the only two for which I can speak, that the results are excellent in other countries and that this is something that ought to be done.  The benefits that can be reaped by industry from this type of education will be very great.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work being done in many directions by the several institutes which have been set up in Dublin in recent years.  I could not name them all.  They are too numerous.  I should like to name two or three, especially from the business point of view.  The Irish Management Institute, which has now been in existence for over 12 years, has done very valuable work indeed.  The Irish National Productivity Committee has also done a great deal to increase the standard of efficiency <Col N="1457" /> in industrial production.  As I stated earlier, the Institute of Public Administration is doing a lot to improve the quality of people employed in the public services.  There are certain other institutes of the same kind doing equally valuable work but I do not intend to weary the Seanad by enumerating them.  I should like to acknowledge the service the Government have done these institutes by the financial help provided in the past, and to express the hope that that financial help will be increased in the future as the work and the needs of all the institutes increase.</P>
    <P>The educational system of the country must be regarded as a whole. Primary, secondary, vocational and university are inter-related, each part helping to influence the others.  Good primary and secondary education provides good material for the universities. The universities, on the other hand, provide good teachers for the primary and secondary schools.  The same is true of the vocational schools.  The institutes which I have mentioned, although they do a certain amount of teaching, are mainly engaged in research. Teaching and research are two sides of education which are intimately associated.  Each side helps the other and it is impossible to say how much research must be undertaken in any particular place.  It must be done in the universities and in the institutes, and indeed is being increasingly done in private business.  On the whole, the educational field must be regarded as one.</P>
    <P>There is one particular institution I should like to mention.  I happen to be vice-chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Library, and I should like the Minister to indicate what steps have been taken to increase the accommodation available for the Library. The Government have purchased a site for a new building, but, as far as one can discover, nothing else has been done and the present National Library is overcrowded to the point of inconvenience for readers and almost of danger to its contents.  Immense collections of valuable manuscript material are packed into a very close space.  The Library has nothing at all like adequate accommodation. <Col N="1458" /> No educational system can be regarded as being complete without the provision of adequate reading material. Public libraries in every country are an essential part of the educational system and in Ireland, the National Library has played an immense part in the education of the country for several years.  It is now becoming overcrowded and inadequate for its tasks, and I would ask the Minister to be good enough to indicate when he proposes to take some steps towards erecting a new building adequate for the needs of the many readers who will have recourse to this valuable institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Brien, I should like to concentrate on the Vote for the Department of Education since I consider, and obviously I am not alone in this opinion, it is universally held that the educational service is the most basic service in any country and that the efficiency of other services depends upon the efficiency of the Department of Education and of the system of education.  There is a vital link between the standard of education and standards generally in any nation.  Washington surveys over the past few years, have eminently proven that fact but it should be obvious to anybody that such is the case.  Our standards in art, culture, literature, science, industry, and so forth, all depend on our standard of education.</P>
      <P>Since we were here this time last year speaking on the Appropriation Bill, a considerable advance has been made on the educational front and many of the things to which we referred then and in the previous year have now been accomplished.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> makes reference to the improvement of the pupil-teacher ratio which should make for a considerable reduction in the size of classes.  In future, classes will be reduced to manageable proportions and so a higher standard can be attained with greater individual attention to the needs of slow-learning children especially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference is also made to a Research Unit in St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra.  Teachers, over a number <Col N="1459" /> of years, have asked for a national council for educational research, like that which exists in Scotland.  It is extraordinary that we have research in so many different fields&mdash;agriculture, medicine, industry, and so forth&mdash;but there has never been any research in the basic service of education.</P>
    <P>The promise of acceleration in the matter of school building and reconstruction is also very heartening, even if there is a long way to go before we have achieved an ideal situation.  It is important that we should have fine school buildings because children are impressionable and if they are kept for many hours each day in squalid surroundings, naturally their outlook will be affected.  Churchill said when the House of Commons was restored after the war&mdash;it had been damaged in a bombing raid&mdash;&ldquo;We shape our buildings and our buildings shape us.&rdquo; It is especially important that children should be brought up in bright, airy surroundings.  This would have an influence on their attitude towards the houses in which they would like to live themselves later on.</P>
    <P>The reference to the provision of teaching aids is also very welcome. The Irish National Teachers Organisation have been conducting courses in visual aids over a number of years and are very pleased to see the Department taking a realistic look on what is a commonplace matter in the educational systems of other countries.</P>
    <P>The most important statement in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is that which deals with the raising of the school-leaving age, which it is anticipated, will be raised to 15 years by 1970.  Those of us who have experience of teaching children in the age group 12 to 14 years will realise how important it is to have an advance of this kind.  We have seen too many children leave school immature and many of them unfortunately have had to emigrate.  Children at that impressionable age experience those mood swings of mind&mdash;the April weather of the mind, psychologists call it&mdash; sometimes they are withdrawn, shy, sometimes violent, brash and forward. It is important children should have <Col N="1460" /> the stabilising influence of the school at that time when many characters are made or broken.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that children should be kept at school until they are 16 years at least, until they have negotiated that perilous period of adolescence.  The tendency in every country throughout the world is towards more and more schooling for children.  Many countries have been experiencing difficulties which have arisen through juvenile delinquency because of lack of stabilising disciplines at that age.  Society is no longer the closely-knit community it was in the past: there is a considerable relaxation of discipline in the home. Children also have to undergo the influences of so many inimical agencies at the present time, such as the cinema and television, so it is all the more important they should be kept at school longer.  We think that even to postpone the raising of the school-leaving age to 1970 is running a great risk because by that time several hundreds of thousands of children will have left our schools immature.  We all have grave responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have referred to some significant advances made since we discussed the Appropriation Bill of 1963.  However, we should like to have some assurances that there is to be a reinvestigation of the overall picture of education as a unit.  We have had a report on primary education up to the age of 12 years and there has been a report on secondary education, but we feel the Council of Education should have been enabled to examine education as a whole. Those individual reports may only serve to consolidate the present position, which is untidy.  The three branches of education do not seem to be articulating efficiently and effectively, one with the other.</P>
    <P>In other countries the legislation governing education is codified.  There are considerable difficulties here be cause there are people who have influence in corners of education who are not prepared to relinquish their grip.  It will take a very brave Minister for Education, it will take a very brave Government to tidy up the educational <Col N="1461" /> scene here.  It is something that should be aimed at because where this untidiness exists, there will never be unity in education and, as Senator O'Brien has pointed out, education must be considered as a unit.  There should not be bits of education here and bits of it there; there should be a system of education which caters for the child from the kindergarten school right on into the area of adult education.</P>
    <P>Here we have a policy of drift. Children are leaving national schools without any idea as to their ability, their aptitude for either vocational or secondary education.  People will reply that children sit for the primary certificate examination but, as an examination for selection, I say it is absolutely worthless.  It has done an immense amount of damage to education in this country, and I speak from experience because I have taught the same age group for a long number of years&mdash; the class doing the primary certificate examination.</P>
    <P>The teacher, in spite of himself, is inclined to narrow down the field of education to the three subjects with which the primary certificate is concerned. In spite of himself, he concentrates on three subjects and tends unwittingly to neglect the others.  If it is the object of the Government to add to the curriculum and if the primary certificate examination is to be retained, it will only add to the number of subjects that will be taught but not with the same emphasis as the three necessary for the written examination.</P>
    <P>That is another fault with the primary certificate: it is a written examination.  Therefore, the teacher is inclined to concentrate on written work.  People mainly communicate with each other orally rather than in writing, and to teach children in a concentrated way towards presenting knowledge in written form is bad.  It would be far better if children were taught to express themselves orally, fluently and correctly, rather than train them to become experts in the presentation of written knowledge only.</P>
    <P>Another flaw in the primary certificate is that it is a compulsory examination. Those who have studied educational <Col N="1462" /> systems in other countries have found that our primary certificate examination is the only compulsory examination in the world.  All our children, be they brilliant or backward, have to sit for this examination. It produces a situation in which the teacher knows a child has not the ability to pass the examination because unfortunately Providence did not endow it with sufficient ability to pass even examinations requiring a lower standard.  Yet that child has to be presented for the examination.  The teacher knows that the child must fail and his parents at that stage know he must fail; yet he has to prove officially he will fail.  We think it very cruel to compel a child who, in the opinion of everybody, must fail an examination, to sit for that examination and to send him out with the brand of failure on him.  He carries all the symptoms of failure already, due to the fact that he has not the inherent ability to get over this hurdle, but to send him out branded as a failure only adds to his handicap.</P>
    <P>The examination also tends to have a constrictive effect upon the teacher's approach to education.  He is inclined to train children to pass this examination by this type of thing&mdash;by telling children they will get half the answer in the question and the other half in the comprehension test which is presented to them.  The higher reaches of teaching are often neglected in this kind of trickery which teachers have to indulge in, in order to get children through the examination.</P>
    <P>In the matter of post-primary education, as Senator O'Brien has pointed out, it is most important that as many people as possible should be in a position to avail themselves of further education and if the State does not ensure that they can avail themselves of this further, post-primary, education then we are in danger of losing a precious part of our resources of talent.</P>
    <P>In some other countries now, the tendency is to give equality of opportunity to all people irrespective of means.  It may be pointed out that here we have a very generous system of scholarships and that this system is expanding.  That is all very fine but <Col N="1463" /> people who have experience of teaching have often been rather suspicious of this question of forcing children into higher education through scholarships because it has led to a system of cramming and often the people who do succeed in getting scholarships through the type of coaching I have referred to are not the best types for further education.</P>
    <P>We have seen children come out of these educational hothouses and go into universities where one must engage in speculative study, where the pressures are off and they have flopped, whereas people who have come from schools where there is very little pressure but where speculative study is encouraged and children are guided to work on their own initiative, to find out for themselves and to think for themselves, come out on top in their studies.  So a system of scholarships is not the answer to the problem.  We must ensure that children with aptitude and ability for further education are given the opportunity to avail themselves of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the curriculum in the secondary school at the present time, it is very wide indeed, and very comprehensive, but, unfortunately, the conductors of secondary schools have not been able to teach the full range of the curriculum, due to the fact that secondary schools have not been properly financed in the past.  The grants to secondary schools have not been at all adequate and schools found themselves in the position that they were only able to employ a small staff to cover the usual range of subjects taken in the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations.  If they had more finance, they could employ extra staff to teach extra subjects, especially in the science range, which would widen the work of secondary schools immensely and confer considerable benefit on the community.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to the type of graduate who would come from the university.  On that matter, it is important that some effort should be made to link the teacher training colleges with the universities.  The universities originally were for the production of <Col N="1464" /> teachers.  The students there aimed at the Master of Arts degree and a certificate or licence to teach was conferred by the university.  But, in the 19th century, when there was such a demand for popular education, teachers had to be produced quickly and training colleges were set up as <i>ad hoc</i> establishments for the production of teachers.  The time is long past for the discontinuance of teachers' training colleges as such.  Teachers who have gone through the training colleges and who have also gone through the university are in a position to make a comparison between what goes on in the teachers' training college and what goes on in the university from the point of view of the equipment to teach. Whilst the training college does give a wonderful training in the art of teaching, the course in the training college is narrow, even in the subject of education itself, and very little reference is made to the history and philosophy of education, whereas, in the Higher Diploma Course of the university there is little emphasis on the techniques of actual class teaching but the main emphasis is on the psychology of teaching and also on the history and philosophy of education. We do think that a fusion of the two courses would be most beneficial and we would have a better teaching corps at all levels.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, there is only one art of teaching.  It may be varied in accordance with the age group being taught but, really, there is only one art, one science, of imparting knowledge to children.  We think there should be a common qualification in the art of teaching and the time has come when we should seriously consider linking the teachers' training colleges and universities.</P>
    <P>No system of education can rise above the level of its teachers.  If you supply the most wonderful school buildings and the most excellent curricula and the most wonderful equipment, all falls to the ground, all is in vain, if the teachers have not confidence in their own qualifications, if they are not appreciative of their own status and the importance of their work to the community.  No system of education <Col N="1465" /> can rise above the level of the teaching profession.  It is important, therefore, that if teachers do consider that they should have a university background their opinions should be very seriously considered.</P>
    <P>In the past, education was mainly an affair of the family and standards were established by the community, a closely knit community.  We think that in the future the school and the teacher will have to play a vital role in developing society.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of education to which I should refer particularly, that is, the education of the mentally handicapped. Over the past few years, spectacular strides have been made in this field and many new institutions, schools, day centres and residential schools, have been established but we have a long way to go yet and we all as members of the community owe in justice and charity a debt to society in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the past, we were inclined to write off these people as worthless members of the community and no one had any great interest in them.  That involved a great loss to society.  People who have studied the problem of mental handicap and handicap in general have found that many of the people who in the past would have been discarded, the apples, as it were, have been trained and meshed into society as competent and efficient people and, instead of being a loss to the community, they have been a gain.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister for Education has taken steps to have this field investigated but there is one aspect of it to which I should like to refer and it is one in connection with which I receive considerable correspondence. It is the dilemma in which parents find themselves when they have one of these unfortunate children in the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made reference to the special needs of the mentally handicapped and I was referring to the position of parents of mentally handicapped children.  It is quite plain to anybody that when a <Col N="1466" /> mentally handicapped child exists in a family, there is a great source of worry and concern in the minds of the parents about the child's future.  Many parents have not the means to send such children to institutions and schools for the mentally handicapped and they have to leave these children at home, neglected, uneducated and with no definite future ahead of them.  I would appeal to the Minister for Finance to exercise his influence in his own Department and in the Department of Education with a view to ensuring that no handicapped child is, through lack of means, deprived of education and training so that he can take his place as an efficient citizen in the community.</P>
      <P>One aspect of education to which I should like to refer particularly is concerned with vocational guidance.  On a previous occasion, we had a discussion here on this matter.  Vocational guidance is considered an essential part of any educational system; without it the system is inclined to involve drift into employment in a haphazard or fortuitous manner.  Children should have an opportunity before leaving school of an examination of the careers and forms of employment available.  At the moment such information is not available to children, except through the goodwill of heads of colleges who have established their own types of vocational guidance.  At Leaving Certificate stage in various colleges information is made available to children through lectures by people in the professions as to the types of work available outside. It is an essential part of an educational system that children should be guided or advised as to the type of work for which they might be suited. At the moment in the national schools the child passes the Primary Certificate and just walks out into the community. The question of securing employment is entirely a matter of chance.  It might be a chance meeting between the father and some employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such a haphazard situation, children are inclined to take up positions in which they have no interest whatsoever and for which they may not be at all suitable.  They remain in these positions for some time and eventually <Col N="1467" /> they emigrate.  This leads to a great deal of instability in the community. If guidance were available for children at the school-leaving stage, they would have a better idea of what was ahead of them.  They would be happier in the type of work they might select.  They might be more suited to the type of work into which they would enter because they would have some idea as to their aptitude for that work.  Generally speaking, it would lead to a more harmonious community to have as many people as possible engaged in the type of work for which they were suitable and in which they had an interest.</P>
    <P>In other communities abroad, this vocational guidance is available and, for instance, through the Ministry of Labour in Britain and in Northern Ireland information as regards the types of jobs or careers can be obtained by a parent on application to any Ministry of Labour office.  Various pamphlets covering different types of employment are provided setting out the educational standards required, the periods of training, and the future prospects in that type of employment, remuneration and so on.  No child in Britain or Northern Ireland goes blindly into a job.  He knows what is ahead by way of a preparation course and by way of remuneration.  He is sure of his future.  Naturally, one cannot ensure that every child will continue in the type of employment he selects but by and large there is a better chance that he will persevere in the type of work that he selects and about which he knows something. Follow-up surveys have been made in countries which have this type of guidance and advice and they show that those children who were aware of the nature of the work they selected have a far better chance of remaining in that type of employment and are happier in it.</P>
    <P>People often suggest that parents are the best persons to advise their children as to the type of employment they should select.  Experience has shown that often parents are the worst types to advise their children in this regard because parents naturally are ambitious; they want to see their <Col N="1468" /> children do better than themselves and they are often inclined to push children into professions to which the children are not suited and for which they have no aptitude or ambition.  This leads to a good deal of unhappiness, not alone for the children but ultimately for the parents themselves.  Parents are inclined to fulfil their own emotional needs in the careers of their children. They want their children to be something they could not be themselves perhaps because they had not the opportunity, the means or the ability. They imagine their children should have the ability and because of that, are inclined to bring pressure to bear on them.  The suggestion that parents are the best persons to select careers for their children is not, therefore, valid.</P>
    <P>Those who have been examining this whole question of placement are of opinion that much of the drift into employment in Ireland, and the drift out of the Irish community through emigration ultimately, could be stemmed by having career advice available. Some people are inclined to look with a certain amount of suspicion on vocational guidance.  They say nobody should be put in the position of taking a child by the back of the neck and steering it into a particular job. Vocational guidance need not be formalised but it should be of such a nature that a child will get direction, a kind of lead, into the type of employment to which he is most suited. It is something that the Government should pay some attention to because it has paid dividends in other countries and has created a situation of stability in the community.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to make one appeal to the Minister on the matter of industrial schools.  I realise that capitation grants to industrial schools have been increased but the experience of conductors of those schools shows that the capitation grants are totally inadequate.  I have here a table supplied to me by the conductor of such a school.  In 1953 he had 175 boys and his total expenses were £19,093 covering his full range of expenditure for staff, clothing, repairs, flour and so on.  His total receipts were £17,300. <Col N="1469" /> The position since then has gradually deteriorated, due to rising costs.  With 106 boys in 1963, his total expenses were £23,700 and his total receipts £19,800.  Running that institution over the past seven years has led to an overdraft position: in 1956, it was just short of £1,000; in 1957, it was £2,600; in 1958, £2,600; in 1959, £4,000; in 1960, £3,600; in 1961, £5,600; in 1962, £6,800 and in 1963, £7,800.</P>
    <P>These conductors are doing a tremendous job of work, mainly on a voluntary basis, for the community. They are not money seekers.  They are giving a service which is not adequately rewarded.  Were it not for the fact that they are members of religious orders, having the goodwill of sympathetic bank managers, they really could not keep going at all.  I know a number of industrial schools are now contemplating switching over to other types of education because they find it impossible to carry on on the money available to them.  I appeal to the Minister to examine that situation.</P>

Cloisimid chomh minic san iad go bhfuilimid ag éirí tuirseach díobh agus is dóigh liom féin gur ceart dúinn aghaidh do thúirt ar an aimsir atá le teacht agus féachaint cad is féidir linn a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá breiseanna áirithe i Leabhar seo na Meastachán agus cé go bhfuil daoine dhá lochtú níor chuala éinne dhá rá gur ceart dúinn iad do scriosadh amach.  Níor chuireadar a méar ar aon cheann acu chun iarraidh orainn gan iad do bheith sa Bhille agus, dar ndó, má bhíonn daoine ag gearán mar gheall ar mhéadaithe an Bhille ba cheart dóibh a theaspáint dúinn cár cheart don Aire an gearradh a dhéanamh.  Má táimíd dáírire sin é an rud ba cheart dúinn a dhéanamh ach níl éinne dhá rá gur ceart dúinn breiseanna eile a bheith againn seachas na breiseanna atá i <Col N="1470" /> gceist i Leabhar na Meastachán agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh daoine eile fós dhá rá nár cheart dúinne aon laghdú a dhéanamh ach tá daoine ann agus bíonn siad ag iarraidh seirbhísí áirithe d'fheabhsú ach ansan nuair a thagann an t-am chun an t-airgead do chur ar fáil do na seirbhísí sin gheibheann siad locht ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas mar gheall air.  Ar ndó, ní féidir ach oiread áirithe seirbhísí do thúirt.  Ní féidir feabhas do chur ar chúrsaí talamhaíochta; ní féidir feabhas do chur ar chúrsaí oideachais; ní féidir feabhas do chur ar aon iarrachtaí atá dhá ndéanamh ag an Rialtas gan a thuille airgid.  Tá sé sin soiléir agus rud simplí is ea é.</P>
    <P>Is ceart súil do choimeád ar an méid airgid a caitear sa tír seo&mdash;súil ghéar ach ní h-é sin an rud ar fad.  Ní foláir féachaint chuige go gcuirfí an méid airgid atá i gceist chun tairbhe na ndaoine.  Tá sé sin chomh tábhachtach leis an rud eile.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfadh an tAire teacht isteach ag iarraidh orainn leath den airgid do thúirt dó agus b'fhéidir ná béimid sásta leis sin muna gceapaimid go gcuirfí an t-airgead sin chun tairbhe na ndaoine chun níos mó do bhaint as na tionscail atá againn sa tír seo agus muna gcuirfí feabhas leis ar na seirbhísí sóisialacha agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Is ceart féachaint chuige i gcónaí go gcuirfí an t-airgead chun maitheasa sa tslí sin agus is dóigh liom féin gur mar sin atá an scéal againn anso.  An méid airgid atá i gceist i Leabhar na Meastachán i gcóir na bliana is dóigh liom gur do leas na tíre é sin agus éinne a dheineann macnamh ar an scéal, éinne a scrúdaíonn an Leabhar agus na Meastacháin caithfidh sé a admháil gur ar son leas na tíre atá siad ann.  Dá bhrí sin, ní aontaím in aon chor leis na daoine adeir go bhfuil an bille ró-mhór.  Dar ndó, ní féidir aon ghnó do leathnú sa saol seo gan a thuille airgid do chur isteach ann. Sin é an rud simplí.</P>
    <P>On this Bill, it is open to us to pass judgment on the methods used to promote the welfare of the country from the resources provided by the Budget and which were implemented by the Finance Act.  When we call to mind the success that attended the <Col N="1471" /><i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> we have every right to believe and to expect that the Second Programme will be successful also.  That has already been mentioned in another place, and the provisions of that <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> have been put before us, but no matter what programming we do, unless the co-operation of all sections of the community is forthcoming, it will not have the success we should like it to have and that it is capable of having. It is always better, of course, to face all these matters objectively and not to be carried away by prejudices or narrow Party views.</P>
    <P>The success and the prosperity of the country as a whole, and the prosperity of all sections of our people, depend on the success that will attend this Programme.  All the salient activities of the State are dealt with in that Programme&mdash;agriculture, industry, local government, health and social services, education, and so on. I do not intend to go into all these matters; we shall have another time for discussing them.  The country is making good progress at present and nothing the opponents of the Government say will prevent the people from seeing that progress for themselves. Even people coming here from abroad comment favourably on the progress that the country has been making in every direction.</P>
    <P>I shall confine myself to a few points, some of which have already been referred to.  In regard to education, we are all interested in the system we have and I believe our system is as good as any to be found in any part of the world.  That is not to say that we should not improve it still further if we can but that cannot be done without the expenditure of more money.  I should like to know that those who advocate the erection of new schools, of better schools, and the provision of more facilities generally for education, will be prepared to accept the liability that goes with those proposals.  That is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the school leaving age.  It is proposed in the <Col N="1472" /><i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that the school leaving age should be raised from 14 to 15 by 1970.  We are all pleased with that, but at the same time there will be certain difficulties connected with he proposal. It will be necessary to make additions to our existing schools, if not to build additional new schools.  Not alone will that apply to primary schools but it will apply to post-primary, vocational and secondary schools.  All of that will involve the expenditure of a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>There is also a further difficulty that I see&mdash;I may be exaggerating the difficulty in my own mind&mdash;that when the school leaving age is raised from 14 to 15, it will be compulsory for all children of that age to attend school but at present there are children of that age who would not derive very much benefit from that additional schooling and it would be much more beneficial to the community if they did something outside.  I admit of course that there is an outlet now for these in our vocational schools, just as there is an outlet for the more brilliant children in the secondary schools.  One thing, however, that will have to be accepted when the school leaving age is raised from 14 to 15, is that they should not be kept in the primary school but should be given the option of going into a secondary or a vocational school.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a lot in what has been said here by more than one speaker, that in the future there must be better co-ordination of our educational system as between all these branches.  This will cost a considerable sum of money, but I think the money invested in it will pay good dividends in the future.  It is generally admitted that a good education for our people is one of the greatest national assets. Whether they remain at home or whether some of them have to go abroad to earn their living, it is good that they be well equipped with the necessary amount of learning.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the school leaving age is raised from 14 to 15, a place will be found in the school curriculum for the teaching of civics.  If there is one thing more than another necessary <Col N="1473" /> in this country today, it is the inculcation of a proper civic spirit. If that is tackled as part of post-primary education, it may have the effect of doing away with a lot of the vandalism taking place all over the country today.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Brosnahan's remarks on career and vocational guidance.  I agree with him that everything possible should be done to direct our young people on the right road for their future welfare.  It is difficult to know what type of organisation is the best for that.  Some people suggest that the parents themselves should have the most important say, but I imagine that the best people to touch upon that are the teachers who have been dealing with the children in the schools for so many years.  The teachers should be in a position to gauge the possibilities and capabilities of the children under their care.  They should be in a position to observe their propensities and, in conjunction with the parents and possibly with the school managers, should be in a position to set up some organisation for vocational guidance.</P>
    <P>When some people deal with this matter, it would appear from what they say that post-primary education is entirely lagging behind in this country. That this is not the case was pointed out recently by the Minister for Education.  Here is an extract from a letter that appeared in the Press from the Minister's office:</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned at the very incorrect picture thus given of our provision for post-primary education.  He has had on more than one occasion briefly to publicise the true facts.  They are: According to the 1961 census there were 57,503 persons in the 14-15 age group.  Of these there were 36,624, or 64 per cent, in full-time attendance at school in February, 1962.  Of this 36,624 there were 32,268, that is 56 per cent, of the age group receiving post primary education.  Of those over 16 years of age 25,327 were receiving full-time secondary education and 5,596 were receiving full-time vocational education.  Since then attendances at both secondary <Col N="1474" /> and vocational courses have risen substantially, but the Department has not yet completed the survey for the current school year.</P>
    <P>It can be seen from this that there is fairly reasonable provision for post-primary education.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the delicate question of the Irish language.  Indeed, I did not expect that the question of the revival of Irish would get such prominence in this debate.  It got a certain amount of prominence in the Dáil recently.  I fail to understand why there has been what I would describe as an outburst in these Parliamentary circles recently about the Irish language revival.  It appears to me there is an implication in what certain people say that, if people have not a sound knowledge of Irish and are not fluent speakers of the language, they have no right to make any pronouncement on the Irish language revival.  To my mind, that is very false reasoning.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is not everyone who had an opportunity 40 or 50 years ago of learning Irish.  Whether people succeeded in acquiring a good knowledge of Irish at that time depended to a large extent on whether they had the time to learn it.  We all know from experience that, when a person reaches a certain age, it is very difficult for him or her to get a grasp of the Irish language.  I know, of course, that there is a minority who can learn a language at any age, but I am talking about the average man or woman.  I believe there are people dealing with the problem of the revival of the Irish language who are quite sincere about it, even though they have not a fluent knowledge of it.  They are just as sincere as those who have a fluent knowledge of it, because whether they have or have not largely depends on the circumstances of their youth.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senator Hayes said today, that in 1922 there was a wonderfully enthusiastic drive for the language. People were more enthusiastic than they are now.  We were a great deal younger then, and we can look back now with more mature minds at what has been achieved.  We realise <Col N="1475" /> now that it is a difficult task to revive the language&mdash;a much more difficult task than we thought it in our young days.  There is no doubt about that. It is becoming increasingly difficult because of all the forces and influences working against it, the most recent being television.</P>
    <P>When we were debating the Bill dealing with television, it was said that it could be a wonderful force for the promotion of the language, or for the retarding of the language.  The question we must ask ourselves is: which is it?  There are forces outside the country over which we have no control, but we have control over the people who appear on television at home, and speak to us on television, and we should try to ascertain whether we are getting the best out of them for the promotion of the language, and the promotion of our Irish culture in general.  I am not offering any criticism now, but it is a point to be borne in mind for the future.  I would suggest to the broadcasting and television authorities that if we are to popularise the Irish language, they should always try to ensure that they get the best and the most natural speakers of the language on those media.</P>
    <P>If we are to ensure the revival of the language, we must make sure that the Gaeltacht does not die.  We must do everything possible to keep the Gaeltacht, as we know it, alive.  We must not allow it to diminish any more than it has diminished in recent years.  I am very glad the Government have taken special measures to improve conditions and to provide educational facilities in the Gaeltacht. There are people who suggest that the more facilities we provide in the Gaeltacht, the more anglicising forces we bring into it.  I do not believe that. The people of the Gaeltacht, the people who speak Irish from the cradle, are entitled to special consideration, in my opinion, and they have been getting it to a great extent.  No one can tell me that if we improve the conditions of the people in the Gaeltacht, we will endanger the language which is spoken from the cradle.  I do not believe that for one <Col N="1476" /> moment.  There are people who think the Irish language could be revived without the Gaeltacht.  I think that is a false line of reasoning.</P>

      <P>The Gaeltacht is the wellspring of the language, and we get our supply of the genuine article from it.  We must make sure that the supply does not dry up.</P>
      <P>There have been references to the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language.  I think Senator Hayes was a bit critical of that commission. He said they told us things in their report that we had heard before.  There is no doubt about that, but there are things which bear repetition, things that are so important that they must be repeated, and repeated again.  I believe that report will form a worthwhile basis for the Government's plans for the future for the revival and promotion of the language among our people.</P>
      <P>It has been said that a period of five years was a long time for them to deliberate on the question of the Irish language.  I do not know if I would agree with that because, after all, they were not full-time officials. They attended at certain times of their free will, and did that business free, gratis and for nothing.  They deserve our commendation for what they have done.  As I say, they gave of their time freely, without fee or reward, but for the love of the language, and I think they produced a worthwhile report. I do not think they took as long to produce their report as did the Commission on Emigration some time ago. These commissions take a long time to examine the problems with which they deal.  The problem of the Irish language is a difficult and complex one, and a report could not be expected too quickly.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that, on the suggestion of the Taoiseach, the Government are to produce a White Paper before the end of the year.  When it comes, we shall have a further opportunity of dealing with the whole question of the revival of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates before us propose to spend a very <Col N="1477" /> large sum, the largest sum in our whole history.  There will be no complaints, I believe, if we are convinced that this large sum of money will be well spent.  I propose to consider some of the Estimates in the light of what I think are three chief duties of good Government.  The first of these duties, as I see them, is distributive justice. That has two aspects: first, to use the effective metaphor the Minister used on previous occasions, to see that the national cake is divided up fairly amongst the various interests in the nation.  But there is another aspect of this distributive justice which I think is probably harder for Governments, that is, to keep a balance between the competing or conflicting interests in the body corporate.  Sometimes industry competes with agriculture. Sometimes the town or the city competes with the country.  In detail, arterial drainage may compete with fisheries.  Sometimes academic bodies seem to be in conflict.  Here, a good Government must keep the balance.</P>
      <P>The second main duty, as I see it, of good Government is to foster national prosperity.  The essential thing to do here is to develop the various talents and the various potentialities of the community as a whole.  These talents will differ but any of them that are worth developing should be fostered.</P>
      <P>There is a third main duty that is not perhaps so important: in fact, it is often neglected.  This is a matter of style.  In the interest of the good name of the country and in the interests of the reputation of the country at home and abroad, it is important that not only justice and prosperity should be looked after, but that they should be looked after in a manner which impresses the average citizen by its style.  And style is a mixture of elegance and economy in the broadest sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to consider a few Votes in the light of these principles.  I turn first to Votes Nos. 8 and 9.  These are the Votes for the Office of Public Works and for Public Works and Buildings.  In Vote No. 8, there is an increase of £66,000 this year and in Vote No. 9 there is an <Col N="1478" /> increase of £708,000.  Have we confidence that this money will be well spent?  I have: I base it on what I think is a remarkably effective piece of propaganda, if you like&mdash;I prefer to call it information.  This is the Bulletin of the Commissioners of Public works.  The title given to it is <i>Oibre.</i>  It was produced in March, 1964.  I must say I was very much impressed by this production.  At first, I was inclined to put it aside as something to be studied at leisure but I opened it and immediately my attention was held.  It was held by two things: first, its record of very remarkable achievement in the last few years and, secondly, the style of the production which I think matters considerably. If any of the Senators happen to have neglected this publication, I do ask them to look at it again.  It is produced with excellent photographs. It is well written.  It has historical information which it would be very difficult to get easily elsewhere.  I shall draw attention to one of these in particular, or perhaps two.</P>
    <P>There is some remarkably interesting historical information on page 5 about Castlemaine Bridge, telling of its importance right back to the 13th century.  Again, on page 7, on Dún Laoghaire Harbour there are three or four paragraphs of terse, effective history.  They explain how originally there were five royal harbours in the country and how eventually the Office of Public Works has come to be responsible for them.  This is the kind of thing which captures the eye of the intelligent reader and which might well be circulated to the higher forms in our schools.  It is informative in style.  It is of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to emphasise the more important part of this publication by the Commissioners of Public Works&mdash;its remarkably fine record, a record of which I think the nation as a whole can be proud.  I pick out one or two of the items in this quite long document.  I pick out, for example on page 18, the work on the extension of the National Gallery; on page 15, the work on Leinster House. In both cases, I am impressed by the pains taken by the designers and architects <Col N="1479" /> to reconcile the old with the new. This is another problem of Government, just as it is a problem of architects.</P>
    <P>Here, in Leinster House, we have a considerable achievement of 18th century architecture which could be spoiled by the wrong kind of extension. I have confidence that it will not be spoiled.  The same is true of the National Gallery.  In particular, I draw attention to the work in Dublin Castle.  Again, we are adapting an old institution with rather an evil reputation to new purposes.  Here, I think it is especially interesting from the historical point of view.  As some Senators will no doubt remember, in the course of excavations, a remarkably interesting Norse settlement was found among the foundations.  A Government in a hurry might well have said: &ldquo;We want this building up fast.  Bulldoze this out.&rdquo;  It is very greatly to the credit of the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works that though he was eager to get the work done fast, he did hold up things to preserve this unique record of our history in the city of Dublin&mdash;and there it will be for future generations.</P>
    <P>There is a special reason why the House should be interested in the restoration of the Royal Hospital. For many years, Senators pleaded for this.  As we know, that building had reached a stage when it was about to collapse within a year if something were not done.  The decision was taken. Now it will be a very fine addition to our history and our country. Senator Hayes was amongst the first to propose that a Folk Museum should be set up there: that will now be done.  Senator Hayes deserves a great deal of credit for that, and as a member of this House, I rejoice that it has borne fruit this way.</P>
    <P>I could say a good deal more of this publication: it deserves it.  I simply congratulate the Commissioners further on this planned archaeological survey and on something which has received more publicity than anything else&mdash;perhaps deservedly, perhaps not entirely so&mdash;the restoration of Bunratty Castle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> All these things are not ephemeral. These are things by which we&mdash;the Government and the Oireachtas&mdash;will be judged in succeeding generations. Just as Athens is judged largely today by the buildings put up in its prime, I hope that when we come to be judged 100 years or 1,000 years hence, our buildings will be worthy of us.  I have every reason to believe they will, if this enlightened policy is pursued. The nation as a whole is affected very much by official publications and our prestige abroad depends a great deal on the kind of publication we circulate among tourists and send out to our information offices in the continents.</P>
    <P>Here, once again, I want particularly to commend two booklets which have appeared recently.  They are both booklets on Ireland.  The first is that published by the Department of External Affairs.  It is masterfully produced, judged by every standard, from the point of view of both artistry and design.  It is true, as some members of of the House will have in mind, that one particular omission caused much heartburn.  I congratulate the Minister on the way in which he has tactfully remedied that omission by circulating the additional page.  The booklet as a whole, is a credit to the country.</P>
    <P>The second booklet I want to mention&mdash;it is on a smaller scale&mdash;is the publication by the Department of Industry and Commerce to be circulated particularly in our Pavilion at the New York Fair.  Again, its style and format are of the highest quality. It is very encouraging for Irish people abroad, when they receive these booklets to see the gigantic leap forward there has been in the kind of publications the Government have been producing during the past ten years or so.</P>
    <P>Perhaps my personal admiration and liking of this booklet were affected by the fact that one of the best pictures among the many good pictures in it was a beautiful portrait of our own library in Trinity College, Dublin. I welcome that for two reasons.  I welcome it particularly because in itself it is a beautiful picture and also because it points fairly to the fact that our library is visited daily by <Col N="1481" /> hundreds and, sometimes, thousands of people and is one of the treasures of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>There is another kind of publication which calls for money from the taxpayers, that is, our postage stamps. These go all over the world every day.  Again and again in the Seanad some of us have pleaded for improvement in the design of postage stamps. They have improved but they have not improved as much as they could and should.  I still think our Irish stamps, as a whole, do not compare in beauty and in effectiveness of design with our coinage which is now almost 40 years old.  I would appeal to the Minister, and through him to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to improve these stamps even further. The kind of stamps we want are good scenic stamps which will show our natural beauty spots.  We need, further, good historical stamps, and rather more explicit than the Wolfe Tone stamp which does not tell anybody anything at all.  This stamp is not informative.  Stamps which are properly designed can be both beautiful and informative, so I would plead with the Minister, in company with previous Senators who have spoken, to urge the Post Office authorities to go further in this.</P>
    <P>I understand there is good money to be made in stamps.  Collectors pay a great deal of money for good sets of national stamps.  I believe it would pay its way and do a good deal for the good name of the country.  Among postage stamps issued within the past few years were stamps giving honour to Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, Thomas Moore, Thomas Davis, Douglas Hyde and Sir William Hamilton, the mathematician.  All these, as it happens, came from a foundation which will cost the taxpayer £358,000 in the coming year. I refer, of course, to Vote No. 34, and in particular, to the Estimate for Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Seanad, and the country as a whole, are entitled to know, or at least to receive some assurance, that they are getting value for this money. Accordingly, I propose, very briefly, to mention some of the new projects <Col N="1482" /> which Trinity College is undertaking in the coming year and at present.  These projects are designed to help education and to help the country in general, and I shall mention some of them.  We have, of course, as a major objective, the extension of the library.  Let me say, our library is being used every day by members of the public in general and by librarians in the city of Dublin, getting information which we are very happy to give to them.  It is no longer exclusively a college library.</P>
    <P>We are also making a special effort to have a new full-time Chair in Pediatrics in the School of Medicine.  We are attempting to improve the psychology department and our genetics department which owes a great deal to the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>May I diverge here for a moment to pay tribute to what I consider is a fine piece of architectural courtesy?  I may be wrong about this.  I only noticed it a couple of days ago and I have not checked the background since.  Anybody going up Earlsfort Terrace will notice the new Sugar Company building which is going up at the corner. The corner of the building nearest Earlsfort Terrace has been covered in brick, or something which looks extraordinarily like it.  The rest of the building is modern in design and architecture. Why has this brick been put up there?  I believe it has been put there out of courtesy to the buildings in Earlsfort Terrace.  Earlsfort Terrace is a very fine example of brickwork of the last century.  Perhaps the architect and the directors of the Sugar Company, for the sake of harmony with the architecture of Earlsfort Terrace, decided it would be good to put the brick there to blend it in with the modern building.</P>
    <P>I commend them for that, just as I commend the people of the 18th century when they were building our first House of Parliament in College Green. I do not know whether anyone has noticed this, but the main facade of the Bank of Ireland, as it now is, is in the Ionic style.  The part of the building which is facing Trinity College is in the Corinthian style.  Why is this? Because the architect saw that they should blend it with the facade of <Col N="1483" /> Trinity College, which is Corinthian.  I am pleased to see, in 1964, architects of the same mind in erecting new buildings.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back to what we are doing in Trinity College.  The Minister for Education is crying out for teachers in mathematics: we hope to be able to supply them much more plentifully in a few years.  Our engineering department is also being developed more rapidly.  Finally&mdash;this is particularly relevant to the debate this evening&mdash;we are establishing new courses in Irish studies.  This will make it more attractive for overseas students and also for Irish students to study the Irish language, Irish archaeology, Irish literature and Irish matters generally. We consider that we will attract foreign students and that some of our own citizens will come, too.  This we offer, not in any particularly pointed way, as a positive contribution to the controversy about the future of the Irish language.  I shall not enter into that because I am not qualified to do so.  But at least we, in Trinity College, are trying to make this positive contribution.  These improvements will be open to every citizen of Ireland who qualifies for our matriculation or any citizen of the world who qualifies in the same way.  For reasons outside our control we have room for people from outside but that may change.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise two facts. Trinity College is making the strongest effort possible to go forward with the times.  Last year we had a team of efficient consultants to tell us what was wrong with our administration. We have now implemented most of their recommendations.  We are determined to make the college as efficient in administration and in academics as possible.  Our policy is one of trying to combine progress with certain academic advantages which can only be acquired in the progress of centuries.  There are certain things long tradition alone can give.  It would be foolish for ourselves and for the nation as a whole if we rashly threw them away.</P>
    <P>In turning to education in general, I simply say that we all welcome the <Col N="1484" /> large increases in the grants.  I agree with Senator Ó Ciosáin that more and more co-ordination in the various fields of education is necessary.  We hope in Dublin University that the Report of the Commission on Higher Education will lead towards more co-operation and co-ordination in the field of university education.  That certainly is what the authorities in Trinity College would most readily accept.</P>
    <P>A wise Government have to keep the balance, as they say, and have to foster non-human assets as well as human talents, as in education.  I shall end by referring to one non-human asset in our country that might be lost.  I refer to the need for what is called nature conservation. There is a risk that our planning may be directed rather too much to the cities and towns and houses, and to the cultivated fields, naturally; but we should not neglect the wild places, the uncultivated lands.  There are two kinds of people who are specially interested in this.  First there are the scientists, botanists, zoologists, ornithologists, and so on.  Then there are the tourists and some of our own citizens who want to enjoy unspoilt landscapes. They want to observe wild life in free nature.  We would be wrong to neglect this.  It may be very marginal but it will always mean a good deal to the country if we can preserve it properly.  There is a risk, for example, under the Planning Act which we passed last year that too much emphasis will be on the towns.  I hope the Minister for Local Government&mdash; and I understand he is interested in this&mdash;will keep a close eye on the nature conservation aspect.</P>
    <P>One of the best things we could do would be to set up national parks on a larger scale.  There is a very great need for a national park in Wicklow where nature would be preserved for both tourists and scientists with easy access from the city.  There could be such parks in Wexford, the Burren of County Clare, Connemara and Sligo as well as in the famous parts of Kerry. All these are important as tourist assets in the widest sense.  But sometimes the ordinary tourist can do damage to nature.  We should keep an <Col N="1485" /> eye on the kind of preservation that some people are pleading for.</P>
    <P>Time is passing, and I know the House is eager to proceed with the debate.  I should like to suggest one or two practical steps with the aim of preserving our wild life.  I suggest that the National Institute for Physical Planning and Construction Research&mdash; quite a mouthful of a title&mdash;might prepare a report on this important matter of planning.  I suggest that perhaps such a report might lead to the setting up of a statutory body, a nature conservancy board, charged with this special responsibility.  Otherwise unique types in our scenery, unique elements in fauna and flora, will disappear irreplaceably.  This is an urgent problem. It is also a marginal problem, but I hope it will not be neglected.  I hope the Minister for Finance will ask the Minister for Local Government to give it the most favourable consideration he can.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude, Sir, by saying that though we have a large sum to spend, I have confidence that the Government are spending it wisely and well with a view to our prosperity and&mdash;this is something I value too&mdash;where necessary they are doing it in good style.</P>

Níor chaitheas ariamh milliún ná ní raibh aon bhaint agam lena leithéid.</P>
      <P>Tá pointe amháin sa scéal ar fad go bhfuil spéis ar leith agamsa ann.  Táthar tar éis é lua cheana féin.  Ba mhaith liomsa beagán fós a rá ar an scéal céanna, sé sin, an dualgas atá ar an Rialtas agus ar an bpobal teanga  na tíre d'athbheochaint agus a chur arais arís in áit na h-onóra in Éirinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do luaigh mo chara ó Choláiste na Tríonóide an riachtanas atá le anam nó saol a chur in áirithe don &ldquo;nature preservation&rdquo;, is dóigh liom a thug <Col N="1486" /> sé air, agus táimse ar aon intinn ar fad leis.  An ní a bhaineann leis an náduir, a bhaineann leis an ndúchas, a bhaineann leis an stair atá taobh thiar dínn in Éirinn, sin rud go bhfuil imní orm a choinneáil beo agus a fheabhsú agus a chur in áit na honóra, fé mar adúirt mé cheana.  Sé tá i gceist agam an teanga a labhair ár ndaoine le dhá mhíle bliain sa tír seo, go bhfuil a rian in gach aon pháirc, agus cnoch agus abha agus baile fearainn in Éireann.

    <P>Is cuimhin liomsa i bhfad siar.  Tá mo chuimhne in ann dul siar go dtí an bhliain 1890, agus tá a fhios agam an staid a bhí ar theanga na Gaeilge an uair sin.  Is léir dom, agus is eol dom, an staid atá ar an dteanga chéana anois i measc na ndaoine, nó i ngnó an chine seo againne.  Trí scór bliain ó shoin, ní raibh ach masladh le fáil againn don teanga.

    <P>An uair sin, ní raibh trácht ar an dteanga.  An uair sin, ní raibh ionainn, fé mar a deirtear i mBéarla, ach &ldquo;underdogs&rdquo; in Éirinn.  Tá sin athraithe againn, pé scéal é.  Tá anois againn trácht ar Ghaeilge.  Is eol don phobal go bhfuil sí ann, rud nárbh eol do chuid mhór acu an trá úd.  Is eol dóibh anois é go cruinn.  Tá a lán eile déanta againn leis.

      <P>Bhuel, ní aontaím le h-aon duine adeireann go bhfuil teipthe orainn.  Sé an gnó a bhí ar siúl againn ó cuireadh Connradh na Gaeilge ar bun ná an dúthracht a bhunú in aigne na ndaoine, in aigne phobal na tíre seo, go raibh an Gaeilge ann, go raibh stair taobh thiar den chine seo againne a théann siar 2,000 bliain nó níos mó.  Agus níor theip orainn é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeilge anois ina ceist mhór phoiblí; tá eolas cinnte ag an bpobal go bhfuil sí ann agus go bhfuil sí ina ceist mhór, agus táimíd ag brath ar an bpobal; táimíd ag teagasc an phobail <Col N="1487" /> chun go leigheasfar pé easnamh atá ar an ngnó go dtí seo.  Thug an Taoiseach ráiteas uaidh le gairid i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Do léirigh sé go cinnte, do gheall sé go cinnte, go ndéanfaí beart éifeachtúil chun obair seo na Gaeilge do chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Is ábhar misnigh é sin dúinn atá ag obair ar son na Gaeilge, ó tháinig ionainn bheith ag obair ar a son.  Chuir sé misneach orainn; d'árdaigh sé ár bhfonn chun gníomhartha eile a dhéanamh, agus is breá linn é siúd a bheith ina thaca leis na h-iarrachtaí a iarrfaimíd ar an bpobal a dhéanamh feasta chun gnó críochnaithe a dhéanamh den ghnó a thosnaíomar i gConnradh na Gaeilge, fé droch-mheas agus fé neamh-aithne trí scór bliain ó shoin.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Taoiseach ar son na cainte sin agus iarraim air gníomh a dhéanamh dá réir.  Geallaim dó go mbeidh pobal na hÉireann laistiar de má dheineann sé amhlaidh.  Is ámharach gur duine den aigne sin atá i gceannas an Rialtais.  Is ámharach gur duine é go bhfuil muinín againn as sa mhéid sin.  Tá súil agam nach dteipfidh ar an muinín sin agus go raghaimíd chun cinn anois chun toradh d'fháil ar an saothar a thosnaíomar trí scór de bhlianta ó shoin.</P>
    <P>Mar adubhairt mé, tá a lán déanta againn.  Nuair bhíos 20 bliain d'aois, go deimhin, nuair bhíos deich mbliain d'aois, ní raibh focal Gaeilge le feiscint i bpáipéar nó i leabhar.  Ní raibh trácht ar bith ar Ghaeilge.  Ní raibh daoine sna scoileanna ábalta í mhúineadh.  Ní raibh duine ar bith sa Stáitsheirbhís ábalta litir a fhreagairt i nGaeilge.  Ach tá an lá sin thart, tá an t-athrú sin tagtha ar an scéal, agus ní saothar beag nó gníomh beag é sin.  Sin í an fhundúireacht, sin é an bonn atá curtha againn leis an obair atá le déanamh anois chun pobal na hÉireann do mhisniú agus do ghríosadh chun an obair a chur chun críche agus an cuspóir a bhí ag an gCraoibhín Aoibhinn, ag Eoin MacNéill, ag an Dochtúir Ó hIceadha agus daoine eile&mdash;na mílte eile&mdash; a thabhairt chun críche, rud nárbh fhéidir a dhéanamh go dtí seo &mdash;agus deirim é sin go dearfa&mdash;mar ní raibh an gléas ann chuige.</P>

Is trua liom an cáineadh a deineadh ar thuarascáil an Choimisiúin a cuireadh ar bun, an tuarascáil a tugadh an lá fé dheireadh don Rialtais.  Ní ábhar cáinte é sin.  Is ábhar é gur cheart dúinn muinín a bheith againn as, agus eolas a bheith againn air.  Is ceart dúinn bheith buíoch den dream a chuir le chéile é.  Chruinníodar a lán eolais nár mhiste a bheith ar fáil againn agus nár mhiste a bheith i láthair an Rialtais chun iad a stiúradh chun pé beart atá ina n-aigne acu a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Is maith liomsa caint sin an Taoisigh.  Tá muinín agam as.  Tá muinín agam as an Rialtas go gcuirfidh siad chun críche an geall a thug an Taoiseach, mar tá rud mór i gceist agus is rud é ná tuigtear go h-iomlán fós.

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In coming to discuss the Book of Estimates, I turn first to the Estimate for Education and, in particular, to the Universities Estimate. It is some source of satisfaction that at last we find now that our needs for building in Cork have been recognised and that a commitment has been accepted by the Minister towards providing, first, the building, that is, a building for science, including physics, chemistry and mathematical science. We, naturally, are quite buoyed up by that hope and consequently things appear much brighter this year.  But there is a feeling that the Government have not yet recognised the fact that buildings do not make a university or an educational institution, that it is the men who count most.  Unfortunately, we find that the Estimates so far show no recognition of this essential fact.  In fact, we appear to be progressing backwards in that in two years our student numbers have gone up from 1,500 to 1,700 and to almost 2,000 in the current year, an increase in the student body of more than 30 per cent, while the increased grant in the two years is just 15 per cent so that, certainly, that does not provide for the increase in student numbers, much less make provision for the increased cost of living and also for expansion.</P>
      <P>We hope the Government will grasp this essential fact before it is too late. It will be too late to grasp this essential fact when the new buildings are there in all their splendour, ready to be occupied and trained staffs are not available to carry out the necessary expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say for the institution with which I am connected holds equally for all other institutions in the country. I do not believe for one moment that we are being treated any worse than <Col N="1490" /> the other institutions.  We can look with envious eyes across the Border and see what is regarded as being the necessary equipment both in personnel and in laboratory facilities and so on in Queen's University, Belfast.  The most conservative estimate you could make is that it costs twice as much in Queen's University, Belfast, to train a student as it does here in the Republic.</P>
    <P>This is something, of course, that the Government cannot remedy overnight but I appeal to the Government to have a policy of closing the gap.  This gap is one to which we will have to take a fairly long term approach.  I suggest something like a nine or ten year period.  If the Government under this heading were prepared to give an increase of ten per cent per annum in order to close the gap, then we could effectively close the gap in nine to ten years and do it without in any way lowering the standard of our academic personnel.</P>
    <P>Of course, closing the gap is not sufficient because these institutions across the border and elsewhere have their expansion plans for the next decade.  In addition, we have to keep pace with their expansion plans so that in ten years' time when we hope to be in the Common Market, when we hope that the fruits of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will have been reaped, we should be able to say that we are devoting as much resources to the training of students per student as they are in comparable institutions in England or elsewhere. That is a target the Government should take.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on this unduly because we hope in the coming six months or so to have the Report of the Commission on Higher Education available.  I believe that will represent a real landmark in the history of higher education in this country and will be the means of making that break-through to convincing our Government of the necessity for a far greater amount of our resources to be channelled into higher education and, of course, the same goes for the other educational branches to which I will refer in a few moments.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I say that I was <Col N="1491" /> very pleased to see in the newspaper controversies over the past month or so the suggestion that Army training should be linked up with the university system?  In fact, I had formed the same opinion quite a while back and had it reinforced very strongly during a recent visit to the United States where I saw how closely the various defence services there are linked in with the university system, so that each graduate, whether at West Point, Anapolis or Colorado Springs, is trained professionally and has a degree and the better graduates are picked to go on to universities to complete Masters' and, in many cases, Ph.D programmes.  That is only as it should be in developing the excellent talent that always lies in a pool of men that are usually attracted to career service in the military services.</P>
    <P>It is high time that we saw to that here and it would be a simple enough matter to arrange.  After all, it merely calls for the stationing of the trainees adjacent to the university centres during their period of training.  That could be done.  I do not thing any one institution should be preferred over the other.  It would do the Army good to have a diversity of trainees coming from the various centres and it would do our student bodies a great deal of good to be brought into active association with Army students during their formative periods.  Of course it should be taken for granted that with the completion of the primary degree period, the better men in the Army graduate class would be given every facility to go to post-graduate schools, either at home or abroad.  The whole nation would gain greatly by utilising the talent of the young Army officers to the full.  They would afterwards become the captains of industry or make a big contribution from the point of view of industrial management, following in the footsteps of many illustrious Army men before them, of whom Lieutenant General Costello stands as the supreme example.</P>
    <P>Again, I find myself very much in sympathy with the growing volume of opinion in the country that the teachers' training colleges should be <Col N="1492" /> actively associated with the universities and should be able, during the training period or shortly thereafter, to proceed to a full degree, so that there no longer would be any question of discrimination between the secondary teachers and the national teachers but that they would all be fully qualified, degree-holding teachers.  At the moment I believe the secondary teachers are fully justified in seeking a differential based on their more protracted training and also on the fact that this has been in most cases paid for by themselves.  Any system that could be evolved should, of course, grant corresponding increments to national school teachers holding a degree, whereby eventually we would have a uniformly trained teaching body without any question of discrimination.</P>
    <P>While the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> calls for something like 2,000 extra national school teachers by 1970 and also sets as a target a 50 per cent increase in attendance at secondary schools, it should call for more than a 50 per cent increase in the number of secondary teachers because many classes are far too big in our secondary schools and very often an inadequate number of teachers are provided in the schools. There is a great necessity for recruiting teachers and I would suggest that in the coming six years, there should be&mdash; there probably will be&mdash;a continuation of the slowdown of recruitment to the public service.  Many of the positions that absorbed so many of our people in the past, for instance, clerical grades in the Civil Service, are now being vacated through the use of machinery. The talent that would have gone into these avenues should be diverted into providing these extra teachers who are required during this period.  The careers open to them should make up for the slowing down of recruitment in clerical and ancillary grades in the public service.</P>
    <P>We need to continue the diversification of the training provided by the university centres.  This is rather difficult in the smaller provincial centres. We look at the developments in the capital in management training, and so on, and we are conscious of the <Col N="1493" /> necessity for these facilities in the provinces. Beset as we are with so many financial difficulties, it is impossible to do this from our own resources and we hope the Government will come to see the necessity for having groups of dedicated men prepared to give students a vocation for management or industrial engineering, to both of which every graduate in this small country should get some exposure.  In our industrial life, the opportunities for pure science or for being completely at your own profession are far more limited than they are in richer countries like England and America.  Consequently, our graduates must be far more diverse.  Any graduate who in any way comes in contact with our industrial life should have some elementary training in economics and industrial engineering so that he is fitted to play the part that is required in our industrial enterprises.</P>
    <P>Without taking up too much time, I wish to refer to a few other items.  I share with many here an uneasiness about certain features presented by Telefís Éireann and which are very much contrary to everything we hold dear in this country.  We do get some excellent programmes which counteract this, but there have been undesirable features such as the desecrations of Shakespeare portrayed recently. There was the presentation of <i>Hamlet</i> in which there were love scenes which would have shocked Shakespeare if he could have seen them.  Likewise, there was a presentation of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> which could have passed for something which was advertising a nudist colony.  This is revolting and, worse than that, it is insidious in our set-up here today because once Shakespeare is listed on a Telefís Éireann programme, the parents of children from ten years upwards will say: &ldquo;You should see Shakespeare so you may stay up tonight to see this programme.&rdquo;  One is embarrassed in the middle of it when sub-teenage children are there to see love scenes that out-Hollywood Hollywood. I have seen some of them and suffered the embarrassment of having to shut them off without causing too much questioning from the child at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> There is no need for importing this trash into our Irish life because it is acknowledged that some of the finest productions of Shakespeare have come from Father O'Flynn's group in Cork, from a place popularly known as The Loft.  If Telefís Éireann would only come down, film those and release them, I feel certain that they would do far more for our young children in giving them an appreciation of Shakespeare, and I am convinced any rational television authority in the world that cared for its teenage students would be anxious to rent such films from us. Yet, so far, the activities of The Loft have gone unnoticed by Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I might make.  For instance, we enjoy the relays from horse shows, Wembley, White City and so on, but why could we not have some of the wonderful competitions at Dublin Horse Show filmed and reproduced for us during the winter or perhaps on the following night or the following week?  All we got, apparently, from that Show was the Aga Khan Cup Competition but there were other competitions all through that week that would have made wonderful material for the long winter nights?  I hope and I believe that Telefís Éireann will look far more at the material available in our own country and scan very much more severely what they import from abroad and also consider very carefully the type of audience likely to see what they put on.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Second Programme that there is to be extra money spent on, among other things, increasing the hours of daylight broadcasting.  As far as I can check in Holland and such places, the hours are far shorter and Telefís Éireann would be considerably improved if its hours were reduced. I see no reason why it should continue from 5 p.m. to 11.30 p.m., if the standard were upgraded and much less of the imported obnoxious stuff I mentioned introduced, and if instead material which the ordinary person could view for a couple of hours were shown.  Programmes are far too long and the hours of available viewing are <Col N="1495" /> far too long.  None of our resources should be spent in the coming period on extending either.</P>
    <P>Turning to the big event that has happened since we met here previously, the publishing of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> this is a very formidable document running to 325 pages.  In fact it is not over-difficult reading: it is an elaboration of the First Programme laid before us little more than a year ago. Consequently I was very interested in seeing what changes the representations of the past year had made in the Programme because we were assured 12 months ago that the First Programme was produced relatively tentatively and that there would be many opportunities for reviewing and adjusting targets in the light of the subsequent discussions with groups concerned and that the final programme &mdash;this one&mdash;would show all those adjustments.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I cannot detect any results in this Programme from any consultations in the past 12 months: it could just as well have been published 12 months ago.  There is certainly no adjustment of targets in this.  The only one that has been adjusted is the agricultural target.  In March I addressed myself at length to this target, showing that a target of 2.7 per cent was much too low, that it was an in-between target which was higher than what we had been doing and far below what we could achieve if we made a modernised approach to the problem. At that stage I gave the figure of four per cent as the figure that the National Farmers Association believed was the minimum at which we should aim and which Dr. Crotty, consultant to the Irish creamery milk suppliers reasoned also was the minimum and which I considered was the minimum.</P>
    <P>Here, at page 299 of this Book, we find the target has been increased from 2.7 to 3.8 per cent for agriculture in the next seven years.  That is practically up to four per cent, the target which the bodies have been looking for. That seems a step in the right direction but, unfortunately, the mathematics of it puzzle and disturb me a little because, as far as I can see, the target <Col N="1496" /> was arrived at in this way: the Programme last June called for increased production in agriculture of 33 per cent over the ten year period 1960-1970 and that, worked out at compound interest, meant you had to proceed at the rate 2.7 per cent per annum.  Three years have elapsed since 1960 and in those years we achieved an increase of only 3.6 per cent or 1.2 per cent per annum. That left almost 30 per cent to be made up in the remaining seven years and if you do a sum, you find you must have a rate of 3.8 per cent that is, nearly 30 per cent in seven years. That does not really inspire much confidence. I should prefer it if I could honestly believe that target was set as a direct consequence of the endeavours of the Farmers Association and the others to get a four per cent target.</P>
    <P>I am further disturbed by the makeup of this target, how this 3.8 per cent is to be produced.  The 1960-1970 Programme called for an increase in productivity of 4.8 per cent, to be offset partly by a reduction in employment of 1.8 per cent.  Now in the adjustment of figures, the 3.8 per cent is reached by assuming a reduction in employment of only 1.4 per cent, that is, almost one-third of a decrease in the number leaving the land suggested before and there is an increase in productivity from 4.8 per cent to 5.3 per cent.  This strikes me as just pure arithmetic because there is no figure or no reason to suggest the flight from the land should decrease in this six-year period.  The only fact is that the two figures added together produce the same net reduction in the agricultural population, some 66,000 as was originally expected 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that the target for increased productivity can be realised. A percentage of 5.3 per cent is altogether too high because Western Europe in the past 12 or 14 years averaged about four per cent and the USA did likewise.  So did we. That four per cent was achieved under very exceptional circumstances.  In Europe, it was due to the fact that there was a tremendous drawing of labour from the land by vacancies in industry.  Those left on the land had to try to get more and more equipment <Col N="1497" /> to carry on.  We had rather inflated numbers on the land.  Many were included who should never have been in any proper evaluation of the numbers on the land, the infirm, the aged, and so on.  It was relatively easy, therefore, to show that four per cent, even though there was a big investment going with it.  It will be progressively more difficult to maintain that four per cent increase in productivity in the years ahead.  I cannot see any reason for assuming we will increase that four per cent to 5.3 per cent, or a 25 per cent increase in our rate of increase.</P>
    <P>I point out these figures to show the difficulties and snags in this programme. It does not matter how the figures have been arrived at but the Government have apparently now set the target at the figure asked for by the NFA.  There is one striking difference as between the two.  The NFA say this figure can be reached, provided there is no further decrease in the numbers on the land.  The Government programme says this figure must be reached and, at the same time, we must lose in the next six years 36,000 from the land.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot get the increase asked for in agricultural productivity without taking proper steps to preserve the numbers on the land.  That is the whole key to the situation and every practical farmer knows that that is so.</P>
    <P>The situation at the moment is that many are seeking less intensive lines, requiring less labour; with increased prices they are thereby sensibly keeping their own incomes constant while cutting the wages bill and cutting the total amount going out.  The best way to ensure increased employment on the land is by ensuring that numbers are stabilised.  That is not as difficult as it may seem.  It can be done by providing incentives to young boys of 14, 15 and 16 to go on the land, first of all working on it and then possibly getting some land for themselves before they become too old, certainly before they reach 30.  That is akin to offering the young lad of 14 or 15 leaving the national school the chance of going on to secondary school and, if he surmounts the <Col N="1498" /> obstacles there, eventually entering university, to emerge with a degree. Not all will emerge but many will avail of the opportunities and all will benefit by a better education and become better contributors to the national economy as a result of that education. Young boys, therefore, should be encouraged to go into agriculture.</P>
    <P>The most significant and encouraging piece of policy in this Blue Book is to be found on page 118.  Article 261 which is headed &ldquo;Agricultural Co-operation&rdquo; states: &ldquo;The Government have accepted Dr. Knapp's recommendation regarding the strengthening of the co-operative movement and have decided that this should be done through the IAOS&rdquo;.  We have at last come to realise that our future lies in the co-operative movement.  Since the war the co-operative movement has been denigrated.  When a semi-State body, An Bord Bainne, was appointed to market agricultural produce&mdash;a function that could equally well have been carried out by IAOS&mdash;I put down an amendment asking that the head of the co-operative movement should be an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the council. That amendment was rejected.</P>
    <P>The intervention of Dr. Knapp is indeed providential because less than two years ago we had a report from a body called the Dairy Produce Committee. That contained a bitter attack on the co-operative movement and it advocated taking away almost everything from the co-operative movement. It is a deep satisfaction to note now that the report has been consigned to the Limbo of forgotten things and Dr. Knapp's recommendation emerges as the blueprint for the future.  We owe a great deal to Dr. Knapp for his forthright language in his excellent report. We shall look forward to this strengthening of the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>One factor gives confident hope for the future.  That is the tremendous upsurge in agricultural prices.  Cattle are up by almost 40 per cent and the resultant increase in agricultural production this year will probably be of the order of £20,000,000 or almost ten per cent.  That is a real increase in every sense because it provides real money. It means that cattle have reached a <Col N="1499" /> reasonable value though it is not quite as high as the values prevailing in Europe.  There is every hope, however, that prices will level out.  That provides a kind of bonus issue at the outset of the economic programme.  It is one which should provide a great stimulus to the economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to economic development, we must really understand this business of subsidy.  There seems to be some misunderstanding as to what subsidy really is.  Take the example in my own home town, shipbuilding.  Suppose a relatively large ship sells for £1½ million and that the added value, due to Irish labour and so on, is £500,000&mdash;these are realistic figures&mdash; that £500,000 is injected into the economy and by the time it is reported as a statistic, the gross national income has increased by about £800,000.  The workers who received the wages for that have to meet their PAYE demands; they also contribute their pennies on the pint and they contribute petrol taxes.  In other words, the whole thing is subject to the general taxation structure and that structure seeks to get back roughly one-quarter of this increase in national income. One quarter of £800,000 is £200,000 and consequently due to that activity, there is an increase of about £200,000 to the Exchequer without any taxpayer having contributed any increased taxation.  It seems just then, and fair, that if it is necessary to keep an enterprise going that you should have no qualms about having to give portion of that £200,000 to keep it going. Naturally, you would like to be able to have the £200,000 to spend on other national developments, such as education, or on other national projects, but the point is that before you call for increased taxation to keep the enterprise going you have to exhaust the whole of the £200,000.  Looked at in that way it can be seen that subsidies are very much misunderstood.</P>
    <P>Our problem, unfortunately, is to try to find industries that we can get going and we are not able to shift from industry A to industry B, because B provides a more economic industry. When we get an industry going we <Col N="1500" /> have to try to keep it going.  While you might reasonably say you could pay up to £200,000 in the example I have given, to keep the industry going before increased taxation was called for, when you look at the psychological damage of closing down an industry like that you cannot put a price on what you would pay to keep it going. It all adds up to the fact that you must be sure that our existing industries are run efficiently.  Whether it is CIE, or shipbuilding, or whether it is our universities, or any other activity that is drawing from the public purse, one thing you want to know is that the activity is being run reasonably efficiently. This is where the Government require to do some really hard thinking. We have no satisfactory machinery to bridge that gap so that the members of Parliament can, in Committee, voice any doubts they have about whether an existing industry is functioning satisfactorily or not, where they can get reasonable answers to their queries, or by which efficiency experts can go into an industry and look at it periodically and say that it is running reasonably satisfactory.  If it is run in a reasonably satisfactory manner I submit that in our present case we have no option but to keep such an industry going because the alternative is to cut employment by the numbers in that industry, because we do not speak of a replacement industry and we are still looking for more industries than we are able to create.  Consequently, every industry which is closed down is a net loss to our economy.</P>
    <P>The same applies to this question of subsidies for exports.  Take the suggestion that we are paying John Bull to eat our butter.  On the surface, it looks quite plausible that we are, because we are selling it at 3/3 a pound, whereas the home price is something like 4/8d.  But what is the alternative?  Suppose the British market is the best we can get, as I think it is, or at least our marketing organisation is selling efficiently, the alternative to selling it to Britain with a subsidy is to cut back production in that line.  That means diverting certain areas from dairy production to beef <Col N="1501" /> production because we can sell beef without a subsidy.  If you divert 1,000 acres from dairying to beef, assuming efficient work in both cases, the beef will probably have a cost output of £20 an acre while dairying should have about £40: at least it is as likely to have £40 as beef is to have £20.</P>
    <P>It means then, the difference between the two, so that we are losing, out of that 1,000 acres, an output of £20,000 by making the diversion.  That £20,000, when it circulates throughout the economy, shows up roughly as £32,000 in the national income.  The tax laws work on that and they deposit £8,000 into the Exchequer.  If you make the switch from dairying to beef the Exchequer is going to lose £8,000, so does it not make ordinary good sense to say that we will not make the switch, we will strike a bargain with the Exchequer and we will use some of the £8,000 to help in the marketing of the surplus butter we are selling abroad? The Exchequer is still better off for the activity as long as our gross liability is under £8,000.  That figure would call for the export of about £30,000 worth of dairying produce and mean a subsidisation of about the level of 25 per cent, or, if the producers are contributing a share, as they are on the one third, two-thirds arrangement, it would mean up to 33 per cent, so that at prevailing prices today you could say that there is still a small residue left to the Exchequer after the subsidy has been paid on the dairy produce. Consequently, I feel we should have a far bolder policy in increasing our dairy produce and facing up to its marketing requirements, knowing that thereby we are getting more out of our return than we could get by the alternative replacement available to us.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two other points I wish to make.  In the application of the Second Programme I would suggest that voluntary and State services should be treated alike.  In other words, if a voluntary group which is not controlled by the State is capable of carrying out an activity, whether it is doing it entirely or only portion of it, and the State is doing the rest, it should get as much State help as the State organisation.  That <Col N="1502" /> has not been our history in the past, as I mentioned in the case of private agricultural schools or, to take the classic example, of the secondary education branch compared with other branches of education where the amounts spent per pupil are, I would say, comparatively speaking, the lowest in the world.  They work out at less than half the amount spent on vocational schools and they are less than half of what the cost would be if we did not have such self-sacrificing Orders as the Christian Brothers and the nuns who contribute so much to our secondary education.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is unfair to exploit these people by keeping their grants so narrow.  If they were given grants comparable to what the State would require to do the activity, if it were doing it itself, I am sure there would be a tremendous development in secondary education and it would be possible by that means to pay the teachers salaries comparable to the salaries they would receive in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>On the question of semi-State bodies, I would appeal to the Minister, as I appealed to him last March, to make some use of this House, to set up a Seanad Committee for Economic Development and to assign to it some positive role in the carrying out of the second economic plan, seeing that the targets are reached and making us in this Chamber feel we are playing some positive role in between.  Perhaps there could be some means of having a committee to help to see the difficulties of the semi-State bodies, to convey the outside concern to them and in general to lay the foundations for a new approach in dealing with them.</P>
    <P>In following Senator Stanford, perhaps I could devote a few moments to listing some of our accomplishments in UCC during the past year with our very meagre resources.  Perhaps this is the &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; of my speech. An electronic computer has been installed which, we hope, will be of very great service in training our students and also of positive service to industry in the Cork area.  A Chair of Applied Psychology has been founded.  Its holder has contributed <Col N="1503" /> greatly to industrial management in the past and hopes to be able to contribute a great deal more now that he has achieved enhanced status.  Courses for teachers have been carried out to the best of our ability and within the limit of our resources.  Finally, dental education has been pushed ahead again with the great co-operation of the Minister for Health.  We feel that the Cork dental school has turned the corner in going from a part-time establishment to one having full-time staff, now regarded as being absolutely necessary for the development of dental education.  We have continued within our meagre resources to try to direct our students abroad to be ready for the period when the Government come across with this plan for bridging the gap between our resources here and those available in England and elsewhere, when this ten-year plan is put into practice to increase our resources.  I hope they will do that very shortly after the Report of the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    <P>I think the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is one to which we can all contribute in some way towards achieving the targets set.  We in the Seanad would feel very happy to be given some responsibility by the Minister for some work in connection with this Programme.</P>

      <P>I only want to refer to three items in this series of Votes we are asked to pass tonight. Firstly, and very briefly, agriculture.  I mention one item in the Book of Estimates because I think it indicates more clearly than anything else in the very substantial sum mentioned on the cover the advantages of taking a progressive attitude towards certain things which, at the beginning, may seem to be very expensive.  I refer to the cost of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  This has been very costly in the past and many people have wondered was it really worthwhile.  Last year the cost was over £7½ million. This year it is down to £3½ million. This is a very comforting item in this enormous list and shows that an item like that, which may appear to be almost beyond our means to start with &mdash;a target almost impossible to attain &mdash;when we have done a good job trying the results can be very satisfactory indeed.  I am quite certain that the dividends in the shape of increased milk yield, increased quality of stock and particularly, in the improved health of human beings will be even greater than the amount spent on this programme during the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second section I should like to comment on is education.  Two of the sections of education&mdash;primary and vocational&mdash;need hardly delay us. Primary education has been looked after fairly well.  On the whole, one could almost say this branch is probably better off, relatively speaking, <Col N="1505" /> than any of the others.  Vocational education is having a great deal of money devoted to it now.  We have large building programmes in Dublin and throughout the country.  Then we turn to secondary education.  As Senator Quinlan pointed out, this is in many ways the Cinderella of the whole Department.  By our tradition in this country, we depend very largely on people who give their good offices and even their lives in the interest of secondary education.  The educational programmes are good.  While I feel with Senator Ó Ciosáin that they certainly could be improved, I think our educational programmes are not the worst aspect of the secondary schools.  More money and more attention should be devoted to the buildings in secondary schools.  It is only relatively recently that any money has been forthcoming from the Government to support a building programme for secondary schools.</P>
    <P>On that account I welcome the announcement made recently by the Minister for Education that he is prepared to make grants available for a building programme for secondary schools but, at the same time, I think some of the restrictions and conditions which he has attached limit the value of the gesture he is making.  In particular I refer to the threshold of 150 pupils which must be reached by a secondary school if it is to take part in this programme.  I am aware that in the Dáil the Minister explained that it is not a rigid figure, and that some allowance will be made in relation to small schools.  We must have a great deal of sympathy for our small schools. They are in a very unhappy and uncertain state.  They are bad enough now, but in comparison with schools in the same neighbourhood that get grants from the Minister, they will be relatively much worse off.</P>
    <P>I have no brief for trying to continue uneconomic small institutions, but I think the Minister should, in the very near future, make a statement telling us what he proposes to do.  I am quite certain he would have the full co-operation of very many schools, some of which are run by the same boards of governors, and in circumstances <Col N="1506" /> in which amalgamation, and so on, should be easy enough.  At any rate, some rationalisation of the position will have to be faced, and the sooner the better.  It can only be faced when the Minister tells us the details of his policy in this regard. We have two motions on the Order Paper bearing on this question, one in the names of Senator Ross and Senator Brosnahan, and the other in the names of Senator Quinlan and Senator Stanford.  I strongly suggest that some explanation should be forthcoming as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to university education, I should like to join with Senator Stanford in thanking the Minister for the increase in the grant to Trinity College. I do not think I should compete with Senator Quinlan and add to the list which Senator Stanford gave of what we have accomplished.  I think I should rather do the reverse and say what we should like to accomplish if we had more money&mdash;if we had the amount of money we think we should have.  It would be invidious to try to compare one Department of the University with another, but I think my colleagues on both sides will agree that the science and medical departments are the most expensive and are, therefore, most likely to be in need of money, and at a serious disadvantage when funds are limited.</P>
    <P>In particular this applies to research. That is an aspect of university responsibility which is mentioned too infrequently in this House and I would suggest, possibly, in the Department of Education.  In other countries it is recognised that the basic responsibility for research is on the shoulders of the universities.  It can be supplemented and topped up as much as you like by State organised research bodies, but the training of young workers, the inculcation of a research outlook, and the establishment of basic principles, are the business of the universities. Those things cannot be done without funds, and the universities are pitiably short of that type of funds.  Consequently, the State research organisations such as the Agricultural Institute and the Medical Research Council have a very much harder time because <Col N="1507" /> they have to supply the money for the apparatus, for paying the research workers, and meeting other expenses like that, which would normally be the basic responsibility of the universities, if the grants were sufficient to enable them to meet that responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Medical Research Council the grant comes from the Hospitals Trust Fund and is, therefore, outside the Estimates we are now discussing. But there is a much greater strain on the funds of the council because it has to go so far towards doing what the universities should do themselves.</P>
    <P>The other Estimate to which I want to refer&mdash;again not at great length&mdash;is the Estimate for the Department of Health.  The Minister for Health in his statement in the Dáil introducing his Estimate gave an admirable review of the position of public health in this country.  He indicated very clearly the importance of what is being done in public health matters, and the necessity for proceeding to do even more. One item which he mentioned which illustrates this very clearly is the thalidomide tragedy.  As a result of the administration of thalidomide to expectant mothers, we have a number of babies in the country now with serious limb defects.  An estimate was made by a member of my department of the number of such babies, and it is quite considerable.  Those children will be a heavy charge on the Department of Health in the future.  They will have to be rehabilitated.  They will have to be fitted with appliances to enable them to live as useful lives as possible. They will have to be trained to use those appliances.  That is one aspect in which the Medical Research Council are interested, and on which the grants given by the Minister have been used.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Health Estimate to which I should like to refer is the building of hospitals.  There is an unusual item in this Book of Estimates. So far as I know it has only occurred once before that a grant-in-aid has been provided for hospitals.  In this Book of Estimates there is a grant of £1 million.  It is about 15 years since this item appeared before.  In the <Col N="1508" /> intervening years it has disappeared because the Hospitals Trust funds were adequate.  Now apparently they are not adequate again and this grant of £1 million has been made to enable the Minister to proceed with the hospital building programme.  So we can say that this is the first time that the State is building or helping to build hospitals. This is an activity that has been going on in other countries for the past 20 years.  New hospitals are being built everywhere.  Everyone now recognises that the State has a duty to sick people, and to the doctors who look after them, to see that they are provided with the best possible facilities.</P>
    <P>In this city we have a number of institutions which were built 100 to 150 years ago.  They have been modified and adjusted.  Attempts have been made to improve their facilities but, on the whole, it has been a makeshift business.  I should like to suggest that, now that the State has entered this field, we might ask the Minister for Finance to turn his attention in this direction even more.  In the past, we were always told that these were small hospitals, that there was no need to have so many of them and that they should join together and amalgamate, and so on.  Now, within the past five years, seven of these hospitals have formed a federation.  They have shown a tremendous amount of goodwill in sinking their traditions and individuality in this federation.  We hope that in the not too distant future there will be closer association between these hospitals.  The Minister should take advantage of this goodwill while it is still there.  Money is being wasted because of duplication of effort in this group.  The provision of a new building would not only bring this movement forward at a really effective rate but would also pay rich dividends later on.</P>
    <P>I was greatly in sympathy with Senator Quinlan's remark about subsidies and paying John Bull to eat our butter and so on.  We export another product which is, in this connection, of some relevance, namely, doctors.  I think we are filling a very important function when we are educating our young men and giving them a career and it should not be held to <Col N="1509" /> be a disadvantage that they have to earn their living at this career elsewhere. They are making a useful contribution to the health of whatever country they are working in.  I think that even if we have &ldquo;to pay John Bull&rdquo; to employ our doctors, it is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <P>To advert again just briefly to the position of the hospitals, I remember a remark recently by somebody who said: &ldquo;Oh, these do not matter very much; we know they are old and out of date and nobody ever goes over them.&rdquo;  This is not true.  They have visitors&mdash;not as many as the Library of Trinity College or Bunratty Castle&mdash; because of our tradition in medicine here and the great names of doctors who worked in these hospitals were known all over the world.  Within the past week, I brought two Americans to one of these hospitals.  If Senators knew the kind of hospital in which those doctors worked in America and tried to imagine their feelings when they came into this institution, they will realise it was a little embarrassing. They were all very kind about it.  I think the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health would be very wise to try to get together in an endeavour to give us a break in this question of hospitals.</P>

      <P>Glacaim leis sin.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks we have been treated to a welter of information and documentation on all aspects of Government planning.  In approaching this Appropriation Bill, one is faced with the choice of covering a wide field superficially or of treating one or two aspects in some depth.  It has been the practice of the Seanad to treat one or two aspects and I propose to do likewise.  However, whichever road one takes, one cannot disregard the general economic situation because all our planning must eventually be conditioned by the resources that will be available, or deemed to be available, for the particular purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, it is very encouraging and heartening to be assured that in so many sectors of our economy real progress is being made; that the plans we have been hearing about for a great number of years are coming to fruition and that specific instances can be pointed to, on industrial and agricultural fronts, in tourism, fisheries and in all the other productive elements <Col N="1511" /> in the economy.  These are all sectors in which large investment has been made.  The dividends from these investments and the improvements we see around us are not only welcome in themselves but are doubly welcome because they are a guarantee that, as time goes on, more and more will be available for social services such as education.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is to be regretted that education, as a social service, has to compete with other social services in looking for its slice of the national cake.  We have heard the expression &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; bandied about so much recently that we have come to hope that it is regarded now as more than a social service or at least as a social service that is rewarding in itself.  Actually, if investment means anything at all in this connection, it is that the capital involved will pay dividends.  The dividend we hope to receive from investment in education is better quality citizens and citizens who are adaptable to the needs of modern life, citizens who are capable of living a full life with better skills and know-how and who are also capable of using their leisure profitably.</P>
    <P>In the other sectors I have mentioned where we are faced with this question of investment in education, we find ourselves in the frustrating position that we are Micawber-like always waiting for something to turn up.  Years ago it was the report of the Council of Education.  By the time that report came out the Commission on Higher Education had been appointed and we had to wait for that.  Now we have investment in education and a survey of scientific research and technological research and we can go no further until all these have made their findings and reports available.  For that reason, we cannot finally judge how genuine and how sincere our Ministers are in their belief in investment in education as the best type of investment.  We can only judge the Minister on the partial investments that have been made or the approaches that have been made to <Col N="1512" /> the practical efforts as they arise.  If we are to judge the Minister on that, I am afraid we cannot be assured that our belief in the investment in education is quite so profound as they profess it to be.</P>
    <P>This is particularly true, as Senator Jessop has pointed out, in the field of secondary education where full advantage is still taken of the sacrifices that dedicated people make, and are continuing to make, in order to provide this higher education at bargain basement costs.  While the Minister for Education can produce figures at OECD conferences&mdash;these figures have been repeated by Senator Ó Ciosáin today&mdash;showing that a fair proportion of our post-primary population, those between the ages of 14 and 18 years of age, are attending school, the credit for that should not go to the Minister for Education but rather to the brothers, the nuns and the priests all over the country who are making these educational facilities available to the youth of the country in a spirit of charity and a spirit of self sacrifice.</P>
    <P>The difference in the approach of our Government here to this sort of thing could well be illustrated by taking an example of a school in the 26 Counties and a school, say, in Belfast.  The religious headmaster of one of our largest schools here will receive, by way of personal emolument from the State for the services which he as headmaster gives, and all that it entails, a sum of approximately £900 a year.  In a similar school in Belfast, a headmaster will receive between £2,500 and £3,000, be he lay or religious. The one man is paid evidently as much as the job is taken to be worth and the other is paid as little as the State can get away with.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here today to the increase in capitation grants to secondary schools.  It was announced recently that there was to be an increase of 20 per cent.  On the basis of increased cost of maintenance and of the cost of running a school, that 20 per cent increase in capitation grants was overdue.  In this case the increase was accompanied by a provision that a substantially greater number of attendances would be required in order to <Col N="1513" /> qualify for the new capitation rates. The school year would in many cases have to be extended.  The Minister proposed that a minimum school year, for the purposes of qualifying for the new capitation grant, would be 200 days, an increase of 30 and that the number of attendances to be put in would be increased from 130 to 170. Perhaps the lower figure is wrong but I know the 170 is correct.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the full scale capitation grant will in future apply only to the first 100 pupils in the school so that even though this increase in capitation was given &mdash; it was announced as a big concession&mdash;it is hedged around with provisions of this kind that take away a lot of its worth. There is also a discrimination between the larger school and the smaller school.  The new grant is in favour of the smaller school.  All this is very recent.  I want to point out, if this is the new thinking, if this is the widening of horizons and the liberalisation of education and if these are means by which the schools will be enabled to provide more amenities for their pupils and wider choice of subjects, school libraries and all the other things which are admitted to be essentials in this age, it is time to begin thinking again.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I can join with Senator Jessop in welcoming the new building grant to secondary schools.  I suppose, in so far as it is a breakthrough, it is to be welcomed. You will remember that it was announced with a great flourish by the Taoiseach just prior to the by-elections in Cork and Kildare but no details were given.  Here we thought at last is real investment in education.  It transpired, when the scheme was published, that it was accompanied again by such a mass of restrictive provisions that it was almost completely worthless.</P>
    <P>One provincial newspaper, shortly after this scheme was announced, devoted its leading article to a commentary on the scheme of building grants for secondary schools.  Having examined the position of every secondary school in its area of circulation, in relation to the provisions of the scheme, it was forced to the <Col N="1514" /> conclusion that of the schools in the area, comprising both boarding and day schools, none could hope to qualify for a grant under the scheme. This was not anti-Government propaganda. This is a newspaper whose editorial policy is well known to be in favour of the Government.  That is why I read it.  Its analysis was thoroughly objective.  I should like to shake the hand of the school manager who worked his way through all these restrictive provisions and emerged qualified for a building grant for a secondary school.  Even if he did that, I would have nothing to congratulate him on because thereafter he would be saddled with capitation deduction in perpetuity, I am told, of five per cent by way of recouping the Government for what is dignified by the name of a grant.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to introduce the subject of teachers' salaries, though I believe the provision of adequate salaries for teachers should be the first instalment of any plan of investment in education, that is, not only to attract the best people to the profession but also to ensure that the people who are there are a contented body of people.  The approach of the Minister for Education on salaries in recent times was not calculated either to attract people to the profession or to foster any spirit of contentment.  It must be obvious now that because of the Minister's handling of the matter, not only are teachers at loggerheads with the Minister himself but that any prospect of co-operation between teaching groups is not likely to be effected perhaps for generations to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister indulged in all sorts of subtle evasions and misrepresented the actions and motives of the Association of Secondary Teachers on every possible occasion and never once did he come to grips with the kernel of the dispute.  Since this is the first opportunity I have had of dealing with this, I want to state for the benefit of the House as simply as possible where the Minister and the Government were at fault.  It is not the responsibility of the Minister for Education alone but the Government as well.  However, the <Col N="1515" /> blame attaches primarily to the Minister for Education in that he recommended to the Government the acceptance of the arbitration award for national teachers which compromised the salary position of secondary teachers.  The Minister was brought face to face on one occasion only with the real issue involved and that was on the occasion of a deputation during the course of the dispute.</P>
    <P>When faced with this issue, his explanation was that he did not advert to the implication which the award had for secondary teachers.  He was so delighted to get the increase for national teachers, against the background of closing the gap, and so delighted to ease the pressure that the national teachers were exerting that he was prepared to sell every other category of teacher down the drain. The national teachers were so delighted with the award that they were prepared to go on strike.  He says he did not advert to the implication for secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>I want to say it was his business to advert to it, and to bring the implication to the notice of his fellow Ministers.  Probably the attitude was that the secondary teachers were easy to deal with.  They had never caused any trouble and were not likely to cause any now.  They would take everything lying down.  As it happened, they did not.  The worm turned.  When the dispute was under way, blame was attached to the secondary teachers in the matter.  If the case is examined, it will be seen there is no foundation for that at all.  First of all, adequate notice was given.  In that they acted in a very reasonable manner, and even though the Minister accused them of trying to sabotage the examinations, it is quite obvious that was never part of the intention of the teachers.  If it were, they would not have given three months' notice of their intention to withdraw their services.</P>
    <P>The Minister proceeded to hurl accusations of intimidation and sabotage at the secondary teachers. These charges, were, as I say, without foundation.  The fact was a mass meeting of teachers was called in Dublin <Col N="1516" /> before the examinations and the teachers there were instructed that in no circumstances were they to interfere with the running of the examinations. This was done of course, not out of any sympathy with the Minister or with his motley crew of agents but out of consideration for the candidates. Then, by placing members of the Garda Síochána at all examination centres, the Minister did much to provoke intimidation and he succeeded in antagonising the school managers but to the credit of the secondary teachers throughout the country, let it be said that not a single instance has come to light of an infringement of the law.</P>
    <P>The whole conduct of the Minister and his satraps in this dispute has been highly objectionable and in the eyes of all concerned with secondary education, I am afraid the Minister has emerged with a tarnished image.  It is in the nature of things I should be more critical of the Minister for Education than the generality of Senators.  At the same time, I should like to give credit where credit is due. While in the circumstances I cannot be expected to laud the Minister, I must concede that during his term of office he has stimulated a much livelier interest in all things educational than ever before.  Perhaps the credit is not due to himself.  Perhaps it is a national development that is coincidental with his term of office, but his ideas for the improvement and expansion of educational facilities throughout the country are very sound and worthy of warm commendation.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Brosnahan, I welcome the reduction in the teacher-pupil ratio.  I regard that problem as having first priority among our educational reforms.  I welcome, too, the decision to raise the school-leaving age to 15 years in as short a time as possible.  Of course, I welcome the greater allocations to scholarships, the modernisation of our secondary school programmes in mathematics and science and the introduction of oral tests in continental languages.  That, I should point out, was something we thought was impossible even in the case of Irish ten years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> I welcome also the introduction of Telefís Scoile.  I hope it will be extended and used more widely in the schools.  These are all very progressive ideas but unfortunately the methods of implementing them have been very clumsy, to say the least.  There has been a tremendous and unnecessary alienation of goodwill by reason of the method of their introduction, particularly because of the failure of the Minister to consult in advance with the people concerned.  It should have been a simple thing, but it is remarkable the ill-will that has been engendered through this semi-dictatorial approach of the Minister, particularly to matters affecting private owners of schools and the teachers in them.</P>
    <P>We are aware that some of the ideas the Minister has been seeking to put into operation have been generated through contacts with OECD, and while they are all very good in themselves, there may be some risk in adapting them to the particular circumstances obtaining here.  Countries associated with us in OECD are nations where there is keen demand for technical skills, something which is not yet true in this country.  Therefore, if we are to borrow educational ideas willy-nilly from those countries, we may be placing undue emphasis for the time being on technological education and may be producing skills for which we have no demand and no outlet in this country, even in our most optimistic estimates.</P>
    <P>There is a further danger that in adopting attitudes and practices from other countries, we may be directing our educational machinery towards the creation of strange and unwanted cogs in the wheels of that machine &mdash;that we will be educating our young people to fit into a future economic pattern instead of as human beings for the development of their individual personalities.  This is the note on which I wish to conclude.  It is to warn all concerned that the fundamental and traditional values must be retained and provision must be made for their inculcation in any programming or planning that is being envisaged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  As I have said, all matters involved in this Bill are important.  Any sphere in which public money is allocated is important to us and to the nation.  Some of these sectors have come in for more discussion than others during the debate this afternoon.  To my mind, one of the principal matters is the payments to the Social Welfare Insurance Fund.  To my mind, the amount is far too small and I say that purely out of consideration for the conditions of the recipients.</P>
      <P>Another highly important Department is that of Agriculture.  Here, quite a lot of money is involved, rightly so, but I think the Minister should direct his attention more to smallholders, many of whom have been finding conditions so difficult in recent years that they have had to give up their holdings.  This is a tragic situation, considering the traditional contribution such farmers have been making to our agricultural economy.  In most of the benefits given to farmers over the years, the smallholders have benefited the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told many times that smallholders have been given the same concessions in regard to rates relief as the large landowners.  That is so, but that is not all that is required to enable small farmers to hold on to their holdings and make even a frugal living from them.  If they are to improve their present holdings, and perhaps extend them, they need much more consideration from the Minister. At the present time, smallholders have the additional worry of seeing people from outside the country coming in and buying up large tracts of good <Col N="1519" /> land which could have and should have been acquired and divided to improve the lot of uneconomic holders. I realise that efforts have been made to rearrange and improve holdings in the west of the country, but the number affected was negligible in proportion to those left without any consideration.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health is another very important section of our administration. Any money allocated there is very well spent because, after all, the health of our people should be one of our main concerns.  The Department of Local Government also have a most important role to play, particularly in regard to the housing of our people.  If time permitted, a lot could also be said about the work of the other Departments.</P>
    <P>That which came in for most discussion here today was the Department of Education.  At least, the Department must get credit for the fact that a number of new schools have been built.  That is important from the point of view of the children.  These new schools are entirely different from the schools built prior to the establishment of the State.  They are a pleasure to look at.  At the same time there still remain both in rural Ireland and in the cities some very old schools that were considered old even 40 years ago. I could not expect the Minister to tell me tonight&mdash;it would be a matter for the Minister for Education&mdash;whether there are facilities available in these old buildings or whether they still have the primitive conditions that obtained 40 years ago.  Certainly the structures have not been altered.  In rural Ireland the sanitary arrangements in some of these old schools could not be much worse.  Perhaps some improvements have been carried out.  I do not know. Certainly they are very necessary.  The accommodation should be such that the children would feel reasonably comfortable.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the question of secondary education.  To all children education is a social and economic necessity of the first importance. If we are to cherish all the children of the nation equally we must <Col N="1520" /> radically alter the system of secondary education for which in the past the financial contributions by the State have tended to endow the rich and buttress the privileged.  A system of selection for secondary education which depends on the financial resources of the parents is unacceptable. At present, only one out of every four children leaving the primary school goes to secondary school.  At least, I have heard that stated.</P>
    <P>One of the most important educational tasks at the present time is the extension and development of vocational education to the highest level. If economic progress is to be made in this country there will be an urgent need for a highly educated and adaptable labour force.</P>
    <P>When children of a large family where the resources may be meagre leave school, they may go into industry. Anyone who is a member of a vocational education committee knows the tremendous demand there is for classes at the vocational schools.  I am sure that is particularly the case in thickly populated areas.  A boy or girl working in industry may continue for some years at a vocational school and become very skilled technically.  That is a very important trend at the present time.  The various vocational education bodies are doing the best they can to provide the increased accommodation that is required.  As far as my knowledge goes, I can say the Department have been most co-operative in helping and in providing finance.  Of course, the local authorities play their part.  Vocational education is very important in filling the need for a skilled labour force.</P>
    <P>Having completed their vocational training, these young people are very interested in continuing their training and in the case of the more brilliant students there should be opportunities to proceed to university education. What facilities are there for university education for a boy or girl who has to work in order to help to maintain the home where the income is low?  Such a person cannot leave the employment he has been lucky enough to secure and could only attend night classes. <Col N="1521" /> There are, I understand, some facilities but they are not of general application. There are, of course, night classes at the vocational schools, which they may attend but I suggest that there is no reason why facilities should not be provided for attendance at the university in the evening, where such persons could continue their education which would be of benefit to them and to the nation.  Of course, that would cost money and it would entail having more staff.  The time has arrived when anyone who is willing and, of course, able, should be able to secure higher education. The State is under an obligation to provide the facilities.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to investment in industry.  Sometimes, that policy is criticised.  I was glad&mdash;it is what I expected&mdash;to hear my colleague from Cork, Senator Quinlan, saying that it was important to put money into industry if it can be done.  That investment is needed to keep men in employment and is redistributed to local traders and services.  It causes production and creates wealth.  Criticism is sometimes expressed that money invested in industry goes out of the country.  It is hard to say that money should not be channelled into industry, to create employment, for the production of goods and services.  That is far preferable to having people idle and getting only very small social welfare benefits, nothing like what they would get as workers, because the State maintains that it cannot afford to pay any more.  At this late hour I shall not stress that point but it is important.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1957 the Government indicated that they would create employment.  I think they went as far as promising 100,000 jobs.  No doubt, they have made efforts in that direction but the target is very far from being reached.  Beyond that, I will not go at this stage.  The target is there and our people are still leaving the country, perhaps not at the rate at which they were going at one time. It could be said, if one wanted to make a case, that people cannot always be there to go because, if they go in big numbers at one time one cannot expect that there will be big numbers left to go.  A better reason is that there <Col N="1522" /> is a big number going into employment. It is well to see money being put into industry which will keep men in employment and put others into employment and create further industry.  There should be more encouragement given in that direction so that we can keep our people at home.  No matter what the cost is, it is desirable as long as we can bring about a position that we get wealth in return for the labour that is put into industry, rather than the way we have been doing up to this.  Efforts are being made but there must be more determined efforts if we are to succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes commenced his speech by referring to speeches made by the Taoiseach and by Deputy Lenihan to the effect that if the Roscommon-Leitrim people did not vote for Fianna Fáil, they could not expect to reap the benefits of Fianna Fáil Government policy.  It depends, of course, on what is meant by that.  I imagine that they were talking about all the benefits the Fianna Fáil Government had conferred on this country.  Naturally they cannot continue if we have not a majority and I do not see how the Roscommon-Leitrim people could expect the rest of the country to give us a majority and not give it to us themselves.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Irish language&mdash;I shall not dwell on this although it is a very important subject &mdash; the Taoiseach outlined our general policy on it as clearly as he <Col N="1523" /> possibly could, without any ambiguity or without any trimming.  I do not know on what side the political advantages lie.  There is not much political advantage in advocating what he advocated and maybe not much the other way, in going against that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha dealt with that point very well and mentioned many instances of the progress that has been made.  For instance, Senator Hayes talked about the crowds coming out from a soccer match.  If Senator Hayes and I had been there 40 years ago and spoke in Irish together, we would not mind whether we were overheard because nobody would understand us but today you could not speak Irish to a person among a soccer crowd in the hope you would not be understood by the people around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give an instance of the position in regard to the language. My wife and I stayed in an exclusive hotel in this country&mdash;in fact the most exclusive hotel if we judge it on the cost.  She is more enthusiastic about Irish than I am; I am enthusiastic, too, but let us say she is more practical about it.  We never spoke a word of English in that hotel to the receptionist when we went in, to the waiters at the table, to the housemaid, and even to the manager when we were leaving, and they never spoke a word of English back to us.  That would not happen 40 years ago in the most exclusive hotel in Ireland.  The point is that the Irish is there but I suggest we must blame ourselves&mdash;I can blame myself&mdash;that we do not use it as often as we are capable of using it <Col N="1524" /> or perhaps I should say, as often as we are willing to use it.  We should use it more often.</P>
    <P>We are all entitled to criticise the commission who sat.  Constructive criticism is very useful but we should give some credit to that commission for the time they devoted to their labours.  Maybe they found difficulty in agreeing upon recommendations. As we all know, commissions sometimes have to give and take in order to get an agreed report.  However, they did a lot of valuable work and we should not be too hard on them by criticising them too much.  As I say, constructive criticism is good.  As a Minister, I shall have to take part in the drafting of this White Paper. Therefore, constructive criticism will be useful and very welcome.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I should like to say about the language.  It was the beginning of the big national movement in this country.  It was those who went out to save the language who started this nationalist movement that eventually led us to independence.  We should not sacrifice that feeling too lightly.  We shall always need that in the country.  As far as I am concerned, I believe this White Paper will give a realistic programme which the Government think is attainable.  The targets may not appear attainable but the Government have set targets before in other fields of activity which were not considered attainable by certain people but they turned out to be attainable. Let us hope that in the case of the Irish language we can do somewhat the same.</P>
    <P>There is an implication, as Senator Ó Ciosáin said, in some quarters&mdash;I do not think he was accusing anybody here of implying it&mdash;that if you do not know or use Irish, you have no right to talk on the question.  That is a ridiculous attitude for anybody to adopt.  If we adopted that attitude on every question, we would have very few discussing the subject of science here or in the Dáil, or perhaps not very many discussing other subjects such as, say, Greek and Latin.  We all feel we are competent to take part in these discussions.  One wonders whether <Col N="1525" /> those who know Irish are more overbearing than people who know other subjects but that certainly applies to some, not by any means to all; in fact perhaps only to a few.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien dealt with the question as to whether we are wise in our general expenditure or not and wondered whether we should not have some overhaul of the method of public expenditure and administration.  Paragraphs 12 to 17 of chapter 7 of the Second Programme are devoted to this subject.  Up to this we have employed people who are competent in organisation and methods and very good results have come from their advice on administration.  We must continue to employ such people and try as far as possible to make economies where economies are necessary and to improve the service, which is more important, where improvement is necessary. These people help in the training of staff and in the organisation of the public services generally.</P>
    <P>The matter of education is also dealt with in the Second Programme.  It will be found that during the period of the First Programme, that is, since 1958, the expenditure on education has almost doubled.  I think I should draw the attention of Senator Ó Conalláin to that figure because he said the Government had not demonstrated their sincerity in talking about education having regard to the amount of money we are spending on education. If we double up in four or five years, we are moving at least towards a sincere attempt to deal with any deficiency there is in the amount of money provided for education.</P>
    <P>Now, in the Second Programme you will find the capital provided for schools, as forecast there, goes up from £2.6 million last year to more than £4 million by the end of the decade in 1970.  On the other side, current expenditure on education will be going up by about 5½ per cent per annum.  These are pretty good figures and I do not think any honest critic could find much fault with them.  I shall paraphrase one sentence from the Programme and put it this way: the growth in public expenditure which has been allowed <Col N="1526" /> for is intended to provide for a relative increase in expenditure on education and services of importance to the development of national resources. That figure is impressive enough to deal with any criticism there may have been to the effect that we are not paying as much attention to education as we should.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan spoke about the school leaving age and welcomed the proposed raising of the age by one year by 1970.  Unfortunately, it cannot be done sooner.  Everybody, I think, realises it will require a good deal of preparation in the way of extra school accommodation and extra teachers. Arising from the extra year, these pupils will, to a great extent, become pupils of secondary schools.  It is believed that a bigger percentage of those over 15 will attend secondary schools and the number to be provided for in that way will be very substantial. This will involve more accommodation and more secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>I can never understand&mdash;I am sure those who make the proposals have a good alternative in mind&mdash;how we can do without examinations completely, how we can determine whether a pupil is fit to leave the primary school and go to a secondary school unless we have examinations, and again whether he is fit to leave secondary school and go to the university.  You must have some test.  Certainly, when he is leaving the university, there must surely be an examination.  It would be a very dangerous thing, for instance, in my own profession to allow people to leave the university claiming that they have sufficient medical knowledge to treat people when no test is being applied.  I should like to have more enlightenment on the policy of abolishing examinations before I could see my way clear to it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ó Ciosáin that our system of education is not so terribly bad that we should condemn it completely.  Our experience is that when people leave this country and go to England, America, or any other country, quite a good proportion of them do very well and in fact they get on very well where education is a necessary fundamental.  I remember some years ago meeting a German <Col N="1527" /> lady who sent her children to school here.  I asked her what she thought about the schools in Ireland and she said they were tip-top.  &ldquo;Even as good as the German schools?&rdquo;  I asked. &ldquo;Better in many ways,&rdquo; she replied. We should not be too quick to condemn the system of education here because it is Irish.  We should see its good points and find out what we require to make it more perfect.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin is quite right in saying that when we extend the leaving age, the pupil who is 14 years of age should have the right to go to a secondary school.  As far as I understand the position, when a pupil does his primary certificate, he has the right to go to a secondary school, even if he is under 14.  I am sure that will be the aim in the future.  We hope to provide the money necessary for the extra accommodation required for secondary schools and also to provide the teachers.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan spoke of vocational guidance which I am sure is very important, although I have not personally considered it to any great extent.  OECD are carrying out an investigation here of our manpower potential and I think that is the necessary foundation before we can do much more in the way of vocational guidance because there is not much use in advising a pupil that he has such-and-such a bent unless there is an occupation to be found for him in that particular line.  The two appear to me to go hand in hand, the potential of employment in various fields as well as the special qualities of pupils and what their occupations should be.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have Senator Stanford's compliments to the Board of Works, especially on additions they are making to old buildings, some of our very beautiful old buildings, such as Leinster House and the Art Gallery. I agree that the Board of Works architects deserve this praise and I have great pleasure in passing it on to them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Senators are aware of it but we have set up a committee to deal with the design of <Col N="1528" /> postage stamps and there are some artists on that committee with others who would be interested in the production of stamps.  This is a permanent committee, not a commission.  I hope that as a result of their recommendations we shall have stamps that will be more beautiful and more acceptable in the future.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Quinlan that Telefís Éireann should film more of our national events for the entertainment of viewers.  I do not see television very much, just an odd time, but I think such programmes would be better, unless they are very bad altogether, than some of the canned stuff they are producing at present. However, this is so obvious that I feel there must be an obstacle in the way of doing it and I do not want to condemn Telefís Éireann as I believe there is some very good reason why they have not done more of this in the past.  I hope they will be able to do it in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan went on to speak of targets in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  He more or less complained that we changed the target for agriculture but did not change it for industry.  Now, we did not change just for the sake of change; we changed because the agricultural organisations thought the target was too low.  They gave their reasons why they thought the target should be higher and their reasons were accepted and, it was as a result of that that the target for agriculture was raised.</P>
    <P>The Senator criticised some of these targets because he thought there was no mathematical support for them.  He should read&mdash;perhaps he has done so already&mdash;Appendix 5, on page 307&mdash; where he will find set out in detail the method by which these calculations were made and how these estimates were arrived at.  In Appendix 3 there is an indication as to how the targets for individual commodities were arrived at.  Economists do not, of course, always agree.  It might be that the three or four economists who came to the final calculations of these various targets could be questioned by some other economist and that <Col N="1529" /> that other economist might be right, for all we know, but we have to accept the recommendation of some group, or other, and we accepted this for better or worse, as it were.</P>
    <P>The Senator also said that we expected too much productivity from agriculture on western European standards.  Admittedly, we expect a bit more because, as Senators are aware, these western European countries were exploited long before our land was properly exploited; our land was not treated with lime and fertilisers, and so on, in order to give the optimum crops and much of our land has still to be treated before we can get full production from it, and we are, I think, therefore entitled to expect a bit more production than western European countries do in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Senator's economic outlook in relation to the export of butter to Britain.  I agree such export is necessary and it would be quite impossible to stop it without creating a disastrous disturbance in farming generally.  There is, however, one thing the Senator should have added at the end of his reasonings. He talked about turning from milk to beef.  I am afraid that cannot be done because, if we turn from milk, then the cows go and, if there are no cows, there will be no beef.  Both will be gone.  As a theoretical calculation, I agree with the Senator that turning from milk to beef would not give the same production as we are getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Conalláin was suspicious about our sincerity in looking after education.  Now I gave the figures and the figure has doubled since 1958.  The comparison, of course, between our secondary school and a public school in the Six Counties is not a valid one. If a comparison is to be made, it must be made between a school run by religious in the North and a school run by religious here because our schools are privately-owned.  They are not publicly-owned in any sense.</P>

      <P>If that was the example, that is all right.  Religious orders in the North do not give the impression that they are so well treated.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous, I think, to suggest that schools cannot benefit as a result of the building grants announced by the Minister for Education.  There are no conditions attached that I know of which would make it impossible for a school to benefit, except the number of pupils.  The number laid down is 150 but the Minister also said that other schools could be considered on their merits.  It is obvious that certain minority schools, let us say, could not expect to have 150 pupils but they nevertheless deserve consideration. In the bigger centres, the Minister is quite right to insist on 150 pupils because, in his opinion, and I agree with him, it is not possible to have the requisite number of teachers to run a secondary school properly unless you have 150 pupils.  If there are fewer the likelihood is that one teacher will teach two subjects and will not do the two as well as they should be done.  As a general rule, therefore, the 150 pupils stipulation is a sensible one.</P>

      <P>It is.  The Senator also implies that the school must repay the grant.  That is not so.  The school borrows the money to build and it is recouped 60 per cent of the interest. That is the scheme.  There is no other tag to the finances given.  I do not say the Minister has worked it out fully but I think it is possible a scheme will evolve whereby schools will get half, and be done with it; but I am not sure if that has been worked out yet.  At the moment they are recouped 60 per cent of the interest and the interest is over a long period.  It is a period in which one would expect the school could repay the principal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that the Minister misrepresented the secondary teachers. Naturally we all took a very keen interest in that problem and the Senator may take it that the Minister would not be, shall I say, allowed <Col N="1531" /> to do anything unjust or wrong to any section of the community.  He did recommend the primary teachers' arbitration award, of course, and I do not see how he could have done otherwise.  In practice, it is almost impossible for the Government to reject an award.  The civil servants and the teachers, on the other hand, can reject it.  The Government are actually at a disadvantage in arbitration because, in practice, they must accept it.  It is unfortunate, to say the least of it, when the other side refuses to accept arbitration.  Civil servants, teachers, the gardaí, and so on, fought for years for the principle of arbitration and, when arbitration comes, it is a great pity that it should be rejected. The Minister recommended that the award to the national teachers should be accepted.  Then the arbitration for the secondary teachers came along and again he recommended the award be accepted, which it was.  He did his duty. He could not do otherwise.  He could not do more.  He was not inclined, and I think the Government would not wish it, to reject the arbitration award in either case.</P>

      <P>I do not understand what the Senator is getting at.  Senators know very well that, in practice, the Government cannot reject an award, because of course they could never carry it if they did so.  They would be in trouble with the Dáil, with the Seanad and everybody else if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This award came along and the Minister accepted knowing that the secondary teachers were going to have their case arbitrated on and he was perfectly right to accept both awards.  It is a great pity the others did not accept it, too.  I must say that at <Col N="1532" /> the time we were talking about giving arbitration to the civil servants, teachers and so on, I was not a very ardent advocate of it because I saw the danger in it, much the same as I said now, that the Government must always accept it but the others may not accept it.  Therefore it is an unfair business as far as the Government are concerned.  It was agreed to and once it was agreed to, I would be most anxious that it would be accepted by everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the carrying out of the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations, I must say I am not aware that the Minister ever said anything about the secondary teachers except that they were not prepared to carry out the duties they had been doing for years and he thought in the interests of the pupils it was a great pity that they should take that line.  I do not remember, certainly, that the Minister ever accused them of any obstruction other than that they were not prepared to do it themselves.  Of course the Minister had the obligation of looking after the pupils and of trying to get these examinations carried out and he succeeded in doing so.  I hope he will be successful in getting the papers examined properly and the results declared as they were in any other year.</P>
      <P>Before I leave this subject, I should like to say that I do not think it is very helpful to this dispute to accuse the Minister of a hostility which he is not guilty of in this particular case. As far as I know, the Minister has been very scrupulous in his dealings and of not accusing the secondary teachers of anything more than that they were not prepared to undertake the supervision of these examinations and the correction of the papers.</P>

      <P>I should like to see that quoted.  Senator Desmond, the last speaker, talked about the settlement of smallholders and the question of foreigners buying land.  I do not want to enter into any controversy at the moment, but the Land Bill, when it comes along, will be helpful in both of <Col N="1533" /> these cases.  It is expected that it will provide more land for division and secondly it will give the Land Commission power to deal with some of these foreign buyers of land because the Commission will have the power to take over the land unless they are resident.  We know that a lot of them who have bought land are not resident but have it to retire to at a suitable opportunity.  It will be possible to deal with them when this Bill goes through.</P>
