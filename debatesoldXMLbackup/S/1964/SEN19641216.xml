    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1964  (  Certified Money Bill ):   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are to raise the statutory limit for issues from the Local Loans Fund and to give power to write off the outstanding balances of certain loans which have proved to be irrecoverable.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory limit for issues from the Fund is £170 million, having been fixed at that level by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1961.  The Bill proposes to increase the limit to £250 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fund is the principal source of loan finance for the capital programmes of both the urban and rural local authorities.  Housing has constituted, and continues to constitute, the major element in these programmes. Loans for slum clearance and other rehousing schemes undertaken by the local authorities from the time of the establishment of the Fund in 1935 up to the 31st March, 1964, amounted to £74 million, representing just half of the issues from the Fund in the period.  Loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and similar legislation, including the special Gaeltacht housing code, and in respect of supplementary housing grant schemes operated by the local authorities, accounted for £43 million, making a total of £117 million for all <Col N="80" /> housing services.  These figures underline the importance of housing in the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Services other than housing&mdash;principally those relating to public water supplies, sewerage, hospitals and vocational schools&mdash;absorbed £32 million. This brings the grand total for issues from the Fund over the whole period from 1935 to 31st March last to the very large figure of £149 million.  The total figure includes an amount of £23 million lent over the past decade to Dublin and Cork Corporations for housing and other purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition to issues actually made, account must also be taken of commitments incurred on schemes in progress and planned which have yet to mature.  On this basis and bearing in mind that at Budget time requirements for 1964-65 were estimated at £16½ million, the present statutory limit of £170 million needs to be increased.</P>
    <P>A temporary falling off in issues is expected as a result of the building strike, but a significant increase is anticipated next year and in the following years according as progress is made with the enlarged programmes for housing, hospitals, vocational schools, sanitary and other services.  It is proposed, therefore, to raise the statutory limit for issues from the Fund to £250 million and this is provided for in section 1 of the Bill.  The increased limit is expected to suffice for a period of about four years.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, say that section 1 of the Bill is purely an enabling section, that is, it will enable the issue of loans from the Local Loans Fund to be continued.  Actual issues from time to time must, of course, be geared to the available capital resources.  An increased level of investment in building and construction is forecast in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> This increase will impose a heavy strain on national resources.  Its achievement will depend primarily on the necessary finance being forthcoming through increased saving by the community in one way or another&mdash; by bigger subscriptions to national loans, more small savings and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> As I mentioned earlier, the Bill is also intended to give power to write off the outstanding balances of certain loans which it has been found impossible to recover.  Section 2 of the Bill makes the necessary provision.  The loans were made over 50 years ago under various last century Land Improvement Acts for the improvement or purchase of land or farm buildings. When the Local Loans Fund was established formally by the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, the balances of these loans then remaining to be repaid became part of the assets of the Fund. It has not been possible to recover the sums now outstanding because of the death, emigration or poor circumstances of the farmers concerned, change of ownership of the land or other reasons.  Further recovery action is impracticable and, accordingly, it is proposed to write off the sums involved. The full amount in question is £272, which is quite insignificant in terms of issues from the Fund.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of the Bill will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the Bill on this side of the House.  Indeed, having regard to the variety of the essential services these loans assist, in our view the Government should go to the full limit of their resources, as I am sure they are now doing, in order to provide these services.  One further point on the sum that has been written off as irrecoverable is that it is extremely heartening to see that the sum is so small, having regard to the very large amount that has been expended. Accordingly we welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can welcome this Bill because we know the necessity for various incentives for building. I think we can share the Minister's anxiety about the increased cost of building and also the productivity of building.  Having increased the amount available, every effort should now be made to ensure that better value and better returns are given for the taxpayer's money than appear to be given at present, because by and large our building industry seems to be lagging <Col N="82" /> behind in modern techniques.</P>
      <P>We all know the great emphasis that has been placed on the contribution work study and the appointment of work study officers can make to various building programmes and other operations.  It is very well worth while and should be encouraged to the maximum, but we can do better than that.  We would be well advised to know what is happening in the United States and elsewhere in regard to the application of operation research to big building programmes, and the spectacular economies that have been achieved.  Operation research is a big phrase.  Essentially it means co-ordination of materials and men on the job on hand.  It ensures by means of mathematical calculation that carpenters arrive on the job just when the team ahead is finished.  At present on many sites we see teams arriving without adequate materials and having to go back for or send for materials and wait until they arrive, or wait until someone else has finished the job ahead of them.</P>
      <P>We are staggered in many ways by the magnitude of the building problems ahead of us.  Speaking for Cork city, looking from the university and seeing the programme that lies ahead of us in the next couple of years, the question is where will a contractor who can handle it efficiently come from, and where will the skilled men come from?  We should try to encourage the coming together of small contracting groups in minor consortiums to carry out jobs in the provinces.  It is only by bringing groups together that you can get the right size of unit which will enable modern management and study techniques to be employed so that the work will be done efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a scarcity of skilled tradesmen but I think that with the improvement in working conditions we should be able to attract many of those who have gone away.  We should face big building programmes with consortiums.  The Government would be well advised to see that the incentive motive is present so far as possible, so that the teams of workmen will get the job finished ahead of time, <Col N="83" /> and will share to some extent in the savings that have been made possible by their diligence.  I welcome the Bill, and I hope it will produce the desired effects in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in welcoming this Bill, principally because it provides money for dealing with the housing problem.  The housing problem, as we know, is very far from being dealt with either in the city of Dublin or in the provinces.  For that reason we welcome the Bill, which proposes to increase from £170 million to £250 million the issues which may be made from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the cost of housing has gone up very conriderably during the past few years. While that is a matter to be deplored, we must face up to it.  Perhaps the complaint I am about to make is not a matter for the Minister for Finance but for his colleague, the Minister for Local Government.  It is about the delays in sanctioning housing schemes, in dealing with plans submitted to the Department.  I may be permitted to make the point on this Bill since it provides the wherewithal.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a slowing up in the Department of Local Government in the matter of dealing with proposals submitted by local authorities.  Sites are not approved of; they are considered unsuitable and there seem to be delays in dealing with plans.  Frequently, when tenders are received from builders and sent up for approval, they are considered too high and unacceptable to the Minister. This, again, causes delay and sometimes the scheme is stalled altogether. It is reasonable to assume that as the years go by the cost of building will become more and more.  Therefore, it authorities.  Sites are not approved of: Local Government to expedite the provision of the necessary houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point I should like to make&mdash;it is a pet point of mine&mdash;in relation to the fund from which money is advanced to enable local authorities to lend money to people to build houses under the Small Dwellings Acts.  We all know <Col N="84" /> that the ceiling income level under those Acts is £1,040.  I have appealed time and time again, and I have heard other public representatives appeal, for an increase in that ceiling to £2,000, certainly to £1,500.</P>
    <P>People on the £1,000 income level find great difficulty in raising the necessary money to build their own houses with the assistance of loans from banks and other such institutions. Building societies are slow to advance money on the security of houses in small towns in rural Ireland.  I know that local authorities have been given authority to guarantee bank loans. Nevertheless, a more direct way and a better way would be to make the money available under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to see to it that the regulations are altered so as to permit the granting of housing loans to people with incomes of up to £2,000, having regard to the change in the value of money.  I repeat that I do not think the power given to local authorities to guarantee bank loans is sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill since its purpose is to make money available for housing.  In the Dáil, when introducing the Bill, the Minister said that from the time the Local Loans Fund was established in 1935 to March, 1964, issues from it amounted to £149 million.  He said that by far the greater amount of that related to housing.  He added that a total of £74 million had been allocated to local authority housing and that 114,000 houses had been provided by local authorities during the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider that the war intervened and that building came to a standstill, while I do not describe 114,000 dwellings as being spectacular, it was a good effort.  It does not appear to me that the same progress, the same drive has been put into the provision of houses by local authorities since building resumed after the war. I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that there seem to be undue delays.  Local authorities find that there are unnecessary and frustrating delays in the <Col N="85" /> sanctioning of sites and plans.  Some effort should be made to cut out those unnecessary delays so that houses are provided for those who most need them.  There does not appear to be any scarcity of money but if there are delays, if the schemes are not being sanctioned, whispering campaigns are begun to the effect that there is no money.  I hope the passage of this Bill will result in more money being provided so that we shall be able to renew our housing drive in a more spectacular way than in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Bill as one which provides more money for more houses for those who need them.  The provision of money is, of course, only the beginning.  What is really needed is greater incentive from the top.  Perhaps, part of what I may say would be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Local Government, but it is tied up with the measure now before us.  There is urgent need to speed up the building of local authority houses.  Indeed, the Department of Local Government and the Minister concerned have shown the number of houses built over so many years.  That might look very well but if we put the matter in its proper perspective, comparing the position with the number of people who require proper housing, then we would know what the correct picture is.  So many thousand houses were built in the past 15 years but we were not given the other side of the balance sheet, that is, the number of people who were badly in need of houses.  Every member of a local authority who is a member of this House, and I am sure there are many, knows that is a factual statement.  In the big industrial areas especially the matter is most urgent.  Various reasons are given.  Here is the problem.  Can we get the builder to build a house quickly; can we get skilled labour?  We know the problem is there. During the last period of building when there was plenty of work available the necessary arrangements were not made to bring workers back to work here.  We know they are quite willing, if they have reasonable <Col N="86" /> security, to come back and work in their own country because they like to be with their families.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there is any incentive in that direction other than with local authorities.  There, we have direct labour schemes.  We know we are short of skilled labour and that slows down the speed of the building of the houses which the people need. At the end of 12 months when there is a check-up it is found that one has not built anything like the number of houses to keep in line with applications for them.  Despite the fact that so many houses have been built the number of people on the application side is still increasing.  It does not decrease because we have to allow for the young people who get married and who rear families.  They go into any kind of accommodation.  They become sub-tenants in municipal houses in urban areas.  They are supposed to have the permission of the local authority to become sub-tenants but the position is so desperate that they become sub-tenants anyway.  Then, when the family comes along, they are disqualified because they did not get permission. All kinds of handicaps are put in their way and the difficulty persists.</P>
      <P>The people in charge of local government are naturally aware of all this and it is from there I think direction from the top should come.  The local authority, of course, talk and complain about it and they also advise.  But, there is a thing called &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;.  There are delays at the top and no quick action or quick decision is taken.  There is such a thing as planning, acquiring land and property, and all kinds of legal formalities have to be complied with. That takes a considerable amount of time and there is only one group of people who deal with the problem effectively.  They are in the Department of Local Government at top level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other problem, too, of loans.  A number of people are now in such a desperate position that they try to build their own houses, and rightly so, and the local authorities encourage them because it takes another man off <Col N="87" /> the list of applicants.  They get a loan from the local authority; they pay a high rate of interest on that loan and then there is what is called the pay back.  They will get only about 90 per cent of the loan.  It might be said the balance is small and that they can deposit it.  But it is not as simple as that, because, whilst the builder will charge, say, £3,000 to build the house, any kind of excuse is made to increase the price on the applicant who is in a desperate situation.  We find that the local authority who give the loan have to put a valuation on the house. It is valued at its true value and that may be cut down £500, £600, or £700. I have not known of any case where the local authority's architects valued that house at a lesser figure that that in respect of which there is an agreement with a builder.  That creates a situation whereby he will only get a loan to the amount for which the local authority say the house is valued.  But he has to pay the builder the figure agreed upon.  The builder has to move up all the time with the prices, and if something takes place which will give him an excuse to put on another £100 he will do so.  The unfortunate man who started first and said he had only a few hundred pounds finds, before the house is built, that he has to provide much more money.</P>
    <P>I have known cases of that kind. The Department concerned should give a direction on this.  Perhaps then we shall be faced with the position where the builder might say: &ldquo;I shall not build because my profits will not be worth it.&rdquo;  We are faced with that and that is where direct labour comes in.  Local authorities work on the direct labour system and it has worked efficiently but there is no profit there. The motive is to build the houses and provide them.  But the unfortunate owner of the house who had to find £150 or £200, which was called a reasonable deposit before, may now have to find the balance of the money. In some cases he may even have to go to another lending authority which, of course, will again increase the interest rates.  They have the unfortunate man at their mercy and it goes on like that. <Col N="88" /> Because of the increased cost, he has to pay back in 25, 30, or 35 years the total cost.  In most cases it is double the actual price of the house and in many cases much more.</P>
    <P>These are real problems.  I am glad to see on today's paper that the Minister for Local Government has issued a warning to builders to consider this position.  The increased cost of the building of houses can get out of all proportion and it may have to be examined.  Anyway, the Minister has at least made a statement on it.  But I should like to see more than that. There should be some definite line of action taken.  We should encourage people to build their own houses. People like to own their own houses at some time in their lives and all this is discouraging.</P>

      <P>Might I remind the Senator that this is not a Housing Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It provides money for an object and we should like to know how that money is being used. I heard of a case where a builder in a big way of business admitted that a particular house which cost £3,600 gave a profit of £900.  This was a few miles from Dublin, but not very far. That is where I think the Department might come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect, which is one of supervision.  The last instalment on our loan is paid only when the house is completed.  How far is a person who gets the loan assisted in seeing that the house is erected according to the specification, as it should be?  Is it his job to have his own architect doing it or are the people who give the money by way of loan under obligation to supervise all along the line as the house goes up?  We know before they pay the final instalment they supervise and examine the house to see that it is finished and looks all right.  I am afraid I have reason to believe that there are many places where, a few short years afterwards, defects are found, but the money is then paid out by everybody except the man whose property has deteriorated.  Perhaps it is his responsibility <Col N="89" /> to have an architect there while the house is being built, but it is not easy for an unfortunate worker to face all those costs and then have to deal with that.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the money is provided and is there but those are aspects which I have met in my experience as a member of a local authority.  There is much more that I could say on the matter but I shall leave it at that at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest rate to county councils on money borrowed from the Local Loans Fund makes quite an imposition on rates in various counties each year.  Is there no way in which that interest can be reduced? Sometimes it seems quite a large figure and it is inclined to be disheartening to local authorities who are endeavouring to tackle large problems in the county as quickly as possible. Is there any hope that the interest rate can be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to refer to was made by Senator Quinlan.  I quite agree with him that every effort should be made to see that we get better value for our money. How this can be done is the problem. It is not so much a question of agreeing to the suggestion as how to carry it out.  He mentioned research.  The Minister for Local Government has been organising a body called the Institute for Planning and Constructive Research.  We hope to get some results from this Institute when it is working.  It may help builders generally to use better methods in their operations and in that way to reduce the costs and perhaps even to do a better job.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be desirable or practicable to get the small contractors together.  I shall have to leave it to somebody else to decide whether or not it would be a good thing.  I think it would be very difficult to get it done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to delay, the Minister for Local Government is blamed a lot for sanctions.  When the Minister gets power to sanction he must obviously have the power to refuse sanction.  The power would not have been given to <Col N="90" /> him unless there was some reason why he should examine a proposition and either sanction it or say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We have a lot of specific questions in the Dáil on this problem.  Deputies are continually asking why such and such a scheme was not sanctioned.  I always find that the reply brings out the fact that the scheme was not so long with the Department of Local Government at all, not nearly as long as the Deputy asking the question would appear to think.</P>
    <P>There may be a general impression in a county that a scheme has gone up to the Minister for sanction and that he is a long time sitting on it.  I think those schemes do not reach the Minister for long after the time they are considered to have gone and that is one point that must be subtracted from the length of time the Minister is supposed to have the matter.  Often I hear the Minister giving the reply that he had to ask for further particulars, that the scheme was not submitted as comprehensively as it might be before it could be considered by his experts and himself.  Again, the Minister has often to refer back a scheme on one point, and maybe not a very big point, but it is referred back and there is a fair delay on the other side.  It might be well and it might be possible&mdash;I do not know&mdash;if the Minister's Department could help him to give the sanction quicker in all these cases but the position is not as bad as it might appear to be.</P>
    <P>The next point raised was that not enough houses are being built.  That is perfectly true.  We all agree that there is an acute want of houses especially in the bigger cities and in provincial towns and even in rural parts.  When we come to the cause of the delay in these matters or the cause why houses are not being built for the people who require them, we cannot, I think, blame the local authorities.  The local authorities are doing their best to get sites, to get a plan prepared and to try to satisfy the needs of the people as far as they can.  I do not think we can blame the Minister because the Minister has not, as a policy, tried to delay the schemes or to put them off by refusing <Col N="91" /> sanction.  He is willing always to deal with a case.  If he cannot sanction it, he points out the reason why and invites the local authority to put it in such a way that he can sanction it.  The cause of the delay appears to be the inability of the local authority to get tenders.</P>
    <P>In my experience, in counties I am familiar with, when the local authorities are trying to get houses built they cannot get a tender.  In some cases they do, naturally.  That, in turn, is due to the fact that we have not enough skilled men in the business. The statistics show that the number of people employed at present in the building industry is as high as ever it was but we need more and how we will get them I do not know.  The only hope, I suppose, we can look forward to is that younger people will go to the technical schools and into those trades and in that way increase the numbers. I think there is no doubt whatever that the tradesmen who are there at the moment need not be a bit afraid of having others admitted amongst them because as far as we can foresee, building will be going on and more building coming on than at the moment so there will be work for everybody.</P>
    <P>The case was made also that a man getting his own house built may get a bill from a contractor for £3,500 but the local authority valuer will say the house is worth only £3,000 and, therefore, the person who is getting the house built has to put down not only the deposit of £300 but has to cover the other £500 as well and he is not in a position to do that.  I am sure that is a fairly typical case.  I am sure that occurs, but what is the remedy?  After all, the local authority cannot, I think, be asked to give whatever the applicant says the house is worth, having regard to the facts of the case.  The local authority must have its own valuer and must work on that value and make the advance on that value.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong and altogether outside all sound business management to give a loan higher than the value of the house would warrant. Whether or not we can do anything on the other side, that is, to see that <Col N="92" /> builders do not charge too much for their building, is a matter that should, perhaps, be considered but it is not a matter I could take any part in, I am afraid, because I am not responsible in that particular direction.  That raises also the point that what I would call the top limit allowed under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts is too low: I have heard that stated both in this House and in the Dáil from time to time.  A case may be made for that. I have not examined that case.  It is for the Minister for Local Government to examine it.  I know he has examined it.  He knows the arguments against it and for it.</P>
    <P>So far he has not come down in favour of the argument for an increase. I suppose these things take time.  Circumstances will change and the Minister will change his mind.  As things stand, he has not changed his mind.</P>
    <P>The last point raised was that the interest generally is a very high burden on local authorities.  The rule which has operated here is that the State provides money for the local authorities. They are allowed a very small margin in relation to the interest they pay themselves.  Up to the last loan the interest which the State was paying worked out at £5 17s.  They made the burden 6 per cent, which is only 3/-of a margin to look after the servicing of these loans.  They cannot go very far on that.  The interest rate, which the State is paying, with the last National Loan, is £6 3s.  It is inevitable that the interest must be revised upwards, not downwards, and that is being considered at the moment.</P>

    <Col N="93" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is empowered under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, to guarantee borrowings by Aer Lingus up to a maximum of £5 million.  Borrowings for capital development by State bodies from sources other than the Exchequer are to be welcomed&mdash;provided, of course, that the terms are reasonable.  Such borrowings afford a measure of relief to the Exchequer in the task of financing the State capital programme.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is at present negotiating a loan on the New York market.  The principal and repayment terms of the loan are expressed in dollars.  The law officers have advised that, having regard to the provisions of the Currency Act, 1927, guarantees under the State Guarantees Act 1954 must be in Irish pounds because that Act does not provide explicity for guarantees of borrowings made in any other currency.  This Bill proposes to remedy this defect and will enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee foreign borrowing by any of the bodies scheduled to the principal Act.  At present there are only four bodies so scheduled and Aer Lingus is the only one contemplating foreign borrowing. All existing guarantees given under the principal Act are in respect of borrowings in Irish currency and are not affected by the Bill.</P>
      <P>The procedure for adding a body to the Schedule of the Principal Act involves the making of an Order by the Government, a draft of which must be laid before and formally approved by each House of the Oireachtas.  Thus, additional bodies cannot avail of the benefits of the Bill to borrow abroad without the Oireachtas first agreeing to a Scheduling Order.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee borrowings in a foreign currency by a scheduled body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the procedure for determining the foreign currency equivalents of the amounts specified in the Schedule to the 1954 Act and of the Irish currency equivalent of any payment in a foreign currency which <Col N="94" /> the Minister for Finance may be called upon to make under a guarantee.  The amounts specified in the Schedule fix the maximum amount of principal in Irish currency which may be guaranteed at any one time, and, in the case of foreign borrowing, the corresponding foreign currency equivalent will be determined by reference to the par rate of exchange ruling at the date on which the guarantee is given.  Where the Minister for Finance may have to honour a guarantee in respect of a loan expressed in a foreign currency the amount of Irish currency required to meet the guarantee will be determined by reference to the rate of exchange ruling at the time the guarantee has to be met.  I should point out that this means that in the event of a currency devaluation by this country the cost, in Irish currency, of meeting such a guarantee would increase and, conversely, would be less if a revaluation occurred.  A similar situation would also arise if the foreign currency in which a guaranteed loan was expressed was either revalued or devalued.</P>
    <P>Section 4 increases from £5 million to £6 million the amount of borrowing by Aer Lingus which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Company is at present negotiating a loan for $15 million, equivalent to £5,357,143 in Irish currency.  As the terms of the loan are reasonable it is desirable to increase the authorised amount which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance so as to enable the company to avail of the full amount on offer.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a Bill which should be well received by the House.  It is the first time, as far as I know, that the Government have guaranteed a loan in any currency except our own.  The fact that Aer Lingus is able to raise money on the American market and that foreign lenders are prepared to lend it money is a great tribute to the standing of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage of borrowing in the USA at the moment is that the rate of interest is lower than the rate of <Col N="95" /> interest here.  Although we have not been told the terms of interest by the Minister, I have no doubt that the rate of interest will be less than that which would be available on the same amount of money in Ireland or England today.  It is appropriate that the first company in this country to borrow in the dollar area should be Aer Lingus because Aer Lingus itself is a very large dollar earner.  It is in a position to earn a large amount of dollars, which is available and necessary, for the repayment of the loan.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, it is not fully realised that Aer Lingus is one of the great exporting industries.  Although it does not export goods, it exports services and those services are paid for very largely in foreign currency which adds to the resources of our country.  Therefore, it is appropriate that a company such as Aer Lingus, which is able to earn dollars in large quantities, should be enabled to borrow dollars in the USA. This is an excellent Bill and I hope it will be received with favour by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm nine Orders made during 1963 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 and the Finance Act, 1962.  Such Orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order Number 132 extended the <Col N="96" /> scope of the customs duties on bars, rods, angles, shapes, sections, sheets and plates of iron or steel.  It provides for minimum specific rates as well as <i>ad valorem</i> rates, except in the case of sheets and plates, which are subject only to <i>ad valorem</i> rates.  These duties provide protection for a range of rolled steel products manufactured or which it is envisaged will be manufactured at Haulbowline, County Cork.  The duties are at present suspended except in the case of certain sections of iron or steel which are now produced at Haulbowline.</P>
    <P>Order Number 134 has the effect of bringing certain planed or dressed boards and planks of soft wood within the customs duty on wood.  The duty on these boards and planks was inadvertently removed during the reclassification of customs duties in the Brussels Nomenclature.  The restoration of the duty is necessary for the protection of the home industry.</P>
    <P>Order Number 135 exempted tinplate from the scope of the duty on sheets and plates of iron or steel to which it had inadvertently become subject under the Brussels Nomenclature.</P>
    <P>The five Orders numbered 136, 137, 139, 140 and 141 were made in accordance with the recommendations of the Industrial Development Authority after a tariff review.  Number 136 reduced the minimum specific duty on drinking glasses, other than drinking glasses of crystal.  Number 137 reduced the customs duty on wooden furniture. Number 139 reduced the customs duty on certain kinds of floor tiles. Number 140 reduced the customs duty on certain textile floor coverings and Number 141 reduced the rates of customs duty on thread and ply yarn of flax and on single yarn of flax in ball form.</P>
    <P>The last Order, No. 142, effected a second general reduction of 10 per cent in the level of industrial protective tariffs on 1st January, 1964. This was in pursuance of the policy of providing an incentive to industry to re-adapt itself and prepare for freer trading conditions.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of <Col N="97" /> Senators.  I shall be glad to give any further information which may be required.</P>

      <P>In this Bill we have a mixture of Orders extending and reducing duties, and as the Minister has told us there are nine orders in all.  Two of them, No. 132 and No. 134, increase the protective duties for one reason or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>It restores the position that was inadvertantly changed. The imposition or reducing of duties is carried out under the advice of the Industrial Development Authority and, therefore, we know that all the factors have been gone into before making these orders.  Order No. 142 is the general one making a reduction of 10 per cent all over in conformity with the policy of getting Irish manufacturers ready for a free trade era into which we are moving.  I understand it has been made known by the Government that it was intended that another 10 per cent reduction should have taken place in the new year, but due chiefly to the 15 per cent imposition by the British Government it is being held in abeyance, or a least the reduction will not be carried out until an examination has been made of all the circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial development is the concern of all Parties, and it would be well if industrial development, and, perhaps, agricultural development, could be above Party politics, but it would probably be hard to achieve that in the fullest way.  I think we all feel nowadays that we are all concerned with industrial development.  Above all, the business community feel that any action taken in connection with industry should be primarily for the good of industrial development.  It is a question of economy rather than one of scoring political points&mdash;what one Party did and what another Party did not do for industry.  Anything that can be done for industrial development is welcomed by all.  At the present <Col N="98" /> moment we are poised between a free trade future and our previous highly protectionist era and it will be understood that the greatest care and skill are required to change and adjust the different controls to the right degree and at the right time, taking care, of course, on the one hand not to hurt industry by a too precipitous removal of tariffs and on the other hand not to cushion unduly our industrialists in the process.</P>
    <P>There has been what I might call a jizzing up of industrialists to make them more efficient than they have been in the past and in order to make them more capable of offering their products at realistic prices so that they can be sold abroad.  A lot of these factors have to be borne in mind and there is always a danger that any halt might occur through some Irish industrialists&mdash;I do not believe there would be many&mdash;failing to adapt themselves to the needs of the future.</P>
    <P>That applies not only to industrialists but to industrial workers.  It is important that all engaged in industry, both management and workers alike, should gear themselves to the highest degree of efficiency, cutting out slothfulness or any other habits that might tend to increase costs and, therefore, make our industries noncompetitive. There is one other point I should like to draw the Minister's attention to.  The Chairman of Seafield Fabrics, addressing his shareholders at the annual meeting this month, said:</P>
    <P>I felt you would wish to know what impact the recent 15 per cent levy would have on the future profits of your company.  Because of the fact that 90 per cent of the activities of your group is in the field of manmade fibre textiles, we have been confined in our export activities in the UK to selling two types of our merchandise, namely, cotton hosiery yarns and cotton printed piece goods.  Were this levy to continue in operation during the whole of the coming year's trading, the net cost after taking into account the Government assistance, would appear to be in the neighbourhood of £16,000, which would not significantly <Col N="99" /> affect the profits of your group and would certainly not cause any reduction in dividends.  It is to be hoped, however, that this levy will not, in fact, apply to the full year's trading.  Our real difficulty in the British market is the continuance of the penal duties against all man-made fibre products, which, as I have said previously, amount to 90 per cent of your group's activities. The use of man-made fibre yarns continues to make substantial inroads on every section of the textile industry and it is absolutely essential for our future well-being that our Government should give first priority to the abolition of these duties in their forthcoming negotiations with the British Government for a new trade agreement, as the future growth of the Irish textile industry is dependent on increased exports.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has heard of that statement.  We hope that at the earliest opportunity steps will be taken to get this imposition on Irish exports reduced by the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his memorandum, says he would be glad to give us any further information we might require.  I should like to ask a few questions in relation to Order No. 142.  When the Minister states that there have been ten per cent reductions in the level of industrial protective tariffs, does that mean that if there had been a tariff of 40 per cent it is reduced by ten per cent to 30 per cent or that it has been reduced by ten per cent of the 40 per cent to make it 36 per cent?  We have had a general reduction for the past two years&mdash;ten per cent in January, 1963, and another ten per cent in January, 1964.  Are there any figures available to say what has been the general effect of those reductions in each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a tariff of 40 per cent were necessary to keep outside competition out, when it fell to 30 per cent one would have thought that outside competition would have succeeded in getting some grasp on the market or, alternatively, that prices on the home market of the <Col N="100" /> products concerned would have fallen by ten per cent to meet the outside competition.  Are there any figures available to show what did happen? Did prices fall on the home market as one might have expected them to fall with the lowering of tariffs, or was the home market closed by any appreciable number of firms to outside competition due to the lowering of tariffs?  I ask these questions purely for information which would begin to give us some idea as to how we are faring in the battle to get our firms geared up to free trade conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take up first the last point made by Senator Quinlan which was also referred to by Senator McGuire.  It relates to the reduction of tariffs apart altogether from the general ten per cent.  It is a fact that both sides of industry&mdash;in this context I refer to industries operating in Ireland and industries in Britain&mdash;have had a full opportunity of making before the Industrial Development Authority the point of view each has in regard to tariff reductions.  Senators seemed to imply that the Industrial Development Authority had come into this exercise of their own volition.  That is not the case as a rule.  An application to review is made usually as a result of representations to the Board of Trade in Britain by a particular industry in Britain and the standards applied by the IDA, who are the reviewing authority, are that they will continue to give, after they reduce the tariff, the home industry reasonable protection and, at the same time, give a reasonable opportunity to the firms in Britain who share in the Irish market.  That is pursuant, of course, to the trade agreements that have been in existence between the two countries for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point made by Senator McGuire had reference in the main to the statement of the Chairman of Seafield Fabrics in respect of the duty payable on the importation of man-made fibres or articles containing man-made fibres into Britain.  In the old trade agreements with Britain there were a few commodities such as, artificial silk&mdash;art silk as it was then known&mdash;excepted from the free tariff <Col N="101" /> entry into Britain.  When art silk disappeared as a commodity or as a component part of a garment, man-made fibres emerged, of course, but the British applied the tariff exception, as applying to Ireland, to man-made fibres and they continued to maintain a tariff on man-made fibres.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, garments containing man-made fibres, no matter how small the element, were also liable to the full value of the garment itself and the tariff.  For example, if there was a 20 per cent duty on man-made fibres and if there there was only a ten per cent content of that fibre in the garment, the tariff would not be levied on that ten per cent content but on the value of the whole article.  That is what really made the man-made fibre duty on goods leaving this country on the British market so prohibitive.  There have been certain easements in the severity of that duty but nothing sufficient to give the man-made fibre industry generally or the producers of garments containing man-made fibres in this country a reasonable opportunity on the British market.</P>
    <P>We have lost no opportunity in bringing home to the British the difficulty that is involved for our exporters in regard to this duty but having regard to the sensitivity of the market in Britain in regard to these commodities, particularly against imports from other countries such as the Far East and certain British dependancies, where labour is of the low cost variety, the British find themselves unable to yield to any reasonable extent to our request to have the duty reduced considerably or removed altogether.  I can assure the House that in any new negotiations we will have with the British the man-made fibre duty will be one of the principal topics we will bring up.  In fact, on all occasions, both at Ministerial level and senior official level, when these negotiations are conducted regularly, the man-made fibre duty is one of the things to which we give high priority.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ten per cent tariff reduction effected on 1st January, 1964, and 1st January, 1965, if I take Senator Quinlan's own example it is the best indication of how it operates. <Col N="102" /> He referred to a duty of 40 per cent, assuming that was the duty before the first tariff reduction was effected.  In other words, if 40 per cent was the duty on the 31st December, 1962, the duty operating as of 1st January, 1963, would have been 36 per cent and that four per cent reduction would continue. For example, the duty operating as of the 1st January, 1964, would have been 32 per cent.  The four per cent of the original tariff was the measure of the annual reduction.  I hope that makes the matter clear to the Senator.</P>
    <P>The Senator suggested that because the 40 per cent duty was in operation on 31st December, 1962, if the industry could withstand the four per cent reduction right through 1963, the 40 per cent tariff was too high.  The Senator made a suggestion of that nature.  One of the purposes of the implementation of that tariff reduction was to induce Irish industry to become more efficient.  It was not the only measure we adopted in order to do this. At the same time, we made technical assistance grants available to enable industries to get survey teams, business consultants and technical consultants of all descriptions to have a look at the industrial process involved and to make recommendations as to how the industrial process could be improved. We also made grants available up to 25 per cent of the cost of a major new adaptation scheme which the industry would carry out, or special favourable loans.  All these things were done as part of this inducement to Irish industry to become more efficient and the effect of them all, including the ten per cent reduction, was to make Irish industry more efficient and to enable it to withstand the reduction that was being made in the tariffs and ultimately help it withstand the impact of free trade.</P>
    <P>I have been told by industrialists, who viewed the first and second tariff reductions with some concern, that this has, indeed, been a shot in the arm to them.  By gearing themselves to greater efficiency, by cutting down waste and restrictive practices of one kind or another, they found they were able to take this reduction without any <Col N="103" /> new capital.  There were no industrial reductions on the home market, nor any disemployment as a result of these tariff reductions.  At the same time, the Senator will remember that there were two rounds of wage increases the industry had to bear.  Therefore one, in these circumstances, could not anticipate significant price reductions because of the greater competition Irish industry was being exposed to.</P>
    <P>I might say, too, that many of these industries which had certain protection at home are exporting industries as well.  In order to broaden their basic production these industries had to try to expand their export markets.  As Senators are aware, it is not uncommon practice in export industries to charge slightly less for the exported article than might be charged for it on the home market.  Accordingly, as some of our industries expanded their exports they were naturally getting less perhaps for their increased output in price than they would otherwise have been getting.  It is not uncommon practice and it is necessary in many instances because, unless goods are produced at a price commensurate with those abroad, they will not naturally compete with goods of the home country or with goods imported from other countries on that same home market.  It takes the home market and the export market in many cases with prices married to cover the capital injection into that particular industry.</P>
    <P>There are figures available as to the effect of all this including the ten per cent tariff reduction on the prices on the home market.  As I pointed out, there were countering elements that could avoid price reductions as a result.  I do not think there were any other specific questions asked but, as Senator McGuire pointed out, there was really only one Order which extended the scope of customs duties. Two or three&mdash;Nos. 134 and 135 in particular&mdash;restored the <i>status quo ante</i> our adaptation of the Brussels Nomenclature.  In other words, the adaptation of the Brussels Nomenclature ultimately removed the protection we enjoyed before we adopted <Col N="104" /> the Brussels system.  Therefore, two of them were restoring the <i>status quo.</i> All the others, the five specific ones which the IDA recommended, and No. 142 which implemented a 10 per cent overall reduction, were tariff reductions.  I think this is one occasion, including last year, when I have been able to come into this House and have not received rebuffs as to the extent of tariff protection we are giving to our industries.  There certainly is no feather bedding involved in the legislation I now propose to the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule, Part II, relating to the imposition of duties, No. 142, I just want to return to a few points arising out of the Minister's reply.  First of all, I think that I and many others were rather misled by the idea of a 10 per cent reduction. We thought it was from 40 to 30 per cent&mdash;in other words, it was quite a big reduction, whereas, in point of fact, a reduction of a tariff from 40 to 36 per cent is relatively small.</P>
      <P>The other point to which I want to refer is that I think that, after two years of operation, we should have some factual study available like something done by the Economics Research Institute which would disentangle the various factors mentioned by the Minister. We know that there has been a price rise due to increased labour costs, and so on.  We should really like to know the effect of the reduction in tariff.  In other words, take an ideal situation where the foreign competitor is waiting outside the boundary, as it were, and the tariff is just right at 40 per cent and he cannot come in and compete with that.  Immediately we reduce that tariff to 36 per cent, he has a 4 per cent margin and should be able to compete which would mean that the home competitor would be forced to drop his prices down to the 36 per cent level to meet the competition coming in.  Although I am not expecting the Minister to have the information now, we should know how far that has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the impression&mdash;it is not any criticism of the Minister or of anybody else&mdash;that a 40 per cent tariff would have a certain margin of elasticity in it when imposed and that consequently the outside competitor would not be standing there poised until it would dip below 40 and he would be able to move in.  Perhaps he would not be able to move in with another 4 per cent reduction against him and consequently the home producer would be under no <Col N="106" /> compulsion to make any reduction in face of the competition.  However, the second year should begin to sort things out a bit.  When it drops to 32 per cent then, at that stage, the competition should begin to become more effective and I would say that further reductions will, of course, find the competition becoming much more effective still.  There is also the effect that previously outside competitors knew that if they could get in over a 40 per cent barrier there would be retaliation by the Government who naturally wanted to keep the market for the home competitor and that the duty would be pushed up from 40 per cent to shut out such persons.</P>
    <P>With a planned, declared policy to go to free trade, the outside competitors know where they stand.  They know that the tariff will not go up against them: in fact, it is planned to go down.  Consequently, we should begin to see more and more of the effect of competition from the outside. I suggest to the Minister that it is really something on which an independent body such as the Economic Research Institute should be able to do very valuable work.  They should be able to inform us how much we are losing of the home market, if any, based on this and to give us their extrapolation over the years ahead in respect of the further reductions to take place because undoubtedly competition will make itself felt much more in the years to come than it did in the first two years of reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to assess the effect of the tariff reductions as scientifically as Senator Quinlan suggests.  It is not a matter of putting all the factors into a test tube and adding sulphuric acid and some other acid and getting a result.  We did not anticipate that this would reflect itself after the first two 10 per cent reductions to a marked degree.  They were 10 per cent of the existing tariff. We really expected that only after the third year would we have any marked effect or an effect marked to a degree that the Institute to which the Senator refers would be able to determine the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> We are not dealing with basic commodities. We are dealing with articles of trade, articles of fashion, articles of industry.  We cannot be sure that we are always comparing like with like. One particular quality of article, say, on the home market may not be the quality that somebody abroad requires. It is not easy to determine specifically the effects in this connection.  We feel that if and when the third reduction takes place we shall be in a better position to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the complaint by the Senator that he was misled as to the meaning of the 10 per cent reduction, I can only suggest that the Senator has not done his homework.  The Senator may remember that, as part of our application for membership of the EEC, we proposed a certain rhythm of tariff reduction to bring tariffs down to nil at the end of what was called the transition period, that is, up to the end of 1969.  We proposed a series of ten per cent reductions, then increasing in the middle to two of 15 per cent and tapering off with one or two 10 per cent reductions.  If the Senator added up all these percentages he would have found that we had a 100 per cent, so to that extent I think I am right in saying that he does not seem to have done his homework.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I know, of course, of the uncertainties in any sort of economic work or any economic forecast but that does not get away from the fact that despite those uncertainties that is what we employ economists to do&mdash;to take account of those uncertainties and give some sort of considered judgment of what is happening and point out how things have gone. We would expect that, if the first two reductions had been a success and had achieved their purpose, if there was <Col N="108" /> an overall tariff of 40 per cent there should have been a reduction in prices of up to 8 per cent.  If there was not, it meant that reducing tariffs did not really help any industrialist concerned or did not at least in that period act as any real threat to them.  The years ahead, of course, contain a threat when the reductions open the gates wider to free trade.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1964  (  Certified Money Bill ):   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will see, the purpose of this Bill is to increase to £30 million the aggregate amount of money available to An Foras Tionscal for grant purposes from the present limit of £20 million imposed by the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1963, and to make further provision in relation to grants by that body for the enlargement or adaptation of industrial undertakings.</P>
      <P>The increase in the aggregate sought is necessitated by the fact that as at 30th September, 1964, grant commitments of the order of £19.5 million approximately had been entered into out of the total of £20 million permitted by existing legislation.  These commitments comprise £15.5 million approximately for new undertakings and £4 million approximately for the adaptation and/or enlargement of existing undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grants, totalling £15.5 million approximately, which have been approved are in respect of 223 new undertakings, and, of these, 170 have commenced production.  The building of factories has commenced in 14 other cases, arrangements to commence building are being made in a further 17 cases and the remaining 22 <Col N="109" /> are not yet in a position to proceed. These 223 undertakings involve an estimated capital investment of £53,955,000 and additional employment of 30,630 workers.</P>
    <P>The total amount of grants paid to 30th September, 1964, under the Industrial Grants and Undeveloped Areas Acts was £10,193,667.</P>
    <P>Applications from 362 firms for special grants, i.e. grants for adaptation and/or enlargement, had been received up to 30th September, 1964, and, as already stated, grants amounting to £4 million odd had been approved in 174 cases.</P>
    <P>Payments actually made up to 30th September, 1964, on foot of grants of this kind represent a total of £885,741, which includes £39,855 paid to firms situated in undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>On the 14th December, 1961, I assured industry that if the Government decided to assist firms to adapt themselves to conditions of more intensive competition, no firm would forgo the right to any such assistance by undertaking forthwith whatever plans were necessary to achieve competitiveness. In view of the imminence of Common Market conditions at that time, the Government hoped that this assurance would encourage firms to proceed at once with their plans of adaptation.  It was in implementation of this assurance that the scheme of enlargement and adaptation grants, as enacted in February, 1963, was made retrospective to the 14th December, 1961.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made by industry generally in the matter of adaptation.  A stage has now been reached where it is essential that adaptation proposals coming forward should be considered in the context of the general adaptation measures formulated by the particular Adaptation Council for the development of the industry in question.  For the future, therefore, manufacturers who are contemplating enlargement and adaptation schemes in respect of which they intend to seek grant assistance, will be required to submit their proposals to An Foras Tionscal before proceeding with the contemplated works.  This <Col N="110" /> does not mean that industries already in the course of adaptation and which have not, as yet, applied for grant are to be taken as debarred from seeking grants in respect of expenditure already incurred, but such firms should submit their schemes to An Foras Tionscal, forthwith.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to extend by one year, to 31st March, 1966, the statutory time limit for making adaptation grants is, I feel, justified having regard to recent events which have highlighted the necessity for our industries to raise their efficiency and productivity in order to meet the challenge posed by external competition.</P>
    <P>Senators will note from the Bill that it is also proposed to authorise the making by An Foras Tionscal of special adaptation grants which are designed to assist exporting industries to face and overcome exceptional difficulties arising from the application of the British special import charge.</P>
    <P>The success of the policy of providing industrial grants is reflected in the rapid increase in industrial exports and the steady rise in industrial employment in recent years.  Industrial exports rose from an annual value of £32.8 million in 1958 to £62.2 million in 1963.  The numbers at work in industry rose from 243,000 in 1958 to 274,000 in 1963.  Portion of the growth rate envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is expected to be achieved by the establishment of new industries and it is necessary to have the means to provide financial encouragement towards this end.  This Bill, therefore, marks a further step in the implementation of the Government's industrial expansion programme.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the Seanad and look forward to its passage through all Stages so that An Foras Tionscal can continue its valuable work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement the Minister has given us on this Bill is self-explanatory and very full.  I do not think there is much more to be added except to say that this industrial grants policy has certainly justified <Col N="111" /> itself and the case made here for the extension of the limit allowed for advances from £20 million to £30 million by An Foras Tionscal is justified. We have seen already how these grants have helped to establish new industries and extend other ones and have helped to deal with the new situation arising out of the effect of the 15 per cent tariff and also the adaptation grants under the CIO. The benefits that flow from these grants are laudable and admirable. Earlier on I said that all Parties are concerned with the advancement of Irish industry and that we should put industry above scoring Party points. Slightly going back on my word, I should like to draw attention to the fact that these industrial grants were introduced by the inter-Party Government, which shows that all Parties have had a hand in building up industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all welcome this Bill.  I take this opportunity to address a few remarks on various figures given by the Minister.  First of all, we have the fact that the period for getting grants for adaptation has had to be extended to 31st March, 1966.  That means that firms have not responded very well to the urgent request of the Government.  We find that only 360 out of a total of around 4,000 firms have actually availed of the grants so far.  That is just one in ten.  I hope that the 360 represent far more than one tenth of the labour force involved so that we may hope the larger ones availed of the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, in particular, point to the urgency of getting the remaining 3,600 or more firms to get on with the job immediately and to make plans for expansion and adaptation to meet the <Col N="112" /> free trade era which is undoubtedly coming.  It will be necessary to mobilise public opinion behind the Government in their efforts to get firms to get on with the job.  The present campaign launched by the Government of buying Irish, which is proving so successful, should be coupled with the other campaign, that is, the demand that firms get ready for the future.  This could probably be done on a regional or even a town basis.  We could have regional competitions and show the region which has come up with the highest number of firms which have produced plans for the future.  We could thus follow up the firms that are lagging.  In fact, it might even be a good idea if the Government published a list of firms which have, so far, answered the appeal to plan for the future.</P>
    <P>The other item in the Minister's statement to which I wish to refer concerns the 30,000 workers and the additional capital investment of £54 million.  The capital involved per worker is £1,800.  That is a very reasonable figure at present.  The amount of money involved from the taxpayers' point of view is £500 per worker.  We should try to get a better return for the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>In the small and medium-sized towns, all of which are seeking their own industries, the rigid division between those having capital and the workers in the factories is not conducive to the best results, the best co-operation and the best team-work.  I should like to see the workers, especially in the small towns, becoming part owners of the factories in a short time. They should be given encouragement and inducement in that regard.  Portion of the shares in those factories, due to the grant, should be available to the workers.  Our hope would be that the senior workers in factories employing 20 or 30 workers would become part owners.  Consequently, at any time of crisis and reaction, when things threatened from abroad, they would be prepared to buckle down to longer hours for the sake of getting their products on the market.  That which was regarded as an exception in Newbridge would then become the general rule if <Col N="113" /> many of our smaller and medium-sized undertakings were on a partnership basis.</P>
    <P>I know this idea of partnership may not be too inviting to outside firms coming in to establish factories here. They want to take the taxpayers' contribution and yet remain 100 per cent. owners of the enterprise.  Perhaps the Government could deal with that matter in some way or other by being prepared to give a bigger grant to firms which were prepared to accept the workers as part owners or at least provide the possibility for some of the workers to acquire shares in the company. Of course, there should be no difficulty whatever with fully Irish based companies like Erin Foods when factories are being established.  They should try, as quickly as possible, to make their workers part owners in those enterprises.</P>
    <P>We can take a lesson from the panic that greeted the 15 per cent levy on our industries and the absolute indifference a year ago to a drop of 15 per cent in the price of cattle.  The drop in many cases was 20 per cent or 25 per cent compared with the previous year.  Despite that the small farmers and the farmers producing cattle did not go out of business.  It meant they had to work hard and make do with less but they got their cattle to the market.  They were in a position to survive whatever happened on the markets abroad.  Surely the lesson we must learn from the 15 per cent levy is that we have got to have teamwork in the factory on the basis that it can survive whatever fluctuations there are in the market outside. That means the co-operation of management and labour in a co-partnership so that together they present an unbeatable combination.  If we could encourage that combination in the small towns we would have fewer factories closing down because apparently their products can be sold.  We would have the workers making certain it was their factory, that they were part and parcel of it, and determined to meet any adversity that occurred.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be able to do something in the near future to promote <Col N="114" /> such co-partnership, at least in our small communities.  I know it might not work that well in the large firms. Of course, added point is given to that plan by the necessity for finding so many new jobs each year.  We should be disturbed by the returns in the live register at the moment which show a very considerable increase in unemployment.  The last time I looked at it, a week or so ago, the number was up by over 3,000 compared with two years ago.  That surely is something we should guard against.</P>
    <P>The figures also seem to show that for one reason or another our economy began to lose its forward momentum about last February.  It lost some of its momentum before it received the &ldquo;belt&rdquo; from the 15 per cent levy.  I do not envy the Minister his tremendous task of trying to create new jobs, especially if we are to continue the lunatic policy of accepting a flight of 6,000 a year from the land, and ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide 6,000 new jobs, and at least another £12 million of capital to resettle them.  That is a burden that should not be placed on the Minister. By European standards we have the fewest per acre working on the land.  I ask the Minister to get that burden taken off his back and placed fairly and squarely where it belongs: on the Minister for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture.  They should stem the flight from the land and not take refuge in meaningless statistics regarding what happens elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Minister and his Department on the way they handled the negotiations with the various interests concerned.  Adaptations have been made, various councils have been set up, and the CIO have worked hard and sent in the report. They have been models of how a democracy should work, with proper consultation between the Department and the industries concerned.  They have worked hard and long around tables.  They got the facts and the figures, and they issued a first-class publication which is a headline for all. I am sorry to say that headline has <Col N="115" /> not been copied by other Departments. All credit to the Minister and his Department for realising that in a modern democracy they must work hand in hand with these industries, and with the people they are supposed to lead.  I believe the success of the Minister can be judged by the esteem in which he is held by the people he represents. When that test is applied the Minister and his Department stand very high indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator McGuire and Senator Quinlan in welcoming this Bill.  I should merely like to contrast the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition in 1956, when similar circumstances prevailed, with the present approach of the Fine Gael Party.  It is well known that the Fine Gael Party always put the interests of the country first.  The Minister and the Government can be assured of the full support and co-operation of our Party in any effort they make to offset the very serious effects the British levy will have, and is having, on Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Since the report was introduced the registered number of unemployed persons has increased by almost 20,000. It is regrettable that the Government could not have foreseen the situation and brought in this Bill some months back, thereby perhaps saving the jobs of those people, now that we are coming up to Christmas.  As Senator Quinlan said, in 1956 by and large the farming community took the rap, and no special Bill was brought in to relieve them.  However, just because they were left to suffer is no reason, I suppose, why we should wish the same fate on the unfortunate people who lost their jobs this time.  I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all support a Bill of this kind and even though the sum may appear rather big to some people I do not think it is.  The object is quite clear.  It is to use our own money, for our own people, in our own country.  No one can complain about that.  I think it is the duty of everyone to support that object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> On another occasion I asked&mdash;I was not in order at the time&mdash;had the Minister any experience of cases where outsiders came in, availed of grants of this kind, an industry was built up, and then eased off.  Some comments have been made&mdash;not in this House, but I have heard them&mdash;that there is an easing off after using our money. That may have been a single case &mdash;I am not quite sure&mdash;but if there was a single case where there was a fall back without some very good reason, I know the Minister would be very alarmed because that would not help people to have the amount of confidence that is required.</P>
    <P>Another point into which we shall be going later this evening is in relation to the management and control of the grants.  My point is that industries should be set up to help local people and thereby create local interest, and naturally local employment. I was very impressed by Senator Quinlan's statement about how industry could function.  Some people say we may have to face a difficult period if we go into the free trade at a later stage.  On the other hand, it may not be different.  Whether we are wise to go in is another matter.  No one is a complete judge of that but it would not be right to go in if it affects our employment.  We are trying to keep our people at home, and as has been said, if we can compete efficiently there will be no ill effects.  However, we will just have to wait for the proof.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the part people engaged in industry might play between them&mdash;that is the workers, management and everybody else interested in the industry concerned.  In other countries, workers have been consulted at management level; they have been given a say in industry and there have not been any fall-back in the industries where this has occurred. In fact, the industries have improved as a result.  We have had people from France here to show how this could be done.  By adopting such a system we would be serving to consolidate the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am often consulted about what is called the live register. <Col N="117" /> I see people signing for the dole, people for whom the dole was never intended.  Of course, the fact that they now have to wait until 11 o'clock in the morning is very inconvenient for them.  I should be very interested to know what the live register really is. I have been about 40 years in public life and know a lot about unemployment, about marches at Christmas and the lot of it, but I thank God that all that has gone.  No longer are our council chambers invaded by poor people demanding a Christmas dinner. I have known occasions when we in the county council have had to give such people a fortnight's work out of the rates.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is most inconvenient for some of those drawing the dole to have to wait in the Gárda station, to which they have driven in a motor car, until 11 o'clock when they could have gone back to their work. The thing is resolving itself into a joke. I have no objection to any man getting the dole to maintain a wife and other dependants, but I have a feeling that a lot of people are drawing the dole who should not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The last contribution gives me the opportunity of dealing with Senator McDonald's point in reference to an alleged increase of 20,000 in the live register.  There are two periods, an employment period and another period.  During an employment period certain smallholders are not permitted to put their names on the live register because they are assumed to be working their small holdings of £5 valuation or less.  You cannot compare the live register of mid-April with that of mid-December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator should not have tried to suggest that there has been an increase of 20,000 in the unemployment figures.  He must remember that if we take corresponding weeks in different years a true picture will emerge.  In January, 1957, the live register stood at 76,000, just before the Coalition Government went out of office.  Under Fianna Fáil Governments that has been cut back to half that number, taking corresponding weeks four or five years ago and now.  That is the <Col N="118" /> comparison we must make, not between mid-April and mid-November.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire, speaking on the last Bill, said he would not make any point in relation to the contribution any one Government or Party made to industrial development as against another Party's contribution.  I let him get away with it but on this Bill he said the inter-Party Government introduced industrial grants.  I believe there must be something written up in Ely Place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter where it is.  He said the inter-Party Government introduced the idea of industrial grants.  The first Bill to introduce industrial grants in this country was the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952.  I do not know that the inter-Party Government between 1948 and 1951 had any idea of industrial grants.  As Parliamentary Secretary, I handled that Bill and I saw no literature, no memoranda anywhere to give me the impression that the inter-Party Government, who had just left office, had any intention of introducing industrial grants.  They did introduce an Industrial Grants Bill, so called, in 1956 and perhaps it is there the misconception arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that 1956 measure, the inter-Party Government merely extended the Undeveloped Areas Act, but that was a far cry from introducing the idea in the first instance.  That Act applied a limit of £50,000 and catered for new undertakings only.  It was a good first try as far as the parts of the country outside the undeveloped areas were concerned, but it proved to be a relatively ineffective piece of legislation, first because of the limitation of £50,000 and, secondly, because it could not apply to established industries.  If it had so applied, there were many industries in the eastern part of the country which could have taken advantage of it.  Of course, £50,000 was not much use to many a proposed new industry.  While it was some attempt to expand the scope of the industrial <Col N="119" /> grants legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1952, it turned out to be relatively ineffective and we had to extend that Act in 1959 in order to make it really effective in respect of the rest of the country.  I have tried to explain this one hundred times in the Dáil and Fine Gael still refuse to believe we are right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of a second form of it.  I am not qualified in these things.  Senator Quinlan suggested that the lists of these industries which availed of the special adaptation grants should be published.  There are the industries that have responded to requests to take advantage of the assistance provided for industries.  They were prepared to undertake exceptional expenditure in order to make themselves more competitive quickly.  These lists are available and are published in detail in the annual reports of An Foras Tionscal.  They contain not only the name of the industry but also particulars of the grants received.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not expected to put them up in the post offices and the Garda stations as you would the voting register.  The people who matter, the other industrialists, have access to these publications and, indeed, the general public as well.  I am not in any way against the idea of workers sharing ownership and profits of industry.  I think it would be a good idea and more conducive to producing the type of results in crisis periods to which Senator Quinlan referred.  We cannot impose this on any industrialist coming in here as a prerequisite to getting a grant.  There is no queue <Col N="120" /> waiting to come in here, waiting to take advantage of our industrial grants legislation.  We must remember that every other country, whether industrialised or not, has an industrial grants system.  Ours is as good as any but, nevertheless, we cannot impose a condition on those taking advantage of it, that they can only set up if they give their workers some form of share ownership in the undertaking.  I should like to see it but I cannot impose it as a <i>sine qua non.</i></P>
      <P>Senator Desmond referred to the possibility of there being some failure because the people who set up industries were not native Irish people.  I do not think it true to say that is the reason.  There have to be failures, of course, in business generally.  Some may be in ordinary industry, other in trades and other aspects of commerce, but we must remember, as Senator Quinlan pointed out, that the £19.5 million of grants has produced a capital investment of £54 million.  That is roughly 33? per cent grant as against 62? per cent private investment.  That private investment comes, to a considerable extent, from foreign sources. Therefore, when you have that kind of balance, a two to one capital investment in an undertaking, one presumes that the person who makes the private capital investment will have as much regard for the success of the undertaking as those he employs.  The Government gives him a grant to come in and work it so I do not think there can be any foundation for the suggestion that because they are foreign industrialists they are careless about the success of their Irish enterprise.  That can hardly be so having regard to the balance of two to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a few failures but in my opening statement I mentioned that we had 223 undertakings representing this total grant involvement of £15.5 million.  This figure is even better from the point of view of the argument I am making.  The £4 million represents the amount paid out on adaptation and enlargements and these are in the main old established Irish firms, so that the ratio is £15.5 million as against £54 million.  That even strengthens my argument.  That £15.5 million <Col N="121" /> represents some 223 new undertakings. There have been five or six failures out of the 223.  These failures may have been highlighted in the particular area because of the lack of concentration of industries there.  By and large, that is a good record of the number of new industries established and the number of workers they represent, that is, 30,630 people, as against the £54 million over all capital these undertakings will involve.  I think I can satisfy the Senator on the figures given that no industrialist will come in from abroad and have little regard for the success of the industry or the future of those he will employ in this country because he has heavy vested interest in the concern himself.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made a suggestion that when cattle prices dropped last year nobody bothered about them.  I am sure he knows more about that than I do.  I cannot recall the figures for the heifer and calf subsidy scheme, which rocketed far higher than the Government anticipated.  He knows the figures for the subsidisation of milk, fertilisers and other agricultural produce.  I do not think he ought to suggest there is a comparison in regard to the £2 million or so that will be involved in the special grants the Government give to offset the impact of the 15 per cent British surcharge. That is not a fair comparison to make &mdash;that the Government came to the assistance of industries and ignored the farmers.  I do not think we should try to set agriculture against industry in either House of the Oireachtas.  I am responsible for industry, not for agriculture. Nevertheless, I will not say that my particular baby is doing better than the agricultural baby.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I would make a bad student of Senator Quinlan as I never seem to get his point when I reply to him.  There is one other point I want to make arising out of what Senator Quinlan said.  In passing, he spoke about the popularity of the Minister which reflects the value of the work he is doing.  The longer you are a Minister, the fewer friends you are likely to make.  I am invited to meet a lot of people.  I shall not say I go in fear <Col N="122" /> and trepidation but I know I am going to meet some challenge on some injury I might have done to a particular group.  Inevitably you will tread on somebody's toes if you stay a long time in a particular Department.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take credit either for the work of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  The only thing we can claim is that we set it up, provided the financial needs and implemented its various reports and recommendations.  The reason I mention this specifically here is that the Committee on Industrial Organisation has now completed its work and I should like to pay public tribute here to the value of the work they have done.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Committee was comprised of representatives on the employers' side of the Federation of Irish Industries, the Federated Union of Employers and on the workers side by the various organisations represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, of civil servants and some independent outside economists.  They worked well and expeditiously and produced no fewer than 26 reports on industry generally.  I do not mean particular firms but 26 major centres of industry, representing about 60 per cent of the total number of workers employed in industry.  They had a number of interim reports which the House will remember dealt with the setting up of adaptation councils, the increasing of technical assistance grants, the making of those special adaptation grants available: all these were implemented with the same expedition as the CIO produced their individual reports and recommendations.  The work has now been completed.  The Committee deserve the highest recommendation from me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, from the Oireachtas and certainly from the community in general for the valuable work they have done.  This work has been highlighted throughout the world and has been favourably commented upon by the OECD and the International Monetary Fund as being one of the greatest examinations of industrial conscience ever made by any country. <Col N="123" /> It was an examination in depth that was unparalleled in any part of the world.  We can feel justly proud of their work.  I hope the effect of the recommendations they made will be commensurate with the amount of industry applied by each member of the Committee and by the survey teams for each particular task.</P>

      <P>The unemployment figures I quoted were taken from the statistics which the Department of the Taoiseach or the Statistics Office circulate every week.  I mentioned them because they continued to rise despite the fact that we have in operation quite a large number of Christmas relief schemes.

One factory I think in County Monaghan laid off men to that number.  There may have been a few others elsewhere: if there were, I have not heard of them.  I have asked industries to let me know exactly how the surcharge affected them.

      <P>On the section and on the making of those remarks by the Minister, I want to make another effort to get my point across to the Minister so that he may use it when he is making the allocation of grants.  I think the difficulty the Minister has in taking my points generally <Col N="124" /> is that he is always trying to read some political implication into what I consider to be simply a factual statement of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with making political points but with making scientific deductions from the facts before me.  Therefore, my mention of the fact that when the farmers' prices for store cattle went down in November, 1963, almost 20 per cent on the prices of the previous November&mdash;there was a drop from £6 10s. per cwt. to £5&mdash;was not to suggest that the Government should have suddenly rushed to the aid of the farmers.  I merely pointed out that despite a 20 per cent drop in prices, the producers concerned continued and held their markets and were able to survive, whereas industry, where you have much less of a total affected &mdash;some £50 million in the agricultural store cattle industry compared with what is affected by the levy, some £15 million or £20 million&mdash;could not have survived without the help the Government were giving them.  The only deduction I want to draw from that is that the farmers survived because they were free enterprise, self-employed. Therefore, I deduced from that that if industry is to survive we have got to get a great element of co-partnership into it where the example of the Newbridge workers will be not the exception but the rule because they are co-partners there.  That is the only deduction I want to draw from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Minister's suggestion of co-partnership and his statement that he is in favour of it but that he cannot see how to bring it about, first of all, we might inquire in Holland where they have made a great success of this and I think much could be done on that.  Secondly, it cannot be imposed but surely it could be done by way of inducement.  Thirdly, with our State companies such as Erin Foods, and so on, where they have no foreign interest to consider, I think the way is wide open there to bring in a proper and adequate co-partnership scheme. <Col N="125" /> Finally, I would say that I was rather amused by the battle as to who started industrial grants in the country&mdash; whether it was Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  In point of fact, if my memory serves me right, the Northern Government immediately after the war built free factories to encourage industries there.  The Minister himself has said that every country has an industrial grants system.  That is an idea that should be self-evident to all.  I do not see that it matters who brought it in. I am sure the civil servants were working on it for many years before it was brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to raise this on section 2 but as Senator Quinlan referred to it on this section I think it is no harm to say a few words on co-partnership.  Theoretically, it seems a very good Christian and business idea.  It seems to be implied that Irish employers are not aware of or interested in participation by their employees through co-partnership in their industries.  When certain firms to my knowledge attempted to include their employees, in a co-operative way, as shareholders it was found that, even where the shares were distributed, in the course of time the workers themselves showed that they were not interested. They sold the shares to other members or tried to get them bought back by the firm.  Generally speaking, they maintain they would rather have an increase in their wages than this participation in the form of shares.</P>
      <P>Any worker can buy shares in any of the companies by using his savings to do it, which is the ideal way.  I think, for instance, the trade unions do not advocate this proposal and are not interested in it.  I think it is felt by the trade unions that the real form of participation in a successful business, or in an unsuccessful business, in which case the shareholders would get nothing, is wages.  It is wages they are interested in because they are regular and can be relied upon, whereas with profits you will not get any reward for shareholding unless the company makes a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite naturally, the worker who has to think from week is really <Col N="126" /> interested in short-term payment and the trade unions concentrate on geting the highest possible money the firm can afford in the form of wages. On the other hand, the Socialists maintain that nationalisation is the true and perfect partnership in which everybody owns the undertaking but that is so spread out that it is really not an ownership or partnership at all.  I should like to explain that this is something that has not been overlooked by organised Irish employers but the fact is that people are just not interested.  I think they are not interested for the right reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to drag out the debate but I must say that I cannot agree with Senator McGuire that employers are in favour of co-partnership.  In any debate that takes place here the names of particular firms are not mentioned.  That is understood, but I have not seen any declaration for an organised body of industrialists in this country to suggest that they would agree with some Senators in the House, that they would advocate or make an open declaration on this.  I have never seen where the trade union movement was against co-partnership, or where workers have been enjoying a special interest in an industry as well as getting their wages. They have had to try to get what wages they could but they have not opposed co-partnership at all.  If we think of giving industrial workers an interest in an industry they can, of course, be encouraged to take a greater interest in other ways.  There are such things as fringe benefits which come up on negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know of the major disputes that have eventually to be settled on the basis of commonsense functioning as it should.  That can be brought about, too, on matters such as were before us on the Order Paper today. A greater sense of responsibility and understanding towards everybody, especially the people who produce the wealth of the nation, is very important. There is no use in saying that they are interested only in getting the best possible wages.  They can be further encouraged to take a special interest along the correct lines that will help <Col N="127" /> both industry and workers along the right road.  I am glad to hear Senator McGuire state that as far as he is concerned he believes in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are inclined to do at this stage is to discuss social principles in regard to employment in industry.  This is a very wide field for discussion.  Since certain things have been said I feel tempted to say that this is not a one-sided matter.  It involves a lot of education in regard to our attitude on the part of both workers and employers.  It is only by a gradual process towards a better understanding of the problems involved that we can solve this question, because profit sharing is a very desirable thing which many people would like to have to produce a higher level of social justice in our community. It might be regarded as foolish for somebody elected on the agricultural panel to express a view on this matter but I feel that we have a duty to express our view.  There will never be any progress made in this sphere if people representing workers in industry start blaming the employers for lack of progress or spokesmen for employers fail sometimes to credit the workers with a full sense of responsibility. We must realise that there are various pressures of social and other circumstances which might make the workers feel compelled to sell their holding.  The answer is not as simple as it would appear.  I rather suspect simple answers when a matter is complicated.  I would suggest that this is an idea which both employers and workers should think about because it is an important social principle and it is worth working for.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the intricacies of the trade union movement but I would suggest that concurrently with profit sharing there is something else which could be fostered by the trade union movement, and that is whether the principle of a differential wage could be agreed to whereby workers with similar output and responsibilities would get a higher wage based on their social or family responsibility.  That is an idea that is not new.  I know it has been tried successfully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Control of Manufactures Bill, 1964: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to do two things.  In section 1, it proposes an immediate relaxation of the Control of Manufactures Acts as a further step in the relaxations commenced in the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act, 1958.  And in section 2 it proposes to set a date on which the Control of Manufactures legislation will cease to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> To take the second proposal first, the House is aware that the removal of the remaining restrictions on external investment in industry in this country is envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in the interest of further facilitating increased investment in manufacturing industry.  Under the 1958 Act, certain categories of industrial enterprises were removed from the scope of the Control of Manufactures legislation, for example, small concerns whose fixed assets did not exceed £5,000, and also firms established with the primary objective of export.</P>
    <P>When the 1958 Bill was going through the Oireachtas it was suggested that the legislation might be completely revoked but it was felt that such action would then have been premature. In the period which has elapsed since then, considerable effort has been put into the task of gearing Irish industry as a whole to meet freer trade conditions.  Searching surveys were made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation, industry by industry, and substantial financial assistance is being provided by way of adaptation grants, to help industries overcome the difficulties or redress the shortcomings which these investigations brought to light.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed in this Bill to fix the date on which the Control of Manufactures legislation should end, and section 2 specifies the date as 1st January, 1968.  This has been selected after careful thought as giving a reasonable time to industrialists to adapt themselves to the new situation.</P>
    <P>A relaxation of the legislation to have effect immediately on the enactment of this Bill is proposed in section 1.  This will remove immediately from the scope of the Control of Manufactures legislation companies which have been manufacturing here for at least five years.  Such companies will thus be given, in advance of the repeal of the Control of Manufactures legislation, the opportunity should they need it of seeking external capital and &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; to strengthen further their competitive position.  The immediate exclusion from the scope of <Col N="130" /> the Acts will also apply to subsidiaries of these firms if the shares of the subsidiaries are held in the manner specified in the section.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is in line with the Bills we have previously dealt with.  It is, firstly, a preparation for the free trade era and, secondly, we need a high degree of continuing industrial expansion beyond what we have now achieved.  Therefore, I feel this Bill is both admirable and desirable. In the initial stages of our industrial development, it is necessary and desirable that we should provide every safeguard and give every encouragement to Irish citizens to develop their industrial arm and give our people an opportunity to establish an industrial base and acquire industrial know-how.</P>
      <P>We have, I feel, now reached the stage where we have a solid base and a solid block of Irish industrial development.  Firms entirely backed by native capital are fully employed.  It is right to say that we can no longer confine the expansion of our industries to our own nationals.  Of course, up to now, and under the previous Acts, it was possible for foreign capital and foreign industrialists to come in here but they had to come in holding a minority holding.  We were very successful in getting quite a large number of people to come here in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to bring about any dramatic expansion in industry and if we want to take our place in the industrial sphere of competitive exports, we will require, first, people to come in here and provide money and secondly, we will want to be sure that they are reliable people who know their business. That is what is being done under this Bill.  These people will now be able to come here and they will be welcome.  The requirements of the earlier Control of Manufactures Acts are, therefore, out of date and unsuitable in present day circumstances. There are some people who are fearful that by the removal of the conditions in the original Act, we will subject ourselves to outside financial domination which will replace our former foreign <Col N="131" /> political domination.  There is little substance in these fears because political power is now in our own hands. We can always control the activities of outside people investing their money here.  In fact, the boot is on the other foot.</P>
    <P>We ought to be careful how we talk about foreigners, foreign money and the safeguards we require when, in fact, we have these people under our political control here.  If there is too much talk about foreigners and what ought to be done with them, they will not come here.  There is one advantage in Ireland, that is, that we have a stable economy.  We have a good philosophy.  We have had native government for over 40 years.  We are a very sensible&mdash;I almost said staid&mdash; people.  We have built up the reputation of being an economically sound country and that we are a people whose word can be relied on.</P>
    <P>Foreigners know that our Government will not take any rigid or confiscatory measures against trade and industry.  It has always been known that our taxation system compares favourably, and in fact, more than favourably, with that of other countries. What most attracts foreign investors is the fact that industry can operate here profitably.  People will not invest large sums of money in a country where they will be told too much about the dangers to them and about the investigations that will be made when they have invested their money.  In the emerging countries today, where large sums of money were invested in the form of machinery, knowhow and buildings of all kinds, the people find that everything is confiscated and they have to leave with only their clothes.  They have had to fly out of these countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland is in a position to attract a very high degree of very good industrialists. Therefore, I welcome this Bill because I believe it is both realistic and timely.  It comes at a time when people are finding it hard to invest their money in safety and security with the hope of a profitable return.  I <Col N="132" /> believe Ireland offers such an opportunity and that this Bill makes it possible for such people to come here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support Senator McGuire.  Of course, when the question of foreign capital was first propounded, political feelings ran very high against its introduction. There is no good, however, going back on these controversies.  Conditions have changed and the policy of the Government seems to have changed.  I am prepared to agree that circumstances have changed and that some of the arguments which were valid in the 1930's against foreign capital are not valid today.</P>
      <P>We have a peculiar advantage from the point of view of foreign capital investment here.  If it were not for the fact that a good deal of foreign capital was coming in here, our balance of payments would be in a very serious position.  Our balance of payments itself is in deficit but deflation has been avoided so far by reason of the fact that our reserves are building up. Despite the fact that we have a deficit in the balance of payments, we have been developing rapidly and therefore are able to bear the deficit up to a certain point.</P>
      <P>Another point was mentioned by Senator McGuire with which I agree, that is, that when foreign capital is invested here, it is accompanied by a certain amount of technical knowledge. Foreign investors send in some of their managers and technicians.  Therefore not only do we get the advantage of additional investment in the country, but we get the advantage of additional knowhow.  Those people are better trained because they have a long industrial tradition.  That all helps Irish industry.  Foreign capital simply sets the standard for native investment as well and, therefore, from every point of view the coming in of foreign capital is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite see that the removal of the restriction on the importation of foreign capital at one blow might inflict a certain amount of damage on certain undertakings.  Therefore, the <Col N="133" /> Minister is perfectly entitled to go slow and postpone the final throwing open of the gates &mdash;so to speak&mdash;until a later day.  We must accept the fact that the time is coming when this country will be fully open to the importation of foreign capital and foreign industry techniques.  Our economic and financial policy in the meantime should be directed towards making the country a suitable place for that capital and those techniques which will be coming in, in the future.  For that reason I welcome the general principle embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator McGuire and Senator O'Brien in welcoming this Bill.  As I have always opposed the Control of Manufactures Acts and pleaded for their repeal, I am particularly pleased to see this new legislation.  As the Minister stated, it was foreshadowed in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> He and his Department are to be congratulated on introducing this legislation so comparatively quickly after the programme was published.</P>
      <P>The old Control of Manufactures Acts, principally the 1932 and 1934 Acts, were unwieldy and difficult.  The 1958 Act was not, perhaps, so unwieldy, but it was certainly difficult. Lawyers spent many hours trying to find ways around those Acts and, of course, they were got around by a number of subterfuges, but they were always on the Statute Book, and were always a considerable deterrent to really reputable foreign investors who wished to come in here and set up straightforward, 100 per cent owned manufacturing subsidiaries.  An indication of the unfortunate lack of effect in some ways of the earlier legislation was that there never was, so far as I know, any prosecution under any of the Acts which we are about to modify, and have repealed in three years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fair to say the earlier legislation laid the foundation, or as Senator McGuire put it, the base for the industries which we now have. While we may not have moved very swiftly in removing these Acts, we certainly did need something like <Col N="134" /> them in the early stage of our industrial development.  A century or two ago if foreigners came over here to set up an industry, a banking, or distilling, or other industry, they tended to settle here and, in the course of time, they and their families became Irish.  Nowadays no one sets up as an individual or a partnership.  They set up as limited liability companies.</P>
    <P>The time has now come when foreign companies set up here must, almost of necessity, always be foreign companies.  Many of our industries may be foreign dominated industries for their whole lifetime.  We may never really get control of them at financial or board level.  Against that we must place what is obviously one of the facts of economic life today, the movement towards freer trade in a world of freer capital.  Bearing that in mind, to develop our industries it is essential that we encourage more and more foreign investment.  As Senator O'Brien said, with this foreign investment we get the tremendous benefit of foreign knowhow which must gradually spread out through all our industries, and must lead to higher development in our technical schools to meet the demands of this increasing technical knowhow.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk in the Dáil that this Bill might lead to dangerous take-overs, and that existing Irish firms and companies might find themselves taken over by foreigners. As the Minister rightly said, the development of take-overs has not shown any significance, certainly in recent years.  The development of take-overs by non-Irish firms has not been very significant.  We must remember that a take-over may not be bad in itself.  There may be a take-over where one competing industry takes over another in order to remove it from competition and create a monopoly. I am quite certain the Minister is well aware of that situation and watching it.  It is not of any great significance here at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are certain take-overs in which a vigorous firm from outside may come in, take over a rather sleepy industry, develop it by the injection of new capital, and employ <Col N="135" /> more people.  That benefits not only the industry but the country.  Take-overs have those two sides.  Most of the take-overs we have seen so far in the manufacturing industry have led to development and increased employment rather than the opposite.  The position under the new Bill is clear. An Irish manufacturing company must see their way within the next three years to ensuring that they will be able to compete with any foreigner who may come in and set up an industry. The Government by various means&mdash;particularly the adaptation grants&mdash;have made the way of that Irish company a great deal easier.</P>
    <P>Thank goodness this appalling legislation of the past&mdash;appalling in the sense of being difficult to interpret and understand&mdash;is now on its way out.  In this connection I should like to say a word of praise and thanks, as a practising lawyer, to the Department of Industry and Commerce, for the manner in which in recent years they have administered the Control of Manufactures Acts, and the Industrial Development Act, 1958.  They are most difficult to interpret.  I speak for many lawyers when I say I always find from the Department an extremely practical approach to the problems which the Acts have raised.  If I may say so, if there were a practical way of getting around the Acts, provided it did not injure any existing Irish manufacturer, the Department have always been most co-operative.</P>
    <P>The writing may be on the wall now for some Irish industries.  This we must face: if an industry has been unable in the past to survive without the protection of tariffs and quotas, then it should never have been set up and we must face the prospect that it will have to go to the wall.  Against that many industries which will be established under the freedom given by this Bill will more than offset any unemployment resulting from the failure of industries which cannot survive the freer trade conditions.  We are facing the prospects that in those years our industries will be open to all comers.  It is something we welcome, as we do this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to point out that there is alarm among industrialists and workers in case the operation of this Bill may constitute a final decision in regard to how the industries may operate.  The Bill will take away certain protections.  Generally, when foreign capital has been involved in industry here, more than 50 per cent of the capital must be Irish with a majority also for directors, shareholders or owners, as the case may be. This Bill appears to remove that safeguard.</P>
      <P>On 24th November last the Minister stated in the Dáil that this Bill will repeal the Control of Manufactures Acts, which will not have any continuing provision.  I should like to know what the position will be in respect of the points I have just touched on.  The provisions of this Bill are a source of worry to many people in this country since we are facing the era of free trade.  I should like also to know from the Minister what the position will be in regard to take-overs.  Will the Irish control still be sustained?  Of course, nobody in industry is ever happy if he faces the prospect of running into difficulty later.  If the operation of this Bill creates such a danger for any industry, the reaction will naturally be that many industrialists will suggest that we must keep Irish control of industries in the country &mdash; that the final voice must be Irish.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask one question.  The conditions obtaining in 1932 and 1934 when the Control of Manufactures Acts were passed have changed considerably.  I may appear to be out of step here because we had Senator O'Brien and other economists contributing to the debate and saying that this Bill will provide a change that is desirable.  However, I am tempted to ask the Minister &mdash; I am sure he does not assume he will be Minister in 1968&mdash;is there any danger that this legislation might open the door for international cartels to come in and take over existing industries? We are led to believe certain industries are Irish controlled, two-thirds of the directors being Irish.  I am worried that in spite of existing legislation there <Col N="137" /> might be wholesale take-overs of Irish industries after 1968.</P>

I am only about a quarter of that period in the Department. There is really little to say in reply except in regard to the contributions of the last two speakers&mdash;I agree generally with the remarks of Senators McGuire, O'Brien and Ross.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to get it across that this is nothing novel.  We have had experience of the possibility of manufacturing firms being owned by external interests under the legislation of 1932 and 1934.  It was there made permissible for an industry to be controlled by foreign capital and interests, by a large holding of foreign capital in certain circumstances, particularly an industry that would be given a new manufacture licence by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Before he gave a new manufacture licence to what I might call an outside firm, the Minister had to have regard to certain statutory obligations&mdash; mainly, that the commodity the firm seeking the new manufacture licence proposed to manufacture was not already made in the country to a sufficient extent and that it was not likely to be made.  Quite a few industries have been set up with the aid of new manufacture licences which exempt them from the operations of the Control of Manufactures Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1958 Encouragement of External Investment Act we have had further examples of how such industries operate.  That Act provided a number of things, the principal one being that an industry set up here for the manufacture of a commodity that was to export 90 per cent of its total output would not be subject in its shareholding to the Control of Manufactures legislation.  Quite a few substantial industries have been set up in the country in those six years and these would not have been set up were it not <Col N="138" /> for the provisions of the 1958 Act.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is nothing new.  It is something we have been living with, since 1932 anyway and, in particular, since 1958.  The fact that we repealed the Control of Manufactures legislation does not mean that foreign capital will flow in and sweep away our native industries. The latter will have a right as long as they want to exclude any capital but their own.  They will not be afraid to sell out to anybody they want to sell out to.  As long as they are efficient and can procure sufficient capital from their own resources as well as from outside, then there is no inducement whatever for them to subject themselves to take-over bids.  They will be free agents.</P>
    <P>Our existing company law will enable shareholders in this country to get, in advance, sufficient information of suggested take-overs that might even be effected before these small shareholders who might not have a seat on the board would have an opportunity of making their voices heard.  In so far as it may be necessary to amend their legislation, it would, of course, be amended under the companies legislation, rather than under the Control of Manufactures legislation. We have, as the House is aware, one of the most up to date Companies Acts in the world.  It was passed this year and came into effect on 1st April. The fact that it is new does not mean that it cannot keep up with undesirable take-overs.  I have told the Dáil and the country that we will keep an eye on legislation and take-over bids and, if there were undesirable take-overs, we would act.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how undesirable take-over bids could arise.  They would cost somebody money and people would have to put capital in to buy out industry.  The people who make these bids are businessmen, industrialists and investors in trade and commerce generally.  They want to get their money back and the only way they can do that is where their industry operates successfully.  As was pointed out, take-overs are for the good of the particular industry concerned. There may be a few lame ducks, and even taking advantage of <Col N="139" /> all the inducements we offered by way of technical assistance grants, adaptation grants and loans, and any other kind of assistance, they would be able to make themselves viable in free trade conditions.  It would be desirable, if they cannot get the capital from within, that they should be able to attract capital from outside.  If the attraction of capital makes the industry more viable, I think it is a good thing. The people who put in that capital will want to get their money out of it and they are not going to close down that industry willingly.</P>
    <P>We have had a few examples recently, not so much of take-overs as the attraction of new capital to new industries.  Some have been rural industries and the effect has been immediately to find greater scope in foreign markets.  The people who come in will either have the technical knowhow from the production end and/or the market knowhow from the distribution of goods end.  It is usually the pattern. It tends to increase the efficiency of the industry and usually helps to widen the scope of the market.  As long as it operates like that, I think it is a good thing.  If not, we will, as Senator McGuire points out, have the ultimate control to ensure that these take-overs, as they come, will not operate against the interests of our own economy.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

I understand that Senator Stanford will second that motion and that he will then speak.  After that, I suggest that <Col N="140" /> Senator Ross might come in, if he wishes to, and he will be followed by the Minister.  I think it follows from what I say that the Minister may have to intervene a second time.  I think the House will appreciate the necessity for that.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome a statement from the Minister for Education on post-primary education.</P>
      <P>In discussing this motion, the Seanad is given an opportunity to discuss one of the most important subjects we could discuss.  It is a subject on which the Seanad should be in an excellent position to give a very balanced viewpoint, whether from the side of the teachers, the various schools, the universities or the Members in general.  Therefore, I am happy that at last we have reached this motion, though, of course, it is a matter of concern to us that it has remained for almost 12 months on the Order Paper.  We should have liked an opportunity of discussing many of the topics much earlier.</P>
      <P>In approaching this&mdash;I know we have all given a great deal of thought to these topics&mdash;I am afraid that I, personally, anyway, shall have to speak rather firmly and strongly on many of the points at issue.  I do so after great consideration and I hope the Minister or his Department will not misunderstand some of the rather severe criticisms I will have to make during the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> We ask the Minister for a statement on post-primary education.  I think it reasonable that we should exclude the university.  As post-primary is generally understood, it excludes the university. In any case, the Commission on Higher Education is sitting at the moment.</P>
    <P>We come, then, to the topics on which we should like the Minister to make a statement.  These are dominated, I think, by this whole idea of comprehensive schools, an idea enunciated by the Minister almost one and a half years ago and which has been given a place in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> as a major contribution to our progress in the coming decade.  Its introduction and the statements and so on we have had since then have been rather nebulous and have left many of us wondering what this is.  I cannot decide whether this is the greatest piece of window-dressing that has yet been done in Irish education or whether it is one of the most sinister attempts made to impose a further taint of statism on secondary education.  I do not know which, but as it stands we have very contradictory statements.</P>
    <P>We had a statement from the Minister in the Dáil yesterday that the comprehensive schools would absorb any existing vocational school within the area of their operations.  It goes without saying that they would similarly absorb any secondary school. That is very serious.  We want to know why.  At the start these were presented to us as merely catering for some out of the way backward places which no existing school organisation would touch, to which no secondary school, lay or clerical, would go or in which the county council could not be prevailed on to open a vocational school. We seem to have swung away from that.  Certainly the example of Cootehill does not bear that out as there is already a vocational school and a lay secondary school there.  We are left wondering because, after all, this is fitted into the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> In talking about education and economics, we should have two guiding principles.  First, we should be concerned that our children are cherished equally, in other words, with seeing that each has an opportunity of proceeding to the educational level for which he is best suited, and secondly with the economic fact that we want to ensure that our scarce resources, financial and otherwise, are used to the maximum efficiency.  To do this, surely we must have some idea of pupil costings?  We want to know what will this new system cost, how it compares with the cost of the present secondary system, and also, in fair play and in justice, we would expect the Minister and the Government to say: &ldquo;We desire that the school curriculum should have ample opportunities for science and for trades&rdquo; and that any existing school will be given full grants or full provision on the basis proposed for the comprehensive schools to set up science labs or anything else required, that they will be given equal treatment for payment of teachers and all the rest, that they will be allowed to compete freely and be given the tools to do so.</P>
    <P>That is the system that prevails in Holland, and that commends itself to all men seeking natural justice, but the position is that any figures we go into show that we are getting a bargain basement bargain in secondary education in this country and, I am afraid, not appreciating it.  Any figures we can take show that the average cost per pupil is something in the order of under £40, whereas in vocational education, which is the other arm, it is about £90.  I am not using these figures to suggest that vocational education is over-endowed. I am merely using them as a yardstick to show that the pupils in the secondary schools are costing only half as much as the pupils in the vocational schools.  Therefore, we must conclude that we are getting a real bargain in secondary education, as it is today. The Christian Brothers and the others, who have so nobly, throughout the centuries, built up our secondary <Col N="143" /> school system from nothing, are providing a self service.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, but it appears to me that in the days of our affluence we are certainly becoming ashamed of our upbringing and we are beginning to believe that it would be far better for us to wipe them all out and produce State education.  If there are questions of difference between the lay teachers and the clerical teachers they should be ironed out.  Edmund Burke laid down as his standard for a statesman a disposition to serve and the ability to improve.  When these two things are taken together they give a definition of a statesman, so the Minister for Education or the Department of Education should be able to build on the foundations we have.</P>
    <P>We should build up from what we have got and face the task of education in the most economical way we can. We should like the Minister to elaborate on the question of our two streams of education.  There is the stream coming through the secondary schools and the stream coming through the vocational schools.  I feel, being connected with education in some way, that this is a very dangerous concept.  Apparently all have to do the intermediate certificate. The big change to be made is that the vocational schools will now have to turn aside from the work they have been doing for so long.  In future, their success, too, will be judged by their achievements in the intermediate certificate, which will be put in the papers.  We are about to turn the vocational schools away from their real function, which is the training of young people who have to work with their hands and who provide the skilled technicians for which industry is crying out at this very moment.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged by all that about 70 or 80 per cent of our children reach the intermediate certificate standard.  Consequently, I am afraid that the idea of trying to make a common intermediate certificate cannot succeed.  A great number of our pupils are not gifted in the literary sense but they are gifted manually.  We <Col N="144" /> will have to hasten very slowly in this matter and watch carefully that we do not disturb a system which has worked very well up to now.</P>
    <P>With regard to the changes that have been made and the major alterations announced, I cannot see the pattern of consultation and research associated with any such major decision.  We all know that the Department of Education are not geared to be a research institute.  I came across in the <i>Irish Times,</i> of December 8th, a very worthwhile letter on this matter by Mr. Bittery, who was for quite a number of years a senior inspector in the Department of Education.  In this letter he says:</P>
    <P>With reference to research I want to say this.  I served for many years in the secondary branch.  It was then under-staffed and over-worked. Its essential duties were carried out with commendable efficiency and despatch: but research was <i>hors de question.</i> Research is something for a separate body of experts.  It cannot be done by officials who are fully engaged on the exacting, responsible, and harassing duties of day to day administration.</P>
    <P>That is quite rightly stated.  The Department of Education have no facilities for research.  Consequently, where was the research done that led up to the decision to make all of those changes in our school system?  I contend it was not done and that it should have been done.  We have got to be very careful in this regard about the position of the university <i>vis-à-vis</i> secondary education because universities may be in a position to give an opinion but they certainly should not, in any way, be allowed to be the deciding factor on what courses are carried out in secondary schools.  By and large most of our university people were in the top line of the secondary schools when they were going through. Consequently, their ideas of what the average secondary school pupil could assimilate are often very exaggerated or very unreal.</P>
    <P>The university is the custodian of its own standards.  Universities would <Col N="145" /> resent very much if any outside body came in and handed them a curriculum and told them to teach it.  That fact is acknowledged everywhere.  Once a body is competent to carry out work, that is the body which is in the best position to decide what major changes should be made.  This concerns mainly the secondary school teachers and the vocational school teachers.  They are the people who are actually doing the job and they should be the deciding voice on what the pupils know and whether a new course is practical or not.  I am afraid secondary teachers and teachers in general have very good cause for grievance in their day to day treatment.  That should change. I cannot think of any body of our citizens who have the same high level of education and hold such responsibility as the teachers.  They are there by education, training and everything else.  They are marked out and singled out in that way.  Consequently they should be treated as befits such a body. I am afraid that has not been done and I should like the Minister to give the reason why or else to show why this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The major change in the school programme is in the mathematics programme.  Speaking as one closely connected with mathematics and probably as one is more concerned with its application and its use through the electronic computer than anything else, I cannot see the logic behind a new course.  I am at the moment engaged on a very deep study of that with others of my colleagues in the university.  We hope early in the new year to be able to bring the benefits of our full views on it to the public, but at the moment we are dubious about it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say something on the recruitment of teachers.  Very often in the university we find ourselves in the unenviable position that when a bright young student comes along, the last thing we can suggest to him is that he should go in for teaching, although we see how much needed are such good pupils in mathematics to man the mathematics departments in the major schools.  When we show him the <Col N="146" /> figures, he says: &ldquo;I would be far better off as a junior executive officer, and I would have some opportunity for promotion&rdquo;, or: &ldquo;I would be better off if I were employed in the meteorological service.&rdquo;  To use a modern term, we must give teachers a status increase to ensure that there is something for them to aim at.  We should have something in the nature of posts of special responsibility in our schools so that those teachers would have a goal at which to aim.  Ultimately they should have not a munificent salary by our standards, but at least should have a salary comparable with that of an assistant principal in a Department. Unless we have something like that, we cannot advise our students to go into the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main points on which we should like to hear the Minister's opinion.  We should like the discussion to range over those, and any other related points, so that on this our one opportunity in 12 months, and perhaps our only opportunity for the next couple of years, we may even at this late stage be able to exert some influence on the course of education, and make sure it contributes its share to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>

      <P>I second the motion.  Its aim obviously is to give us an opportunity of hearing what the Minister has to say rather than to make pronouncements ourselves.  I personally do not intend to say much on the motion.  I shall just mention very briefly one or two lines of thought which the Minister might explore in his statement.  I agree with Senator Quinlan that it is probably desirable that the universities should be excluded from the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir. I should first like to hear what the Minister has to say on co-operation among our schools, especially with a view to meeting the very heavy cost that our new scientific equipment will demand.  It will be virtually impossible <Col N="147" /> for many schools in our underpopulated areas to find the money for scientific laboratories, language laboratories, and other modern scientific equipment of that kind.  The State will have to pay a great deal more, or voluntary contributions will have to rise, which is unlikely, though I shall be making a suggestion on it later, or we will simply have to pool our resources.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage a greater degree of co-operation between schools of various kinds in the underpopulated areas in the west or south of Ireland? Suppose there are three or four schools in a district&mdash;a boys' school, a girls' school, a convent, and a lay school. The rational thing to do is to have a very good laboratory for all the schools, a first-rate, single, scientific laboratory, superbly equipped.  Is he prepared to move towards that?  I hope he is.  I know in this country there are particular difficulties in co-operation of that kind, but I think it is our only hope, really, in view of our underpopulated areas, three or four schools will be using certain forms of equipment and certain forms of buildings together.  That is the first aspect on which I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with Senator Quinlan's fears about the comprehensive school.  I think that, properly introduced, and properly handled, it may be the best solution for some of our problems.  I hope the Minister will press on along those lines.  He is too wise to ride rough-shod over many of our historic traditions.  As we all know, the times have greatly changed.  The ecumenical age is here now and I think the time has come when certain sharp cleavages which resulted from the past will be healed.  There are creedal and social barriers, perhaps, which I hope we will be able to overcome.  I should like to see the time when our schools are much nearer to the schools of the United States of America, or Canada, or France, with citizens of all kinds going to school together.  I know this is full of the most tricky problems for any Minister for Education, but I firmly believe it is the ideal at which we should aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I hope the Minister will consider the question of the curricula in some subjects.  Senator Quinlan mentioned mathematics.  I am still unhappy about the languages in general.  So far as I can judge, it seems that there is still far too much emphasis on sheer memory.  There has been an improvement, but there have not been sufficient improvements.  So far as I can make out, it is still the position that a boy or girl can pass in Latin or Greek by making up a crude little key.  It may be necessary to know perhaps a minimum of grammar as well, but generally I understand that is still the situation.  That is certainly not a classical education.  It is not education at all.</P>
    <P>I was horrified to find&mdash;this was some years ago and it may not entirely apply now&mdash;when my own daughter was taking the Leaving Certificate examination in Latin, that she was more or less given to understand that all that was necessary so far as a knowledge of Virgil went was to learn a vile key.  That is the only word I can use: a &ldquo;vile&rdquo; key.  It was an abominable piece.  It was not even good English, and was far from being anything like the masterly language of one of our greatest European poets, Virgil.  It is horrifying to find it is still possible for children to qualify in Latin, and to some extent in Greek, on such terms as those.  I shall not emphasise it any further.  I know certain improvements have been made, but I would plead with the Minister to consider the abolition of set books &mdash;that is the real test&mdash;or to get as close to that as he can so that a genuine knowledge of the language and some genuine appreciation will be necessary before any child can pass in Latin or Greek.</P>
    <P>Another topic on which I should like to hear from the Minister is whether he would take steps to introduce education in good citizenship in the secondary schools.  We have talked about this in the House before but I shall mention it very briefly again.  It is of vital importance for the future of our country.  It is vitally important for this House and for the other House: it is vitally important <Col N="149" /> for politics as well as for industry and commerce that children should at an early age see the good side of the organisation of the State instead of reading some of the sensational reports in the newspapers and learning it first in that way.  I would urge the Minister to give the most serious thought to this development.  A good booklet, good practical work in class or some other method would make our children genuinely well instructed and good citizens.  I think they would enjoy it and it would very soon be reflected in the life of our country in general.  I especially think not of the recruitment of teachers here, though that is most important, but of the recruitment of politicians which in some ways is quite as important for our country.</P>
    <P>One aspect I am pledged to mention this fortnight&mdash;I made a pledge to the Minister for Local Government &mdash;is road safety.  It is an aspect of good citizenship which could save lives. It would improve the organisation of our country, manners on our roads, and the intelligence of our drivers.  It is a kind of education that children could learn very quickly if they were properly taught.  It is something they would not find boring or tiresome.  Of course, the difficulty is finding room in the curricula, but good citizenship should have at least one hour every week in every school.</P>
    <P>Finally, I shall be particularly interested&mdash;I imagine other Members will be as well&mdash;to hear any statement the Minister may be prepared to make about expenditure on necessary improvements in both the staffing and equipment of our secondary schools. Obviousy, much more money is required from the State.  I shall not labour that point because it has been pleaded again and again.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would add.  I do not think we should assume that all the money must be found in the future from the taxpayer.  In the future, we can still look for some contribution from public-spirited people who want to be associated with some school or who feel a debt of gratitude to a school.  I come from a very small <Col N="150" /> school in County Waterford, Bishop Foy School, and one of the past pupils has guaranteed £500,000 to that school for development.  I do not know the exact terms.  That is munificence of a rare kind in this country but I believe there could be much more of it, and one way to encourage it, as was suggested to the Minister for Finance last week by a small deputation, is to give relief from taxation on covenant to subscribers to secondary schools.  It would be quite a small thing which would not cost the State more than £50,000 on average; yet it would give that extra encouragement to public-spirited people to put their money into education.</P>
    <P>Many people are proud to see their names on a plaque in, for example, a library and some people pay tens of thousands&mdash;some are prepared to pay hundreds of thousands&mdash;of pounds for that type of thing.  A little more inducement may loosen many more purse strings and I hope the Minister will induce his colleague in the Department of Finance to encourage this.  It would be a very sad thing if the tide of charity dried up entirely.  I promised I should not speak at great length.  The main purpose here is to hear the Minister.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan said he put down his motion about 12 months ago.  I put mine down in July of last year, 17 months ago, and it seems to me a pity that one is so frequently told the Minister is unable to come into the House to hear a motion of this kind and of this importance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the answer to that.  The answer is that I know the Minister on occasions was available to come to the House, certainly in July of this year, and the Leader of the House promised me he would give me <Col N="151" /> a week's notice before this motion came up.  He did not give me a week's notice and twice he told me the motion would come up.  On both occasions, I admit quite frankly, I told the Leader of the House I was not ready because I had relied on his good faith and expected to have been given a week's notice.</P>
      <P>He told me that whether I was ready or not, I must make the best of it and go on with my motion.  Last July, when the motion was due to come up, it so happened I was ready.  I was prepared to go on but the debate in the House on other matters continued until 10 or 11 o'clock and the Minister, naturally, did not come in at that late hour, nor would the House ask him to. A fortnight ago, exactly the same thing happened.  The Leader of the House rang me up a couple of days before and told me, without any other warning, that the motion would come up.  I told him I was not ready.  Unfortunately I was completely engaged on the two following evenings.  He told me that whether I was ready or not, the Minister was coming in.  In fact I got ready a fortnight ago to move my motion and the Minister was not able to come into the House at 4.30 in the evening.  Both these motions were then adjourned until today.  The point that I was not ready is therefore not valid.</P>

      <P>The point is not valid because whether I was ready or not, the motion was to go on regardless of me.  I do not think the Leader of the House can possibly charge me with obstructing the House.  The point is he was going on with it whether I was ready or not.  He had given me an undertaking and he broke it.  I do not want to take him to task but I do not wish to be taken to task for delaying the House.  It is 17 months since my motion was put down and a year since Senator Quinlan's motion was put down.  This is a House of the Oireachtas and as a House of the Oireachtas, surely it <Col N="152" /> deserves better treatment from the Minister and the Government?</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be personal because the Minister for Education is not by any means the only one who has delayed the House in this way.  It is the normal practice of the Government not to come here for these motions.  It seems to me that is not treating the House with the respect with which it ought to be treated.  A motion should come before the House within a reasonable time after it has been put down.</P>

      <P>I think it is fair to say that this is an important motion.  All motions put down are important and I do not think the Government are treating the House with respect, but are treating us as a debating society, putting us off until such time as it is convenient.  I do not want to make this a personal matter in any way.  My motion is narrower than Senator Quinlan's, calling on the Government to give greater financial help to secondary education.  By secondary education, I mean the recognised secondary schools, of which there are 557 in this country.  I want to confine my remarks strictly to these secondary schools and do not propose to follow Senator Quinlan into the wider aspects on which he has chosen to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my motion was put down, there have been many changes in the treatment, by the Department and by the Government, of secondary education and there has been what I would like to think are, and what I see as, the beginnings of a drastic new look of modernisation.  At this stage the important thing is to see how far these or other steps of modernisation actually go.  My appeal is for greater financial help and, while the amount of money given to purely secondary education by the State has increased considerably <Col N="153" /> since my motion was put down, I think my motion is still completely valid.</P>
    <P>May I take the points which were valid 17 or 18 months ago and consider them in the light of what we know today?  I should like to add to Senator Quinlan's questions to the Minister because there are a number of developments which appear to me to be somewhat undefined at this stage. If the Minister is to make a statement, I should like him to deal with these points.  The points which were so valid a year and a half ago were; firstly, the need for capital grants for buildings; secondly, the need for equipment grants for a greater number of faculties; thirdly, the need to increase capitation grants; fourthly, the need to increase teachers' salaries; and, finally, the need to increase scholarships.</P>
    <P>It may seem a little strange that I should call on the Government to give more money to secondary education two days after a Supplementary Estimate has been passed in the Dáil for secondary education in the amount of £926,000, largely for incremental salaries and to some extent for educational and television services and equipment for modern language teaching.  I hope to show that while this is a step in the right direction, it is still not nearly enough and still does not compare with the amount per head of the secondary schoolgoing population in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is a notable increase, of course, because the total Vote for secondary education now is over £5 million, nearly £5,200,000, whereas last year it was £3,745,000 and in 1961-62, £3,130,000, so there have been very big increases indeed.  Yet, the amount spent on secondary education is still only a fraction, approximately one-third, of the amount spent on primary education.  Two days ago in the Dáil, there was a Supplementary Estimate for primary education.  This brought the total expenditure for primary education for the current year to £16,800,000 approximately, so that our £5,200,000 on secondary education is still only about one-third of the amount spent on primary education.</P>
    <P>If we compare these figures with the <Col N="154" /> figures in England and Wales, roughly the amount spent&mdash;and I do not think the exact amounts are important&mdash;on a child at a secondary grammar school is about £160, whereas the average spent on a primary school pupil two years ago was about £65.  I cannot quite tie up these figures but I think the inference from that is that more money should be spent on secondary education than is spent on primary education.  Possibly it should be something like twice as much.  At any rate, we appear to be considerably out of proportion in that the amount spent on primary education is still about three times the amount spent on secondary education.</P>
    <P>If I may go from the general to the particular and look at the position with regard to capital grants for building, six months ago the Taoiseach told us that the Government were setting aside £500,000 for capital grants for buildings and secondary schools.  This is a tremendous step forward and is very welcome.  As I said earlier when speaking about the 557 recognised secondary schools in this country, it involves little arithmetic to divide the number of schools into the amount of money at present available and arrive at a sum of approximately £1,000 per school.  Not all schools will want buildings at the same time but there is a prime need for new buildings in the vast majority of secondary schools in the country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might read a letter which I think is not untypical and which I received from a schoolmaster in the country:</P>
    <P>My school has two main buildings. One is about 250 years old and the other is a converted private residence about 150 years old.  What we require is a block of modern classrooms.</P>
    <P>Now, £500,000, spent as it is, will not be enough to provide many schools with the type of classroom which they need. I hope the Minister will tell us this is only the beginning of a very much larger grant because it is much larger grants that are needed.  When the Minister makes his statement, perhaps he will give more details on how these <Col N="155" /> actual capital grants will be administered. I do not think it is quite clear yet whether this is an outright capital grant or whether it may be in some part loan, and, if it is a loan, whether it is interest-free or not.</P>
    <P>It is not clear what the position of a school may be which has not waited for the announcement of these grants but has gone ahead on its own initiative, in the years perhaps not so very long gone by and raised the money and mortgaged its property to build new buildings, on its own, and is now heavily in debt and trying to pay off the mortgage that was created for that purpose.  Is the Minister prepared to extend the grants that are to be given for buildings to schools which have anticipated the grants but which had initiative and went forward to do what they ought to have done even at considerable capital cost to themselves?</P>
    <P>Again, some clarification is needed as to the conditions under which a school will qualify for these grants.  Is there any question of any strings being attached to grants?  Is there any loss of independence by a school which gets the grants?  I think this must be clarified.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions, I think, that has been announced by the Minister is that the grants will be restricted to schools with not less than 150 pupils and this, I think, must bear rather heavily on the Protestant schools.  I am not making a special plea here for Protestant schools but I mention it by the way because it is a fact that, particularly on the west side of Ireland Protestants are fairly thinly spread and, therefore, their schools tend to be rather small ones.  A possible way around this for not merely Protestant schools but for schools in areas in which children are spread might well be for the Minister to follow for secondary schools the project he has outlined for his comprehensive schools, namely, providing some form of transport to bring children from outlying places into bigger and more efficient scholastic establishments.</P>
    <P>I was amazed quite recently to see <Col N="156" /> all over the States of New England and in the Province of Quebec, in Canada, buses provided to take children from outlying districts to and from school.  These were special school buses, beautifully painted yellow, with &ldquo;School Bus&rdquo; inscribed on them. Obviously, we could not afford this sort of thing but it would be possible for the Government to subsidise school transport to some extent where there are difficulties in maintaining small schools and schools which may not get this capital grant.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Protestant schools and, perhaps, in parenthesis, I should say that I know the Minister has appreciated the difficulties which Protestants have experienced in organising their schools in certain circumstances.  I think I can quite safely say that it is a matter of great appreciation by the Protestant community as a whole that the Minister has appreciated the difficulties with which we were faced.  In making these points, I should like to make quite clear that I am not at all unmindful of, but on the contrary extremely grateful for, the attitude he has taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add all Ministers for Education of this State before him?  It is only fair to say that. There has been a consistent policy of generosity to Protestant schools from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to suggest that any Minister for Education prior to the present Minister was ungenerous: I concur in the statement made by Senator Stanford.  I know that, recently, deputations have been to the Minister and I should like to place on record the appreciation for the reception given to the Protestant deputations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point concerns equipment grants.  A short while ago, they were restricted to science and domestic science.  Here, a splendid step has been taken in making grants available now for television sets and language courses.  Recently I was in Mountjoy Prison, going around as a visitor, and I went into the schoolroom there.  I was surprised to see an extremely efficient and most effective form of <Col N="157" /> projector whereby the schoolmaster sat or stood looking at his boys and what he wrote was thrown by means of this projector on to a screen immediately behind him.  He had the great advantage that he could look at the people he was teaching and had not to turn around to the board while, at the same time what he was writing down in front of him was projected behind him.  This is probably rather necessary in prisons but it is also necessary to have this sort of thing in schools.  It is, perhaps, the wrong priority that we should have the latest equipment in prisons where we are trying to reform young men rather than in schools where we should be educating them so that they do not go into prisons.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points on which I would hope the Minister would widen the scope of these equipment grants.  They are already good grants and generous but I would hope he will widen the scope of them to cover projectors, the hire of educational films, slide projectors, slides, some of these new forms of three-dimensional maps for teaching geography, and, indeed, all the latest audio-visual methods of teaching which are so necessary.</P>
    <P>My third point concerns capitation grants.  Again a step forward has been taken.  The age for the giving of these grants has been lowered from 12 to 11 years 4 months.  I believe that this has made quite a considerable difference to a number of schools, particularly in the cities.  At the other end of the scale, it has been extended to a post-Leaving Certificate year. This has had a very beneficial effect on young girls and boys who have got their Leaving Certificate but who want to go on for a further year, perhaps, before going to university or possibly to broaden their education usually before going into industry or business or the professions.  But, once again, I think we have got to get the figures of the increase into some perspective.</P>
    <P>The capitation grant for a senior child has now been increased from £16 to £19 and for a junior child from £11 to £14.  When these grants were first introduced in 1924 the figures <Col N="158" /> were £11 for a senior and £7 for a junior, so that in the period from 1924 to now these grants have in the case of a senior barely doubled and in the case of a junior just doubled.  If you take the £ as being worth £1 in 1924 it certainly is not worth more than 5/- today, so that the real money which is going in capitation grants is very much less per student than it was in 1924 although a greater nominal amount is being given.  In fact on capitation grants in terms of real money we are losing ground.</P>
    <P>The post-Leaving Certificate year grant is specially welcome, and one which was looked for by many educationists, but I believe that there are strings attached to that which are somewhat stringent.  I understand that it is necessary to study no fewer than five subjects, one of which must be Irish, to qualify for that grant.  For a young man or woman studying for a university scholarship this may be somewhat onerous.  I am not in favour of too much specialisation, but five subjects may be a bit too much. While I am in no way speaking against the teaching of the Irish language, and I do not wish to be misunderstood, I do not think that at this stage in the career of a young man or woman they should be forced to learn any one subject, be it Irish, mathematics, Latin or whatever it may be.  I do not think that after the Leaving Certificate a particular subject, whatever it may be, should be put compulsorily on the curriculum in order that a capitation grant may be given.  The plea, therefore, on the capitation grants is that there should be still greater increases, and that some of the restrictions attached to the grant for the post-Leaving year should be relaxed.</P>
    <P>Fourth is the question of teachers' salaries.  Here the complaint of teachers is quite clear, that the present rates of teachers' salaries in this country just qualified, just having got a higher diploma in education and a university degree, simply do not compare with the amount which he or she will get either in the North of Ireland or in Great Britain or elsewhere, and certainly do <Col N="159" /> not compare with the figures he or she will get with a university degree in industry or commerce.  As I understand them, the present figure for a single man or woman teacher in Ireland with a higher diploma for the first year will be somewhere between £250 and £550, probably around the £350 mark. Compare that with the same person going to teach in Great Britain, with say, only a third-class honours degree. He will start with £790.  I know of a case a year ago of a young girl here with a university degree and the higher diploma in education who could not get a job in this country at more than £300 a year living out.  She went up to Belfast and got a job almost immediately at £800 or £840 living in.  There simply is no comparison between those figures and the case of a young man or woman leaving the university and going into industry.  He will get at least £750 today in Ireland, and a young qualified professional man will probably get the same sort of figure.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the best teachers we must compete with the cost of paying teachers outside the country and the cost of paying people who are going to industry and commerce.  We are still, even with the increases recently given, miles and miles behind.  This is terribly important because it is on our young teachers that we must build the basis of our teaching community.</P>
    <P>Added to this is the question of reciprocity with other places.  Now a teacher who has been teaching in the North can come back here and get the incremental rate for the number of years he has served as a teacher in the North.  The same is true of certain of the African countries and, I think, of a teacher in certain countries of Europe who has been teaching modern languages and is coming back to teach modern languages here.  This is all in the right direction, but I believe, the great majority of people qualifying here as teachers go to England, Wales or Scotland&mdash;particularly to England &mdash;but they cannot come back on that incremental scale.  If they come back they come back at the beginning.  This is a very sad thing because as time <Col N="160" /> goes on in the years in which a teacher serves the incremental scales as between Great Britain and this country tend to even out.  The real disparity is at the beginning and not at the end or in the middle of their teaching career. My own view is that it is very valuable if people go away for a year or two to another country, get other experience, learn things which they might not like to do here, and learn things which they would like to introduce here.  They learn by their experience elsewhere and we should be able to profit.  But these people who go to England, Wales or Scotland cannot come back here and get the incremental salaries which they would have got had they stayed or would have got if they had gone to the North and come back.  It is time that the doors were opened to these people, because we can do nothing but benefit from the interflow of people from one country to another in the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>My final point is on the question of scholarships.  The Minister has time and time again said that his aim is secondary education for all.  I would add that that should also be the aim of all of us, and I would certainly strongly support this, but this must mean the availability of secondary education to all who are fit to participate. If this is to be a reality then we will need very much more in the way of scholarships than we have at present.  The figures I have have been quoted in the House before.  They are probably old figures but I have no more recent ones.  I do not think that they do any more than highlight the disparity between this country and other places.</P>
    <P>In 1960-61 the expenditure on scholarships in Northern Ireland per head of the child population was £16 12s. and our equivalent expenditure was 11/2d. or 11/3d.  Since then, of course, there have been considerable increases in scholarships made available by county councils and by the Government to the county councils. Let us suppose that the figure here has been doubled or trebled.  If it has been trebled, it is still far less than one-tenth of the amount per head per <Col N="161" /> child spent on scholarships in Northern Ireland.  Probably the Northern Ireland figure itself has increased since 1961.</P>
    <P>I would in part agree with Senator Stanford when he says perhaps not all the money to be devoted to secondary education must come from the State and that parents should make a greater contribution to their children's education. This is probably so.  My concern is for the parents who simply cannot afford to send their children to secondary school, either because the value of the scholarships is not high enough or because in some sense they cannot afford to pay the cost of the books.  Books still have to be bought and they are becoming increasingly expensive with every month that passes. This can be a very heavy burden on a poor family.  In Northern Ireland, I think the books are provided as part of the scholarship.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford mentioned the case of a donor who gave £500,000 to his old school.  This is a splendid gesture indeed.  If we could have all schools with some sort of donors of that kind, the Minister's problem, and my problem, would be solved.  In principle, I believe it is true that parents and, possibly, old boys and old girls should make some contribution to their schools.  That is only a minor thing. The real truth of the problem lies in making sufficient money available through scholarships so that any child of sufficient ability can get education in a secondary school within its means. A far greater amount of money will still have to be made available to the local authorities which can be paid by them to deserving cases for a secondary education.</P>
    <P>I know Dublin Corporation's grant for scholarships has considerably increased and is now up to £16,000. Again, there are strings attached to scholarship money by Dublin Corporation which may be reflected in most of the country.  It seems to me that the wrong sort of emphasis is being placed on the subjects for which scholarships are awarded by Dublin Corporation.  I believe the position there is that scholarships are marked on the basis <Col N="162" /> of 1,000, and that 300 marks are given to Irish, 200 to English and 100 to each of the other subjects.  I suggest this is a bit out of balance.  Nobody wants to denigrate the teaching of Irish but there may be children who cannot learn Irish.  I am not taking Irish particularly.  Suppose the high mark is given to mathematics or the classics. If there is a child who cannot learn either of those subjects, it seems to me quite wrong to prevent that child from getting a scholarship, when he could be very able in other subjects.</P>
    <P>We are doing the revival of the Irish language harm and the country as a whole, harm, in overloading the marks given in this way to the Irish language, so that unless you are really good at Irish, you will not get a scholarship. There should be other subjects with similar priorities.  The greater needs of secondary education remain the same, in spite of all the progress made over the past 18 months or so.  There are many signs of modernisation, and in bringing in a motion of this kind, I do not want to belittle the work which the Minister and his Department have done.  They have made great strides.</P>
    <P>We have a new mathematics course and a new science course.  Biology has now become a subject in the Intermediate for the first time.  I am not sure if it is a subject for the Leaving Certificate but I hope the Minister will make it a subject, if it is not.  There has been a new approach to the classics and modern languages.  Music appreciation now appears in secondary school courses.  This is all very much to the good.  I most strongly support Senator Stanford's appeal that citizenship be taught as part of the curriculum. It is very necessary that young people should know something of Government, local government, the Civil Service and so on, on which they are dependent, and that they should get this knowledge while they are young.</P>
    <P>This new look is also needed in respect of one or two other subjects.  I should like to see something done about the teaching of history.  We teach Irish history and we teach European history but I should like to see a much broader development in <Col N="163" /> this sphere.  It seems to me Irish history is so interlinked with British history that we should learn something of British history, apart from merely European history.  We should also learn something of the history of the USA with which we also have very close links.  The teaching of history needs a new look and we should look further and widen the teaching of history in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>The whole system of examinations is in need of revision; it needs drastic revision on the whole.  Senator Stanford mentioned his daughter learning a bad translation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I discouraged her and she adopted a different method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that every child in a secondary school who takes the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examination has to learn vast amounts of written English, possibly French, Irish and other subjects, so that the whole examination so far as the Intermediate is concerned is merely a memory test.  I am not sure that the position is very much better in regard to the Leaving Certificate examination.  We need badly to have a new examination system which will test our children on what they have actually absorbed and how far they can think rather than on what they have just learned parrot-fashion and merely throw out <i>verbatim</i> in a meaningless manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have said enough to show the House that all this needs money. The money going to secondary education is not enough.  We pour money into every conceivable object for development.  In industry we make factory grants, and adaptation grants which we were discussing only this afternoon.  We give grants for exports, for machinery, for roads, for hotels, for monuments.  We give agricultural grants for new ditches, for farm buildings, for drainage, and even for pigsties. To my mind it is economic lunacy to spend vast sums on industrial and commercial development, on the reorganisation <Col N="164" /> of the country in many capital ways, without spending equivalent sums on the foundation of all this development in industry and commerce, education.  The trouble is we do not see the money which is spent on education in immediate terms of bricks, mortar or machinery, with the result that education is neglected. Education needs this money, and secondary education needs it vitally, if investment in education is to mean anything at all.  Investment in secondary education today will, of course, produce the leaders of industry, commerce and the professions tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> on page 13 dealing with education and training it is stated:</P>
    <P>Better education and training will support and stimulate continued economic expansion.  Even the economic returns from investment in education and training are likely to be as high in the long-run as those from investment in physical capital.</P>
    <P>Those are strong, and important, and I believe true words, but they will not be a reality if we do not spend very much more on secondary education, and they will not be a reality until the points I have outlined are considerably supplemented by more and more money.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister is to be congratulated on the start which he made in transforming secondary education but, while it is a considerable start, it is only a start, and we have a long way yet to go.  At a later stage I shall formally propose the motion that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to give greater financial help to secondary education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think by agreement I am to speak twice.  If the House permits me I shall leave the points raised by Senators to be dealt with when I speak later, because I am sure other Senators will speak and raise similar points, and deal this time with the invitation of the Seanad to make a statement on post-primary education.  I welcome any help I can get in trying to solve the <Col N="165" /> very acute educational problems which face our country, and if I have not been able to meet the Seanad on this before it has not been altogether my fault.  Now we are together I must say I am very happy to be here.</P>
      <P>I welcome the expression of a point of view by Senator Quinlan which is better out in the open if he thinks it at all.  I want to assure him that I have suffered the &ldquo;slings and arrows&rdquo; and I will not be too sensitive on what he has to say about me.  He seemed to have some fears on that point. Again, I think the expression of opposite views will be a help to me.</P>
      <P>For me the problem about discussing education is that it is not widely understood, and very few people have a framework on which to base an opinion.  Even those who have an idea of the skeleton on which the body of our educational system is built can be easily lured into very attractive side-issues and points of detail which in themselves could be debated for many hours.  If I were not to guard against that, then the Seanad, which waited 17 months to hear me, would have to wait another 17 months to hear me out if I tried to deal with the whole question of secondary education, because I presume the motion involves post primary education in general.  I shall try to make a statement which avoids details as far as possible. Starting with the background is the best way I think.</P>
      <P>Not so long after I was born, at the beginning of this State, there were 25,000 children availing of the only form of post-primary education which was then in existence in the State.  That was secondary education in the academic sense.  I am sure no one could have the idea that that number was representative of the community as a whole.  It was not until 1930 that the vocational branch, as it has come to be called, of the post-primary system was formally established by Act of Parliament.  At that time there were about 1,000 whole-time pupils in technical schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position, which is rapidly changing&mdash;changing each year &mdash;is that about 90,000 pupils attend full-time at the private secondary schools, and 32,000 attend full-time at <Col N="166" /> the vocational schools.  That does not take into account the big number of part-time attenders at the vocational schools.  We have, therefore, gone a considerable way towards catering for the post-primary education needs, but the system as I found it, and see it, stopped short of what I would deem to be the social rights of all our children.  My leading principle as Minister for Education is that every child should have an opportunity of receiving some post-primary education and the corollary to that is that such post-primary education should as far as possible be that best suited to the aptitudes of the child.  Other people might say this, but anyone who dreams it can be achieved without conflict with some other interest is fooling himself and anyone who says you can do it without taking positive action is again either fooling himself, or trying to fool others.</P>
    <P>How to achieve this?  I have said I decided it was not possible of achievement in the system as it existed. We had the academic stream available to children going to intermediate certificate, and beyond that for those who could afford it a leaving certificate course which in turn could lead to various posts and to the university.</P>
    <P>On the other side, there was a two-year day course in vocational schools with a day group certificate examination which was and is useful but which did not lead further.  I decided that this vocational course should be a year longer and should lead to an examination equal in standard and in esteem to the examination taken in the secondary school.  In regard to subjects, there was no question of forcing children in vocational schools to do subjects which were completely academic.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that this should be a new comprehensive examination in which hand and eye subjects, if you like to call them that, other than the academic can be taken by pupils in vocational schools.  Having decided to establish that, I thought it was also necessary to fill a gap in that branch of our educational system, and that was that there should be a course leading to a leaving certificate on the <Col N="167" /> technical side towards which students could be channelled from either the secondary or the vocational school after the comprehensive intermediate certificate examination.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate course can lead to the universities, as I have already said.  The technical leaving certificate course, too, should lead to some faculties in the universities and to technological colleges.  There are other aspects of the comprehensive system.  To my mind, comprehensive means a wide range of subjects to meet the aptitudes of different children and also means it would be available to all children.</P>
    <P>This suggestion made here of maintaining the small school and at the same time cherishing all our children equally is a contradiction.  A small school with a small number of pupils can only have a limited staff and perhaps five or six subjects.  The children there are limited to what is available in that school and, therefore, they cannot be considered to be cherished equally with those who can get into a much larger school with a wide range of subjects from which they can choose, a wide range of teachers and all the other advantages.</P>
    <P>The idea of the comprehensive school is based on this.  The viability of the smaller schools in the thinly populated areas is doubtful.  In our efforts to cater for a wide range of talents, it is necessary to have a wide range of subjects, which means a wide range of teachers.  To justify all that, you must have a relatively large number of pupils, probably 225 or upwards.  This is the basis of my thinking and, perhaps, at this stage I might say to the Senator who saw some sinister motive on my part, that the system of management which I thought suitable to the comprehensive school offers great promise for a continuation of the degree of independence which our academic people have enjoyed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how I can get it into people's minds&mdash;I am not saying Senators do not know it&mdash;that an utter change has come about in what education <Col N="168" /> means to the community and in our attitude to education.  When there were 25,000 children in secondary schools some of them did not need education: they went back to a shop, to a business, to money; they could enjoy the luxury of education and lecture us that education was an end in itself.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that most of the 25,000 enjoyed a privilege which changed their whole lives from those of their brothers and sisters who did not get this opportunity; and it is even more true now that the more education you get, the more obviously the better you enjoy an advantage throughout life. Education does mean something in terms of social standing and income of the person who gets it.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, a matter of social justice and if we want to cherish our children equally we must give them equal opportunities in education.  This utter change I spoke about has been from a situation where the community at large was not concerned with our educational establishments.  The demand was not very great.  It could have been and was left then to private enterprise plus the activities, the excellent activities, of the vocational committees.</P>
    <P>When we come to the stage where every child must be given an opportunity and where the community will be called on to spend vast sums of money to achieve this, then we must plan.  If I seem to be looking for authority it is not because I want authority for its own sake, but because nobody can so deal with our educational system as to meet the needs of the individual and the community without having sufficient authority and co-operation from all concerned.</P>
    <P>This utter change I have mentioned has brought about a situation where somebody has to take initiatives, somebody has to make the necessary changes to fit modern needs and this somebody has recently been me, as Minister for Education.  Of all the things people might say about me, the most dangerous is that I had not done the research to bring about the changes which I thought were necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> Research is a fanciful word.  I suppose people consider that Ministers would not have the resources necessary for research.  People think in terms of very isolated and difficult activities.  I tried to think of the alterations, as Senator Quinlan called them&mdash;others would call them reforms &mdash; of the changes that have been brought about recently which required research.  I made a list of the things.  The first was the 1961 Scholarship Amendment Act which for the first time brought the State in to pay into the scholarship fund of local authorities and which has had the effect of bringing the number of scholarships from 600 to 2,000 and increasing annually.</P>
    <P>When I introduced that measure, I said it was a pattern.  I still regard it as a pattern, for further development, but I do not know of any research that might have been necessary to make that change.  It was an obvious fact that children should be given equal opportunity.  It will take many years to give everyone this.  In the meantime we had to take interim measures to try at least to give the clever children a chance.  That is the position since 1961 when the Scholarship Amendment Act was introduced without a great deal of research.  The knowledge is there for those who want to see it.  Another change was the introduction of direct building grants for secondary schools. Research in this was not necessary because, indeed, there was a clamour for those who best knew the problems of those building secondary schools.</P>
    <P>
      <i>En passant</i>, I think I would claim these building grants as a sign of our intention to see the secondary private schools flourish and continue to do the good work they have been asked to do. It was in earnest of our intention to do this that we introduced these grants, and I hope it will reassure the Senators who felt that there were some sinister motives behind the comprehensive schools idea.  There are other changes, too, and I can say that not one of them was done without consultation with the people most concerned.</P>
    <P>There is the extra year which will be recognised without any examination strings, capitation grants and quota consideration allowance.  The extra <Col N="170" /> year, I hope, and intended from the beginning, will be dealt with in a liberal way by the Department of Education.  I think it was last year we relaxed the school staff quota by not counting in the headmaster of a secondary school and also by allowing the ratio of pupils to be, one teacher to 15 all the way up, instead of one to 20 after the first 60. Again, there was no research needed there.  I have witnessed in my time changes in the curricula.  Mathematics were changed, and physics and chemistry, again after many people had called for the changes.  These changes were brought about by people who were constantly in touch with the teachers.  They were brought about in consultation with the universities and I am amazed that a Senator of the university which passed the mathematics would not be aware of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people think that consultation means that I do nothing, but I am not dealing with the constant problem of consultation.  I am dealing with the statement of the Senator that things were done without research.  I think the people who deal with these courses could hardly be accused of being short of knowledge. However, I did not mean to go into details and this is an example of how one, in education, gets swamped down in details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, I should get back to the main issue again.  If there was anything more than another that bothered me, having decided that somebody must take the initiative and that this was the duty of the Minister for Education for the time being, it was that I found, as in many other countries, if we were to give coverage to all the children and adequate facilities for them, we had not adequate information about the places available or the type of teaching and training we would need for the years to come.  This was something on which research had to be done.  This was certainly something on which we had little information and on which no country in the world had, I think, done any research.  In co-operation with the <Col N="171" /> OECD, we set up a team of economists, statisticians and educationists, guided by a steering committee, to investigate what should be our investment in education, what lines we should follow over the next ten to fifteen years.</P>
    <P>Very detailed and very thorough examination has been carried out by this committee and their report will be available shortly.  As I have said somewhere else, I understand their report will be regarded as a very important document, not alone nationally but internationally, because the Irish Department of Education was the first to start this type of research and will be the first to have a document of such importance available.  This research, which was necessary and which is now near completion, will be for us the main signpost of Government expenditure and State activity in education over the next ten to fifteen years.  It will also be the beginning of a great deal of expenditure on education because, even though we have stepped up almost double for some years in expenditure on education, you come to the stage where extra money does not bring extra results.  One must plan one's spending and, with the publication of this study, which has been happily called &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;, we enter an era of further increased expenditure on all forms of post-primary education.  We have also, of course, the Commission on Higher Education, which is not concerned with the matters under review in the Seanad tonight.  You cannot however, altogether separate higher education from secondary and vocational education, because the social principles guiding the availibility of opportunity at post-primary level operate also at university level.</P>
    <P>I would have wished to go to the Seanad and make a much shorter statement and to have avoided details.  I would like to say my main interest in education must be social.  I am not an educational expert, although I have much expert advice available to me. I should like to repeat, if there is any statement of mine the Seanad should like to debate, it would be that my <Col N="172" /> leading principles, as Minister for Education, is that every child should have the opportunity of receiving some post-primary education.  Again, the corollary of that is that such education should be that best suited to the particular child's aptitude.</P>
    <P>I have taken every possible occasion recently to warn everyone associated with education that we are only six years now from the deadline set for raising the school-leaving age to 15.  As well, the normal annual increase of pupils, due to the increasing appreciation by the public of the value of education, will bring about a situation by 1970 where we shall need 60,000 extra post-primary places.  This requires a great deal of building, a great deal of activity and, above all, an avoidance of tripping ourselves up on technicalities when we all seem to be agreed on the main issue.  I repeat again that you cannot have my main principle without some clashing of interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil áthas orm gur tháinig an tAire chun an ráiteas sin a dhéanamh. Fear misiniúil is sea é agus ní bhíonn eagla ar bith air a chuid tuairimí a nochtadh mar a dhein sé go soiléir anso anocht.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Minister and the important statement he made.  He has propounded a new principle which he has introduced into Irish education. The new principle of comprehensive education which the Minister has referred to here tonight, was first introduced to the public by means of a press conference.  On that occasion, I think, that the Minister made a tactical blunder inasmuch as he did not invite representatives of all educational interests to the conference.  In saying that I am not criticising the content of his release on that occasion, I am just suggesting that he would have had more goodwill for his new plan had he first consulted with and invited the interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that at the time the conference was about to take place a newspaper rang head office INTO asking if it was aware of the new plan for comprehensive schools and we had to <Col N="173" /> admit that we were completely unaware of it.  We then rang the Chairman of the Council for Primary Schools in Dublin diocese and he also informed us that he had not been consulted nor had he been invited to the conference. I think that it was a mistake to ignore a large number of people who have been asking for and have a keen interest in educational reform.</P>
    <P>During the course of the press conference on that day, the Minister stated that he hoped to get agreement on the question of managerial control of comprehensive schools.  Interested parties would also have preferred that he had been in a position to say that he had actually arrived at agreement on this important point.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of suspicion about the nature of the control of the comprehensive schools and whilst I myself am not in the slightest way suspicious of the Minister's intentions I have heard such suspicions mentioned. The existence of those suspicions and the lack of support for a scheme of comprehensive education must damage what in itself could be a very important educational development.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to all that education must in the future continue to play a fundamental and vital rôle in the development of this and any other country.  There is a changing pattern all over the world.  For example, in France in the 1800's a survey was made in which it was established that 80 per cent of the people worked on the land whereas only ten per cent were engaged in industry and ten per cent in a tertiary sector, that is the sector which includes white collar workers, secretaries, lawyers, doctors, research workers, newspaper people, and so on.</P>
    <P>The picture has completely changed. It was pointed out in a Unesco survey, a couple of years ago, that the 80 per cent on the land had dropped to 30; the ten per cent in industry has jumped to 35 per cent and the ten per cent in the tertiary sector has jumped to 35 also&mdash;a complete change of picture, which indicates that for the future more and more post-primary <Col N="174" /> education will be required.  Also according to the Unesco report, the Russian delegation stated that in Russia the use of muscle power is now somewhat outdated and that all types of work contain a high element of intellectual content.  The opinion also that more and more education is required in this country comes from very responsible sources.  For example, Most Rev. Dr. Birch, addressing a group last year said we must have more and better education and that we must adapt our present system to modern needs.  The Minister also said we have to take into account modern needs but it is a question of how best to do that, bringing all the forces with one.  That is why I suggested at the outset that a tactical blunder was made in the way this matter of comprehensive education was approached.</P>
    <P>Further, the Minister did say that sufficient research had been undertaken and in certain cases research was not needed prior to the introduction of new programmes, new curricula and also in the matter of adapting existing facilities.  The curriculum for secondary schools is as wide a curriculum as would be found in any country but it has never been fully operated.  It ranges from languages, classical and modern, right down to manual work, includes all the branches of science, domestic economy, music and commerce.  Those subjects are in the programme for secondary schools published by the Department of Education but that curriculum has never been operated to the full, and, as Senator Quinlan pointed out, the secondary schools of this country have been suffering from financial malnutrition and the whole secondary situation is completely anaemic.  Sufficient money has not been poured into the existing facilities.</P>
    <P>I think that the question of more financial aid should be looked at very seriously.  Schools are not getting sufficient financial support to employ teachers to fully operate our existing system of secondary education which could be comprehensive if properly operated and would involve all the subjects which the Minister envisages for a comprehensive school.  The ordinary secondary school at the <Col N="175" /> present time just engages in a limited range of subjects.  It cannot afford to employ professors to engage in the full range.  It is well known that some of the outstanding secondary colleges in this country are deeply in debt, in some cases up to as much as hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Were it not for the goodwill of bank managers and due to the fact that these schools are in the main run by religious communities they could not carry on at all.  A lay person trying to conduct business in that way would not last any length.</P>
    <P>I would say, in relation to the comprehensive schools, that an opinion seems to be abroad that they are a bad idea in themselves.  They are not a bad idea.  In Scotland and Northern Ireland comprehensive schools have been accepted as the ideal way of choosing children for academic or practical courses later on.  The comprehensive idea is good in itself but I think that the people who are questioning the whole idea of the comprehensive school are doing so on the basis of a fear of undue State interference in education.  I have heard it expressed in several quarters.</P>
    <P>It is feared as a result of experience in other countries where the State did unduly interfere in the control and direction of education that similar abuses might arise in this country. Personally I do not think so but people who are objecting to change are raising these fundamental matters.  In the matter of the expansion of post-primary education I would say that the Minister was wise in this respect that he avoided any idea of selection at 11 or 12 years of age.  That type of selection has been thrown overboard in Britain and Northern Ireland following experience of its operation.  It was found that testing was socially loaded against the under-privileged child and people who were selected at 11 plus did not always make the grade because of the test being made at such an early age.  People in Northern Ireland have departed from the 11 plus mentality and gone over to the comprehensive school principle.  In the <Col N="176" /> recent White Paper issued in Northern Ireland that has been strikingly brought forward.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of scholarships.  The Minister did state that in introducing a wider range of scholarships he had enough of research, but I would suggest that more research was needed on one particular aspect and that is on the scholarship age.  We think that it is going to do a great injustice to children in rural areas because they will have to travel considerable distances at a much earlier age, otherwise they would be completely debarred from participating in the scholarship examination because they would be over age at the time they would have reached the sixth class.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the whole idea of examinations scientifically examined in Ireland because the emphasis has been too much on the memorisation of so many pieces of knowledge which are useful for supplying answers to questions at examination time.  This leads people into the position of being taught what to think rather than how to think.  There is not enough individual freedom in the schools for the teachers or pupils; there should be a more liberal approach towards learning, and later when students would find themselves in the area where speculative learning is required they would not be completely at sea.  We have known cases of people taking scholarships in the secondary schools and losing them at University level because they have been treated in a hothouse fashion in secondary schools.  The Minister himself is completely against the whole idea of cramming, and he should make a public statement on it at some stage, because I have a letter which he has written, which incorporates a paragraph stating that cramming for scholarships over a number of years is educationally unsound. Too many children are being pressurised to obtain results.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the Minister or the House, but I would like to stress that whilst we all agree that more education is required for efficiency, efficiency alone is not the complete <Col N="177" /> answer.  Fears will be allayed if the Minister avails himself of an opportunity to make a pronouncement on the fundamental philosophy of education rather than highlight the comprehensive schools only.  An opportunity should be availed of to state that efficiency in itself is not the complete thing.  The comprehensive school, due to the nature of its management and maybe the nature of its curriculum, might lead to undue emphasis on efficiency.  While technocracy might produce a catalogue of dazzling results in the technological field, if it leads to spiritual bankruptcy, it is a complete failure.  While the physical sciences are very much to the forefront in various curricula there should be a balance of broad humanism.  If the Minister could enunciate an educational philosophy which would allay a lot of the fears he would bring with him many of the people who are now inclined to snipe at him.</P>
    <P>I know that he is aware of criticism, but the House also should be aware of it, and if he did consult more with people who are engaged in the field of education on the managerial and teaching levels, he would bring about that harmony in education which is very fundamental.  An educational system cannot progress with maximum potential unless there is complete harmony in all sectors.  Understanding is absolutely necessary.  Suspicions poison the atmosphere and damage the whole educational potential.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I am in considerable sympathy with the motion.  I would suggest, of course, that it is somewhat too narrow in its approach and is likely to cause more trouble and misunderstanding than is intended.  In the first instance, the motion must be placed in its proper perspective.  We all agree more money must be spent on education, but, we must decide on the priorities of expenditure and must decide how much money is to be expended on education. Are we going to select out a particular field of education or are the public likely to misunderstand that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, we have to consider primary education in two ways.  The first way is the provision of more teachers in order to reduce the size of classes, and the second is an increase in the number of new and renovated schools.  We know how important it is to have new schools.  The Minister has, to a very great extent, increased the number of new schools and it is wonderful to see the pupils in their new surroundings. We then go and see the old schools which were built, I suppose, 100 years ago.  We see the atmosphere there and the sanitary accommodation and other facilities available.  The old schools were built under a foreign Government and are very small.  Against that, we have the new type of school which is <Col N="181" /> bright and cheerful, with all the facilities that make a child happy and inclined to learn.  All that costs money and is a slow process.  Extra costs are involved in raising the school leaving age to which the Minister refers.  I do not mind adjourning in the circumstances if the Minister has to leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the school leaving age, I know the Minister has it in mind that after so many years, it will be raised.  That is an important matter.  It will cost money but not very much.  There is no doubt that we want more money for secondary education.  Then it may only bolster up the existing educational system in so far as it is confined. Fundamentals come first.  If we are to spend more money on secondary education, let it be spent on a massive increase in all branches and include technical school scholarships so as to get a broad line where it will take all pupils who may be able to advance. They may be prevented from doing so at present because of lack of money, even though they have the inclination and the abilities.</P>
      <P>Greater advances could be made to the parents who are moving along that line.  I may mention one and a half years ago approximately the Labour Party published its policy on all forms of education.  It was published in the public press and was available for anybody who wanted it.  It covered all forms of education.  I notice, while listening to Senator Quinlan and to the Minister that there was very little difference on the main principles.  We said at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party considers that the provision of free post-primary education to all children is a social and economic necessity of the first importance.  If we are to cherish all the children of the nation equally we must radically alter the system of secondary education by which in the past the financial contributions of the State have tended to endow the rich and buttress privilege.  A system of selection for secondary <Col N="182" /> education which depends on the financial resources of the parents is unacceptable.  At present only one out of every four children leaving primary schools go to secondary schools.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious matter.  It continued:</P>
    <P>We accept that all children must have some form of post-primary education, and that the transfer of children to the more academic forms of this education must be based on aptitude and ability rather than on the financial position of the parent.  We should ensure that the system of secondary education is an integral part of a co-ordinated educational system reaching from primary to university education, allowing free transfer between secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    <P>In some respects the problems facing the framer of educational policy in our secondary school system as it is today are greater than those to be found in either the primary or vocational systems.  This may be one of the reasons why the recent Report of the Council of Education on the secondary curriculum was the universally condemned failure that it was.  In the case of primary or vocational education, a rational framework provided for and watched over by the nation already exists.  There are many faults and difficulties but the foundation is there.  In the secondary school system, on the other hand, there is little in the way of coherent framework.</P>
    <P>The distribution of secondary schools in this country is one of the most irrational features of the system.  At present, owing to the uneven distribution of schools, in some counties a child has approximately one-third the chance of secondary education of a child in one of the better endowed counties.</P>
    <P>Every Senator knows that that position exists in certain places throughout the country.  A boy or girl in certain parts of the country who wishes to continue secondary education has, perhaps, to <Col N="183" /> cycle eight or nine miles to get to the nearest secondary school.  That child may have had to go only three miles to the primary school when first starting school.  Now, because the child wishes to go to secondary school, he or she has to travel so much further. That is the hardship and the difficulty which has to be faced in the urban areas.  It is a big problem and I was glad to hear the Minister refer to it. He covered various aspects of the problem and it would appear that it is a question of finance.  If we are not prepared to provide the finance in relation to the children of the nation when starting in life, we just waste money afterwards, because we must approach it properly at the start.</P>
