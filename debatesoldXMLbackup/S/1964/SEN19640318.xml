    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the supplementary expenditure required for 1963-64 since the 1963 Appropriation Act and to authorise the expenditure necessary to carry on the supply services until the 1964 appropriation is passed.</P>
      <P>Section 1 authorises the issue of £9.4 million which is the total of the Supplementary Estimates for the current financial year.</P>
      <P>Section 2 authorises the issue of £61.73 million, that is, approximately one-third of the total of the Supply Services Estimates for 1964/65.</P>
      <P>Section 3 empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the sum of these two totals.</P>
      <P>At almost £186 million the Supply Services are up almost £19 million on this year's original figure or £9½ million over this year's total with Supplementary Estimates included.</P>
      <P>I should say, however, that the Estimates have necessarily had to be framed on the basis of the rates of pay in force prior to 1st February, 1964. They do not, therefore, include provision for the &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo; or other pay increases.  Additional provision of about £7 million will have to be made for the ninth round for civil servants, teachers, Army and Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the Estimate for Transport and Power contains only a token provision for CIE as its statutory grant ceased to be payable this year. <Col N="697" /> New transport legislation will be required providing for continued subsidy.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should refer to is the fact that various estimates are increased because of the introduction of payments for all services rendered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and not just Telegrams and Telephones as hitherto.  This is explained in a note on page v of the Preface to the Estimates Volume.  The position of the Exchequer will, however, remain unchanged as increased disbursements on the Supply Services will be offset by increased postal revenue in the Exchequer accounts.</P>
    <P>A note of the major increases and decreases in the Estimates as compared with the original 1963/64 Estimates plus Supplementary Estimates passed up to 6th March, 1964, has been circulated to Senators with the Estimates Volume, and Senators will have observed that a considerable portion of the increase for 1964/65 relates to social expenditure, namely, Social Welfare, Health and Education.  Social Welfare is the largest single Estimate in the Volume.  At £33.9 million, the service shows an increase of £2.7 million over the revised provision for this year, the increase being mainly attributable to the full-year cost of the improved benefits announced in the last Budget.</P>
    <P>State expenditure on the Health services in 1964/65 is estimated at £13.6 millions which is nearly £2 million more than the current year's provision, including Supplementary Estimates. Nearly £900,000 of this is for higher payments to health authorities in respect of Health Act patients in voluntary hospitals and for the increased costs of local authority hospitals.  The balance of the increase arises almost entirely from a new provision of £1 million for payment of a Grant-in-Aid to the Hospitals Trust Fund for building.</P>
    <P>The provision for education shows an increase of over £2 million when account is taken of supplementary estimates.  The two special pay awards granted to national teachers last year are included but there is no provision <Col N="698" /> for either the &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo; or for any increases which may be granted to secondary and vocational teachers as a result of negotiations at present in progress.  The grants to universities and colleges show a considerable increase, mainly in grants for additional accommodation and equipment.  Senators will have noted new provisions for grants to the Dublin Dental Hospital and the College of Pharmacy.  A grant to this college for 1963-64 has already been approved in a Supplementary Estimate passed recently by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is by far the largest of the economic services.  Next year's Estimate is £1.6 million less than the total provision for 1963/64.  This is due mainly to four facts&mdash;(1) the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme is nearing completion; (2) it is not necessary to provide for losses on the disposal of wheat; (3) the amount required for bacon subsidy is lower because of improved prices; and (4) no provision is required for further expenditure on grain storage facilities.  The total decrease attributable to these items is £3.5 million.  As against that, there is increased provision for the Farm Buildings Scheme and the Lime and Fertiliser subsidies.  Provision is also made for two new items, the Brucellosis Eradication Scheme and the Scheme of Grants for Calved Heifers. The provision for the relief of rates on agricultural land shows an increase of £456,000.  Total expenditure on Agriculture in 1964/65 will amount to some £33 million or almost 18 per cent of all Supply Services expenditure.  This is a significant contribution towards the well-being of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the non-agricultural economic services, the Estimates show the Government's desire to promote industrial development, to encourage industry to adapt itself to modern trading conditions and to develop tourism.  The provision for grants by An Foras Tionscal is being increased from £3 million to £5 million.  An increase of £½ million is made in the provision for Technical Assistance projects and the grants to the institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Coras Tráchtála and the Shannon Free <Col N="699" /> Airport Development Company.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been making an increasingly significant contribution to the economy.  Estimated expenditure for tourist development, including grants for holiday accommodation and resort development, is over £2 million in 1964/65, an increase of £550,000 on the current year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs is £1.2 million up on the revised provision for the current year.  Four items account for the bulk of this increase, namely, £300,000 more for salaries, £318,000 for telephone capital repayments, £150,000 for the grant-in-aid to the Broadcasting Authority and about £250,000 arising from the new arrangement for charging for services rendered by and for the Post Office. The last two items do not involve any additional charge on the Exchequer. The rise in the grant to the Broadcasting Authority is counterbalanced by greater Exchequer receipts arising from the higher licence fees introduced a short time ago.  The increased payments by the Post Office to other Departments are reflected in higher receipts in the relevant Votes.  Increased expenditure on telephone development will be recouped from capital advances from the Central Fund for telephone capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Ninth round and any other pay increases that may be given to Post Office staffs will, of course, be additional to the amount of this Estimate and, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told the Dáil, will have to be recovered by way of increased charges.</P>
    <P>I have now, I think, mentioned briefly the main variations in the Estimates for 1964/65 as compared with the current year.  The increase in the total provision is considerable, particularly when regard is had to the further additions required for remuneration and CIE.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Seanad, however, that the Government have examined the Estimates thoroughly so as to reduce provisions to the minimum considered necessary and, so far as possible, to confine increases to the <Col N="700" /> services which contribute most to the well-being of the community, both economic and social.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Central Fund Bill gives us an opportunity to review aspects of general Government policy.  This year one of the obvious topics for discussion is the White Paper laid before the Seanad last August entitled <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  I propose to devote practically all my contribution to this debate to a discussion of the Government's programme as outlined in this White Paper and also to give some alternative ideas of what I think might be better approaches to planning. In order to do this properly, it is necessary to examine first the outcome of the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
      <P>In discussing the Second Programme, it is impossible, without unduly wearying the Seanad, to deal with all aspects of the programme which properly arise and I intend to confine myself to a discussion of the targets of the programme and of the financial aspects of some of the Government's policies which are implicit in it.</P>
      <P>In regard to possible alternatives, I wish to put forward that I think we could go a great deal further in adopting the type of Liberal Planning which is being adopted by the countries of EEC and by the Christian Democratic Parties of these countries, in particular. We could go much further in the direction of planning without any loss of personal freedom if we had Liberal Planning.</P>
      <P>Therefore, let us first look at the outcome of the First Programme, published in November, 1958 and covering the period 1959-60 to 1963-64.  We recall that in the White Paper introducing that programme it was estimated</P>
      <P>that the implementaion of the programme would result in an increase in real national income of some two per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>When we come to read the White Paper on the Second Programme, we see on page 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This two per cent growth rate was mentioned not as a target but <Col N="701" /> as a deliberately modest forecast of what action on the lines of the programme might be relied upon to achieve.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a slight difference in emphasis in the two.  When one reads the Second Programme it suggests that the sponsors of the First Programme foresaw a rise of more than two per cent and were not surprised in any way by the fact that the outcome showed an average rise of four per cent.  The impression is given also that since the views of the sponsors were so true in this respect their views on 1970 outlined in the Second Programme are equally true.</P>
    <P>The most interesting fact about the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published in 1958 is that it was never carried out.  There was a definite programme of development investment laid down in the Government White Paper, a programme which in 1958 was estimated to give two per cent, though now we read that really two per cent was not all the sponsors hoped for.  What was actually done from 1958 onwards?  What was done was that the development expenditure proposals contained in the White Paper were replaced by a different development investment expenditure programme, one involving 2½ times more capital than had been planned for.  So what was carried out between 1958 and 1963 was a development capital expenditure programme some 2½ times that given in the White Paper on the First Programme.</P>
    <P>Also, if we look at what was to be the mechanism of success in the First Programme, we are told in it that the release of the dynamic was to be through agriculture.  Of course, we can agree with this in principle; with sound agricultural policy in a country such as ours we would expect the release of the dynamic to come through agriculture.  But if we look at the outcome of the First Programme what do we find?  We find that expenditure in agriculture increased by more than the average and agricultural output increased by less than the average for the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, which was to be the secret of the dynamic was, in fact, something which lagged behind the remainder <Col N="702" /> of the economy.  Look at one of the definite targets in the First Programme and we find that the number of milch cows was expected to increase from 1,200,000 to 1,500,000, a rise of 25 per cent.  I have not got the latest figure but the indications are that this increase has been achieved only to the extent of about 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The success achieved between 1959 and 1963 was, certainly, not achieved in the direction which the sponsors of the programme had expected.  Can the overall success achieved during the five years be attributed to the fact of the existence of the Programme?  Can it be taken that even though the programme did not work in relation to agriculture it did in relation to industry? In other words, can we say the programme was a success because the increase in industry actually gave us an overall four per cent increase?</P>
    <P>I suggest that not all and maybe only half of this industrial progress can be attributed to what was in the White Paper.  If we look at the way in which this progress occured we shall find it was not an increase of industrial production leading off into increased industrial exports.  What happened was that a rise of industrial exports came first and was followed by a general rise in industrial production.  If we look for the reasons for this we can find a number of factors which had little to do with what was contained in the White Paper on the First Programme.</P>
    <P>From 1957 onwards, the slight advantage we had over Britain in labour costs became quite marked.  At the same time, the tax relief on exports introduced by the previous Government began to bear fruit.  When this first impetus was over, we had the apparent imminence of our entry into the Common Market to keep up the momentum by causing many managers to take stock of their competitive position.</P>
    <P>Other factors, which were part of the Government's programme, did undoubtedly contribute, one being the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act, which removed in part a very serious distortion in our economic structure.  If we look at this First Programme in order to find a <Col N="703" /> guide to the reliability of the forecasts in the Second Programme, I fear we must conclude that the targets in the Second Programme will only be realised if similarly helpful circumstances arise.</P>
    <P>Since 1963, our labour cost advantage over Britain has declined and the position in this respect will certainly have to be improved if we are to hold a really strong place in the British market for our industrial exports.  An intensive policy would have to be used to encourage efficiency and innovation in all spheres.  I submit that we need something more than a half promise about the repeal of the surviving restrictions of the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>If we take the White Paper of August 1963, containing the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, we shall find it very difficult to discuss this White Paper because as it stands the amount of quantitive information in it is altogether inadequate for an analysis of the assumptions and reasoning which lie behind it.  At the time it was published, it was intimated that a further document giving the meat of the problem would be available early in 1964: I believe the month of February was mentioned.  So far, we have not had this further document and so we are left with the White Paper of last August as the only official publication.</P>
    <P>This White Paper has no technical appendix to help us to analyse its effects.  It was only last month when Professor W.J.L. Ryan presented a paper to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, entitled the <i>Methodology of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, that one was able to appreciate at all the way in which the figures in this White Paper had been built up.  Some help towards an understanding is given in another paper by Dr. R.C. Geary, presented to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society in January last.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this White Paper and look at the objectives of the Second Programme as set out there.  The objectives are given on page 17 and are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> (i)  It will cover the period to the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>(ii)  It will have as its chief objective the raising of the real income of the community by 50 per cent in the 1960s, in line with the collective target of the OECD.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Its complementary aim will be to secure the progressive reduction of involuntary emigration so that by 1970 net yearly emigration will be reduced to 10,000 at most.  The net increase in employment envisaged in the decade is 78,000.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Special attention will be given to education, training and other forms of &ldquo;human investment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(v)  The obligation of Ireland to give increased aid to less developed countries will be recognised.</P>
    <P>(vi)  The basic principles underlying the first programme will continue to be respected.</P>
    <P>The overall targets given here are clear enough&mdash;a 50 per cent increase in GNP, reduction of net emigration to 10,000 by 1970, and 78,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>When this White Paper came out, there were certain critics&mdash;they were not political critics&mdash;who said of it that it seemed largely to consist of the adoption of the 50 per cent target and the working out of its implications.  So seriously did the Government take this criticism that the Government Information Bureau on 30th August, 1963, denied that the general target of a 50 per cent increase in the gross national product between 1960 and 1970 was an unconsidered adoption of the collective OECD target.</P>
    <P>The position is that there is no indication in the White Paper, no indication in Professor Louden Ryan's paper to the Statistical Inquiry Society and no indication in Dr. Geary's paper to the Statistical Society as to how the 50 per cent was arrived at.  Dr. Geary starts off with it as a basic assumption. Professor Louden Ryan talks of the various rates of increase which were possible and, having rejected high rates, says a rate between three and five per cent would be appropriate and eventually states:</P>
    <P>Four per cent was the highest rate which seems possible in the light of <Col N="705" /> the limitations imposed by the availability of internal and external resources.</P>
    <P>You can see from the White Paper that if you adopt this figure of four per cent and round it off to 4.14, in order to get the 50 per cent target, you find you involve yourself in £16 million a year deficit on your balance of payments.  Is this a reasonable figure? Was this 4.14 per cent taken because it was considered that £16 million a year out of balance on external payments was a reasonable criterion?  It seems to me that the shift to 4.14 per cent has been affected to a great extent by the OECD target.  I should like to ask the Minister specifically what rate of increase, given all assumptions other than that the balance of payments be out by £16 million, would be appropriate; in other words, what rate of increase would have balanced us on external account, all other assumptions remaining as in the White Paper?</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Government Information Bureau also goes on to say that the individual sector figures are not merely arithmetical figures implicit in the total 50 per cent: I heartily agree.  The sector figures given do not immediately follow from the figure of 50 per cent. They require additional assumptions, and some of these are less reasonable than the assumptions leading to the overall figures of 50 per cent growth in ten years.</P>
    <P>The first assumption made is in regard to employment.  The assumption is made that employment will rise between 1960 and 1970 by threequarters of one per cent per annum. It is very difficult to discuss at all figures in regard to total employment in this country.  The only information we can get is the standard information in census years, and outside those years the only official information we can get is that the figures given are wrong.  Therefore, we are in grave difficulty in trying to work out what is the employment increase.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us figures, and can he indicate the accuracy of those figures in relation to the rate of increase of total employment during the past three years?  Certainly it <Col N="706" /> appears to me from the figures in the annual volume of employment and unemployment that in the past three years we do not seem to have been in a position to increase total employment. If we apply the figure of threequarters per cent to the figure given in the White Paper for the total number employed in 1960, we come up with the figure of 78,000 more people at work in 1970 than there were in 1960.</P>
    <P>The further assumption is made, before calculating emigration, that there will be a fall of 20,000 in the number unemployed, and this, as far as I can read it from the various documents, means there will be an unemployment rate of 3½ per cent.  I should like to ask the Minister is this assumption implicit in the White Paper. It is rather interesting to go back over the figures for the past few years in regard to the percentage of insured persons on the live register.  In 1959, it was 8.0 per cent; in 1960, 6.7; in 1961, 5.7; 1962, 5.7; and 1963, 6.1. The figures so far in 1964 are less than those of last winter, but they do not show improvement over conditions in 1961 and 1962.  It is easy to say that these figures are unrepresentative or that the figure of 6.1 per cent last year was due to the fact we had a very hard winter.  But, if so, it is only fair to ask the Minister in his assumption of 3½ per cent in the White Paper that from now until 1970 we are not going to have any more hard winters?</P>
    <P>The figure of threequarters per cent, which is taken for the increase in employment, corresponds, if we take the Minister's figure of growth rate, to a 3.4 per cent increase in productivity. This is a reasonable figure to take.  It is reasonable, not in the sense that we can say we are bound to attain it, but rather in the sense that it is a figure we must reach if we are to remain competitive in the export market.</P>
    <P>I find difficulty in following the figures in regard to emigration.  The White Paper says that by 1970 emigration should not exceed 10,000.  On the other hand, if you look at Professor Louden Ryan's paper read to the Statistical Society last month, you find in table I, with the pencentage growth <Col N="707" /> very close to the one given in the White Paper, average emigration during the ten years 1960 to 1970 at 16,300.  Of course, there is the difficulty that the figures of total employment used by Professor Louden Ryan do not correspond with those given in the White Paper and we are back again to the old problem of unreliable employment figures.  Nevertheless, we can take the figures given in the White Paper and pro-rate the figures given in Professor Louden Ryan's paper&mdash;this may not be correct procedure because there may be hidden assumptions.  The number of new jobs is 78,000 and checks with the White Paper.  This seems to indicate that I am not completely astray&mdash;the net figure of emigration, however, between 1960 and 1970 is 158,000 on my calculations.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister specifically how he arrives at this figure of 10,000 by 1970.  Is it bound up with the assumption that there is bound to be continued building up of total employment?  Is it bound up with the assumption that if you get 3½ per cent of unemployment, the rate of emigration will fall to 10,000?  I should like to ask the Minister specifically what is the estimate of total emigration in the White Paper for the decade 1960 to 1970.  I should also like to ask him if he would give the derivation in the same manner as it is given in Table No. I of Professor Louden Ryan's paper.  It is clear that, if the Government's optimistic figures for total unemployment are not maintained, emigration will be higher, and one of the objectives of the programme will not be attained.</P>
    <P>If we move from the overall picture to the division, as it were, of the objectives between the different sectors, we find this division given in Table 1 on page 20 of the White Paper.  Here we are given the sectoral products in 1960 and the percentage increase between 1960 and 1970 and the sectoral products at 1960 prices.  Here again we can tell very little from the White Paper because there is no technical appendix.  If we turn to Professor Louden Ryan's paper, particularly <Col N="708" /> pages 6 to 11, we find a series of assumptions which lead to a breakdown of the sectors, starting off with the assumption of the gross national product growing by 50 per cent in ten years.  It is assumed that indirect taxation minus subsidies will also rise by 50 per cent.  This is subject to policy decisions but may be taken to be a reasonable assumption.  Then we come to the key assumption in regard to the division which the whole country has to make between the sectors.</P>
    <P>The next assumption made is that the increase in agriculture will be at the rate of 2.7 per cent per annum and we are not given any details by Professor Louden Ryan except that it is based on the estimates by the Department of Agriculture.  Further assumptions then follow but I do not think there is any need to go into detail except the assumption as to what industry is expected to do.  An estimate was made that industry was expected to do something between six per cent and eight per cent.  When this was studied initially the answer came out at six per cent but it was the wrong answer, and it was decided that there was a built-in factor of pessimism. In Professor Louden Ryan's paper he quotes from Tinbergen a well-known econometrician in support of this point.  When the exercise was repeated, a rise of seven per cent was obtained which allowed the equations to be balanced</P>
    <P>The next step made in drawing up this programme was an estimation of the employment productivity in the different sectors.  This is given in Table 2 on page 21 of the Government's White Paper.  Here again there is a series of assumptions.  The first one is that the rise in productivity would be least in the other domestic sector, that is, the sector including transport, public administration and other services.  That is a reasonable assumption.  The second one is that, since it is policy aim to level earnings in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, productivity increases should be greater in agriculture than in industry.  It is not a question of whether productivity increases in the agricultural sector can be <Col N="709" /> greater than in other sectors but the assumption is made that it is greater.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to deal with all the assumptions but I should like to pinpoint the assumptions in regard to agriculture: that agricultural production will increase by 2.7 per cent per annum, that agricultural productivity will increase by 4.6 per cent per annum, and that agricultural employment will decline by 1.8 per cent per annum.  I quote now from paragraph 29 of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion:</i></P>
    <P>The target figure is also based on the assumption that, in the second half of the 1960s, international market arrangements for our agricultural products (which at present, due to reasons outside the control of the Government, are unsatisfactory) will be considerably improved, as a result, <i>inter alia</i>, of our being admitted to membership of the EEC. At present, a major factor impeding agricultural growth is the depressed and disorganised State of international markets, and the solution of this problem must be found if our agricultural potential is to be fully realised.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are all conscious of the fact that the position in regard to our export markets is critical for agricultural production.  On the other hand, it is too naive to assume that if our marketing problems were solved everything would be all right, or to assume that membership of the EEC would make all that difference in regard to our marketing prospects in agriculture.</P>
    <P>What is really at stake here is&mdash; how good this assumption is.  It is quite clear, and the Taoiseach repeated it only this week, that there is no question of our going into the EEC without Britain.  Therefore, the assumption that we go in well before 1970 is an assumption that Britain goes in well before 1970.  Here, maybe the Government have information not available to the members of the House but this is the first assumption which is made.</P>
    <P>The second assumption is that if we go into the EEC then we are no longer in any trouble in regard to agricultural <Col N="710" /> markets.  I should like to quote from the report of the Central Bank of Ireland for 1962-63.  I quote from page 12:</P>
    <P>Referring to a paper on agricultural policies which was before the conference, Dr. Mansholt&mdash;</P>
    <P>who is vice-President of the Commission of the EEC&mdash;</P>
    <P>accepted the views that, for the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the prospects in the nineteen-sixties were for a rate of increase in gross national product slower than in the nineteen-fifties and that the demand for food products would not grow proportionally. If present policies were left unchanged, there was a risk that there would shortly be non-disposable surpluses of certain commodities. If the disequilibrium between production and consumption should worsen further, the terms of trade for agricultural products would deteriorate and, in fact, agricultural prices had already, since 1954, been in constant decline in relation to prices in the industrial sector.  Dr. Mansholt emphasised the seriousness of the situation for countries which need to export agricultural products and to import industrial goods. While recognising that farm incomes are still relatively low in Western Europe, he strongly advised against a policy of increasing agricultural incomes by raising the prices of agricultural products.  Although in the case of meat, especially beef, he anticipated that the import requirement of the European Economic Community in 1970 would be at least at the same level as at present, he considered that in this sector also a &ldquo;prudent price policy&rdquo; seemed essential.  The situation concerning dairy produce he described &ldquo;as very serious indeed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We can take this view of Dr. Mansholt and we can take also the forecasts made by FAO for &ldquo;Agricultural commodities projections for 1970&rdquo;&mdash;these projections being for the production and consumption of various agricultural commodities in <Col N="711" /> different areas for 1970, the year the White Paper is concerned with.  The position as stated by FAO in regard to dairy products is that the countries of the EEC which had a surplus in 1960 will have a surplus of more than three times as great in 1970. Even in regard to meat, on which we seem to feel ourselves fairly secure, in the countries of the EEC the projections are that in 1970, relative to the figure for 1960, the amount of meat which would be imported into the EEC could vary anywhere from 14 per cent of the 1960 figure to 152 per cent. The indications, indeed, from the rates of growth in the last few years in these countries are that we would be getting away from the upper part of that range.  On the other hand, if we look towards the question of Britain, we find that for 1970 the projection is that British meat imports will lie between 109 per cent and 114 per cent of what they were in 1960.  If we look at these two figures and remember that the British import figure in 1960 was six times that of EEC, we come back to a conclusion which some people reached a very long time ago that in regard to seeking agricultural markets, the British market is really the only hope for the Irish farmer.  It was very gratifying, indeed, to have a statement to this effect from the Taoiseach on Monday of this week.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the discussion by going into aspects in regard to other sectors but I want to make some comment about the financial aspect of the Second Programme.  In this regard, I cannot help feeling that there is a distinct change of tone between the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and the White Paper which was laid before this House last August.  Remember that it is stated in the White Paper which was laid before us last August that the basic principles underlying the First Programme will continue to be respected. On page 9 of the First Programme we find the following statement:</P>
    <P>As well as encouraging increased production, the Government will strive to reduce the effective burden <Col N="712" /> of taxation by moderating the growth in net debt service charges, by achieving the maximum efficiency in administration, by relating further improvements in the social services to increases in real national income and by reducing subsidies to the minimum necessary to secure a permanent increase in economical production.</P>
    <P>However, when we come to the Second Programme we can read there, on page 63, the following statement:</P>
    <P>It is not expected that the increase in taxation, which will occur in the context of rising individual and social standards, will be considerable (the present 23 per cent ratio of total taxation to GNP may have to rise by one or two percentage points), or that, given a mature sense of social interdependence, there will be any adverse effect on initiative and output.</P>
    <P>I detect a change of tone between these two White Papers.</P>
    <P>If we look further into some of the figures given, there does seem to be a difference of approach.  I think the statement that there ought to be a one or two percentage rise in taxation relative to GNP is not something that can lightly be dismissed.  In this respect, there is just one comment that I should like to make.  It is to the effect that all the percentages which are given here for taxation are percentages of GNP. It is rather handy for the Government that the basis of relating taxation has changed from what used to be the custom, that is, taking the percentage of national income.  For many years, the figures given were those of total taxation as a percentage of national income.  We all remember the criterion given that passing 25 per cent of national income was passing a danger level in regard to taxation.  However, taxation did exceed 25 per cent but this is now handily side-stepped by the fact that total taxation is now related to GNP.  It is just as well to remember that talking of 23 per cent to 25 per cent of GNP is equivalent to talking about 28 per cent to 30 per cent of national income.  I think this rate, no matter how you express it, is a relatively <Col N="713" /> high rate considering our level of income in this country and our low defence commitments.  Unless this taxation discriminates, and discriminates pretty heavily, in favour of innovation and rationalisation, such a level of taxation could inhibit growth.</P>
    <P>I want now to take up the question of transfer payments and subsidies. Again, it is very difficult to work this out in view of the scanty data available. My arithmetic, too, may be at fault; if so, I should be glad if the Minister would give the correct figures.  If we take it that, in 1970, total taxation will be 24 per cent&mdash;we will not push it up to the 25 per cent level&mdash;of GNP, the total tax income then in 1970 will be £240 million.  Trading and investment income of public authorities was about £15 million in 1960.  If we take that as increasing something the same as GNP, we can take a figure of £23 million in 1970.  This would give us a total income for public institutions of £263 million.</P>
    <P>We are told in the White Paper, in Table 3, that current expenditure of public institutions would be £121 million. That leaves us, if we neglect saving for the moment, that transfer payments and subsidies would amount to £142 million.  This figure of £142 million represents a 67 per cent increase over 1960.  On the other hand, we remember the clear statement in the first White Paper that transfer payments and subsidies should be controlled, that transfer payments would rise with GNP and that subsidies would be reduced.  Lest anyone should think this is an indication of a move to the left, let me point out that transfer payments include interest on the national debt as well as old age pensions. The White Papers definitely, the first in particular, would lead us to expect at the very most a 50 per cent increase in this figure and a 50 per cent increase would give us only £127 million as against £142 million.  This leaves us with about £14 million unaccounted for.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister specifically how will this £14 million enter into the account of 1970?  Is it represented by Government saving, in <Col N="714" /> which case it would appear that the Minister is endeavouring to produce a surplus in his Budget rather than reduce taxation?  Or is this to be used to reduce taxation, in which case there should be no necessity to go up to the figure of 24 per cent of GNP?  Or is this sum going to be used to increase transfer payments by 70 per cent where we would have expected them to rise only with GNP?  Or is it going to be used to increase subsidies by 120 per cent over their 1960 figure, whereas we have been encouraged to think they might be reduced?  Or is it a factor of safety which is being built in?  Or is it a mistake in my arithmetic?</P>
    <P>The next point I should like to take up in regard to this White Paper is the effect on the banking system of the proposals which are given here.  Now for the past ten years, the ratio of money supplied to the GNP has varied between about 30.7 per cent and 32.8 per cent.  Over the past five years the variation was slightly narrower, from 30.7 per cent to 31.4 per cent.  We would expect, therefore, under the conditions of 1970 that the total money supply would be something of the order of £300 million.</P>
    <P>This money supply consists, of course, of current accounts and currency. If we look at the Report of the Central Bank we will see that currency is being gradually replaced by current accounts.  At the moment currency is about 38 per cent of the total, and it is decreasing.  If we assume it as equal to, say, one-third in 1970&mdash;that is not an unreasonable assumption&mdash;then, in 1970, we will have £100 million in currency and £200 million in current accounts compared with £84 million in currency and £139 million in current accounts in 1960.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deposit accounts, in 1960 these amounted to £210 million. These are not strictly connected with GNP but we would naturally expect them to rise with GNP and, in 1970, they would certainly be above £250 million but, to be absolutely conservative, I take the figure as merely £250 million.  Under these circumstances, in 1970 the banks would require £16 million extra in currency in order to operate the economy, £61 <Col N="715" /> million extra in current accounts and, at the very least, £40 million extra in deposit accounts.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to what way the banks are expected to handle this particular problem.  To get the currency the banks would have to part with the same amount of external assets to the Central Bank.  Or is this procedure to be relaxed?  In the present circumstances, I understand they would.  This matter is, of course, important because it raises the question of the net external assets of our commercial banks.  In the White Paper, known as the Grey Book, <i>Economic Development</i>, the author mentions, in regard to the commercial banks, that &ldquo;their first obligation is to remain solvent&rdquo;.  He goes on to state that expert opinion has agreed that there is a minimum safe level of external reservations to the total of current and deposit accounts and that this minimum safe level is 30 per cent and should not be allowed to wander more than three per cent away from this figure of 30 per cent.  At this rate, the banks would need at the very least an extra £30 million of external assets in order to keep up this 30 per cent ratio.</P>
    <P>We must remember, too, that the programme calls for an external deficit which, in ten years, would total £160 million.  Unless that deficit is to be financed through an international organisation and not through our commercial banks, this would be a further burden on our banking system.  There is also, of course, the ordinary operation of the financing of Irish purchases of foreign securities.  During the past seven or eight years this has averaged about £16 million a year.  Assuming that all this had to be handled through the commercial banks, there would be a sum involved of £366 million and, to finance this, would require a capital inflow to this country over the decade of something of the order of £37 million per year.  If we look at what has been happening in recent years in regard to capital inflow, we find very severe fluctuations, but with an average of about £24 million coming in, and I do not see any real sign of an <Col N="716" /> upward trend.  If these figures are correct, then the position is that over the next ten years, there will be a gap here of something of the order of £120 million.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister now what does the programme envisage in regard to this particular situation.  Is the assumption made, as indicated by a footnote on page 20 of the White Paper, that our external deficit will be completely covered by arrangement with one of the international organisations? Have the Government already been assured that this £16 million a year deficit can be covered, that we can get investment in this country from an international monetary organisation to cover this?  If this is not certain, how do they envisage this deficit may be handled?  Is it to be handled through the ordinary banking system?  To do so, it seems to me there would have to be a 50 per cent increase in capital inflow or else an abandonment of the 30 per cent ratio.</P>
    <P>It may well be it would be a proper thing to abandon this 30 per cent ratio of net external reserves to accounts but if so, this should be stated in the programme.  We should be told these things and the arguments should be put before us.  I should like to ask the Minister specifically what capital inflow the programme envisages.  I wish also to ask him whether the 30 per cent is to be maintained or abandoned.  Does the programme assume that the external deficit is to be financed outside our own banking system?</P>
    <P>The question of the balance of payments is not something on which we should be doctrinaire.  The question of the balance of payments deficit at any time is not one for taking up a rigid attitude.  The argument should rather devolve on whether the money coming back to this country is being put into worthwhile investment or not.  On the other hand, it is dangerous to start a programme of this type and to plan for a continual deficit of £16 million a year.  OECD are quoted to the effect that everything is all right as long as &ldquo;the underlying trend is clearly in the right direction.&rdquo;  Is the running of a deficit of £16 million a year for seven <Col N="717" /> consecutive years an underlying trend in the right direction?  It would seem to me much wiser to interpret what the OECD Report says here as referring to short-run deficits.  Surely to plan for £16 million deficits running over seven years is something quite different.  Has there been any consultation with OECD or other international bodies in regard to this point?</P>
    <P>I believe the removal of the psychological benefit the balance point has in regard to the external account is a dangerous thing.  It may lead to even less emphasis than there is already on real economic criteria in investment decisions.  The Government may be using proper investment criteria in regard to large-scale economic investment but they are not telling the Dáil or the Seanad what these criteria are and we can only remain in doubt about this point and remain anxious that it will be thought that if it is all right to plan for £16 million deficits, then it is all right to plan for £26 million deficits.</P>
    <P>It can be said that our record of investment is relatively poor.  It is very difficult to judge this because indicators such as capital output ratio are very crude indicators indeed but in the absence of anything else, we can point to the fact that we have had for a long number of years a capital output ratio of something of the order of five. That is an indication there is something wrong with our investment procedure. Whether the fault lies mainly in the public or the private sector, the indications are that on the basis of international comparison, we do not seem to be investigating in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to bring up the question of control.  We have here what is described as a <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> but it seems to me rather a prediction based on certain assumptions and that before it could be dignified with the name &ldquo;Programme&rdquo; it would have to indicate in some way the measures which are to be taken if it shows signs of missing any of the targets which are mentioned.  It may be that this has been done in the drawing up of the programme and it may be the Minister <Col N="718" /> feels he should not reveal what these studies have shown.  It would allay my anxiety to some extent if the Minister were to state categorically that there has been an examination of the steps that would be taken and taken rapidly if these targets are not being reached. We know the perennial troubles which arise in this country.  We know what will happen if our prices get out of control here at home, that we shall suffer in regard to our exports.  This is something which can be seen and fairly well evaluated by means of the trade statistics which are available monthly and within a month.  I should like to ask the Minister what are the sort of steps which would be taken. The failure to describe the procedure whereby this machine is to be controlled makes me rather doubtful of its ability to ride even a minor storm. Even elementary programming should include an analysis of possible deviations from the intended path and an examination of possible corrective measures.</P>
    <P>In any of the various achievements that have been made in the control of man's environment, there have been certain stages in control of environment. First of all, we try to observe it. When we have learned to observe it, we try to analyse it and the next thing logically is to try to predict what will happen.  Of course, we become masters of our environment only when we are able to control it and complete masters when this control is something which happens automatically.  It should not be something which happens when things come to a sudden crisis and then a very big lever has to be pulled.  Unless this programme is examined from this point of view, the Minister may find himself in the position of having, at some time or other, to pull a very big lever in order to divert the economy from this particular path.</P>
    <P>Having spoken about some of the insufficiencies of this programme, I should like to bring forward what might be alternatives to the propositions laid down in it.  Naturally it is possible to do this only in a general way.  Programming or planning is accepted in principle by virtually everybody and if one is logical, one's <Col N="719" /> attitude to planning is influenced by one's political philosophy.  The great argument in regard to planning going on throughout Europe today is in regard to different types of planning. There is, at one extreme, the planning of the doctrinaire socialist who likes the completely centralised type of planning which reaches its peak in the collectivist community.</P>
    <P>We also have, of course, another type of planning which is also centralist and which for lack of a better word can only be called the bureaucratic approach which is also centralist in the sense that all the main decisions are located in either one or another small decision-making authority very close to the centre of power.  On the other hand there is the idea of liberal planning which is decentralist in nature and which is the type of planning which is being adopted by the countries of the European Community and indeed the type of planning which each of them has used in their own way with a great measure of success.</P>
    <P>Now I want to be quite clear about what I mean by decentralist in this respect.  It has nothing to do with decentralisation or the deconcentration of men or buildings.  It is actually a question of the deconcentration of power and the deconcentration of decision making.  Thus the fact that the Minister for Justice had sent the Gardaí to be trained in Templemore has nothing to do with decentrism. This is the deconcentration of certain buildings.  On the other hand, it is a very good example of centrism that the Minister for Justice has come again and again to this House and sought to remove power from judges in court to the office of the Minister for Justice.  This is centrism in action. This is something which I find myself unable to agree with because of my fundamental political views.  For that reason, I would much prefer to see in this country an approach to planning that was more obviously decentralised than what we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>The essence of this liberal planning is to make the market economy work as smoothly as possible, to remove <Col N="720" /> distortions from it, to remove frictions from it, to give a free choice in real terms to the individual consumer, to combine the maximum possible degree of economy and the widest possible participation in decision-making, to get all these together in a consistent system.  This planning, as I said earlier, has been adopted by the Christian Democrat Parties of Western Europe and they have applied it to the local circumstances in their own countries. This work is sometimes, though very wrongly, confused with a return to <i>laissez faire</i>, which it definitely is not and the market economy is sometimes confused with the crude, uncontrolled inter-action of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>The true nature of the market economy is brought out by the following quotation from Mr. Pierre Massé, Director General of the French Plan, in a paper on &ldquo;Productive Investment&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Should an economy, whose object is to promote the general interest, bother about adopting an overall strategy as such, or should it allow it to arise spontaneously from all the individual strategies worked out at decision-making centres?</P>
    <P>This question is put not to fan the embers of academic controversy, but for two very precise reasons.</P>
    <P>One of these illustrates a trend in modern economic thinking which does not seek to determine in the abstract whether the individual and overall approaches coincide but endeavours through research to define the conditions under which this can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that this fundamental research throws light on some of the mechanisms devised to meet practical requirements.  The effect is more significant because it is not the result of conscious planning.</P>
    <P>Massé goes on to discuss how this works.  He says:</P>
    <P>Thus, the centralised approach by way of quantities and the decentralised approach by way of prices are complementary, a fact which should put an end to the controversies to which I have referred.  The snag is <Col N="721" /> that this is only true in a certain number of hypotheses.  Some of these are almost self-evident.  For example, monopolistic practices and the exploitation of dominant market positions must be excluded.  Costing must be invariably truthful, and in particular there must be a proper apportionment of welfare charges. The speed of growth must not be pushed to the point at which control by prices would be swamped in ever-recurring new disequilibria.</P>
    <P>Now, markets freed according to the market economy approach of the Continentals can move very quickly from one equilibrium point to another because of the influence of natural prices.  Of course, we must in these cases avoid the mistake of taking any action which would remove one set of rigidities from our economy only to find we have replaced them by another. It is quite true to say that the market cannot be left alone; this was the mistake of the 19th century.  There are in the market certain tendencies towards disequilibrium and these are largely concerned with the concentrations of power.  It is quite obvious that all of this movement of the market must be controlled by our social and political objectives.  It is the solution to this particular problem that has given a meaning, and given a whole coherence of purpose, to the work in recent years of the members of EEC, something which has brought them closer together in their thinking and something on which their true unity of purpose depends.</P>
    <P>Once they have this unity of thinking on economics, you can see it going on fitfully towards a unity of purpose in regard to other problems.  This system is something which not only safeguards the freedom of the individual consumer but has been shown under diverse conditions to improve real productivity. Once prices are real prices, productive efficiency will be more readily increased. Productive efficiency has two elements; there is a price efficiency and a technical efficiency.  You can do all the work study you want and you can have all the management consultants in the world and increase the efficiency of your actual system, but unless your <Col N="722" /> actual allocations of inputs are according to a correct price system, you will not play the part you might play in the productive firm or industry or factory or in the whole economy.  It is by natural prices that the economy is best served.</P>
    <P>I think this is vitally important for this country because first many of our prices are controlled from outside. Many of our prices, indeed, are controlled by the fact that we are linked to the British economy.  It is, therefore, all the more important that we have the real price system which will enable us to prove our efforts in the right direction.  It is for this reason that I believe it is absolutely essential, if the Second Programme is to work at all, that the distortions of our position regarding such matters as the Control of Manufactures Act must be removed.  Of course, the main problem likely to confront our economy between now and 1970 is instability and, from what has happened over the past two years, the Government apparently have no real policy for dealing with instability other than a stop-go one.  If they have, they certainly have not announced it.  I have already commented that the White Paper is extremely vague as to what would constitute a deviation from a target so significant as to call for action.</P>
    <P>According to the principles of liberal planning, there is no control by means of a large lever and a sudden movement. Control is built into the actual situation and the ideal situation is one in which most of these controls are automatic.  In order to achieve this it is necessary that the economy becomes an information system, a system in which each element both gives and receives information.  For the proper working of a programme such as the one which the Government have outlined it is necessary that we do have information not merely travelling towards a centre but diffused throughout the economy.  Unless information is to travel rapidly throughout our economy, then I think it would be very difficult for the individual parts of the economy to play their proper part in the carrying out of this particular programme.</P>
    <P>The adaptation councils set up by <Col N="723" /> CIO represent a very rudimentary form of what Continental firms have been doing in this regard to information exchange for very many years past.  An OECD Report of 1957 on &ldquo;Inter-firm comparison; an incentive to productivity&rdquo; is most enlightening on the amount of information exchanged between firms and the consequent benefit to everyone within the group.  Indeed, the most striking fact is that when all of the information is exchanged the benefit is found usually in an unexpected quarter, so that an individual query would not produce anything like the same result.</P>
    <P>Since trade figures are available monthly and trends can be quickly spotted and analysed, there is no reason why this information should not be diffused and why, indeed, a great deal of decision-making could not be decentralised and left to individual sectors, individual industries and individual firms.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank of Ireland has shown that advance estimates of national income and its components can be precise enough to act as indicators for policy reviews and some of these estimates of the Central Bank could be produced, I think, almost weekly.</P>
    <P>In fixing targets and in aiming at them, the proper approach calls for a good deal of discussion, both discussion vertically within sectors and industries and discussion horizontally between firms and groups of industry and this discussion, I think, should not merely be the passing on of decisions but a real involvement such as the involvement which has made the French plan work so well.</P>
    <P>If this idea of diffusing throughout the economy information and, indeed, the decision-making, were adopted and if in this way an involvement can be produced, it would be possible to generate enough motivation in order that there would come from within the sector and from within every one of the sectors enough energy to make the whole system move ahead.  Unless we have that, it may be very difficult to keep up momentum under the conditions which we face.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I would say, in summary, that I think we need a positive approach that has something to offer beyond mere pragmatism.  We need, in fact, to design our economic system in accordance with our principles and not be content with just using arithmetic and algebra to predict the performance of our present patchwork economy.  I think we must see in the alternative approaches to planning a reflection of the stand we must take in regard to the problems which split the world, split Europe, and split us all off into peoples with different fundamental beliefs about the extent to which the individual should be left in freedom as an individual.</P>
    <P>I think we have an opportunity in this country to combine efficiency and a high degree of personal freedom.  Not only do I think that, but I think that if we adopt a system of planning based on a high degree of personal freedom and based on a diffusion of decision-making to individuals and to smaller units, this will be a guarantee of the efficiency of our economy and the best guarantee that we could have of the competitiveness of our exports in world markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to cover anything like as wide a field as the previous speaker has done.  In fact, in previous years the Cathaoirleach has been rather restrictive as to what may be discussed in the debate on the Central Fund Bill.  I intend to keep the discussion to as narrow as possible a field, to avoid being told that I am perhaps out of order or irrelevant.  I shall confine my remarks to the Estimates before us for the coming year.  I have listened with the greatest possible interest, as we all have, to Senator Dooge's criticism of the Second Programme but I do not intend to deal with it at all myself because I think there is enough to be said about the present Central Fund Bill to which the Estimates apply without going into later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actually, I have had the experience in this House that the scope of the debate on the Central Fund Bill can be made rather narrow.  In the first place, we cannot discuss taxation.  We have to wait until much later in the <Col N="725" /> year, until after the Budget, to discuss how money is to be raised for the public services.  I also understand that we cannot discuss particular Estimates, that we can only discuss the Book of Estimates as a whole; that we cannot go into the programme of particular services.  Furthermore, we cannot intelligently discuss the capital expenditure for the next 12 months because all we know about the capital expenditure is that part which is called the voted capital expenditure which appears in the Book of Estimates.  We have no indication of the so-called below-the-line capital expenditure until the Budget is introduced.</P>
    <P>In order to clarify this issue, it would be desirable if all the capital expenditure of the Government above and below the line, the voted capital expenditure and the other capital expenditure, could be presented in bulk at the same time because we now have in this Book of Estimates a certain amount of capital expenditure, voted expenditure and then, when the Budget comes, we will have a large amount of other capital expenditure and the division between them is really very artificial and tends to obscure clarity perhaps in some of these debates.</P>
    <P>So, therefore, all that I really intend to try to address myself to on this occasion is whether the Estimates presented to us are justified in the circumstances of the country or if they are excessive.  The analogy is really with a human being.  I am going to try to discuss, from the national point of view, a man: Is he living within his resources?  Is he spending too much for his income?  In order to answer these questions we will have to look, first of all, at how much he is going to spend, secondly, what his income is and, finally, we have to know what he is going to spend it on.  Unless one answers these questions one cannot really say whether the expenditure presented in the Book of Estimates is within the means of the country or not. We must take the economic background against which this public financial programme is presented.  I trust I am not delaying the Seanad but I think that does involve a rather rapid glance at some of the actual features of the <Col N="726" /> year that is just finishing and I think something in the nature of a rough forecast of the trends we discover that will persist into the coming financial year, the year under discussion.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge has said, the major event of last year has been the breakdown in the Common Market negotiations with the United Kingdom. That has fundamentally altered our attitude but it is generally assumed&mdash; and assumed in the Second Programme &mdash;that by 1970 we shall be in the Common Market.  It is obvious now that even if that does not take place, we shall have to make the utmost of our trade arrangements with the United Kingdom and that we shall be thrown more and more together.  From what we read in the newspapers it appears that the Government at present are trying to consolidate our position in the United Kingdom which is obviously very necessary.  But the breakdown of Common Market negotiations does not mean we are remaining in a period of high protection because the Government have been gradually reducing tariffs, with the result that the country is becoming more and more a free trade country and, therefore, whether we enter the Common Market or not, we must have regard to the efficiency of our production, both in order to maintain exports and maintain the home market.  If we allow our production to become inefficient and too costly, not only shall we not be able to export but we may find that people in other countries are able to get into our home market and we may find ourselves in considerable difficulties in regard to the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I think it could be argued that the delay&mdash;if that is what it is&mdash;or postponement of our entry into the Common Market may be a blessing in disguise.  It gives us a little more time to adapt ourselves to new conditions and the work the Government have done in setting up adaptation councils and so on will bear fruit.  Possibly if we had found ourselves in the Common Market very soon, we might not have been in a position really to meet the difficult situation that would arise there.  Therefore, this delay, if properly <Col N="727" /> utilised, may be a blessing.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go in unnecessary detail into the events of last year but we cannot really intelligently forecast the coming year unless we examine trends which appear in the previous year.  On this matter I am using as my principal authority the Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank for January which gives the most up-to-date figures on the subject and also expresses some valuable opinions on the present economic situation.  According to the Central Bank, 1963 was a satisfactory year for the country.  On the agricultural side, exports were high, higher than in the previous year. Agricultural output, although not much higher than the previous year, certainly was not lower and at the end of the year, agricultural stocks were exceptionally high.  I do not wish to mention agriculture any further because it is being investigated now and a great deal of attention will be given to agricultural organisation.  The Knapp report on Agricultural Cooperation has opened up a new field of inquiry and the new agreement which appears to be coming with the United Kingdom will also give us opportunities of making agricultural adjustments. I have no doubt that in future our agricultural production and exports will increase and be a source of strength to the country.</P>
    <P>There is no getting away from the fact that if one confines oneself, as I am doing, to a very short period, increases in agricultural production will take a long time to come about and an agricultural programme is, in very essence, slow and therefore, taking the immediate future&mdash;which is what concerns us in this debate on the Book of Estimates&mdash;we must rely more on industrial exports to expand in the very near future than on agricultural exports. Here, again, the Central Bank expresses a favourable view.  Industrial production was up last year seven per cent on the previous year and exports have also increased.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to pay some tribute to the excellent work done by the Export Board not only in increasing exports <Col N="728" /> to our older markets but in penetrating into other markets all over the globe.  One export industry which has done particularly well is the tourist industry and again, just as we should say something about the Export Board, we should also pay tribute to Bord Fáilte.  They have done their work very well, with the result that we are now one of the leading tourist countries in the sense that the income per head from tourism is one of the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must remember that this is a two-way traffic and just as more people visit Ireland every year, more Irish people go abroad. Therefore, in order that the net income from the tourist industry should increase, the volume of the industry must go on continuously increasing; it cannot remain stable because it is a two-way movement and if there are tourists coming to Ireland, there are Irish tourists going abroad and this reduces the net amount to be received from this source of income.</P>
    <P>The employment situation, so far as one can understand, seems to be good.  The number employed in industry has gone up by 6,000 and some of the new industries are actually finding a shortage of skilled labour. That position gives me the opportunity to mention the valuable attention at present being paid to education at every level.  Several important commissions are sitting at the moment on education, technical, vocational, university and so on, and in the long term, this is the best investment any country can make, building up the brains of the citizens.  That is the best investment, provided we can find employment for them.  To build up a large skilled population, a large number of university graduates, a large number of highly-skilled technical people and have to export them leads to what is known as a &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo; which gives rise to many troubles in other countries.  There is no sign at present that anything of that kind is happening here.  Our population is increasing for the first time in a very long time and there is certainly no remarkable increase in unemployment. So far as one can judge, the amount <Col N="729" /> is greatly less than it has been in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is only one aspect of the labour situation which is disquieting and calls for certain attention, that is, rising rates of wages.  The eighth round was completed last year and largely, I think as a result of the turnover tax&mdash; or to some extent&mdash;the pressure of the trade unions for an increase in wages has been acute and the ninth round has now practically been accomplished with the result that wages have risen here at a higher rate than in most of our neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be more important&mdash; everyone will agree&mdash;than a rational incomes policy.  That depends on having some sort of an understanding between the two sides in industry and the public authorities regarding what is called in England the guiding light to what changes in incomes should be.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Employer-Labour Conference in 1962 was a distinct step in the right direction. As a result of the long discussions, this conference has made very valuable recommendations which is the basis of the present wages position. The situation is that generally there should be a 12 per cent increase in wages, to be stabilised for two and a half years&mdash;that there should be an approximate rate of wage increase of five per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty is, of course, that you cannot apply the recommendations indiscriminately to every worker in the country.  The recommendations themselves provide that the Labour Court will consider disputes.  It seems to me that the Labour Court have a very important part to play in the successful working out of these recommendations. If the Labour Court want to try to honour the spirit as well as the letter, the wages position may not get out of hand.</P>
    <P>The hopeful aspect is that there does seem to be something like a standstill for two and a half years, that at least we can look forward to a period during which there will not be any further demand for increases in incomes but, unfortunately, as we all know from experience, these hopes are frequently frustrated.  We must, however, hope <Col N="730" /> that both sides will honour the agreement in that way.</P>
    <P>It is very satisfactory to be able to report that the National Industrial and Economic Council, on which employers and trade unions, as well as the Government, are represented have submitted that on the whole Irish industry can stand this rise in wages&mdash;that on the whole Irish industry can pay the 12 per cent.  Nevertheless, we must face the situation that the weaker industries may go to the wall, that weaker industries may not be able to face this large increase in their costs.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a matter of which I have spoken frequently before and which is always central to all discussion on the future of the country.  That is the danger of a cost inflation&mdash;the danger of the cost of production being raised to a level where we would not be competitive in outside markets.  It is not irrelevant to remember that at the present moment wages are rising in every country in Europe, that in some Common Market countries wages are rising quite rapidly and that in the United Kingdom and in Ireland they are rising less rapidly than in some of the Common Market countries.</P>
    <P>This question of cost inflation is really a relative thing provided our costs do not rise more rapidly than in the countries outside, with whom we are competing.  If they do, we shall find ourselves in great difficulty.  I must now repeat what I said on previous occasions, that this new increase in purchasing power may bring about a second type of inflation, a demand inflation&mdash;that the amount of money in the pockets of our people can be larger than the amount of goods, bringing about a demand inflation as well.  This will be reflected in larger imports, larger consumption and the balance of payments may be affected.  This demand inflation may be the effect of increasing imports for consumption.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge has rightly said, and as is indisputable, the balance of payments position is one of the central factors to which we must have regard. Any developments of an inflationary kind, either cost or demand, could have very serious results.  If any signs of that kind become apparent, the <Col N="731" /> brakes, if brakes appear to be necessary, should be applied early.  The brakes should be applied before the situation gets out of hand.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments last year was not really very much disimproved from the year before.  The visible balance was about £10 million worse. The deficit was about £10 million greater, but the invisible account was very satisfactory and generally it is thought that the maximum deficit that could have occurred last year was in the order of £20 million.  That seems a great deal of money but it has, of course, to be related to inward and outward movement of capital.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge stated, the question of external reserves is all important. As long as it can be said that external reserves are moving into the country in sufficient quantities, one can stand a deficit for a considerable time.  Here, everything points to an inward movement of capital in the last year.  The figures in the banks and in Departmental accounts show an increase of £3 million, and that is only a small amount of the total of the large amount of capital moving into the country.  Therefore, the deficit is probably covered by the inward movement of capital and, though it may seem very large, I do not think it is large enough to give us any cause for undue worry at the moment.</P>
    <P>This inward movement of capital is of a very complicated kind.  There is a certain amount of it coming in from the United Kingdom, from people who are afraid of the political situation there&mdash;of a Government coming into power which would be hostile to investors. Also, a good deal is coming from the United States of America and from Germany&mdash;genuine investment in this country.  Some of it is used for the purchase of land for the extension of existing businesses, for the foundation of new businesses, for the purpose of buying Irish Stock Exchange holdings and for deposit in banks.  In fact, the amount of funds seeking investment here has been unprecedented.</P>
    <P>All this inward movement of capital is what is making it possible for us to live with this deficit in the balance of <Col N="732" /> payments.  This inward movement might in itself give rise to certain dangers if people who sold securities in this country to foreigners began to purchase many importable goods.  This would lead to a new type of demand inflation, bringing about an increase in imports. Another danger would be a reverse movement&mdash;so called hot money.  If some of these reserves were not actually sunk in concrete investments here, if they were removed from the country, then, of course, a deficit might be intolerable and would call for correction.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1963&mdash;Recommittal and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 26 and 27 to insert a new subparagraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) murder done by the administration of poison or other noxious substance or thing,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My views on these matters have been already fully explained on Second Reading.  The first amendment in the names of Senator L'Estrange and myself deals with a matter about which I feel very keenly.  Indeed, the Minister himself, speaking on the Protection of Animals Bill, referred to strychnine being classed as the &ldquo;Irish <Col N="733" /> poison&rdquo;.  In my amendment I am not confining myself to the administration of strychnine only.  I am talking about the administration of poison or other noxious substance or thing by which a person's death can be brought about.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to everybody that poisoning is the most insidious method of bringing about the death of an enemy or the removal of somebody whose presence on earth is an irritation to the person who contemplates the death.  The administration of poison for the purposes I have mentioned is very easy.  Admittedly, our poison laws are strict; but poison can be bought legitimately for the purpose of laying it on lands or for any other purpose for which the poison laws provide.  That poison can be kept in anybody's house.  Its whereabouts can be known to other people or members of the household, who can remove it from its place of hiding or safety, as the case may be, or it can then fall into other hands.  In such circumstances, the administration of poison is a simple matter.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is also an extremely simple matter to plead a mistake afterwards.  It is extremely difficult to convict the person accused of committing a murder by the administration of poison.  I know of only two cases in comparatively recent times, in one of which there was a conviction and in the other, an acquittal.  I am not attempting in any way to adjudicate on either of those cases.  I am talking about the general situation whereby it is made easy for somebody to cause the death of another secretly and without warning.</P>
    <P>If an intending murderer points a gun at another or threatens to waylay him at night or writes threatening letters to him, or if an argument crops up in which blows are likely to result or guns or knives likely to be drawn, the person about to be attacked has a warning and has some way of defending himself either by fighting back successfully or, by the exercise of discretion, running away and getting out of the danger.  But the poisoner can sit opposite his victim at the same table, talk trivia and calmly wait for the end of the person into whose food the poison has been put.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> That is a situation which demands inclusion in the category of capital murder.  I see no reason why the person destroyed in that way should not have the same protection as a policeman or any of the other classes of persons included in this section.  This is not a matter on which one can say an awful lot.  The very thought of it should be sufficient to make people realise the enormity of an offence committed in this way.  I do not propose to weary the House by going into examples of poisoning or deal with the criminal law concerning it in this or any other country.  It is sufficient that we should realise it is a very serious offence and that, if it is to be murder at all it should be murder of the highest degree, that is, in accordance with the wording of this section, capital murder.</P>
    <P>I am well aware what the Minister's difficulty is in matters of this kind in either accepting amendments or rejecting them.  I know the difficulties that lie in the way of the Parties and groups supporting the Minister in this House. These matters are already discussed in other places before they come here.  If people have not raised these matters at their own Party meetings, it is difficult then for the Minister to relax the view finally fixed when these matters were discussed at Government level and later at Party level.  However, in these circumstances if the Minister were disposed to grant a free vote of the House, I have no doubt that the whole of this House&mdash;certainly a majority of those in favour of capital punishment to the extent the Minister proposes to have it enshrined in this Bill&mdash;would be in favour of including murder by poisoning as capital murder.</P>
    <P>The next amendment deals with murder in the course of an illegal operation to bring about an abortion where death results.  That is also a very serious matter.  In accordance with the law as it now stands, it is murder. I see no reason why the person or persons upon whom these operations might be performed from time to time &mdash;usually, indeed almost invariably, in the interest of others&mdash;should not be protected in the same full manner as a policeman in the course of his duty. <Col N="735" /> All of us are aware of the circumstances in which these operations are carried out.  It is bad enough that a girl or woman should find herself in a situation of that kind, having been influenced to that extent initially by the wrongdoer, but it is worse when, in circumstances of embarrassment, she is further influenced with a view to getting her to agree to submit to such an operation.  Some, I know, are successful; others are not.  A wrongdoer who follows up his initial wrong by using his influence to get a person to submit herself to an operation of this kind should not be in a better position&mdash;in fact, should be in a worse position&mdash;than a person who, in the heat of the moment, shoots a garda or a prison warden, or any of the other classes included in the Bill.  I do not intend to elaborate on that subject, but every member of the House must be aware of the enormity of an offence of this kind.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister with great sincerity to accept these two amendments. If he cannot see his way to accepting them outright, I urge him to allow the House to vote freely upon them.  On the last occasion when replying to my Second Reading speech on the question of poisoning, the Minister talked about mercy killing.  I think I might describe him as having had his tongue in both cheeks on that occasion.  I do not know whether he was referring to the incident on the Continent in relation to the thalidomide baby or something of that kind.  We do not subscribe to those views in this country. In any event the Minister did not deal with my point.  I was not referring to euthanasia or mercy killing, but to the deliberate removal of a human being from this earth because of jealousy or hatred or some other cause.  In all the circumstances, I see no reason whatsoever why these two types of killing should not be included in the categories which will be known in future as capital murders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I clearly indicated my views on capital punishment as a deterrent.  Since that time I have given a great deal of <Col N="736" /> thought to the whole matter, and I must say I find that I have moved much nearer to the Minister's point of view since Committee Stage&mdash;not that I think my amendment widened the categories, as the Minister said.  On reflection, I think that in so far as capital punishment is a deterrent at all, it is more likely to be a deterrent in the type of case which the Minister has in mind; criminals who in pursuit of their nefarious trade choose to arm themselves and so are in a position to cause the death of a garda who is attempting to arrest them.  I still think a citizen who comes to the aid of a garda is in the same position as the garda, but the amendment has been dealt with.  The more I think about it the clearer it is in my mind that it is only in that special type of case that capital punishment is a real deterrent.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first amendment, I am sure we all have a particular abhorrence for murder by poisoning, probably because it is the most sneaky method of committing a murder.  There is no shred of manliness about it at all. It is an appalling way to commit a murder, but I do not think capital punishment would deter a poisoner because of his peculiar mentality and the method he uses.  It is obvious that a poisoner picks that method because he thinks his crime will be completely concealed.  His motive is usually greed or jealousy, and I should imagine that his mind is so completely obsessed that the idea of punishment does not enter into it.  Therefore I do not believe capital punishment would be a deterrent in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the second amendment, I do not see that such a murder is any different from quite a large number of other cases.  We have heard that there are types of killing which are not recognised as murder at all.  For instance, there are people who deliberately ignore the law when driving a motor car.  They cross the white line on a bend, and go over the crest of a hill on the wrong side.  That happened to me twice today.  There are other people who ignore the speed limit.  Anyone driving a car, or any mechanically-propelled vehicle, is in charge of a lethal weapon, as we all <Col N="737" /> understand.  If such people deliberately break the law, and particularly when the law is very precise and other road users have a legal and moral right to expect that the law will be kept, they are not regarded as murderers, but they should certainly rank <i>pari passu</i> with the people with whom the Senator is concerned in this amendment.  I do not see anyone seriously proposing that a person who kills because he drives at 35 miles an hour in a restricted zone should be executed for it.  I cannot see that there is any more case to be made for that than for the second amendment.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter a great deal of thought, I am inclined to believe that in so far as capital punishment is a deterrent at all, it can only be a deterrent to criminals setting out to commit a crime who take arms with them to enable them to commit the crime and escape.  The sort of cool deliberateness of it makes it one case where they might be deterred if they knew they might be executed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the first amendment.  I have some doubts about the second amendment because in that case the person who would be charged with murder would not have set out with the intention of committing a murder.  He would perhaps have set out knowing that there was a risk that death might result.  Therefore, I cannot support the second amendment.  I support the first amendment because in that case there is deliberate planning to take a life, and if there is any way of deterring that person, it should be adopted.  I believe capital punishment might be a deterrent to murder by poisoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Occasionally, there are other murders by poison and the poison used might not be detected.  In the more distant past, that was their hope but modern science can usually detect these things now.  However, if a person were able to procure some poison not very widely known to medical science in this country, and deliberately procured and used it, that person used it simply because he thought it the most unlikely way of being detected.  In that way, I think, such a person says: &ldquo;I will not shoot this person because I am more <Col N="738" /> likely to be caught and I am more likely to meet punishment.&rdquo;  If people know that the punishment will be execution, then I think they will feel this to be a greater deterrent.</P>
    <P>The person who sets out to poison a victim is probably a worse criminal than the person who perhaps, although armed with a gun, is attempting to resist arrest and in the heat of the moment shoots a policeman.  I think that a person who plans to murder with poison deserves a greater punishment even than the person who shoots a policeman although he brought his gun with him, possibly intending to frighten and eventually shooting in the hope of escape.  The poisoner deliberately planned the murder beforehand in cold blood.  I am sorry the Minister takes the attitude he does in regard to the amendments.  I feel it will lead to people having less regard for human life in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I missed the earlier part of the discussion on these amendments but I find myself in a difficulty about amendment No. 2&mdash;murder done in the furtherance or course of or consequent upon the attempted procurement or procurement of an abortion.  In any attempt, successful or otherwise, to procure an abortion, there are two lives at stake, the life of the mother and the life of the individual that is inside her uterus.  I wonder in this amendment if that is meant to include the second individual because, if so, I would have to indicate, on a technical point, that it is not always certain that that second individual is alive at any stage of the pregnancy.  At least 50 per cent of conceptions end up at an early stage of the pregnancy without producing a living individual and they very often terminate without the mother knowing that she was ever pregnant.  Therefore, one would have to be quite clear that what was meant here was murder in the case of a person who had died&mdash;the mother who had died in the course of an attempt to procure an abortion.  I should like clarification on that, Sir.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support the first amendment but not the second amendment.  I would support the first amendment for the simple reason that it is so easy for a person to administer poison and to escape detection subsequently. For example, if a person had been attending a doctor for a heart ailment or some other illness and another person administers the poison subsequent to the visit of the doctor, it is quite likely that the doctor would issue a certificate in that particular case without a re-examination of the patient.  A case like that could arise and the person who would administer the poison would have a motive and a reason for administering the poison.  I think the deterrent should be there to prevent such people from taking advantage of any such occasion.  In the second one, I would say that there would be no motive or intention of committing a murder.  It could really be described as a tragedy that would take place as a result of extraordinary circumstances.  I could not support the second amendment at all but I would support the first amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to raise the same point as that raised by Senator Jessop in regard to the two lives involved.  I am surprised to learn now that it is not murder legally where abortion is brought about or created. The question of a deterrent was discussed very fully in the earlier debates on this Bill.  We seem now to be splitting hairs as to what constitutes a murder and what does not.  My view is <Col N="740" /> that anybody who takes life should get the severest penalty possible.  Most murders that have taken place, with few exceptions, are planned murders. The poisoner, therefore, is no different from any other.  We have to decide whether capital punishment has acted in the past as a deterrent or will so act in the future.  We have the Minister talking to the effect that in the past ten years capital punishment has not acted as a deterrent.  If it has not acted as a deterrent there is no point in including it in the Bill except for the purpose specified by the Minister, namely a civic guard or a prison warder.</P>
      <P>My view is that all life is sacred whether it be that of a civic guard, a prison warder or anybody else.  I feel that capital punishment has acted as a deterrent to a certain degree.  Take the question of rearing children.  We have to have deterrents in order to have discipline and we have to punish occasionally.  As far as criminals and others are concerned, we are using kid gloves.  We are taking that line in recent times.  We seem to be doing more now from the point of view of rehabilitation, which has yet to prove whether it will be effective.</P>
      <P>Someone has said that we are actually educating these so well that they will be fully-fledged criminals when they come out, knowing all the pitfalls, all the dangers inherent in committing a crime, and, therefore, able to avoid them.  I am sure any who have read the debates on this Bill will be fully armed in the future because they will be fully aware of their rights and privileges.  People do not regard a prison sentence in the same way as they regard the threat of losing their lives.  Recently I was told about a man who has a dispute with another over some piece of land and the view was expressed that, as soon as the Bill becomes law, that man will probably take the law into his own hands, knowing that he will not be held accountable and his life demanded of him if he does a certain act.</P>

      <P>I understand the regulations are very stringent with regard to the sale of poison.  Is it a fact that, in order to purchase poison now, one must have a signature of a civic guard or call at the local garda station and be identified in the shop in which one wishes to purchase the poison?  There was an unfortunate case in which a person, who was known to the shopkeeper, purchased poison for the destruction of rats; unfortunately, there were other results.  I should like to know if the regulations with regard to the sale of poison are pretty stringent now.  If they are, then there is no need for Senator Lindsay's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Since the last meeting, I have had an opportunity of discussing <Col N="742" /> this Bill and the amendments with a number of people, a former chief superintendent, some university people and some clergymen.  I have yet to find any one of these who agrees with the Bill as it stands.  They all share the view that it is unnecessary.  They all share the anxiety I stressed here on the last two occasions with regard to unsolved murders.  The get-away technique of the murderer has been perfected to the point at which the law enforcement authorities, even with the aid of modern science, are unable to catch him.  Surely the most premeditated murder of all is that by poison. There is the procuring of the poison, the administering of the poison, the planning of the disposal of the remains to avoid detection.  If that does not amount to premeditation, then I do not know what does.  Quite obviously, the death penalty is a deterrent. The Minister's reasoning is so devious that he actually argues that a hardened criminal, going to commit a robbery, feeling he might meet with a garda and, in the heat of the moment, might shoot him and find himself charged with capital murder, will, in future, leave his weapons at home.  If a deterrent is of that value in the case of such a person, surely it is equally a major deterrent in the case of the poisoner.</P>
      <P>We must exercise our opposition to the fullest in relation to this Bill.  In present circumstances, that opposition will not achieve anything but it may curb some of the Minister's enthusiasm for this law reform and we may succeed in directing his attention and the attention of his Department to the major problems confronting us today, namely the number of unsolved murders which make such sorry headlines in our newspapers.  What is sorrier still is all the publicity, identikits and so on, and the murderer escapes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Having given the matter considerable thought, I am opposed to both amendments.  Neither will act as a deterrent or assist in the civilised development of our society.  I shall deal with the second amendment first, the purpose of which is to treat as capital murder, with a penalty of death, murder done in furtherance of, or in the course of, or consequent upon, the attempted procurement or procurement of an abortion.  An abortion is always committed with a view to preventing the public knowing that a certain female is pregnant or is about to give birth to an illegitimate child. Either she is unmarried or her husband is living apart from her.  For either of those reasons, she does not wish the public to know she is pregnant.  Someone closely attached to her, an immediate relative or the putative father, wishes to have the matter concealed. By making that capital murder, are we really creating a deterrent?  Quite obviously, even if there were no penalty at all, except the publicity, this unfortunate female would not submit herself to this operation and neither would the person who has prompted her to have the operation. The mere fact that it is a criminal offence means it will be investigated in our law courts under the full glare of publicity.  Everybody will know her name.  Everybody will know the name of the putative father or whoever conspired with her.  If there is any reasonable prospect of these parties being discovered the girl will not undergo the operation and the man concerned will not have her undergo the operation. Therefore, making it a criminal offence with the penalty of capital punishment is not a greater deterrent than imprisonment for life.  There is no use in having a penalty of death merely for the sake of vengeance.  As our society advances I hope we are getting further and further away from vengeance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment requires the administration of poison to be punishable by death.  The administration of poison, as has been pointed out here, is <Col N="744" /> a cold calculated act.  It differs from murder done in the heat of the moment.  There again, by making that punishable by death, we are assuming that every criminal who administers poison is equally responsible, equally guilty, whereas one person's crime may be far more serious than that of another.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the case of a person who administers poison to himself, commits suicide.  Most of us would hold that in three cases out of four such a person is at least mentally unbalanced, in many cases insane.  However, strictly speaking, if that person did not succeed in bringing about his death, if he were caught in the act or if he were caught in sufficient time that a doctor or medical aid could be brought and he could be revived, he could be charged with attempted murder, if you like.  From the moral point of view he is as guilty as if he had committed murder.  From the legal point of view he has attempted to commit a crime and the view might be taken that such a person is completely balanced mentally.  Likewise, in the administration of poison the person who administers it may be perfectly balanced.  Therefore, having one penalty, a penalty which cannot be revoked or amended, for such crimes is contrary to natural justice.  When poison is administered for the purpose of procuring death it is administered for either of two reasons.  In 99 per cent of cases it is brought about because the person administering the poison wishes to make some financial gain or because the person who wishes to bring about the death is involved in some illicit affair of sex or passion. If such a person is to be imprisoned for life he will not be able to enjoy financial gain or to indulge in illicit affairs.  If that person feels there is even a remote possibility of his being discovered and being prosecuted, he or she will not commit the crime.  Therefore, the penalty of imprisonment for life is as effective as the death penalty.</P>
    <P>If we pass these amendments I believe we shall merely do so for the purpose of boosting our own ego, giving vent to our inherent feelings of vengeance, which are natural, if you <Col N="745" /> wish, but which are not justified.  As I am not convinced the penalty of death in either of these cases would act as a deterrent or would prevent one single crime of that nature, I feel constrained to oppose the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation whatever in asking the House to reject these two amendments and I would very strongly urge Senators to do so, on two main grounds.  First of all, on the principle of the Bill, I believe the time has come in our society to get rid of capital punishment. Capital punishment is either a good thing or a bad thing.  I think it is a bad thing and that most people believe it is a bad thing.  I am prepared to retain it only in the cases where I believe it is absolutely essential to retain it at this stage of our development, for the security and protection of the State, in the very limited number of cases which are outlined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The proposers of these amendments and others who support them are in a very false position.  They cannot make up their minds whether they want capital punishment retained or not.  If we are against capital punishment on principle because of all the connotations it has, we must gt rid of it to the greatest possible extent and retain it only in the very limited number of cases where it must be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear and has been fairly scientifically established that capital punishment is not a deterrent in the kind of murders we are considering. The various bodies and institutions throughout the world which have investigated this matter have, with a greater or lesser degree of unanimity, come to that conclusion.  If it does not act as a deterrent in this type of case, then why retain it?  There does not seem to be any argument in principle or logic for its retention if it does not act as a deterrent.  Surely the crime of murder by poisoning is the type of crime in which it is least likely to act as a deterrent because the poisoner, more than anybody else, hopes to get away with his crime and never to be discovered.  If that is so, then in what possible circumstances could it be regarded as acting as a deterrent against <Col N="746" /> that type of crime?  If I thought there were any categories of murder the incidence of which the retention of capital punishment would help to keep down, then I would not abolish it at all for any such categories.  But it is quite clear in these two cases that it does not act as a deterrent and, therefore, because capital punishment in itself is a bad thing, I am against any extension which is not absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>It is on that main ground of principle that I am opposed to the two amendments.  There are other grounds for my objections.  For instance, I want to point out to the House that if we do this, if we make this sort of extension, we shall get into all sorts of difficulties and all sorts of anomalous situations will arise in the future. Senator Lindsay was not quite fair to me in regard to what he said about mercy killings.  When we were discussing this on a previous occasion, I said that I was sure nobody in this House would for a moment subscribe to the type of reasoning which causes a person to carry out mercy killing or euthanasia of any sort.  I think we would be unanimous that that sort of mentality is completely foreign to our people but I want to point out that, if we adopted the first amendment, you could have a situation in which the death penalty would be invoked for a crime which would not be half as reprehensible or half as heinous to most people's minds as some other crime for which we were not retaining it at all.</P>
    <P>It is possible to conceive a situation in which a person for reasons which to him were humanitarian and just and merciful would carry out a killing. All of us would reject that type of thinking but we must face up to the possibility that such a situation could arise and none of us, knowing the person's mind, would regard that type of crime as being as reprehensible as some other brutal or heinous crime for which we were not retaining capital punishment; so that if you start this sort of thing, you would get into serious difficulties and create these anomalies.</P>
    <P>I want also to point out that this is <Col N="747" /> an attempt to grade murder, to say that one type of murder is worse than any other type and therefore you are going to keep the death penalty for it. No country in the world has been able to do that successfully.  The British Commission on Capital Punishment which reported in 1955, after carrying out a lengthy study of the possibilities of grading murder along these lines, concluded with regret that the object of their quest was chimerical and must be abandoned.  Having gone into it carefully and at length, they decided that such grading was not possible.  I fully subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>To support that argument, I would mention that different people have different ideas about which type of crime is more reprehensible or more heinous than another.  Before this Bill was published, a learned judge of our courts wrote to me and suggested some types of murder for which he thought the death penalty should be retained.  They are different categories from those proposed by Senator Lindsay.  The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland proposed categories which again are different from what this judge proposed to me.  This is a clear case of <i>quot homines tot sententiae</i> but I think it is true to say that, if you start making exceptions, you will have as many exceptions in the Bill as you have Senators.</P>
    <P>I strongly agree with Senator Nash. There is a clear indication, if we were to accept these amendments, that these types of murders are worse than other murders and therefore should attract greater punishment.  That is false thinking.  It involves a notion of vengeance by the State and of punishing vengefully.  The State cannot do that.  The community or society is only entitled to protect itself in these matters; it is not entitled to be vengeful or revengeful and say: &ldquo;Because this type of murder is regarded by us as reprehensible, we are going to punish you far more than if it were some other type of murder&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty in regard to the second amendment, that is, that it will be difficult in the future to conceive a death from abortion being <Col N="748" /> regarded as murder.  The provision which is included in the Bill about malice in murder cases is that a person must intend to kill or cause serious harm and this would seem to me in most cases to exclude death caused in attempting to procure an abortion from the category of murder.  Clearly in most of these cases the person committing this terrible crime would not intend the death of, or serious harm to, the woman concerned and whereas we have a rebuttable presumption about a person being responsible for the natural and reasonable consequences of his or her act, I think even so it is unlikely in the great majority of abortion cases that it would be possible to convict the person of murder at all.</P>
    <P>I merely mention that as an additional argument against the second amendment in particular but both amendments are unacceptable, first of all, because of the principle on which the Bill is based and, secondly, because of the difficulties and anomalies which they would create for us in the future if we were to adopt them.</P>
    <P>It always amazes me when people who should have a scientific approach to things come out with nonsensical sorts of statements.  We have not got in this country any serious amount of unsolved murders.  I gave figures in Sligo last week for the period of 10 years from 1954 to 1963.  In that period there were 49 murders committed in this country and only six of them at this stage remain unsolved.  I am not complacent about that situation.  Myself or the Garda authorities or anybody concerned with the matter would never be satisfied or complacent as long as there is even one unsolved murder on our books, but I do feel that I should point out, in fairness to everybody concerned and in order to allay to some extent the public disquiet that this miscievous sort of statement causes, that our figures of statement causes, that our figures of murders remaining unsolved at this stage compare more than favourably with any other country in the world that we know of.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need bother to reply.  The Minister has made up his mind.  Those supporting him in the House, with their majority, have made up their minds.  If the Minister for Justice suffers from any limitation of mental process, it is that he seems to be ready at all times to accuse anybody who differs from his line of reasoning of basing everything on false premise.  That, of course, will lead him into considerable trouble, as it will leave him with the poisoner and the abortioner when this Bill is through.</P>
      <P>All this talk about deterrent is just poppycock unless there is a deterrent there.  When the Minister accuses us in putting down these amendments of not being able to make up our minds as to whether we are for or against capital punishment, I want to make my mind perfectly clear.  I am for capital punishment and I am for it for far more categories than he has included and in addition to the two that I am trying to include but I am prepared to go that bit of the way with the thinking that is being done in modern times by those who want to reduce the matter to categories.  I do not follow the Minister at all in his line of reasoning that we are dealing with this on the basis that something is more reprehensible than another.</P>

      <P>I was not being unfair to the Minister about mercy killing. I merely quoted him.  I did not know what he was at and I was glad that he gave the explanation.  He says, in one breath, that we are all in principle against any effort to take away life through mercy killing but, nevertheless, there might be a situation in which it would be found that it was a mercy killing rather than a murder.  In those circumstances we want to provide the lollipop through this Bill as a let out for the person lucky enough to establish it as a mercy killing rather than plain murder, and no more about it.</P>
      <P>I do not follow at all his reasoning when he says that, if he includes this, he might find others and it would lead us into peculiar anomalies.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very fond of talking in generalities, fond of saying, &ldquo;It is well established&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is clearly established&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is well recognised&rdquo;, &ldquo;All the people in all the countries where this question has been considered have come to the same conclusion.&rdquo;  Does he not know that in England the system where certain categories were put into what might be called the &ldquo;soft pedal class&rdquo;, that is, the class carrying penal servitude merely and not carrying capital punishment, has been most unsuccessful and that crime in those categories is on the upgrade in England at the present time and that the English authorities, both in the Office of the Attorney General and in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, are extremely worried about the situation and are full of regret that they ever reduced the matter to categories at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The Minister would have done better if he had come into this House and said: &ldquo;I am going to abolish capital punishment, whether you shoot civic guards, warders, diplomats or even myself.  There will be no more capital punishment&rdquo;, rather than come in here and reserve capital punishment for murders of policemen, warders, diplomats and various people of that kind and murders for a political motive.  I do not see why such murders should carry capital punishment, why it should be retained for these because, remember, the life of a Minister or the life of a diplomat, visiting or otherwise, or the life of a guard, is not one whit more important than the life that is taken by the poisoner or the life that is taken by the performer of an illegal operation.  It is for that reason that I want the deterrent there for all of these performers in whatever sphere they choose to operate.</P>
    <P>There is too much namby pamby business going on.  The Minister will discover that he is making a mistake as time goes on.  I hope that I will be proved wrong in making that assertion but nevertheless I make it with more confidence than misgiving.</P>
    <P>I regret that, having regard to the way I think on these matters, I must <Col N="752" /> force the House to a division on both of these amendments.  They can be decided in one division if the House so wishes rather than lose time.  A matter of national importance in our criminal code that affects the whole of our community cannot be left to one Party.  It cannot be left to one Party to decide which category carries the capital charge and which category does not.  I do not think for one moment that a matter of this kind should be decided in the Government Party room.  I do not think it can be decided in the Government Party room that the poisoner will go to jail for life and the person who shoots a civic guard must hang, unless some other means are devised in the meantime instead of hanging.  Accordingly, I press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish simply to say I have been honoured by the Minister's statement that I have been unscientific in mentioning the unsolved murders about which everybody knows.  If that is what the Minister calls unscientific, I am honoured to accept it, but when it comes to science, I challenge the Minister or anyone of his standing.  Reading the importance the public attach to what we have been reading in our newspapers over the past months, when it comes to logical argument, it is basic evidence of the weakness of logic when one steers off a case by assuming, as the Minister does, that he alone is the sole arbiter of logic in this House.</P>
      <P>The sole logic of this Bill and of the arguments against it was that in retaining the death penalty there was no tribunal, no court at all in which one could have the penalty retained. It was assumed here that all categories were to be executed, whereas in the first instance, we have the courts, and then we have the Cabinet prepared to do their duty and to consider carefully the cases that come up.  There has not been a murder since 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish merely to express my disappointment at the manner in which the Minister received what was intended to be wholly constructive criticism.  To my mind, he has made a mistake in tampering with a situation that could have been helpful. What was necessary here was a review of the manner in which sentences of death were automatically commuted by the Government.</P>
      <P>When I say Government, I do not mean any particular Government: I mean that from 1954 or thereabouts there has been no execution, as Senator Quinlan has said.  That may well have been the correct approach in all of those cases, but it brought about a degree of cynicism towards the law and towards the administration of the law that was in all probability thoroughly justified.  In Government, or in the control of any Department at national or local level, one must always beware of breeding cynicism or contempt of that kind for the Establishment or for established rule of law.</P>
      <P>That is what was necessary here&mdash; that it should be made known that if ever sentence were commuted, the Executive were firmly resolved to retain for themselves the prerogative which they have enjoyed and in all cases, under all Governments I would say, rationally exercised.  That is the reason why this Bill is of great moment: this is tampering with the situation fraught with danger.  Earlier in the evening, I used the phrase &ldquo;namby-pamby&rdquo; for want, simply, of a better phrase which I could not find at the time.  It is that softness of approach, that misplaced pity, which has become such a feature of post-war life that has crept into all spheres of public activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all be gentlemen, we must rehabilitate, everything we do must be designed to create a deterrent: punishment <Col N="755" /> is out, we must not have punishment any longer.  Well, we have the old saying of: &ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&rdquo;  I submit the Minister is making it easy for the people who believe in the opposite of that concept. If Senators will only direct their minds to the situation that has arisen during the post-war period in relation to crime generally, they will see an almost remarkable change, a forbidding and terrible change.  If you drive, cycle or walk along the streets&mdash;indeed, it often happens in the country, too&mdash;people will not even leave you the right of way.  Some fellow with drainpipe trousers and a haircut not invented by God nor man will stand in your way and defy you to brush him with the wing of your car or to even pass him by.  Any kind of soft pedalling at this time is dangerous.  I want to warn the House, with such experience as I have and such observation as I have been able to exercise, that the time has come in law reform in relation to crime not for soft pedalling, not for the abolition of capital punishment, not for the reduction of sentences, not for rehabilitation in the soft sense of the word, but for a stern application of the law to the wrongdoer.  Anybody responsible for provisions of this kind, making it easier, making it less frightful, making the future not so forbidding for the wrongdoer is doing a great disservice to the nation and its citizens.</P>
    <P>I put down the two amendments we had on the last Stage with a view to widening the categories, not because I do not believe in capital punishment. I have already said I do.  I would have had far more categories included, but after a careful examination of the law books dealing with various kinds of crimes, I selected these two as the ones I regarded as most heinous and which required a deterrent if crimes ever did.  The man who shoots a policeman or injures a prison warder in an effort to escape does not start his operation with a view to killing. That is where the &ldquo;guilty mind&rdquo; comes in.  He kills only in an effort to get away.  It might be successfully argued that the killing was never accompanied by malicious intent, and <Col N="756" /> in cases that has been successfully argued.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this argument of a deterrent is a good one in so far as it is applied in certain cases here.  You notice that only the Establishment is protected&mdash;the police, the prison warder, the person killed for political motives, some Minister or visiting dignatary from a foreign State.  It is within that narrow confine we have reserved capital punishment.  If I thought for one moment that the abolition of capital punishment altogether would meet the situation, I would be the first to accept it.  But I do not believe it, and I do not believe it has been found so effective that it has become apparent only in the past 15 or 20 years.  Admittedly, there have been down the years suffragettes and liberal-minled people from all walks of life, but only a small minority in all countries, campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment on the ground that it is a barbarous act accompanied by torture, suffering and cruelty and that nobody has a right to sever, as it were, the soul from the body, not even the State.  But that right has been given to the State.  It is given in time of war and in time of peace to every State.</P>
    <P>What I think is fundamentally the worst feature of this Bill is that it follows in the main its English counterpart. You are dealing with a different kind of people.  You are dealing with the Anglo-Saxon in one case, and with the Celtic temperament in the other. You are dealing with two different kinds of people.  In all legislation we have copied, not slavishly but lazily, without making proper assessment of the conditions governing our people and the particular temperament with which the law makers have to deal as well as those who administer the law. I am not surprised that the Minister received a letter from a judge of our courts wishing to include categories other than those I wanted to include, and I am not surprised that Lord MacDermott, the Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, had still further categories to add.</P>

      <P>As one who is extremely anxious to uphold the law, I suppose I had better accept the ruling of the Chair at once.  Those are the thoughts that occur to me at the passing of this Bill.  I hope the Minister has not made a mistake, but I am afraid he has.  I hope the people who supported him tonight in excluding the poisoner and the abortioner from capital punishment will not regret it. Most people are human enough to like to prove themselves right.  In this instance I should like to see myself proved wrong.  It is because at this present time I am so convinced that I could not be proved wrong, having regard to the circumstances of our times, I took the stand I did on these two amendments and on this aspect of the law.</P>
      <P>I want to get clarification from the Minister on two matters.  I want to know if the section on malice interferes in any way, however slight, with the doctrine that every man is innocent until he is proved guilty, and that at no time in the course of a trial shall the onus be cast upon a prisoner to prove himself innocent.  Secondly, is it the intention of the Government that when a person is convicted of murder <i>simpliciter</i>, and sentenced to penal servitude for life, the sentence will be served in full without any interference by the Executive?  Will the Executive still retain the right to commute the sentence passed on a man or woman found guilty of capital murder?</P>

      <P>I am glad the House has so far approved this Bill.  I am quite convinced that the retention of capital punishment in any stage of our development has never been a serious deterrent against the crime of murder. I say that deliberately and honestly from my heart because I believe it.  I have the greatest respect for Senator Lindsay, but his contentions seemed to me to contradict themselves.  If, as Senator Lindsay suggested, we now have a new type of lawbreaker emerging, or the evolution of some new type of social problem, surely the fact <Col N="758" /> that we have such a problem to deal with is the answer in itself to Senator Lindsay's point?  If we are left with this problem, is it not obvious that we are left with it after a long period of years in which we have had the right to call for the exacting of capital punishment?</P>

Unless the State demands and exacts the full penalty of the law, every member of the House will have contributed, indirectly perhaps, but very seriously, to a most serious omission.  I hope neither the Minister nor any member of the House will find himself in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to say anything at this stage, but Senator Lindsay has directed some specific questions to me which I feel I should answer.  Let me say, first of all, that I am glad Senator Lindsay referred to something we talked about in the early stages of the debate, that is, the situation in which the Executive have been placed in recent years.  This measure probably owes its existence to the unsatisfactory situation to which Senator Lindsay referred, in which we had the courts, with all the dignity and solemnity which surrounds a murder trial, solemnly pronouncing sentence of death, while practically everyone was aware of the fact that it was most unlikely that that sentence would be put into effect.  As the years went by, it became more and more certain that the death sentence would be commuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> I agree with Senator Lindsay that that was an undesirable state of affairs, that it was bringing the law into contempt and making a mockery, to some extent, of our courts of justice.  It was as much that as any other factor that induced the Government to bring forward this Bill and to consider the whole proposal to abolish capital punishment. I think our experience in this regard will be the same as that of all other countries who have taken this step at different times in their history.  As a rule, countries approach this problem nervously and are worried about the effects of the abolition of capital punishment.  They are nervous that it might lead to increased crime, but they find, as the years go by, that it has no such effect at all.  We all know the story of the famous English judge who said that he thought the entire constitution of England would be subverted if capital punishment for larceny were abolished.  He probably believed that at the time, and was sincere in that belief, but it shows how fallible people can be when dealing with a problem of this nature.</P>
    <P>I feel that in this Bill we have a very good measure.  As I said at the outset, we are abolishing capital punishment to all intents and purposes. We are retaining it for a very limited and exceptional category.  I would say that almost to the extent of 99 per cent we have, in fact, abolished it.  I am not in any way nervous of the outcome. As I said also at different times during the debates on this Bill, if the Government thought for one moment that the introduction of this measure would have an adverse effect on the volume of this type of crime, they would not have considered it.  It was only when we were satisfied, to the extent to which human intelligence can ever be satisfied in these matters, that it would have no such effect, that we decided the time had come in our affairs to take this step.</P>
    <P>Senator Lindsay was worried about the section dealing with constructive malice.  I think his fears are groundless. That is a matter to which we gave a great deal of thought, and into <Col N="760" /> which we put a great deal of research. We did not confine our research to this country.  So far as we could, we sought the best opinions of jurists abroad.  I think I can satisfy Senator Lindsay by saying that we are assured that subsection (2) of section 4 merely restates the law as it is at present. Senator Lindsay will agree with me when I say that if such a fundamental change as he suggested were to be made, it could only be done&mdash;when you take the whole corpus of common law and force of precedent into account&mdash;by putting an express provision to that effect into the Bill.  We have not done that.  I am satisfied that this subsection simply gives statutory effect to what is the law at present.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot give the House any sort of satisfactory assurances as to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy by Executives in the future. The Government will still have, in the case of capital murder, the right to commute the sentence to one of life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the length of sentences that prisoners with death sentences which have been commuted should serve, there is not very much that I can say.  I have already mentioned that it will go out from this House very clearly that the overwhelming majority of Senators are not satisfied that murderers whose sentences are commuted serve long enough at present.  I think future Executives will have to have regard to that sentiment and opinion as expressed here. As against that, they will have to have regard to ordinary human considerations.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned before, when a prisoner in one of our jails has satisfied all the competent authorities that he is fully rehabilitated and is fit and ready to take his place again in society, without any danger whatever to that society, I find it very difficult to believe that anybody in this House who is given the responsibility of deciding such an issue would insist that such a person should continue to be imprisoned if continued imprisonment would cause deterioration in his moral and physical condition.  I cannot say <Col N="761" /> what future Executives will do.  All we can hope is that they will decide each particular case coming before them in the light of the considerations I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>When this sort of case comes before the Government, the Government are armed with the fullest possible information about it.  They are given complete details of the original crime, how and where it was committed, the motives, and the remarks, if any, of the judge in imposing the sentence.  All of these things are fully put before the Government and then all the subsequent history of the prisoner&mdash;reports from all the competent officers concerned. Finally, on the basis of all this information and evidence, the Government must take their decision whether or not to release the prisoner on the basis that he has paid his debt to society and that he can safely be allowed back into society as a fully rehabilitated person.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can do more than that.  I think we shall just have to hope that future Governments will do their duty in this regard.  This is an executive act of Government.  It is one for which this House or the Dáil can take the Government to task at any time if it feels the Government are being over-liberal in the use of their power in remitting balances of life imprisonment sentences.  I cannot give the House any specific assurances but that is the situation as I see it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to thank the House for the reception it has given the measure and for the constructive and valuable criticism which it has received here in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole import of the section, particularly subsection (1), does somewhat disturb me a little.  I know it is the accepted law here and in England now, but one feels in respect of those families where there is this difference between the father and the mother, and they are now both legally guardians, with equal power, it will create possibly a series of applications to courts which will perhaps leave matters worse than they were before. I do not know any other remedy.  I should rather put it in such a way that the father was the guardian and in exceptional circumstances the mother could apply to the court.</P>
      <P>Article 42 of the Constitution does at first sight give both parents equal rights.  The words in the Article are &ldquo;duty to provide&rdquo; for the infants.  It seems to me that it does rather upset our conception of family life in this country.</P>
      <P>It may be that the rights of the female member of the partnership or the rights of women all down through the past 100 years, or less, have been growing into equality with those of the male.  In family life one would perhaps like to see one or the other&mdash; possibly, in a lot of cases the mother would be more important a figure, at least in the younger life&mdash;being given the guardianship except in the exceptional cases.</P>
      <P>Where the father and mother of an infant shall be guardians of the infant jointly, it worries me slightly that, in those families where there is more or less incessant disagreement between the father and the mother, this will not assist the matter at all.  An application to the court in exceptional circumstances would have appealed to me much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to subsection (4).  One point occurs to me: <Col N="763" /> the mother of an illegitimate infant shall be the guardian of the infant.  The mother can appoint a guardian on her death, by will or deed presumably.  If she has a right of maintenance against the natural father of the child, on her death, will the guardian also have that right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am interested in the point made by Senator Cole in regard to subsection (4).  The mother seems to be faced with the complete responsibility.  Even though it is an illegitimate infant, what further safeguards are taken for responsibility? How far does the law in such a case make the father face up to his responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are really only giving effect to what the Supreme Court decided in the Tilson case.  Senators will recall the judgment of the Supreme Court in that case.  It included the statement that the principle to be derived from Article 42 of the Constitution was that the parents have a joint power and duty in respect of the religious education of their children and that parents, in this context, could not be construed in some generic sense that included only the father when he was living. That was a Supreme Court judgment in 1951.  In effect, what we propose here has been the law since 1951; the parents have equal rights in regard to the guardianship of their children. However, I make no bones about the fact that I think the situation where the father, just because he is the father, has some superior rights over the mother in this regard is indefensible and I regard this section now as putting right, if you like, a wrong that has existed for centuries.  This is the final step, I think, in the achievement of equality of the sexes in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Cole has posed a question to which I have not got the answer readily available, but, offhand, it would seem to me that the guardian should be entitled to the same contribution as the natural mother.  I do not want to be dogmatic since it is not really a matter for this Bill; it is a matter for the law governing maintenance.</P>

      <P>Subsection (7) amends the Wills Act of 1837 by enabling a parent under 21 years of age to make a will appointing a testamentary guardian.  I do not take the slightest objection to that.  I think it is the logical thing to do.  A person who is married, even though under 21 years of age, should have the right to appoint a guardian.  I am in agreement, therefore, with the amendment of the Wills Act.  I do not know, however, why the section did not go a little further and give the person under 21 years of age the right to appoint such a guardian by deed.  As I understand it, a person under 21 years of age cannot execute a valid deed.  At least, such a deed can be set aside if called in question subsequently.  While a young person of 17 or 18 might be rather slow to make a will such a person might execute a deed appointing a guardian. I do not know if the Minister and his advisers are of the opinion that a person under 21 can execute a valid deed appointing a guardian.  I am inclined to think that he or she cannot.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 8 (2) a very important point arises.  There is a lot of good in this Bill and I agree with the Bill by and large but I am violently against this subsection as it stands.  I have read the debate in the Dáil on it and given it much consideration.  Subsection (2) of section 8 reads:</P>
      <P>When no guardian has been appointed by a deceased parent or if a guardian so appointed dies or refuses to act, the court may appoint a guardian or guardians to act jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that, if a wife dies survived by her husband and some children, some in-law or other relative may go into court and have himself or herself appointed as guardian jointly with the father.  That is totally unnecessary and can lead to all sorts of complications and difficulties.  I know the Minister's argument is that there can be a case where a parent dies without appointing a guardian and where the surviving parent can be totally unfit to look after the upbringing of the children and in such a case there should be a right to have a guardian appointed, and with that <Col N="767" /> proposition I thoroughly agree.  I am also aware of the provision in section 3 of this Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant, or the administration of any property belonging to or held on trust for an infant, or the application of the income thereof, is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>I am aware that section is there but I say that in the great majority of cases a surviving parent is very well fitted to look after the children and he or she should not have a guardian inflicted on him or her by the court. The Minister says the court will always act reasonably.  That may be so but section 3, which imposes on the court the obligation to put the welfare of the child above all else, is more of a hindrance in this case than anything else because, if an application is made to the court to appoint a joint guardian with the surviving parent and if the court is in doubt as to whether such a guardian is necessary or not, it will fall back on section 3 which says the welfare of the child is to be the all-important factor.</P>
    <P>The unnecessary appointment of a guardian to act jointly with a surviving parent could do a lot more harm than good.  There could be a case where an interfering in-law, with the best intentions in the world, who believes that the surviving parent might not act in the best interest, will go into court and seek to have himself or herself appointed as a guardian.  Even if such an application is thrown out by the court on the ground that it is unnecessary, it could do a lot of harm.  It could bring the surviving parent into court to resist this unnecessary application and could in that way create bad blood between the surviving parent and the relatives of the deceased parent.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of the Minister's contention that if the surviving parent is an incurable alcoholic or if the surviving parent is amoral or in some other way totally unsuited to look after <Col N="768" /> the child, there should be machinery available to the deceased parent's relatives to protect the child.  However, there should be a very decided brake put on subsection (2) of section 8.  I did not put down any amendments and I can only suggest to the Minister a few amendments whereby he could give the court a direction as to how it should exercise its discretion under this section.  Subsection (2) at the moment reads:</P>
    <P>When no guardian has been appointed by a deceased parent or if a guardian so appointed dies or refuses to act, the court may appoint a guardian or guardians to act jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the following words should be added to that:</P>
    <P>if it appears to the court to be necessary in the interests of the infant to do so.</P>
    <P>or, if that is not acceptable, these words could be added:</P>
    <P>if it appears to the court that the surviving parent is unfit to look after the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>Something like that should be written into this subsection in order that the court will realise that the rights of the surviving parent are not to be lightly interfered with and that in normal conditions the surviving parent is the person entitled to the custody of the child, the person entitled to mould the child's mind and to bring it up.  There is a positive danger, as the subsection stands, that the court will come down too heavily in the interests of the child if it is in doubt at all and against the interests of the surviving parent and in that way do more harm than good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may give the reference to which I referred a moment ago, it was decided in <i>Ex parte Ilchester</i> by Lord Eldon, as reported in 1803, that a deed appointing a guardian is &ldquo;a testamentary instrument&rdquo; and as such it is revocable by a subsequent will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fears which Senator Fitzpatrick expressed are groundless.  I do not think it is necessary for me to give a <Col N="769" /> direction to the court because the courts themselves down the years have laid down very definite rules in this matter.  There is an established rule of law, which this Bill does not affect, that the court must act very cautiously when they come to interfere with parental rights.  The court must not act in opposition, as it were, to the parent unless it is judicially satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child, beyond any shadow of doubt, that it should interfere.  That rule was fully expressed in the <i>Kindersley</i> case in 1943.  This is a very difficult area, as Senator Fitzpatrick knows, and it is not easy to decide what exactly is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that what we propose here has in effect been the law since 1886.  A similar provision was included in the Act of 1886 in respect of a surviving mother; all we are doing now is applying the provision equally to both parents.  If we do not have a provision like this, then the courts' hands would be tied and very serious harm could come to children who would desperately need the services of a guardian.  I am satisfied that what we are providing is the right thing to do, to give the courts this power, knowing as we do that down the years the courts have always been very slow indeed to interfere with parental rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that in the Dáil the Minister was in a more flexible state of mind on this subsection and he undertook to reconsider it and to look into it.  Now the Minister is making his whole case on the ground that you could have a case where the surviving parent should not be entrusted with the children.  As I said already, the Minister cannot have any argument with me on that proposal because I thoroughly agree with it, but if this subsection is only necessary to deal with cases where the surviving parent should not be given charge of the children, what is the objection to putting that into the subsection? This matter is entirely a question of opinion and this problem will have to be decided by a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the application is made to have <Col N="770" /> himself appointed joint guardian with the surviving parent, it will be heard by a High Court judge.  A High Court judge is a human being, liable to make an error and certainly liable to be fallible in cases where it is an opinion of what is best and what is the right thing to do.  One judge might think that a father should be left, or a mother should be left to look after the children and bring them up as he or she thinks best, and another judge might think that somebody from the deceased parent's side should be put in to assist in looking after the child. In that way they could do a lot more harm than good.</P>
    <P>This subsection is new in the sense that it is now written into an Act of Parliament and it is a guide to the court.  I cannot see any objection to giving a direction to the court as to what the legislature intended when it passed this subsection.  Most Senators know that it is not possible to go into a court of law and say: &ldquo;Here is what the Minister for Justice said in the Seanad or in the Dáil, when he was putting it through&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>They will have to interpret this section as it stands without guidance from anybody except in regard to section 3 which says the interest of the infant is to be of paramount importance.  This is a non-contentious measure.  It is a measure dealing with a very delicate problem and I am sure the ambition of every Senator, and of every member of the Lower House, is to produce the best possible measure.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to reconsider this and to add such a brake or saving clause to this subsection as I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in a different context Senator Fitzpatrick would be one of the people who would argue <Col N="771" /> that there are dangers in attempting to write down in statute form provisions which are long established in the common law.  Very often it is better to leave well enough alone and to leave the established common law rule there. When you start to put down these things in codified form in a statute, you leave yourself open to the risk of omitting something that you would want to include.  This is not a question of putting in something here for the first time.  As I said, this was in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, which stated:</P>
      <P>When no guardian has been appointed by the father, or if the guardian or guardians appointed by the father is or are dead, or refuses or refuse to act, the Court may, if it shall think fit, from time to time appoint a guardian or guardians to act jointly with the mother.</P>
      <P>As I say, it was in the 1886 Act except that it was confined to the surviving mother and the only change we are now making is to have it applicable to both parents.</P>
      <P>One objection to Senator Fitzpatrick's proposal is that the surviving parent might want a guardian appointed; he or she might want the court to appoint a guardian to help out in a particular task such as the management of an estate, and so on, and Senator Fitzpatrick's proposal would mean that even in these circumstances the court could not appoint a guardian.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to tie the hands of the courts in this regard.  The courts have exercised this jurisdiction in guardianship matters very wisely and very well down the years and, as I say, they have established their own rules without the necessity for the Legislature to do so.  The courts have, in effect, laid down the type of rule which Senator Fitzpatrick would like to see applied and, in these circumstances, I feel that it is better to leave the situation as it is.  The courts have acted with great wisdom and discretion and I think we should leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section <Col N="772" /> of this Bill&mdash;section 7&mdash;which accepts the principle which I am trying to get the Minister to write into subsection (2) of section 8 because, without having time to consider it, I think section 7 provides that one parent can appoint a testamentary guardian to act jointly with the surviving parent and that that testamentary guardian shall act unless the surviving parent objects and then, if the surviving parent objects, you go to the court and the testamentary guardian is not given authority unless it appears that the surviving parent is unfit.</P>
      <P>If that is a correct interpretation of section 7, surely that is the very thing that I want written into section 8 and what is the objection to it?  I feel very strongly about this matter, I must say. I should like to hear the Minister as to whether he agrees that that is the correct interpretation of section 7 or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) does say that but, of course, that is a different type of situation.  Section 7 deals with the case where a testamentary guardian has been appointed and there is a dispute between the parent and the guardian.  In this situation, leaning heavily on the side of the parent, we leave it to the court to decide.  But in section 8 we are trying to cope with a situation where, for one reason or another, maybe because of the unfitness of the parent, maybe for some other reason, no guardian has been appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admittedly, as I said in the Dáil, the most common type of case would be where the parent was unfit, but there might be other types of cases.  It is simply that I am reluctant to tie the hands of the court.  We cannot envisage everything.  Cases have to be decided on their merits in relation to particular circumstances.  We might write something into this Bill which might have unforeseen results in a particular case. On the whole, the wise thing to do is to give the court discretion and allow it to decide in each particular case on the merits because, as I have said, there might be other types of cases, apart from unfitness.  I have mentioned one such case, namely, where the <Col N="773" /> parents themselves want a guardian appointed; there may be others.  That is all I can say to Senator Fitzpatrick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to drag it out and this is the last point I shall make: Surely there is a stronger case for allowing a guardian who has been appointed by the deceased parent to act jointly with the surviving parent than there is in the case where the deceased parent does not appoint a guardian at all and then to allow somebody else to say: &ldquo;I want to be appointed a guardian&rdquo; and not to provide that that person can only be appointed a guardian on establishing to the satisfaction of the court that the surviving parent is unfit or unsuitable? I am all in favour, by and large, of giving a discretion to the court but this is something delicate, something very personal and something in which the court should have a direction as to how it is to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know the courts are jealous of the rights of infants and I know that long before section 3 ever went into this Bill, a primary consideration of courts in this country in deciding matters of this sort was the welfare of the child.  I know that and that was the position long before section 3 was ever thought of; but the other thing is important, too.  Parents have rights that should not be lightly interfered with unless it is necessary to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was saying when the debate on this Bill was adjourned was that any reversal of the inward flow of funds into the country might create difficulties in the balance of payments and might reduce the liquidity of the banking system by depriving it of some of its external assets.  This point becomes relevant in view of the fact that according to the report of the Central Bank, bank advances here have been increasing rapidly in recent years.  Last year the increase in bills, loans and advances was ten per cent over that of 1962 which was the same as the increase in 1962 over 1961.  This shows a very considerable increase in the demand for credit partly from the Government but partly from all sorts of private bodies.  The report of the Central Bank classifies these various advances by saying that there is practically no type of trade or industry that is not borrowing more from the banking system now than it was a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a considerable increase in the amount of hire purchase debt; in other words, the community as a whole, public authorities and private borrowers, are becoming more and more indebted.  Therefore, anything in the nature of a sudden withdrawal of funds from the country might possibly create some difficulties for the banking system.  I want to make it perfectly clear that there is no sign of any such difficulty at the moment. The external liquid assets of the commercial banks are adequate to meet any possible calls which could be made upon them.  I want to clear up a point on which there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding, that is, in regard to what can be considered <Col N="776" /> as liquid assets of the banks at present. The banks' external assets are classified in the consolidated balance sheet separately, but in addition to these assets, the banks now have deposits with the Central Bank and also have exchequer bills which can be rediscounted on demand by the Central Bank and these, for all practical purposes, amount to sterling assets. Therefore, if these are taken into account, the actual liquidity of the banking system is higher than appears from a mere view of the external assets set out in the consolidated balance sheet.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that there is nothing in the nature of a dangerous position in the Irish banks at the moment.  But I want to make the point that a large inward movement of credit, if it suddenly became reversed to the extent of becoming what is known as &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;, might create certain difficulties for the banking system and for the balance of payments which would call for correction and which would be very adverse to the continued progress of the country.  I want to make abundantly clear that I do not suggest for a moment that there is any pressure of that kind at present and that the published figures of liquidity actually underrate the true liquidity because they do not take into account deposits with the Central Bank and exchequer bills which can be rediscounted by the Central Bank and which, for all practical purposes, are sterling assets.</P>
    <P>The increase in real capital formation of the country has continued at a surprisingly high rate.  The report of the Central Bank says that the amount of capital creation in 1963 was higher than in any previous year and that the amount of capital goods created at home and imported from abroad increased considerably.  If one looks at the trade returns, one finds that of the total imports in 1963 producers' capital goods amount to 15 per cent; consumer goods, 21 per cent and materials for further production, 59 per cent.  Of the latter a large amount were used in export industries and therefore figure later in the export figures.  I know that the figures I have given do not add up to exactly 100 <Col N="777" /> because there are one or two minor categories I omitted.  The point I am making is that, side by side with the great increase in borrowing, there has been this remarkable increase in capital creation, that is to say, in investment.</P>
    <P>At the same time as we have this increase in investment, there has been a remarkable increase in consumption. This may be the result of people buying before the imposition of the turnover tax last November.  That would account for a certain amount of urgency in buying possibly, but other figures, retail sales and the number of new cars registered throughout the whole year, show a steady increase in consumption last year.  Both consumption by the public and investment increased during the year.  This great increase in expenditure could be inflationary and could have an adverse effect on the balance of payments.  If the high rate of wages, as I said earlier, were to bring about an increase in cost and if the increase in money incomes were to bring about an increase in consumption there might be pressure on the balance of payment caused by the diminution of exports and increased imports.  It cannot be sufficiently emphasised, even at the cost of repetition, that the crux of the Irish economic situation is the danger to the balance of payments caused by a continuance of inflation.  I do not suggest that inflation as yet has got to the point of being dangerous but there are danger signals.  The rise in income is proceeding rapidly and all that indicates that both costs and consumer incomes in the country are increasing and both types of inflation may possibly be on their way.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the question of where the savings came from to finance all this increased investment, it is satisfactory to know that the Central Bank comes to the conclusion that there was a great increase in savings during the year.  The deposits in the commercial banks&mdash;by that, I mean deposits on deposit account as apart from current account&mdash;failed to rise but there may have been a reason for that not entirely unconnected with the Budget of last year.  But the amount of savings in the Savings Banks, in <Col N="778" /> Saving Certificates and Prize Bonds was higher last year than in the previous year.  This, of course, only represents monetary savings.  There must be a great deal of savings which do not figure anywhere in monetary statistics.  There was a very large amount of savings from abroad.  Investment in Ireland last year was largely financed by inward movement of capital.  The saving was done by foreigners of various countries and the investment was done in Ireland.</P>
    <P>These are all different aspects of saved capital coming into the country and being invested in one way or another.  Therefore, between the entire monetary savings and the import of capital, the vast amount of capital investment which took place here was possible without any diminution in the external savings by Irish holders.  It was therefore entirely satisfactory and did not involve any running down of the accumulated external savings of Irish savers.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay too long on the Report of the Central Bank, but I should like to quote the conclusion to which the report comes to regarding the conditions in the country in 1963. It says:</P>
    <P>The tentative calculations indicate that the recent slackening in the pace of economic expansion has been arrested during 1963 and that the economy is moving ahead encouragingly. When the tentative national expenditure figures are adjusted for the measurably smaller rise in prices generally, an increase from 2.5 per cent in 1962 to about 4 per cent in 1963 emerges in real terms; and the economy has entered 1964 on a promising note of rising industrial exports and production.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in discussing the background of the Estimates, the year 1963 can be given a clean bill.  On the figures published by the Central Bank, we can learn that the country was moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>When we come to the Central Fund Bill, to which the Estimates really apply, the conclusion of the Central Bank regarding the present year is a little less optimistic.  There are two <Col N="779" /> sentences in the Quarterly Bulletin which I shall read:</P>
    <P>The trends disclosed in the preparation of the tentative assessment for 1963, taken by themselves, suggest that 1964, however, will be a more difficult year.  Above all, the continuing and accelerated upward movement in monetary incomes contains serious economic risks, especially as regards external trade and payments.</P>
    <P>That bears out what I have already said and is also corroborated by the Quarterly Report on Ireland published by the Economist Intelligence Unit for February of this year, from which I shall read one sentence:</P>
    <P>Although gross national product will probably rise at an annual rate of more than four per cent in early 1964, prospects for further expansion are uncertain because of the risk of inflation.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank and the Economist Intelligence Unit are agreed on that. Both point to the same danger&mdash;the risk of inflation by rising incomes and rising prices.</P>
    <P>So far I have been dealing with the background against which the Estimates must be studied.  I now come to the Bill itself, which brings the Estimates before the Seanad in the only way the Estimates are in fact brought before us.  Nobody need be surprised at the increase in public expenditure: public expenditure in every country in the world is increasing and therefore the fact that the Estimates for the coming year are higher than last year need not be cause for surprise.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates shows that the amount required in the coming year is £156 million&mdash;£16 million more that the amount in this financial year included in the Estimates, together with Supplementary Estimates.  In order to get the total Government expenditure for the coming year, certain additions must be made to that sum.  The Minister stated in the Dáil that the cost of increased salaries to the public service under the ninth round would come to about £7 million, that the cost of the Central Fund services will be up by £3,500,000, <Col N="780" /> bringing the Central Fund services up to about £33 million.  Grants to the Road Fund will be another £9 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not incorrect to say that the amount required for current expenditure in the coming financial year will be something between £205 million and £210 million.  This is the amount which the Minister will have to find from taxation.  As we all know, the very word &ldquo;taxation&rdquo; must not be mentioned in this debate on the Book of Estimates: this comes later in the debate on the Budget.  However, I risk being told I am out of order by making use of a single sentence to the effect that there is no reason to believe that important additional taxation will be required to balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like to say which is not out of order, I submit, is that the Budget must be balanced.  In other countries, people are arguing in favour of Budget deficits.  In the USA it is the fashionable remedy for the prevailing unemployment that there should be a deficit Budget.  There is nothing in the Irish situation at all that would justify a deficit.  The pointers in this country are all in an inflationary direction and if anything were appropriate to the Irish situation, it would be a surplus rather than a deficit Budget.</P>
    <P>In the United States there is a fear of deflation and therefore a large amount of informed financial public opinion is in favour of deficit budgeting. In the United Kingdom, signs of inflation are appearing and many of the best economic commentators are in favour of a Budget surplus. Whatever may be said for a Budget surplus here, there is nothing to be said for a Budget deficit.  Therefore, it may be said that the total amount for the current services, about £205 million, will have to be met by taxation.</P>
    <P>What our taxation will be will be obvious when we see the Budget next month, and it is not proper for us to discuss it now.  It is outside the scope of this debate.  When we come to capital expenditure, we are largely in the dark about the amount required. The only part of the capital expenditure <Col N="781" /> which we know is the very small part known as voted capital expenditure, that is to say, the capital expenditure which is called &ldquo;above the line expenditure&rdquo;.  When the Budget is introduced, we will be told the Minister's proposals regarding the capital expenditure below the line which will, as it always is, be considerably greater than that above the line.  As far as one can judge from the Estimates, the increase in capital expenditure above the line is justifiable on the ground that it all happens to be for truly productive purposes.  It is of a productive nature.  We hope that, when the capital expenditure below the line is revealed next month, it will also prove to be equally productive in nature.</P>
    <P>I should like to say again what I said earlier today: that this division of capital expenditure between above-the-line and below-the-line is rather out-of-date.  A discussion of public finances would be facilitated if there could be a clear-cut distinction between current expenditure, on the one side, and capital expenditure on the other. There should be a current Budget and a capital Budget.  At the moment the capital Budget is divided into two parts &mdash;the above-the-line capital Budget, which appears in the Estimates we have before us, and the below-the-line capital expenditure which will not be revealed to us until next month.</P>
    <P>That is the position: that we will be expected to find about £210 million of taxation in the coming year and that also we will have to borrow a large but unknown amount to meet the capital expenditure of the Government. That brings me back to the question I asked at the beginning of my speech: are these amounts the country can afford?  I would remind the House of the analogy I drew between the individual and the nation. When one is dealing with an individual one asks the questions: What is his income?  How much of his income is he spending?  On what is he spending it?  Until we have answers to those questions, we do not really know whether that person is conducting his affairs in a prudent manner or not.  It is the same in the case of the nation. <Col N="782" /> We have to ask what is the income of the country.  Are the Government spending at a greater rate than the increase in income and, if so, on what are they spending?  Until we answer those questions, we cannot really say whether the estimates of expenditure are justifiable or not.</P>
    <P>One thing we can say with safety is, without entering into any detailed statistics, that the rate of increase in Government expenditure is greater than the rate of increase in national income.  The national income last year went up by about 4 per cent.  The rate of Government expenditure is going up at a higher percentage than that.  But that, of course, is, as I said, really a sign of the times.  If you take almost any other country in the world you will find the same thing.  Governments are doing more and more today, and to find that the ratio of public expenditure to national income is getting larger is not in itself a condemnation of the financial policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Actually, we all know that between now and this time next year the amount spent by the Government will be more than the amount in the Estimates. Of course, there will be errors of overestimation.  At the same time, we all know that the Supplementary Estimates which will be introduced in the coming year will far outweigh the allowance made for overestimation. Therefore, the amount which will be spent by the Government in the next year will be more than the £210 million to which I have referred.  This is really inevitable.  It is not a matter for which the Government deserve any blame.  It is partly the result of rising prices. Prices are rising in this country and in other countries.  Incomes are rising; costs of all kinds are rising.  Every private individual finds the cost of running his house going up; every businessman finds the cost of running his business going up.  There is nothing exceptional, then, if the Government find the cost of running the public services going up also.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, which was very fully expounded by Senator Dooge today, involves a good deal of Government expenditure.  How much we really <Col N="783" /> do not know, because the Second Programme is still slightly mysterious. We are waiting to get details.  So far we have only had volume one, and until we get volume two, until we know the actual amount to be spent in different directions, we shall not know the true nature of the Second Programme.  However, there is one thing I think it is fairly safe to prophesy: it will involve an increase in Government expenditure of one sort or another.  Therefore, we can answer the first question that the Government are spending a larger fraction of the national income than they spent last year or in previous years.</P>
    <P>The second question is: on what is it being spent?  Is it being spent on something productive, something which will add to the national income of future years; or is it simply being used for redistribution, for social services, for building up the standard of living of classes of people who, for one reason or another, are not able to maintain themselves at a decent standard of living?  The answer to that question must also be hazardous.  It is very largely a matter of opinion.  A good deal of the additional expenditure is of a truly productive nature, As I said earlier, nothing is more productive as an investment than the education of the people.  A good deal of the additional expenditure is on education of one sort or another.  But, as I have also said in this House previously, expenditure of that kind takes a long time to fructify.  In the long run it will, of course, pay dividends, but in the short run it imposes a burden on the taxpayer without any equivalent return.  There is also another type of expenditure which is very much in the same category&mdash;State expenditure on agricultural production.  The increase in the subsidies to agricultural production will in the course of time produce a result; but, as I said already, agricultural production is slow to increase and, therefore, the actual benefits we can receive from this type of expenditure may be rather delayed.</P>
    <P>There are other items in the Estimates which are productive, judged by <Col N="784" /> any standard&mdash;grants to the Export Board, grants to Bord Fáilte.  All these are productive things, which in due course will yield a benefit to the country.  But it must also be admitted that a certain amount of the additional expenditure is of a social kind.  I am not condemning it on that account.  I am not saying a Government should not redistribute national income or should not come to the assistance of the weaker members of the community. But there is a clear-cut distinction, when we are dealing here with the national accounts in a hardheaded way, between expenditure which will yield some sort of monetary return to the State and expenditure which will not yield such a return.  A good deal of the additional expenditure, although perfectly justifiable, will not yield any monetary return.</P>
    <P>When one comes to answer the second question I have asked&mdash;how is the money being spent?&mdash;one can only give conjectural answers.  Some of it is being spent on productive measures and some of it is being spent on socially desirable but non-productive measures.  It is being spent to compensate pensioners for increased wages and prices and to lift the standard of living of the less well-off members of the community.  These are all perfectly proper objects, with which we all agree, but at the same time, looking at it as hardheaded businessmen, these are types of expenditure for which the Government get no immediate return. Therefore, all we can really say is that the share of the national income being spent is increasing and that part of the increase is being spent on socially desirable but unproductive services.</P>
    <P>However, one might express the opinion that current expenditure is within the capacity of the country.  It would be pessimistic for anyone to say the country is living beyond its means. It is perfectly true that expenditure is going up, but many individuals spend more this year than last year without necessarily being imprudent.  On the whole, looking at the picture generally, I think the current expenditure forecast in these Estimates is within the capacity of the country.</P>
    <P>When we come to capital expenditure <Col N="785" /> we are really in the dark.  We do not know what it will be, but I am prepared to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt.  I am prepared to admit that the greater part of that capital expenditure will be productive, possibly in the long run, possibly in a generation or so.  It may be on agriculture or it may be on education that will yield a dividend in the future, but it will impose an increase in the charges for the Central Fund Services in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Here again I hope I am correct in saying that whatever capital expenditure is likely to be undertaken is within the capacity of the Government to borrow.  As I said many times, the country is at the moment a creditor country with an inward movement of money.  There is more money coming into the country than going out, and the capacity of extending credit is being increased.  Therefore, unless the Government do something very wild in the sense of vast increases in expenditure on defence&mdash;of which I do not see any signs at the moment&mdash;we may say that capital expenditure will be within our means.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that I have tried to strike a note of optimism.  I have tried to state that both current and capital expenditure are not excessive taking all the circumstances of the country into account, but I should like to qualify that by saying that these optimistic assumptions depend upon the present trend not being suddenly reversed, In recent years the trend has been favourable to this country, and that any deterioration in the position of the country either at home or abroad&mdash; any increase in our inflation relative to that of other European countries&mdash; might create a dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while I think the Government have every reason to be satisfied with our projected expenditure, I do not think there is any room for complacency. If wages and price movements are allowed to get out of hand, if prices are allowed to go on rising as they have been rising in recent times without any stop, then, of course, a dangerous situation might arise.  If the favourable circumstances which I <Col N="786" /> have described of the inward flow of capital were reversed, or if the purchasing power of our customers abroad were to be interrupted by some slump, if inflation in other European countries were to slow down while ours still went ahead, there would be a very difficult situation in the balance of payments which would not enable the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to be implemented.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dooge pointed out very clearly, the basis of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is that we can tolerate a deficit in the balance of payments.  If we were to find ourselves in a position in which we could not tolerate a deficit in our balance of payments, then the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> would have to be drastically revised. It is accepted as national policy at the moment, and I think everyone approves of it, but it depends on the country being in a healthy condition, and remaining in the healthy condition in which it has been for the past five years.  The Government must admit that to some extent they have been lucky.  The circumstances of the past five years have been favourable to their two programmes, but if the trends suddenly reversed their luck would seem to have turned.  Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to set their face against any additional inflation.</P>
    <P>I should not like to sit down without saying that every advance which we have had in this country cannot be credited to the Government.  The ordinary businessman who has actually run his business, and the ordinary individual worker who has done his day's work, are as much entitled to credit for the advances of the past five years as the Government who have, to some extent, planned them.  I would equally say that any foolish greed either on the part of businessmen or trade unions might upset the policy of the Government.  As Senator Dooge said in his very interesting speech, the Government can control the economy only within limits.  The Government have been rather lucky in the past few years.  World trends have been favourable, and the behaviour of the business people and the trade unionists in Ireland has been reasonable on the <Col N="787" /> whole.  But if those conditions were reversed we might find ourselves in considerable difficulties over which the Government would have no control. Therefore, the future of the country and our capacity to meet the increases in current and capital expenditure, depend not only on the Minister for Finance but on all of us: on every individual and, in particular, on the employers and trade unionists whose duty it is to try to preserve a rational incomes policy in the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill gives power to the Minister to borrow up to £71,172,504 and states that he may &ldquo;issue any securities bearing such rate of interest and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption or otherwise as he thinks fit.&rdquo;  I should be interested to know the rate of interest that would be paid on borrowings of that size.  The interest paid appears to be a big problem.  The Minister has to lend money to local authorities and other people and the rates of interest have to be fixed.  There are low rates of interest to such concerns as the Post Office where the interest rate is 2½ per cent.  The interest rate is also 2½ per cent in our savings banks.  There do not appear to be any complaints about the rates even though it is true that they go back over a long period and it may be that one is entitled to have the position examined to see if the rates are fair.  The masses of the people, perhaps not the people having all the wealth but people having certain savings, at any rate, put their money there and the State have the use of it.  The Minister is in control there, and rightly so, and the money can be put to very useful purposes.  Then money is also put into other places.  It is put into, say, our commercial banks. They pay, I think, a much lower rate of interest except, of course, when the industry is putting in a big sum: in that case the interest rate is raised. That they lend the money again to anybody who wants a loan and is reasonable security for it.  Finally, at the end of the year, they check up to see how they have balanced out for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> I notice that four banks this year published their accounts.  The first bank had a profit of £126,248 after paying all debts, including bad-debts, and paying the shareholders and directors. The second bank had a profit of £376,944.  The third bank had a profit of £49,520 and the fourth bank had a profit of £99,105, making a total of £651,817 between the four banks in profits after paying everything that it was necessary to pay.</P>
    <P>We do not say for a moment that the banks should not work safely and efficiently but were these profits got because of the rates charged on whoever got the money?  A bank is a money institution and profits are made in this way.</P>
    <P>What is the comparison between the bank and the Post Office?  The Post Office is not a profit-making institution. The Post Office Savings Bank is for the benefit of the people who lodge their savings which are available to them any time they require them.  I should like to know what views the Minister has on the comparison between the banks and the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>One portion of our banking institution charges a higher rate of interest for loans.  The people who get a loan have to meet the loan charge whether they have invested in land or in housing. In most cases a person pays back very much more than he borrowed. That applies even in local government. A man builds a house.  The State gives free grants.  Despite the free grants, if a man gets a loan he has to pay 6½ per cent or more on the loan for the house.  He is under a very definite hardship, especially today with rising costs of materials.  The rising costs of materials mean that he needs a bigger loan.  He gets a grant and if he is lucky, he gets a supplementary grant, too, but he pays back nearly twice the amount he got by way of loan.  He is finding that a definite hardship and he complains about it because of the difficulty of meeting the total costs out of his weekly earnings.</P>
    <P>It might be said that earnings have increased, that people got a rise of 12 per cent, and so on, but that does not <Col N="789" /> meet the increased outgoings.  His hardship is much greater than the compensation. The purchasing power of the people in general has been reduced by virtue of the fact that prices have risen.  No matter what small percentage increase a person may have got, and some people did not get 12 per cent, it does not come anywhere near the increase in the cost of living.  Social welfare recipients did not get 12 per cent but they have to meet rising prices with the result that their standard of living is gradually dropping.  That is a serious position.</P>
    <P>The price rise is much more than the 2½ per cent turnover tax imposed since 1st November last and which was introduced in the Minister's last Budget.  In a good many cases, the increase in prices is 12½ per cent.  I know of receipts which show that what was formerly purchased for 20/- was increased in price by a substantial amount&mdash;not 2½ per cent but much nearer to 12½ per cent.  I notice that the Fair Trade Commission are keeping an eye on the matter but I do not see any action.  I have not seen that any step has been taken to keep control in that matter and that is serious for people who have to purchase.</P>
    <P>Is it correct that the public debt at the end of March, 1963, was £506,710,604, which is practically 12 months ago?  Is it correct that we have to finance that debt to the extent of £28 million odd?  Because of the high interest rates for the use of money, it is bound to be a heavy burden and the State has to meet the debt which is increasing each year.  Has the Minister power to take more control in this matter or has the Central Bank power to fix a policy for State finance and the financial position in general?  I should like to know more about the position. The Minister should have power in matters of that kind because the hardship is increasing each year and is bound to continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy in approaching the Estimates for this year to be able to begin by congratulating the Minister on a number of improvements in the Estimates this <Col N="790" /> year over the previous year.  It has proved, I think, that there is some use in raising issues here and in keeping at such issues.  In the past few years I have made a special plea here for private agricultural schools.  I showed that they were not being treated fairly compared with the State agricultural schools and in general had not shared in the previous eighth round increase. I am very happy, therefore, to find in the Estimate that the Minister has more than made up for this and has given increases of the order of about 22 per cent, or so, to these very deserving schools in Pallaskenry, Warrenstown, Gurteen, St. Patrick's, and the others.</P>
      <P>Even with this increase, the Minister and the nation are getting a bargain because one could educate nine students in any of these schools for what it costs to educate one student in any of the State schools.  I do not argue now that the cost is too high in the State schools.  The real point is the marvellous job that is being done in the private agricultural schools.  I advise the Minister to continue the good work he has begun this year, to give something really worthwhile next year; then the nation will be able to sit back, confident that everything is being done to foster the most progressive force we have in the expansion of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item of Government policy that concerns me is the grant to Maynooth College.  There is a sizeable percentage increase this year, an increase of the order of 37½ per cent. Nevertheless, the amount given is a mere pittance and I appeal to the Minister and, through him, to the Government, to make a worthwhile investment in the education given in Maynooth College.  Maynooth should not be left out of the investment in education.  I believe that there we shall get better value per £ invested than anywhere else in our educational system.  From the point of view of international prestige, many of the members of the staff of Maynooth College stand very high in international esteem and are quite capable, if given the tools, of doing even greater work internationally for our reputation, and not merely in science, for which Maynooth is famous anyway, in philosophy, <Col N="791" /> theology, and so on, but also in the arts.  Maynooth is doing a spectacular job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention it in connection with general educational policy.  I believe in making the appeal to the Minister at the first opportunity that offers.  There are other aspects of Government policy which have to be considered.  Building programmes are under way in the universities. The provincial colleges in Cork and Galway are now moving into line and we hope the Government will appreciate the importance of these centres in the general educational framework.</P>
      <P>There are many suggestions I should like to make to the Government in this regard.  First of all, there is little use providing buildings unless the Government also provide the means to enable the colleges to equip and staff the buildings and ensure that the staff are able to give of their best in the service of the nation.  If the Government ensure that, then the staff members, I feel sure, will not be found wanting.  We are disturbed naturally by what seem to be inconsistencies in policy.  Try as we may, we cannot discover from the Book of Estimates or by way of statements from the Ministers concerned the basis on which Government policy operates in regard to grants to universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I think, general acceptance of the principle that, if one produces more, one gets more aid to bring about that increased production.  In University College, Cork, there has been a spectacular increase in the number of students.  Numbers have gone from 1,500 two years ago to 1,700 last year and 1,900 in the current year. That is an increase of almost 30 per cent in two years.  Yet the increase in the grant represents an increase of only 15 per cent.  I suggest the Government should take account of an expansion like that and give appropriate recognition by way of grants. That, of course, will not be enough <Col N="792" /> because, to use the familiar phrase, we have got to close the gap.</P>
    <P>There are a number of gaps.  The most significant is that between Queen's University and ourselves.  The amount provided per student in Belfast, which is on the British scale, is quite spectacular.  On a comparison basis, we are providing only about half as much per student as compared with Belfast. I am leaving out of account the amount given by way of scholarships, and so on.  The amount is far higher in the North.  On the university proper side, it is only half as much.  Therefore, in any planning we do, we should plan very seriously with a view to narrowing the gap and eventually closing it.  A ten-year minimum target should be aimed at for the purpose of closing the gap.  In other words, we should aim at doubling the effective value of the support given to the universities.  That would mean a ten per cent increase per annum over the next ten years. That should not be beyond our resources.  It will, of course, ensure that we will be able to make the full return on the investment in new buildings today.  I suggest these two aspects be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>There is another gap also that the Government should seriously consider closing.  I refer to the gap between Cork and Dublin and Galway and Dublin.  Because of shortage of resources, these places have fallen considerably behind in salaries as compared with the capital.  I doubt if the Government would really like to see these constituent colleges treated as second-class institutions.  That is another problem we should face up to in the next few years, ensuring a rough equality with comparable posts in the capital.  The Minister for Finance should concern himself with that aspect of the matter.  I know the Minister for Education is seriously concerning himself with these points.  We have, indeed, been highly impressed by his dynamic approach to the whole problem.  We look now for big things both from the Minister and from the various committees and commissions that are due to report.</P>
    <P>I think we can say that the nation is firmly convinced that investment in education is one of the best long-term <Col N="793" /> investments we can make.  On that score, the Minister should be congratulated on the successful settlement he has made with both the secondary and primary school teachers over the past year which has given them a considerable increase in position.  That is only as it should be.  I believe the Government appreciate that a contented teaching profession in the primary and secondary schools is the foundation stone for any real advance in education. A very good start has been made there and I suggest to the Minister that he might consider using many of the teachers for holiday surveys in various aspects of the educational structure that may be necessary in the coming years.  This work would be well worth while and work to which teachers could make a substantial contribution. Of course, they should be adequately rewarded for the work they do in such periods.</P>
    <P>Again, I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to see that relations between the Secondary School Teachers Federation and the Government, especially the Department of Education, are put on a more rational basis.  It does no good to have those mutual recriminations that have been a feature of the past couple of years. The Government owe a great debt to the Secondary School Teachers Federation for the valuable pioneering work they have done in compiling information about educational requirements and provisions here and contrasting them with those elsewhere.  It is not good enough for any Department to try to rebut those figures by ridicule. These are serious figures and I suggest they should be treated in a serious way.  If there are loopholes or inconsistencies in them, by all means show them, but treat this work as that of dedicated people who are imbued with the ideal of the advancement of education and who are really doing outstanding service in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge made a very fine speech this afternoon on the Blue Book and the new plan.  I am sure we all look forward to reading this speech which has some excellent analyses and that we shall all find it <Col N="794" /> stimulating and worth while.  I do not intend to go over the ground with which he dealt so comprehensively.  I merely want to take this opportunity of complimenting him on the work he did.</P>
    <P>Turning to the agricultural side of this Blue Book, I must express grave disappointment with this part of the Plan.  Recently a very interesting paper on the Methodology of the Plan by Professor Ryan was read at the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society which shows the cross-checks which were engaged upon.  In fact over 60 groupings in industry were investigated. Full use was made of the CIO reports and, in general, the approach was very logical and straightforward.  However, when it comes to agriculture the same logic does not seem to persist because we find in Professor Ryan's paper the statement that, by and large, the figures taken for agriculture were those given by the Department of Agriculture.  It does say there were some discussions on the figures but we are not left very satisfied that those discussions were adequate.  For one thing, the figure arrived at, 2.7 per cent, is away below any estimate the National Farmers Association or the Agricultural Institute would make of our potential; in other words, it considerably underestimates what we are capable of achieving in agriculture.  To put it another way, it strikes a mean figure that hits the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years our increase has been scarcely one per cent.  Now 2.7 per cent is proposed which, of course, is a substantial improvement on the past ten years.  In fact it is such an improvement percentage wise that I do not think it can be realised unless there is a considerable change psychologically and otherwise in the approach to agriculture.  If we make that psychological change in our approach to agriculture, then we should be able to achieve not 2.7 per cent but four or five per cent, which is really worth while and which would give a real impetus to our economy.</P>
    <P>When I say four or five per cent, I am not talking wildly.  We can go back to the Secretary-General of OEEC who visited this country in 1960 and who in reach of the ordinary farmer.  Then <Col N="795" /> an excellent address gave it as his opinion that where we were falling down on the job in agriculture was that our target was not high enough. He said we had, according to his experts who had studied the situation, the infra-structure necessary for a substantial advance in agricultural production and he felt that if we aimed at four, five or six per cent, we would achieve it.  He would not have made any rash statements with the full authority of OEEC behind him.</P>
    <P>Since then, the Agricultural Institute has got into its stride and produced spectacular achievements.  In their centre they are able to get an average of 500 gallons per acre milk production whereas the normal average is about 140 or 150.  With management, that could easily be brought within the <Col N="796" /> we can look at what England estimates she can do.  Since the war, England has had a spectacular expansion in agricultural production which has increased at the rate of over five per cent per annum.  It might be said she has taken up a great deal of her potential; yet her plan for the period 1964 to 1970 calls for an increase of 3.5 per cent for agriculture.  Therefore, despite the extent to which she has expanded, she proposes to expand percentagewise more than we propose to do in the coming six years.</P>
