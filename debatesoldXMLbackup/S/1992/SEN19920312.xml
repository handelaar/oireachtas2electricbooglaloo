      <P>I have notice from Senator Raftery that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take effective steps to prevent the immediate closure of United Meat Packers.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the coal ban to Bray town and its environs.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to outline the reason for the refusal, by the Attorney General, of legal aid to a prisoner (details supplied) in Portlaoise Prison; and the non-implementation of the Martin report recommendation regarding a Court of Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Raftery, Ross and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Raftery's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Ross and Costello may <Col N="1354" /> give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House, in view of his agreement to a debate on the Greencore issue next Thursday, if he could ensure that copies of the report will be circulated to all in this House who are interested in the matter?  At this point we have not received a copy of the report.  In view of its importance it deserves at least one week's contemplation before we make our contributions on the matter.  Again, with the guidance of the Chair and perhaps of the Leader of the House, I would like an indication how this House could immediately debate the difficulties in the meat industry generally, and particularly in UMP.  I would like to have a constructive debate on it.  It is not a matter of unloading our invective against the banks, the Government or any other party.  There is a real crisis in the cattle industry and UMP is representative of the major problems that exist.  I will be guided on whether we structure a debate on the cattle industry itself, or specifically on UMP.  I ask the Leader of the House to agree to an immediate debate given the urgency of the matter, given the 900 full-time and 600 part-time job losses, and the number of farmers and creditors involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle.  I do not begrudge Senator Raftery the Adjournment, but it is not the appropriate way to discuss such an important issue.  We need to have a debate on the matter.  In the interest of not causing recrimination &mdash; we had enough of it last night &mdash; while I do <Col N="1355" /> not want to push it, Senator O'Keeffe's demand for a debate on the banking system is further highlighted by current events.  There is a considerable amount of documented evidence that Irish banking is bedevilled by short termism and by a definition of long term that only a banker could come up with, which is about five years.  We need to discuss what is happening in the beef industry, what is happening to industry and what is happening in the banking sector.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to let us have a long open debate on these issues.  In particular, we should have a look at our banking system.  Nobody else wants to do it.  The Culliton report left it out.  Most statements on industrial policy barely mention the banks.  Yet, in my view, they are the major inhibitors to many enterprises.  The subject needs to be dealt with.  I invite Senator O'Keeffe to use whatever influence he has with the Leader of the House and with the Government so that they will allow us to have a debate on the banking system as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cathaoirligh. I think I might have coined the phrase myself and if I can add a little political slogan which was attached to our party once &ldquo;now more than ever&rdquo; it is appropriate that we have a debate on the &ldquo;O'Keeffe initiative&rdquo;.  The banks are at the centre of the problem in the west and it is imperative that action be taken to prevent an appalling tragedy being visited on this very underdeveloped part of the country.  Unless people begin to think of the food industry in the long term, and in particular the meat industry, we are going to stumble from one crisis to another, like those we are experiencing this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion on the Adjournment, but this matter is much too serious and requires much greater <Col N="1356" /> and more detailed attention than can be given to it on the Adjournment.  In view of the fact that there are 900 permanent jobs involved, that some people are owed £1.5 million, and because of the enormous consequences of the closure of the UMP plants, would the Leader of the House agree that it would be better if this matter were dealt with by statements rather than by a full debate?  Indeed, that would fulfil the requirements set out in Standing Order 29 as to a matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration.  I am sure we could defer Item 2 &mdash; statements on the cost of motor insurance &mdash; because of the urgency of this matter. The time would be better spent dealing with this immediate problem so that we can air the matter in this House.  If this House is to mean anything and is to be relevant to the people, this is precisely the sort of issue we should be discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in regard to the milk agency Bill?  A number of producers are worried about the delays and they are anxious to get this legislation enacted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the debate on the meat industry, I am the first to agree that the Adjournment debate is not adequate, but it could be regarded as an entreé for the meal we would have subsequently.  We should not rush into a major debate without an in-depth look at the facts.  We should look at what we think should happen.  We are not fully appraised of all the facts here today.</P>
      <P>Finally, I support the call made several times for a debate on broadcasting.  I am appalled that TV licence payers and the taxpayers' money was used to pay a coke-sniffing prostitute from Florida to air her views publicly and to crucify the wife and family of the man who was responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All right.  I will rephrase it &mdash; to interview a lady of ill repute.  I am not naming the lady.  I do <Col N="1357" /> not know her name.  We all know who we are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my support to the calls for a discussion on United Meat Packers.  I would appeal to the Leader to consider making time for this debate, at the latest, next week.  I also want to raise the matter that we are discussing this afternoon &mdash; that is, motor insurance.  I am not aware if the time limits he proposes have been agreed with the Whips but, as far as I am concerned, they are totally inadequate.  I find that either 15 minutes or ten minutes will not enable me to make a worthwhile contribution on this issue, particularly as I regard the action of the insurance industry as being an attempt to twist a very worthwhile report by Coopers and Lybrand into a whitewash of their performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I am simply saying that to have an objective and worthwhile discussion on this issue, as far as I am concerned, either 15 minutes or ten minutes are totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on UMP next week.  The organisation caters for 20 per cent of one of our major industries &mdash; the meat industry which is vital to our economy.  There are 900 families traumatised with regard to their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Leader when the Minister for Justice intends bringing in his promised Bill to decriminalise suicide.  The previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, gave a commitment to the House on 27 November <Col N="1358" /> to introduce a Bill before last Christmas.  In view of the recent Supreme Court judgement, this has become more urgent.  The Supreme Court found that a pregnant woman who is suicidal may have an abortion legally in the Republic. It is cruel and uncivilised that a person in such a position who attempted to commit suicide could be prosecuted.  I ask the Leader, as a matter of urgency, to bring the views of the House to the Minister for Justice.  The promise given to and taken in good faith by this House should be honoured by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make representations to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and to the Ministers dealing with the negotiations in the court this morning on behalf of small farmers who put cattle into UMP and who have received cheques &mdash; I have a list of the names of small farmers in Donegal who are in serious difficulty having put in cattle to United Meats Packers after this document was published.  The cheques are under the protection of the court.  Those farmers put in the cattle in good faith. This is a separate issue from the serious problem we have here.  They put in the cattle having seen the advertisement in <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> which stated that the agreement with the Examiner and the United Meat Packers group was legally binding and guaranteed that the sale of livestock would be paid for as normal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when we can expect the Green Paper on Education.  We did not have an opportunity to discuss or debate educational issues during the last session.  I would like to know what are the Minister's views on bringing equity to the third level grant system.  If we do not have the Green Paper soon another session of university life will begin without any effort being made by the Government to do something about the inequity within that system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Dardis regarding the meat industry. I do not think a debate next week is adequate or, indeed, is addressing the matter.  The facts are that by next Monday this operation could be wound up in the High Court.  It is a matter of urgency.  The call by Senator Dardis for a debate under Standing Order 29 is a reasonable approach to the crisis which affects County Roscommon and other counties; the closure of UMP affects 900 workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want speeches.  There will be plenty of opportunity to talk about this.  You have made your point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been elaborated on by Senator McGowan that not alone does it affect the families working in UMP but it affects the families who have sent their cattle to UMP.  This is a national crisis.  We should have a debate today because we are not sitting tomorrow. I am asking that the suggestion of Senator Dardis be taken on board.  If this House is to address itself to something of national importance and to redress its image as a talking shop, a debate today on the cattle and beef crisis is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to those who have spoken about the UMP issue.  I come from County Mayo and given that UMP have their headquarters in Ballyhaunis, this crisis is having a very negative and unacceptable impact.  I ask the Leader to take on board the consensus <Col N="1360" /> that we should have a debate in the Seanad on this issue.  As Senator Finneran pointed out, it is not just the 900 jobs that are affected.  It is the whole fabric of rural Ireland through the input of the farmers and everything else.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach has allowed Senator Raftery an Adjournment debate on this issue.  While this might be an entrée to a wider debate, it does not answer the needs for a wider debate. Since the Receiver is moving in today, we will probably be much better informed on this issue within days.  Why not consider postponing next week's Greencore debate?  That debate is, of course, crucial, but at this stage it is of historical interest.  It is not as pertinent as UMP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You made your point Senator, and I am sure the Leader will take in on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House should also take on board the view that we should have a full day debate: we should postpone the Greencore debate for a week or two to allow an urgent debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>There are two other issues.  I asked the Leader to arrange a debate on regional development in the west.  I pointed out that in recent months huge meetings arranged by the bishops have been held to discuss these issues.  Regional development is now more topical than ever in view of this catastrophe in the agriculture sector which is hurting the west more than any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to add my voice to those who have spoken about the appalling programme on Ben Dunne shown on RTE two nights ago.  I would like to make two or three comments.  I have never met the man; but he has been vilified enough.  He has to face the courts in America.  If the punishment is supposed to fit the crime, he has been punished already.  The prurience we see in the Irish media lately is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have made your point.  Unfortunately, we have no say over television programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;descending to &ldquo;News of the World&rdquo; standards.  That this standard is now being followed by a State television Authority is unfortunate and regrettable.  Since we are supposed to have control over RTE, I think something should be done about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Dardis and others have said about the urgency of having a debate on United Meat Packers.  I believe it would be appropriate today, because today is the day the Receiver will probably be sent in.  I had considered proposing an amendment to the Order of Business along those lines.  Senator Hederman indicated that she would second this.  In deference to the workings of the House and the fact that the Order of Business for today was agreed, I will not do so because I think it would be obstructive.  I would also have been happy to move a motion under section 29 but perhaps somebody on the other side of the House might move a section 29 motion in order to get it discussed today.  If they would like me to do it and let them off the hook, I certainly will.  I have no problem with that.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Neville's request that the Government bring forward speedily a suicide Bill.  You, Sir, know there was an excellent debate on the question of suicide initiated by Senator Neville some months ago.  We were given an undertaking that a Bill would be introduced.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I refer to item No. 48 on the Order Paper?  It asks that no Government representation should be present at the St. Patrick's Day Parade until the discriminatory attitudes expressed by the organisers cease.  Would the Leader convey this proposal very strongly to the Government, especially in the light of the news this morning that Mr. Joe Doherty, a convicted IRA hitman, is to be made the honorary grand marshal of the parade.  It puts the discrimination in perfect context, as far as I am concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support what <Col N="1362" /> Senator Dardis said.  It is clear that there is a consensus emerging in this House that UMP should be dealt with today. Unfortunately, on too many occasions, we find ourselves debating after the event.  At the very least, there should be a beginning here this afternoon by having a discussion on this very important matter.  There are too many jobs involved in the company itself.  The effects on the local economy are enormous.  Bearing that in mind, a Chathaoirligh, with your permission we wish to move the Adjournment of the Seanad, under Standing Order 29, to debate the future of UMP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will submit a motion to you in writing this morning to move the Adjournment under Standing Order 29, so that this matter can be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to lend my voice to the calls for a full debate on United Meat Packers.  There is no doubt but that this is a very critical time.  There is not much sense having a debate after the Receiver has gone in.  This is tremendously important in relation to jobs in the west in particular.  It is also extremely important because UMP is the second largest meat processing concern in the country.  In fact, its closure would result in Goodman having the monopoly in the beef business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be proper and right if we could change the Order of Business, and if the Leader of the House <Col N="1363" /> is willing to do so.  There is a consensus in the House that we should do so to avoid a section 29 motion.  Rather than having it brought in in that form, it would be better if, having heard from all sides, we could by consensus have the debate today.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader of the House any furthere information about the progress of the Nicky Kelly case?  Is the Minister for Justice making a statement on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also very interested in the beef crisis because we have a factory in Charleville which is affected.  I too would welcome a debate on that issue.  I find it extraordinary, however, that, given the amount of debate here this morning, there was only one request for a debate on the Adjournment.  I would have thought it more appropriate for the Whips to have come together before the Order of Business and made some arrangement pertinent to an issue that is of such major importance.  The closure of UMP will affect the jobs of 900 people. In the circumstances and in view of the business being ordered today, could I suggest that rather than having the Adjournment debate at 4 p.m. he would organise a two hour debate from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.?  That would go some way to meet the requests made in this House.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the Taoiseach has appointed a Minister with responsibility for Rural Development, would the Leader allow a debate on rural development that would take into account the Leader programme and other structural programmes for rural development?  It would give Senators who expressed concern over a long number of months with regard to development in rural Ireland an opportunity to put forward their views in greater detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a subject which was touched on by Senator Norris. Will the Leader convey the concern of a large number of Members of this House that the Government will be sending representatives to the St. Patrick's Day <Col N="1364" /> Parade in New York and to the parade in San Francisco&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the Order Paper, Item No. 48.  There is concern because the Grand Marshal of the New York parade is an alleged member of the Provisional IRA, and that other alleged members of the Provisional IRA will be taking charge of other St. Patrick's Day parades.  There is a real danger that a false signal will go out from Ireland to emigrants if representatives of the Government are standing shoulder to shoulder with people who have been asked to wear black armbands because of the activities of the Provisional IRA and those who are in charge of the St. Patrick's Day parade.  The Leader of the House might ask the Government to consider not sending any representatives overseas if the people organising the parades are acting in this manner which is, after all, supporting terrorist groups.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on the UMP issue.  Without going into detail I think that if the suggestion that we wait until things develop was accepted we would wind up closing the stable door after the horse had bolted. Working in the west, I know the devastating effect it will have if the company ceases trading, even for a short period. We will not know the full facts until it is too late.  I, therefore, think there should be a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this House is to be relevant to the day-to-day affairs of this country, we have to debate things as they are happening, and not always be debating <i>post factum.</i>  Other debates were lined up, particularly the debate on banking, and it is a pity to defer them but even if it means deferring the debate on motorcar insurance, I ask that this matter be debated today.  To put it in perspective, what may happen in the west of Ireland would be equivalent to ten times the <Col N="1365" /> number of jobs lost in a city the size of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I support the request for an early debate on the UN peacekeeping. There are varying opinions on when it should take place but at the moment we are probably not fully aware of all the facts.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to grant such a debate.  I thank him for santioning a debate on Greencore but we would be willing to defer that to faciliate a debate on the meat industry.</P>
      <P>In relation to the time limit on Item No. 2, I appeal to the Leader to leave the debate more open-ended having regard to the information revealed recently about 75,000 motorists currently uninsured. It is a serious matter and the debate, if necessary, should be carried forward to another day.</P>

      <P>I was going to elaborate on that.  Two items have been arranged. One is the UMP issue pending at the moment and the other is a debate on the entire beef industry.  There is a commitment to deal with both.  In the past year the former Leader and I have always tried to accommodate the House.  We will sit next Wednesday and Thursday and should the need arise we will certainly facilitate the House to make further statements or to have a debate.</P>
      <P>There is a definite commitment to a debate on the banks but with industrial action pending and labour relations problems it would not be appropriate now to speak on that issue.  I will come back to the Seanad about the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill.  I have been making inquiries and I hope within the next couple of weeks we will have Committee Stage on that Bill.</P>
      <P>On the public broadcasting debate, I made my own views on the programme in question clear yesterday.  There is one comment I would like to make.  I understand the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications will announce a new complaints commission soon.  I note in the papers today that RTE admitted to an amount of public concern about that programme.</P>

    <P>I have dealt with motor insurance.  I will come back to the Senator with dates on which we might deal with the Green Paper on Education.  On rural and <Col N="1367" /> regional developments, I gave a commitment yesterday to hold a debate on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation legislation gives us an opportunity to look at the state of the nation.  I regret we do not yet have the Minister in the House. The country has been exposed to a much lauded new political beginning in recent weeks and I would like to wish everyone concerned well.</P>
      <P>Polls indicate there is 53 per cent satisfaction rate with the Government at this time, which leads me to wonder who comprises that 53 per cent.  Are they the beef producers who are finding it extremely difficult to find purchasers for their finished animals?  Are they drawn from the ranks of the beef workers whose long term job prospects in this industry are not that rosy, if we are to contemplate the state of the industry at present?  Are the taxpayers over-enthused at the Greencore affair, or the Telecom affair or the Carysfort scandal?  Are the 53 per cent satisfied citizens drawn from the ranks of the 300,000 unemployed?  When we talk about 300,000 unemployed people, we must remember that unemployment touches almost one million people if we are to consider the average family size in this country; unemployment can have a traumatising effect on the extended family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the satisfied citizens are not touched by the long waiting lists for health services.  They may all be fit and are not concerned with long waiting lists for <Col N="1368" /> hospital services and orthopaedic operations. They are probably not on the waiting list for ophthalmic operations, removal of cataracts, or dental care or on the outrageously long and slow moving waiting list for orthodontic treatment with the health boards.</P>
    <P>Many people in this country appear to have adopted a posture of whistling past the churchyard; they do not seem to feel the depressing vibes that are widespread. There is a deeper recession and a greater shortage of finance in this country than most people would care to admit.  We have an internal relations problem with the commercial banks at present, and surely those working in banks at all levels have an opportunity to appreciate the economic viability of individuals and of industries.  I hope the Government will take an early interest in this dispute and endeavour to bring the sides together to save the country a bank strike.  During the bank strikes over the past 20 years many people found themselves in severe financial difficulties when the banks reopened.  I deplore any dispute which diminishes the control banks are able to exercise on the accounts of ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>The situation is confusing at present. If we look at unified Germany, dozens of top class companies internationally known and respected in manufacturing industry are experiencing trading difficulties which must have consequences for the German economy.  Since we joined the European Community 18 years ago as a nation we have been content to look on our German colleagues mainly as the paymasters of Europe.  That day is fast disappearing as all of Europe has undergone changes over the past 12 or 18 months which will affect the mentality of the German people and the German Government.</P>
    <P>The Germans are wrestling with the problem of integrating 16 million people, formerly from East Germany and placing their living and working conditions on a par with the rest of west Germany which will cost a lot of money and necessitate infrastructural development.  Germany despite its economic power can no longer <Col N="1369" /> continue to make the same contribution to the coffers of Europe that it has been making for the past 25 or 30 years.  We must acknowledge that and change our policies accordingly.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a redefinition of major national policies for our new Government.  It is not sufficient for us to presume that the policies this Government may or may not have been elected on a couple of years ago continue to be valid or that they are adequate to meet future challenges.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has not been at such a low ebb since the thirties.  There is great uncertainty as markets continue to be affected by quota restrictions and contracts. Young farmers beginning their careers doubt if they can make a livelihood from the land.  The return on capital gets smaller and smaller and this spring a huge crisis has befallen cattle finishers or beef producers.  Many farmers in my area have between 50 and 100 fat cattle of 14, 15 or 16 hundredweight daily getting so fat that the price per pound will be reduced and they cannot find a buyer for them.  What are they going to do with them?</P>
    <P>We have been exposed to the beef inquiry for many months and rather than clear up the situation, it is sowing seeds of distrust among people dependent on the beef industry.  If UMP close down the number of factories and buyers available to trade in this area will be significantly diminished and the price of beef will plummet.  When the Easter lamb becomes available in a few weeks time the number of buyers will diminish further. One wonders if anyone will have the money to pay for the cattle, sheep, pigs or other livestock.  That is a harrowing and difficult possibility.  The cattle trade is difficult to understand given that suck calves or calves two or three days old command practically a third of the price of a finished fat beast.  The situation is absurd.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to blame the Minister for Agriculture and Food when farmers themselves cannot see the need for fair play.  The milk farmers who traditionally have been the best organised seem to be <Col N="1370" /> in a dominant position and certainly call all the shots.  They have survived probably because they have access to a cash flow unlike farmers in other husbandries.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister for Agriculture and Food redefine his policies on the future of the agriculture industry over the next few years.  Farmers are fast running out of crops to sow because of quotas and restrictions.  There is difficulty in the beet sector this year due to a protracted row between beet growers and Greencore, because Greencore over the years have not paid the farmers for all of the sugar extracted; they renege on payments for sugar extracted from the crowns or the tare of the beet.</P>
    <P>Years ago my own farm delivered beet to Thurles and Carlow; Thurles sugar factory was operating then.  I have two farms a few miles apart, one of them in the Thurles area and the other in the Carlow area.  As loading dockets came in the practice was to load up beet from wherever one had it and to deliver it on the loading date.  I delivered beet from the same field to both factories on different dates and the taring standards in the factories were significantly different, which means that even five or ten years ago the Irish Sugar Company, as it was then, were doing the farmers out of their entitlements.  There can be a 7 or 8 per cent difference in the amount of tare which is clay or tops that a company will acknowledge.  That gives a different price per ton, so that it was hit and miss with Carlow and Thurles sugar factories during the years.</P>
    <P>Since there is over-production in practically all food crops in this country it is time for the Government to look seriously at the introduction of non-food crops.  Apart from my own particular interest in reproduced sources of energy, a number of farmers in Donegal have been growing flax, which is a non-food crop and I wonder if they have been getting the support they were entitled to expect.  The Commissioner and those who comment on the Common Agricultural Policy talk about wine lakes or butter mountains and here we have a group of farmers endeavouring to revive <Col N="1371" /> a high quality industry which could be brought back to the glory it reached in the last century and in the earlier part of this century.  However, I doubt if those flax growers got maximum support.</P>
    <P>The OECD say that by the year 2018 the known recoverable resources of fossil fuels worldwide will have expired.  The technology is available to us to grow rapeseed or sunflowers here.  Rape-seeds would be the easiest to grow and could be substituted for imported diesel oil. I think the Department of Finance are nervous in case they lose out on the duty paid on hydrocarbons.  We could look at this possibility from the point of view of import substitution, it would take about 350,000 acres to replace diesel oil imports in Ireland.  Beet contracts amounted to something like 90,000 acres last year.  A large acreage of cereals is sown annually yet profit margins are being restricted year in year out making it hard for cereals to compete with the cheap import substitutes.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee for the continuation of traditional Irish agricultural practices of recent decades, which is why I would like the Minister for Agriculture and Food to redefine policy and to take a stand in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, in co-operation with the Minister for Energy, on the whole question of non-food crops.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Agriculture and Food explain how a country with 300,000 people registered unemployed can still afford to import over £30 million worth of carrots and potatoes?  These two crops can be sown, not just in any field but in any cottage plot or garden in Ireland. There are many questions to be answered here.</P>
    <P>For some years we had a junior Minister with responsibility for Horticulture. The Government, to give them their due, set up An Bord Glas to encourage the production of high-class vegetables in order to reduce importation.  Despite the expensive infrastructure of An Bord Glas the value and the volume of imports since that board was set up appear to have increased.  The Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1372" /> and Food should turn his mind to this matter and give us some suggestions on redressing that situation.</P>
    <P>Job creation must surely be high on the agenda of everyone concerned for the future of this country, whether for youth or for the development of our economy. In 1957 the Industrial Development Authority was established and I wonder how often that Authority has been able to introduce new ideas or encourage people to provide employment opportunities. In Abbeyleix, we have been told that one of two factories in the town, Manchester Tools, will close down this summer after ten years.  That is a huge blow to a small town with a population of 1,200 or 1,500.  I have not seen any great efforts by the Industrial Development Authority or the regional authority to help or propose an alternative.  This makes one feel that the statutory authorities seem incapable of doing anything to present the demise of these factories. This factory has been in operation for ten years.  I wonder if they stayed on only while the grant aid or tax concessions were in place?  If that is so, it is a bad basis for industry and there should be an investigation into why we are losing factories once those concessions cease.</P>
    <P>I know it is inappropriate to talk about tax under the Appropriation Bill, and I would like to keep off that, However, the incentives the Minister for Finance announces from time to time should be looked at.  Perhaps there should be a little more flexibility.  It is important to have industry and job opportunities in the smaller towns and rural areas to endeavour to keep people in their native areas. I admit it is not easy and I know we must compete, but I am convinced that we have the potential to do so.  There is a fairly high standard of education here and our labour force are capable of producing the highest quality products that should be able to compete with our European counterparts if the environment is right, where we have access to almost 400 million customers.</P>
    <P>This Government say they are making a new beginning and I would hope they accept the challenge a new beginning <Col N="1373" /> offers, especially in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>In a small provincial town like Abbeyleix, with the prospect of one of only two factories closing down, much sadness and uncertainty are brought to a considerable number of workers and their families.  I would like to see a sharper response from organisations such as the IDA who are paid to help in industrial development. There should also be some equality in the amount of aid the authorities can offer. It is a bit of a nonsense that there is such a discrepancy in the amount of grant aid available from one location to another. Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce might look seriously at that point.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a few points on the Appropriation Act.  We have a number of important debates coming up, especially on the Culliton report, and I should like to avail of that opportunity to go more in-depth into the whole area of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think this country must grasp the nettle of reality.  We must face the difficult issues.  I earnestly appeal to the Government, and to the Minister present, to have as part of the new beginning at least one policy &mdash; that there will be no more Irish solutions to typical Irish problems.  We must be realists.</P>
    <P>In 1993 we will be in open competition with both producers and consumers in a community of around 400 million people. To give our people the best possible protection we must have a level playing field. We have the opportunity to produce the finest top quality food products.  We have a highly skilled and well educated workforce that compares more than favourably with that of any other country in greater Europe.  Therefore our goods should be able to stand four square beside anything else that goes on offer.  If we are realists and face every problem openly and squarely, then I think there is some hope for us in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the Seanad. He is no stranger here.  He always has made a very helpful contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> I join with other Senators in saying a few words on the Appropriation Act, which covers a wide range of Government activities.  May I refer breifly to my colleague, Senator McDonald?  He wondered where the 53 per cent who support the new Government come from. I would venture to say that they come from the plain people of Ireland, who had no difficulty arriving at that decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new confidence which is in the country, especially among the young people, who will be the inheritors of the prosperity we achieve.  It is remarkable that while the world is in recession and unemployment is high, this country's economy has stood the test and we have achieved remarkable progress.  I come from a Border county, and I feel a great sense of pride that the economy of the little patch I represent is better than the economy across the Border which was always the envy of the people who looked across the Border at the industrial development there.  We were always the poor relation, with high unemployment. Everybody was confined or condemned, whichever word you want to use, to the land.  Whether the small farm was economically viable or not, the family had to stay on the farm to survive.  I am delighted that now, under almost every heading, we are now able to stand on our own feet economically.</P>
    <P>The education and training of our young people compare favourably. Workers' pay and social welfare benefits also compare well and in some cases are higher right across the board.  To my great pleasure I see people from across the Border coming to Donegal to try to qualify for the pension and to live with relations.  That is a complete turnaround.</P>
    <P>However, I am not going to say that we are living in Utopia and that we do not have problems.  We certainly do have problems that need to be solved and they can be solved by educating our young people, by more training programmes and by encourging people to believe in themselves.  This is what this new Government have now achieved.  The youth and the people of rural Ireland have a new confidence in themselves. <Col N="1375" /> That is exactly what is required, because nobody believes the Government can press a magic button and everything will be all right.  That is not the situation.</P>
    <P>Progress will be achieved by people on the ground who believe in what they are doing, who have confidence in themselves and in their country, and who have the commitment to set up industries, large and small, providing employment for two, three or ten people.  It is a bonus if you get a factory employing 100 or 900 people but you accept that the world recession and economic factors outside our control here represent a risk to large numbers of employed people in your town.  It is a very traumatic experience when one of those industries close down. However, we have to keep our little ship on course and look to home-based industries, whether it be farming, fishing, tourism or craft industries.  We must have the self-confidence to say: we are as good as the Germans, we are as good as the Americans, we are as good as the British, and in some cases we are better.  Why should we have people coming from Taiwan, India, Japan or anywhere else to show us how to achieve success and provide a living for our families on our own little patch?</P>
    <P>It is all about confidence.  I was pleased and thrilled to be at our party conference at the weekend.  The atmosphere there uplifted and encouraged those people from rural Ireland who attended that conference. They will go back to their areas and encourage their friends to spread the message that believing in oneself is part of being successful.  If anybody does not accept that philosophy they are not going to go anywhere.  It is as simple as that. As one stage we had very low level of confidence in ourselves.  We felt we could not make anything good in Ireland, that it had to be imported.  There was a slogan in the UK that anything they could not sell they would paint green and send it to Paddy.  We have long got past that psychological barrier.  We are now talking as a people who have potential, who have a clean and green island, who have a future, but we have to educate ourselves <Col N="1376" /> and train ourselves and get our economy right.  I believe the economy has been well managed by the Government and that we have major opportunities now as a full partner in Europe.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters I want to cover in this debate.  First, I want to highlight one of the problem areas.  How can you have the economy right and have everybody in well paid jobs if you are spending millions of pounds per day on Border security?  That is a tragedy.  I know the extent of the problem.  This week it was no great joy for me to listen to the news and to see my county of Donegal being flashed all over Europe and the world, to see the rerun of all the pictures of the guns, the bombs and so on.  This is devastating for Bord Fáilte and the tourism organisations trying to sell the west of Ireland, trying to create jobs and and stimulate industry.  How can you support a tourist industry if pictures of the bombs and guns are being flashed on every television set in Europe and in America?  It is an impossible task.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is one of the areas where we would have high hopes of providing jobs.  My party were totally committed to developing tourist potential to the extent that we set up in Killybegs in Donegal a hotel training and catering college that is turning out about 500 well trained students every year.  It is not a luxury; it is basic for the potential and future of my county, and I believe we have been correct in setting up that training college.</P>
    <P>It would not help and I would be wasting my time asking the Provisional IRA: what have you achieved in the 25 years? I certainly see it at first hand and can reply: you have achieved nothing for my county; you have achieved nothing for any of the Border counties.  For those people who are not familiar with the current situation on the ground, there are seven major British military bases surrounding my county on the northern side while on the west is the Atlantic Ocean. My county has been made an island &mdash; the most desolate and peripheral part of Europe &mdash; by the Provisional IRA.  We cannot develop our potential, our scenic <Col N="1377" /> value, our hospitality and our training in how to cater and look after people. People are frightened.  Even many people in the south say &ldquo;I will not go up north. If you go to Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan or Dundalk you are in the danger area.&rdquo; That is what the Provisional IRA have achieved in 25 years for the Irish people. I would not be honest, straight or fair in this Chamber if I did not say that.</P>
    <P>It is long past the appeal stage, because this is an unstoppable campaign by paramilitaries and by the godfathers who keep it going.  But the vast majority of Irish people &mdash; leaving the British people and the British Prime Minister out of it &mdash; would never accept that the way to achieve a united Ireland is by bombing and by killing people.  The murder campaign that is going on will never, in my humble opinion, achieve anything.  I am as close to the Border scene as anybody. I see the sandbags, the barbed wire, the gates that close at 12 midnight and the cunning, clever British soldiers who use every excuse to close a gate.  If poor patients are on the way back from Dublin driving through the North, there is a gate on the main road locked the same as if you were locked in a farmyard.  That is what they have achieved in 25 years.  How can we invite tourists, how can we print a colour brochure and hope anyone would take it seriously, when we are swamped by pictures of barbed wire, bombed buildings, and of the ambulances and stretchers bringing people to hospital? They are giving the impression that it is a place not to touch.</P>
    <P>That is the biggest cancer we have in this country because it is costing millions of pounds &mdash; it is certainly in excess of £200 million, which is £4 million a week on Border security.  Some of those same people come across the Border to Donegal to draw the dole.  They then tell us how to run the Government and that we are not doing enough for the unemployed, that we are not building enough houses, that we are not building enough roads.  We could build roads and houses, water, sewerage and sanitary facilities and this country could be a great country if they would go back to where they came <Col N="1378" /> from and allow the legitimate democratically elected Government to run the country.  Ninety-nine per cent of the people support that approach.  Until the paramilitary IRA stop, this country will still be struggling to survive, will be looking for special aid and special conditions from Europe and assistance of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>We must focus on the real problem. The real problem, as I see it, is the fact that those people continue to believe that they are performing some kind of a heroic role, that they will go down in history as the people who achieved a united Ireland.  I believe that they will not.  The tombstones, the flags, the banners and the charade are taking us nowhere.  I would be totally dishonest if I did not publicly express my honest convictions here.  More people in the country have to say that we will not be able to sustain the security that is necessary for people to walk about and sleep safely in their beds and at the same time develop our country.  That has to be said and understood.</P>
    <P>The Border counties have many difficulties. There is a third level college in Letterkenny which was built to cater for 500 students but has 1,200 students.  We have to ask the Government and the EC to support a development programme for an extension to that college.  The programme which we have submitted to the Department of Education for Government financing will cost about £10 million. We cannot continue to train and accommodate 1,200 to 1,400 young people in a third level college intended to accommodate 500 students.  We are working at the moment in Letterkenny on two campuses &mdash; the regional college and part of a building rented in St. Conan's Hospital.  That is totally unsatisfactory. I have to keep saying that we have a special case in that part of the county because of our many difficulties. I hope that the EC, the Department of Finance and the Department of Education will recognise that there is a benefit to be obtained by investing money in education and training and that my county has a valid case in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Recently I attended a meeting of the bishops that was called in Sligo.  I went there with enthusiasm, expecting that we were all going to get together to contribute and that we were all going to do something positive.  I was disillusioned when the first speaker was a bishop and that there were selected people who in my opinion had an attitude but had nothing to contribute, no experience. They started off by talking about health cuts.  They did not know what they were talking about because in fact there were no health cuts.  They talked about crime in rural areas.  They talked about bad roads.  It was a general gripe.  It was a tragedy, because it further disillusioned the people who were there and who were anxious to contribute.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the North Western Health Board since last November. The greatest surprise I ever got in my 32 years as a public representative was to discover that the North Western Health Board, covering Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal and having a population of under 200,000, are getting £120 million of State funds for their health services. This has increased every year since 1987. The amount of money going to the North Western Health Board is greater than the funding going into the three local authorities, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, to administer all the other services.  We have people who expect to be believed when they stand up and say that the health cuts are destroying the country. They start to pull out the old chestnuts, the old clichés, and talk about the cuts in the health services that do not exist and never existed in the North Western Health Board.  I want to take this opportunity to say here that I am pleased that in very difficult circumstances, in tight financial times, in a recession affecting many other countries, the Government have been able to provide £120 million to sustain and support the health services in the North Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>My county could do with more funds for roads and for housing.  We must continue to highlight how important it is to have funding provided for national <Col N="1380" /> primary routes.  For the development of industry, whether it is the tourism industry or the fishing industry in Killybegs or Burtonport, national and primary routes are fundamental.  My county has an ongoing difficulty in finding sufficient funds.  The same must be said of the allocation for housing.  While my county gets the second highest allocation in the country, we have a problem and we have a substantial waiting list for housing.  That was not caused by the lack of initiative or by the lack of campaigning.  It was caused by having a manager in my county for 15 to 20 years who, when it was blatantly obvious that we should build 50 houses, built ten.  We accumulated a serious backlog in housing to the point where we now have a housing crisis in my county.  We have to convince the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance and the Government in general that there are special circumstances and a special problem in my county, not created by neglect of Government but by nobody other than ourselves and I hope we will have sufficient funding in the future to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>As regards the International Fund for Ireland, we must express our gratitude to Canada, Australia, America and all those countries who contribute to the fund. However, the administration of the fund is far from satisfactory.  Two-thirds of the funding goes to the North of Ireland.  I accept that.  It is very hard to see development plans for projects being approved for funding in the North while similar projects and plans are turned down in County Donegal.  The people in Donegal find that very hard to take.  I will not deal with this issue in great depth because I hope those who administer the fund will see that the procedures they use are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>In the North one can buy derelict sites and have them classified as bombed sites and one can get £75,000 to develop such a site.  That cannot be done in County Donegal or in a Border county.  It is a bit of a racket.  I could give details of people who have made a lucrative business out of picking up such sites.  They receive <Col N="1381" /> £75,000 for each site to begin with, and they can use it for development.  The International Fund for Ireland is not administered satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Recently the Buncrana Harbour Commissioners, of which I am a member, applied to the international fund for a support grant of £7,000 for the harbour at Buncrana.  They were refused on the grounds that since they were a statutory organisation, the international fund did not cover them.  I reminded the directors and administrators of the fund that they gave £100,000 to enable a study to be carried out in relation to an airport at Eglington which is administered by Derry City Council which is also a statutory organisation.  That was blatantly unfair.</P>
    <P>I and others in the Border counties are very unhappy about the way the fund is administered.  I will not give details of all the cases but in one instance an architect submitted plans for six projects, one in Donegal and five in the North.  The Northern projects received aid from the fund but the one in Donegal did not.  I do not know the political implications but I compliment some of the political leaders in the North who successfully influenced the directors of the international fund and led them to believe that all funding should be spent in the North.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago when the directors of the fund came to Ireland they were instructed to meet everybody in County Derry from the play school group to the bishop.  They made three social calls to my county.  They visited two pubs and Glenveagh National Park.  They were directed to those places by very prominent public representatives who represent a constituency in the North of Ireland.  I am not tempted to mention names, but I am not very happy about it. When the directors of the fund came from America to visit the north-west, it was stated that they were coming to see what the fund had achieved on the ground.  Sad to say, no elected public representative in County Donegal was invited to even the socials that were held in Donegal.  I blame Bord Fáilte.  They paid for the trip.  Perhaps they did like the Chinese &mdash; they <Col N="1382" /> treated the people out of their own bottle &mdash; that is, they paid for the directors trip out of the fund.  Senior people in Bord Fáilte organised the directors of the fund &mdash; the Members of the US House of Representatives &mdash; to visit the north-west. They spent two days looking at every aspect of development in the North and made three social calls to Donegal, to which no public representative was invited.  When the matter came to light the Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht received a belated invitation. The people in Donegal are angry and Bord Fáilte must explain in public why public representatives were excluded.  What happened looked like sharp practice, but it is not over.  We will have other opportunities to raise the matter.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has been given a high priority by the new Government and I support that approach.  We all have a contribution to make.  We must get rid of the stigma of unemployment.  I believe we must start using the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;. FÁS have produced a brochure with a very attractive name &mdash; Employment Subsidy Scheme.</P>
    <P>A large number of people are unemployed. Unfortunately some people have been unemployed for so long that they could not even think seriously about working.  Somebody asked recently how many people are looking for work and how many people are looking for jobs.  I do not want to criticise those who have been demoralised and draw dole, unemployment assistance or whatever.  We must adopt a new approach to this problem. The Government should subsidise employers who create jobs.  I do not have all the answers but we must provide an incentive to work.  The FÁS training is valuable and I urge the Minister and the Government to look at ways of improving the training facilities and job opportunities that FÁS provide.  We will never succeed in solving the problem if we only complain about the high numbers of unemployed people.  I am glad that the Government have placed job creation at the top of their priorities.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald in his contribution <Col N="1383" /> mentioned the success achieved in each Germany.  A few weeks ago I was in west Germany at a European Regional Conference and I met some Germans who gave useful information to the conference on progress made in east Germany. I was very interested in and pleased with the approach of the German Government to the difficulties in east Germany.  They did not make substantial grants available nor did they draft elaborate schemes of assistance.  They carried out a survey of all businesses and appointed new administration personnel. Where machines were outdated they installed new machines and supported the new management structure to get the business going.  They did not throw hundreds of thousands of pounds willy-nilly into east Germany but put it into supporting business management structures. They have reached a stage where the east German development programme has nearly been achieved in a very short time without major losses and without pumping money into it for years.  That is the right approach.</P>
    <P>Where industries are failing, such as is the case in Ballaghaderreen, as a result of cashflow problems, equity should be taken up by a Government agency.  The Government will have to take an interest in the industry that is now in danger in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>United Meat Packers have a major problem to the tune of £60 million.  The Government are right to approach this carefully.  If the Government gave them £4 million today and the industry was in difficulty in July, no great credit would attach to the Government.  They should establish an agency to take equity in this industry and safeguard any funding that is given.  It is of paramount importance that the jobs are saved in the west and those who sold cattle to United Meat Packers must be paid.  Those cheques must be honoured.  That is fundamental and there is no way round that.  I plead with the Government to recognise that.</P>
    <P>I hope that my county will benefit from the new initiative.  We have the potential to develop our tourist industry.  It is very <Col N="1384" /> sad to see two major hotels, Portsalon Hotel and Portnoo Hotel, semi-derelict.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited Glenveagh Park. I very much enjoyed his company at the function there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>All was in order and it was a very pleasent occasion.  The potential for tourist development is untapped. We have beaches, mountains and terrain suitable for hill walking.  I hope our hospitality encourages people to visit Donegal. Bord Fáilte have a budget of £22 million.  That is not sufficient.  When one considers the cost of running the head office, there is, as we would say in the country, only enough to put oil in the lamp.  They would need an increased budget if they are to attend to derelict areas which show good potential for development such as in Portsalon and Portnoo.</P>
      <P>The picture is not all gloomy.  It would be wrong to let this opportunity pass without complimenting Telecom Éireann.  We have a very modern telephone service.  County Donegal has a first class telephone and fax service.  That has helped to take the region I represent out of the doldrums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major development in this country was the discovery of natural gas.  It was piped from Kinsale to the east coast right up to Dundalk.  There are many counties from Galway to Donegal, Mayo, Longford, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon that will never benefit from that major development.  I put it on the record of the House that the directors of Bord Gáis drew up a plan.  They had a meeting in Monaghan with members of the local authorities and showed them a plan whereby natural gas would come from Dundalk to Sligo-Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and up to Donegal.  I believe that EC funding was sought to support An Bord Gáis.  I also believe &mdash; I would like somebody to correct me &mdash; that An Bord Gáis directors never intended to provide natural gas in the west.  We lost out on funding under the European Regional <Col N="1385" /> Development Fund as a result, but an ever bigger problem is that it is much more advantageous now to establish industry near the gas pipeline.  A contract has been signed to connect the gas pipeline to the UK and the rest of Europe and £250 million is involved.  County Donegal and other counties in the west have been put at a disadvantage and we have ground to make up.</P>
    <P>Irish Rail lost in the region of £120 million.  We do not have a rail head in my county.  If the playing field is to be level then major funding is needed for those areas in need of development.</P>
    <P>Some people in my county want an airport at Letterkenny.  The local authority is putting up substantial funding and we are looking for small money.  Part or our case must be based on the fact, that we did not benefit from the major funding expended on the development of natural gas, rail or shipping.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Dublin Corporation building cutstone walls and having a dual carriageway from here down to Carlow or Wexford and the environment section of Dublin County Council placing flowers along the road while somebody like myself is struggling to get enough money to fill the potholes in the west.</P>

I am totally convinced that the Minister and the Government will level the playing pitch.  It is better to be positive and look forward to an area being developed rather than sitting back, moaning and groaning, hoping that some day somebody will provide us with Utopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I would have no difficulty in convincing the Minister about the vast areas that need to be developed in the west.  He is totally committed to the west and that can be seen from his input <Col N="1386" /> through the years in his time in public life.  I hope he will have the energy and health to continue the campaign.  I humbly join and support that campaign. Hopefully, we will get our fair share of the obvious prosperity in this country today.  We are confident that the new Government will provide better opportunities for the west.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Neville for co-operating and agreeing to change his time with me.  I congratulate the Minister and welcome him to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Act, 1991.  I will address the issues most important to my area &mdash; mainly rural Ireland and agricultures as I represent the agricultural panel in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Appropriation Act, 1991 and the subsequent budget.  While many areas could be mentioned where larger allocations would assist greatly, the Government must keep tight control on spending or else return to reckless spending which would result in terrible consequences for all our people.  This House should put on record its compliments to all involved in preparing the Appropriation Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problem facing society at present is unemployment.  It affects all areas of our country, and contributes to many other problems such as crime, vandalism, the break up of families &mdash; to mention a few.  We are presented with a great challenge to lead our country out of this crisis and provide a work orientated structure.  The Government, with the cooperation of the social partners, can achieve this by adhering to their present policies.  They can create exceptional employment opportunities and safeguard <Col N="1387" /> existing jobs, thereby providing a better future for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>The European scene has changed greatly, the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall have disappeared and Communism and the Cold War no longer exist.  The European Community is undergoing major development; the creation of a Single Market from January 1993 and the establishment of political, economic and monetary union, will provide tremendous challenges for which we must be prepared if we are to reap the rewards. Policies and attitudes to European affairs must be right if we are to share in the prosperity of a Single European Market.</P>
    <P>Because of good economic management, the recent budget and Government polices on job creation are on course.  The Government, in consultation with the social partners, have undertaken a series of initiatives to confront the problem of rising unemployment and substantial funding is now available from the European Community for the new employment subsidy and in-company job training schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the employment subsidy scheme a weekly subsidy of £54 will be provided for 15,000 people who have been unemployed for at least two months and the in-company job training scheme will provide training for 10,000 people who have been unemployed for two months.  These schemes are welcome and will provide people with the necessary training to return to work with dignity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the temendous initiative by our Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, announcing and agreeing to an all-party Oireachtas jobs forum.  This is his acknowledgement of the need to have political consensus in trying to reduce the scourge of unemployment.  It is also confirmation of his personal priority &mdash; job creation.  I welcome the new initiative and wish the Taoiseach and the Government success with the many tasks facing them.</P>
    <P>The agriculture sector is currently going through a difficult period as income falls and the uncertainty of the GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy <Col N="1388" /> negotiations continue to destroy farmers' confidence in the future.  Many farming families are on low incomes, some living on an annual income of £2,000 or less. Rural Ireland and farming are the very core of the fabric of society and we must ensure that those areas and small farmers survive and increase in importance.  A vigorous effort must be made by all, including trade unions and bodies in the industrial sector, to protect this way of life and to keep people on the land.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has served EC member states well over the past 20 years providing a continuous supply of quality food.  Irish farmers have worked hard to develop the farms but by international standards they are still very small holdings.  Why should they have to suffer as factory farms survive?  Last year there was a welcome announcement of the extension of the disadvantaged areas and their reclassification to more severely handicapped status.  However, I must express my dissatisfaction at the rate of increase for my own counties of Monaghan and Cavan.  There is a compelling case for a much higher rate of inclusion in those counties.  I hope the appeals mechanism will do justice to the farmers of Monaghan and Cavan and that their disadvantages will be fully realised.  Last year's unacceptable inclusion rate should be massively increased as a means of keeping people on the land.  Another issue of serious concern to farmers in Monaghan and Cavan is bovine TB.  This is causing great hardship to many farmers as they are unable to sell cattle to provide much needed income for their families and make repayments on the farm investment, in particular for pollution control facilities.</P>
    <P>The importance of a good technical and advisory service to farmers is critical for their survival as many farmers diversify in alternative enterprises and improve efficiency on existing enterprises. Therefore, I wholeheartedly welcome the provision in the budget of an extra £1 million for Teagasc.  I also welcome the Government's commitment to protect and safeguard the advisory training and research services for farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> We are living in difficult and challenging times and to enable us to increase employment, keep people in rural areas and build a brighter future for our children, there must be sound economic management which this Government are providing, as indicated in the Appropriation Act, 1991.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill.  I again welcome him to the House and wish him well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  The Minister has done duty in this House on a number of occasions and I have no doubt he will fulfil his duties in his new office with the same efficiency.</P>
      <P>The Appropriations Act, 1991, provides us with an opportunity to look back on the past year and see what we have, or have not, achieved.  It is important to know how much money has been expended and on what it has been expended.  We should also plan for the future.  I have a number of concerns in relation to the past year and, indeed, in relation to the year ahead.  It is clear from a recent MRBI poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> that unemployment and job creation are a priority for the majority of our citizens; 100 per cent of those polled held that view.  We do not get figures like that for any other issue, for leadership rating in political parties or in relation to popularity of any of the political parties.  We spend our time dealing with various issues &mdash; business scandals, a leadership crisis and the renewal of the debate on the referendum in relation to the young girl against whom the Attorney General decided that an injunction should be taken to prevent her travelling to another country.  All those are extremely serious matters, but are we improving the overall standards and quality of life for our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous that the unemployment figure is now heading for 300,000.  A total of 20.8 per cent of our workforce is unemployed at present, more than double the European average which is 9.2 per cent. There are now more people on the long <Col N="1390" /> term unemployment register than there were in total unemployment in 1980.  In 1980 we had 8.2 per cent of the population unemployed, totally; in 1992 we have 8.8 per cent who are long term unemployed.  That is probably the strongest indicator of the extent to which we have lost control of the unemployment situation.  We have failed under any criteria to make job creation a priority.  The majority of people on long term unemployment have no hope of getting a job in the future.  Everything else comes and goes, but unless people have the means to earn a livelihood there is little hope for them in society.  Their way of life is restricted compared to the full potential that exists for those in employment.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that any moneys have been set aside in the finances which have been allocated to the various Departments, whether it be Industry and Commerce, Labour, Education or the local authorities, for job creation.  The State-sponsored bodies have been allocated money to create employment but that is an expensive way of creating employment. We have failed to meet our employment needs.  There are more people unemployed now than there were ten or 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>We will shortly be debating the referendum on Maastricht and there are many issues to be dealt with in relation to that, the most important being the integration of Europe on an economic and financial basis.  What will that mean for this country?  Will our employed workforce be further constricted as seems to be the case since we joined the EC in 1973?  We have lost out gradually but particularly in the eighties.  There will be fewer jobs and we will have to export our young people or compel them to go abroad, as seems to be the case at present.  A total of 46,000 people emigrated in 1989 but that number decreased to 1,000 in 1990 because fewer jobs are available abroad at present.  The Minister for Labour talked about exporting our trainees to be trained abroad because they are not voluntarily leaving the country. That is a sad reflection on the way we set about creating jobs; we are almost <Col N="1391" /> accepting the inevitability that we cannot provide jobs for our people.  A former Minister indicated that this island is too small to cater for all its people.  I do not accept that we cannot provide jobs for all those who wish to remain in the country. We are a small nation but we have tremendous resources which we are not exploiting to the full.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see United Meat Packers, the second largest beef processing company in the country, about to go to the wall.  The Minister said in the other House that it was inevitable that a receiver would be brought in.  The examiner found it was difficult to get the necessary finance to ensure that United Meat Packers would continue to operate but the Government now say they will bring in a receiver to restructure the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Howard) Acting Chairman (Mr. Howard)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring to it in the context of unemployment. Financially they will be restructured, their debt of £50 million will be got rid of and the banks will be happy; but will the country be happy?  A total of 900 fulltime and 600 part-time jobs are at stake in the counties Sligo, Roscommon and Mayo.  This is a short-sighted view of employment retention.  We should not be pressurised by financial institutions on a matter of this nature.  We must consider the effects on society and the banks should be pressurised into acting prior to receivership.  The case is lost once the company goes into receivership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, my main concern is unemployment. Since 1987 the Government have concentrated on creating a climate for creating jobs.  Inflation was kept at a low level and under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> wage increases of 2½ per cent were granted.  The restructured <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has reduced wage levels so that the wage bill will not be a heavy burden on the economy; the employer has had a cheap workforce in recent years.  As a result, we had a booming economy with an average export surplus over imports <Col N="1392" /> of 5 per cent.  Last month there was a record export surplus of £2.165 billion; exports have been in surplus for the past five years.  This surplus has resulted in a large amount of money coming into the country but that money has not been used for job creation.  We have a booming economy with profits being transferred to the business community while we have low inflation and low wage levels. The climate is right for job creation by any economic indicator and this is where the Government are to blame.</P>
    <P>We must adopt an interventionist policy in relation to job creation and not a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach of leaving the responsibility to the business sector.  The business sector will not create employment in an open economy we must export in order to survive.  The money paid for those goods goes outside the country to some tax haven and does not come back. That is a matter we must face up to for example, by giving more incentives to investors.  We have to look at DIRT for a start.  We should give incentives to people who bring back money into the country and to those who provide employment distinct from purchasing machinery or equipment.  Above all, we have to plug the black hole into which that money is disappearing.  Money is leaving the country at the expense of the workforce who produce the goods that are sold abroad. Tremendous work is being done and production is high but the haemorrhage of money leaving the country is preventing and undermining job creation.</P>
    <P>We have been receiving considerable EC funding since we joined the Common Market but farmers have been getting less than 20 per cent of the funds approved under the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have been allocated £3 billion in structural funds because of our peripheral position in Europe &mdash; £500,000 million per annum &mdash; yet, we still have high unemployment.  The highest monthly rates of unemployment for the past 18 months &mdash; indeed, in the history of the State &mdash; were recorded last December and January.  The Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement that unemployment levels would not go above <Col N="1393" /> 275,000 in 1992; yet a fortnight later there were 276,000 people out of work; he now admits that the number out of work may exceeds 300,000.  What advice is the Minister getting?  Why should he make such a statement in January and then, in February, realise that what he said was not only no longer valid but was out of line for the following 12 month period? Clearly he has no concept of the unemployment problem.  Are those figures being compiled in the hope that people will emigrate if the position deteriorates further?</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, we are faced with a colossal social welfare bill and if the unemployment level exceeds 300,000 there will be less money to create jobs.  The more unemployment gets out of hand the more difficult it will be to get the necessary Exchequer funding to invest in productive job creation.  The Government have talked about establishing a Dáil forum on jobs, but will the Seanad be represented on that forum? The Government have no desire to include the unemployed on that forum but, perhaps they will reconsider because if all interest groups are not represented, it will be regarded as a cynical exercise. A jobs forum should be established on a permanent basis and not just to deal with a crisis because we have never been able to provide an adequate number of jobs for our people.  Therefore, this forum should be a permanent structure involving the trade unions the unemployed, voluntary organisations and State bodies as well as politicians.  In that way there will be consensus on this issue not just among political parties but among the population as a whole.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I thank Senator O'Keeffe for accommodating me.  I welcome the Minister to the House as a fellow county man and congratulate him on his promotion. County Galway is doing well with the Ministeries.  There is much more representation in the county now than there is in the whole of Munster.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on this subject here at least three times in the last 12 months, I was astonished to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce when interviewed on the issue one morning recently, refer to the fact that our insurance is so high because of the very high claims &mdash; and I can go along with that &mdash; but he said that is what the people want and that as long as the people want it that is how it will be.  I am not sure that the people were polled on that issue.  I certainly do not want it.  I am sure the vast majority of car drivers do not want it.  The only people we are accommodating by high claims are those who are arranging crashes in order to make a lot of money out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present cost of insurance for car drivers in Ireland is scandalous.  We are not doing anything effective to reduce it. I have spoken about the cost of insurance relative to that in continental Europe. Today I will quote from a recent report which compares our insurance costs with the UK.  I will point out again, as I pointed out before, that insurance costs on motor vehicles are now so high that they are acting as a disincentive to investment <Col N="1396" /> and reducing our competitiveness in the marketplace.  That situation must be addressed and must be addressed quickly.  For young drivers particularly it is absolutely ridiculous.  A driver under 25 years of age today trying to get insurance for the first time is quite likely to be quoted a figure that is higher than the cost of the secondhand car which he bought.  It is making it impossible for young people to get insurance.  For many of them it is making it impossible to get a job.</P>
    <P>As a result of the extremely high cost of insurance we now have 75,000 uninsured drivers driving around the country.  The insurance companies themselves &mdash; and they are no angels &mdash; commissioned a report by Coopers and Lybrand to compare the cost of motor insurance in Ireland with the cost in Britain.  I have to say that they would be putting the best side forward for the insurance companies. Let me say that if they are so concerned that they are doing their job properly, why did they ask for and why did our Government support their call for a derogation in the non-life sector in the European Single Market situation?</P>
    <P>This report is quite detailed.  I accept they have stated the facts.  It shows clearly a number of rather disturbing matters. For instance, personal injury claims are two and a half times more likely to arise in the Republic than in the UK.  Non-comprehensive claims are five times and comprehensive claims three times more expensive than in the UK.  Personal injury claims are four times more expensive in Ireland.  Damage claims are twice as expensive.  The fatal accident rate too, unfortunately, is higher.  Here it is two and a half times the UK rate and the serious injury rate is 1.25 times higher in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Spare part prices are up to 33 per cent higher here than in the UK.  Car repair times are longer in Ireland.  But there is much more to it than that.  The survey showed that the differential was on average 48 per cent higher for comprehensive cover and 133 per cent higher for non-comprehensive cover in the Republic of Ireland than in the UK.  The industry <Col N="1397" /> statistics in the last three years indicated that the average earned premium per vehicle per year was 70 per cent higher for comprehensive cover and 106 per cent higher for non-comprehensive cover while average cost claims were 74 per cent higher for comprehensive cover and 141 per cent higher for non-comprehensive cover in the Republic of Ireland.  Based on the premiums for comprehensive cover the report goes on to show that, based on five cases included in the sample which required comprehensive cover and taking a straight arithmetical average, it can be estimated that comprehensive cover will cost 48 per cent more than if the car owner lived in a similar region in the UK.</P>
    <P>In relation to the frequency of claims, we must look at the factors that this report identifies which influence the issue.  They list the frequency of claims, the claims cost, accidents, repair costs and the type of cover.  Dealing first with the frequency of claims, this report points out that overall claims frequency is significantly lower in the Republic of Ireland than in the UK, with approximately double the claims per vehicle year in the UK.  On the other hand, if you look at the awards in Ireland, the percentage of claims with a personal injury award is roughly five times higher than in the UK. When this percentage is extrapolated over the vehicle years covered, personal injury claims are two and a half times more likely to arise in Ireland than in the UK.</P>
    <P>The claims costs are another factor. The generosity of our judges astonishes me.  Claims arising under comprehensive cover were up to three times more expensive in Ireland.  Similarly, claims arising under non-comprehensive cover were roughly five times more expensive in Ireland.  I am astonished at how generous judges are with other people's money.  In relation to vehicle repair costs, in general the cost of spare parts is higher in Ireland than in the UK.  The extent of the differential depends on the make and the age of the vehicle.  It runs to about 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>I will refer to my own personal experience <Col N="1398" /> with a car insured in Belgium.  I insured a new car in Belgium.  I had it there for two years and then took it back to Ireland.  I insured it with a subsidiary of the Belgium company in Ireland and was charged two and a half times as much for the same cover in Ireland as I was paying in Belgium.  By chance I met the chairman of the subsidiary on the train one day.  I put this to him and asked him for an explanation.  He told me as follows. He had the figures with him because he was going to the annual general meeting of the company on that day.  Litigation costs in Ireland are so much higher that the company have to write in £70 per insured vehicle above what they would charge in Belgium.  Uninsured drivers are so numerous on the roads that they have to put in £20 per insured vehicle.  The PMPA debacle costs £10 for every car insured in Ireland.  That is £100 straight away.  He then asked if I wanted to hear all about the claims.  I said &ldquo;I think I have heard enough for today&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We know from the evidence in Britain also that the claims awards in Ireland are excessively high.  Other countries have had this problem in the past.  They dealt with it by having a standard award for a particular type of injury.  A judge in Britain or in mainland Europe awards £X for a broken leg; for an eye injury £X + Y is awarded and so on.  Here in Ireland each judge makes up his or her mind on what the award will be, depending on how the judge likes the claimant, or whatever. Then we have the arranged crashes. More recently I heard that this extended even to south county Dublin.  I got this news secondhand.  I have heard that a bus driver has been suspended from Bus Átha Cliath for having arranged a crash with a car driver.  It is so profitable to make a claim that I would not be surprised if that story were true.  It is a fact that people are arranging crashes with old bangers of cars and getting awards which are out of all proportion to the value of the vehicles.  The insurance companies are not blameless in this.  They prefer to pay up than to fight the claim. Indeed if you look at the awards that were made by Bus Átha Cliath in 1991, <Col N="1399" /> they amounted to a total of £11 million, up £3 million on the previous year.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on, but I promised Senator O'Keeffe that I would be brief. This racket will continue as long as we fail to take steps to deal with it.  It is within the competence of our own legislators to deal with it.  For some reason we are not dealing with it.  This is resulting in a tragedy for many people who cannot get insurance.  All of us who get insurance are paying through the nose for it.  It is making our companies less competitive. It is encouraging up to 75,000 people to drive without insurance cover; in other words, it is making criminals of people also.  I thank Senator O'Keeffe for accommodating me.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to the House.  We were both elected to Dáil Éireann in 1987.  We were good friends through that time.  I am particularly delighted for him because he is a man of talent and great ability.  He knows the ropes and I have no doubt but that he will perform excellently in the portfolio that has been given to him by the Taoiseach. I hope that his reign in ministerial ranks will be of long duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that exorbitant car insurance rates are not so much a national disgrace as a national outrage, particularly when you look at premiums for young drivers under 30 years of age.  They are all regarded as being in the high risk category.  When I look at insurance companies I ask myself is the day fast approaching when insurance companies are looking for drivers who are absolutely no risk and who at the end of the day will ensure that they return a profit on that small segment of our society.  We were <Col N="1400" /> promised that with the abolition of the juries and the reduction of senior counsel we would have a dramatic decrease in the price of premiums.  Everyone now knows that what has happened is quite the reverse.  We saw the situation in 1988-90 when there was a 25 per cent hike.</P>
    <P>I would be inclined to say &mdash; and I agree with Senator Raftery on this &mdash; that the time for talking has ended.  We must now look at what action can be taken to get at the very root of the problem regarding costs in the motor insurance industry.  It is intolerable to think that those drivers who have had no accidents, no claims and full no claims bonuses were faced last year with a hike of 25 per cent in their premiums.</P>
    <P>It is significant to remember that when the abolition of juries was mooted as well as a reduction to one senior counsel, the legal profession itself was very much opposed to this measure.  They indicated quite clearly at the time that in their opinion it would not result in reducing insurance costs.  Today, privately, within insurance companies they say that the costs, in fact, have increased.  They, privately, are questioning whether there is collusion or some arrangement between the members of the legal profession to ensure that what they claim at the time becomes a reality.  No one can be certain of this fact but we can be sure that there has been a significant increase in the awards given since the decisions were placed in the hands of judges.</P>
    <P>The Government should take the issue in hand.  Perhaps they should look at this idea of a quantum of awards relating to various injuries.  Why not set up a data base for the insurance companies which would indicate the most prevalent type of injury and the most prevalent type of claim, and then relate the awards that have been granted right through the country?  There are inconsistencies in those awards.  We should aim at having a level playing pitch.  While it is not possible to be specific in terms of injuries, it should be possible to set down an average scale of awards which would act as a mean which could be followed by justices all over the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> I would like to deal with the insurance companies themselves and particularly with the interfacing between insurance companies, the legal profession and, indeed, the engineering profession.  Let us first look at the level of awards.  As I said, there is no consistency in the level of awards all over this country.  We have an insurance company being advised by the legal profession whether to take a case to a court or not.  Indeed, insurance companies have been criticised for not settling cases far earlier and at far less cost.  This House should look at the dilemma that is facing insurance companies in this regard.  The legal advice is to take the case to court but looking at it from a subjective point of view, obviously a precedent tells the legal representative to present his case to the court and the likelihood is that he personally will get a bigger slice of cake at the end of the day. The basis for that is that the more time he spends the more money he earns and the higher the percentage that will accrue to him from the very high level of compensation that is now the norm in the courts in this country.  The insurance companies are left in a cleft stick.</P>
    <P>I would also like to look at what are termed in insurance parlance as &ldquo;attendant costs&rdquo;.  Here again the experience is that attendant costs are extremely high. Under the present arrangement, it is not surprising that this is so.  Take, for instance, the engineers on both sides of the argument.  The engineer is asked to look at the scene and make a report.  He or she makes a first report.  When it is coming to court engineers on both sides are sent back to verify and to issue a second report, so that this will stand up in the court.  They arrive at the court and the engineer says to himself that the case might take a day, two days or even three days.  As far as he is concerned, he cannot take a chance, so he charges on a daily basis.  We all know that those charges can range from £1,000 a day to £3,000 per day.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the medical profession. It is possible in certain cases to have up to eight consultants involved in both sides of the argument.  I know recently of a <Col N="1402" /> case where four consultants were asked to attend the High Court.  They each demanded a down payment of £1,500, just to attend the High Court.  If this had not been paid, they would have refused to attend.  If they were looking for a £1,500 down payment to attend, one can imagine what the total payment to each was at the end of the case &mdash; each received £8,000 for a day and a half at court; each of the four on the litigant's side was peripheral to the case.  What I find ironic, however, is that in that same case an expert was invited from the UK but that expert made no such demand for a down payment.  At the end of the day his fees were far less than those who were peripheral to the case in the first place.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies, I also understand, have a procedure where they estimate claims on the basis of award level, plus 30 per cent costs.  My understanding again is that the actual attendant costs are now working out at a minimum of award, plus 50 per cent costs.  Again, I can cite a recent case where liability was admitted.  An award of £15,000 was made and the attendant costs were £12,000 &mdash; 80 per cent.  If you take that a step further, and look at a case where there is a far higher amount of money involved in the award, can you imagine what the attendant costs are?  Should it not make you wonder why premiums are so high in this country?  It is interesting to note that the insurance companies lost £116 million in 1989 compared to a premium take of £381.2 million in the same year.</P>
    <P>There is another factor the Minister might look at.  It was also thought that claims or costs in urban areas, particularly major urban areas, would be far lower than in the country in general. Again, I understand that the reverse is the case.  That too is something that is worth looking at and I would like the Minister to take note of it.</P>
    <P>I would now like to look at a number of specifics under various headings.  The first would be what I would call the ambulance chaser.  Now we have what I would term the unseemly spectacle of solicitors advertising publicly for litigant business on the basis of try-on claims, <Col N="1403" /> and on a no win, no fee basis.  Instead of curbing the number of claims, they are actually encouraging them.  I charge them with doing a disservice to the young people of Ireland who, at the end of the day, are the ones who have to pay the piper.  The time has come when the Minister for Industry and Commerce in particular must cry halt to this obscene practice, and place a ban on such advertising. He must eradicate, as far as possible, the mentality which wants to sue that pervades our society.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies stand accused of carrying inordinately high administrative costs.  There does not appear to have been any attempt to rationalise their operation and so they also stand indicted.  Where are the proposals for reform?  Today I would like to list a number of proposals that might make some difference to premium costs.</P>
    <P>The time has come for insurance companies to set up a data base which would identify the types of claims made.  Everybody knows that the incidence of whiplash is higher here than in any other country and compensation for whiplash injuries forms a major part of motor insurance costs.  That data base should record the name of the claimant.  There is evidence to suggest that many people claim repeatedly.  To the insurance companies I say: &ldquo;Get together, get a data base, place documentation on file and let us see who is benefiting and if they are benefiting once, twice or more often.&rdquo;  I have no difficulty with the genuine accident case who deserves to be compensated but I believe that a compensation mentality motivates people to claim compensation for compensations sake.</P>
    <P>There is a level of deviation in awards granted by various judges around the country for certain accident cases and particularly for whiplashes.  It is astonishing that we have not yet reached agreement on the amount of damages appropriate to this injury.  It is time some consistency was brought to bear.</P>
    <P>I would also look at the type of legal officers involved in insurance claims.  It <Col N="1404" /> would be fitting for insurance companies to establish a pattern with regard to certain legal practices in litigant claims.  That would throw light on what is now a dim subject.</P>
    <P>What can the Government do?  The wrongs are not only on one side.  I propose to the Minister that it is now time to set up a claims tribunal, which would not be welcomed by the legal profession because it would bring down attendant costs.  This is the way forward.  Anything that we as a Government can do to reduce attendant costs should be done.  We could have the transfer of engineering and medical opinion at the minimum cost.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister &mdash; and I know that he has this in mind &mdash; to legislate for cars in poor mechanical condition.  There should be increased vigilance in this area. The roadworthiness of cars in Ireland should be subject to a mandatory inspection after five years.</P>
    <P>On the subject of drink driving, one has only to look at the incidence of fatal accidents and major injury as a result of this practice to denounce it.  We have seen the success over two Christmases of vigilance on drink driving; 1990 saw a dramatic decrease in the number of accidents. The reduction was not as significant this year but other factors kept the numbers of accidents up.</P>
    <P>Many young people rather than driving to discos or whatever have established a pattern among themselves of coming together as a group and hiring a taxi. They decide that drink driving is not for them, by and large.  We who are older suffer from the older syndrome.  The taxi concept is more difficult for us to accept, but young people should be encouraged in this regard.  We should ensure year round vigilance on drink driving.</P>
    <P>The incidence of uninsured driving is massive in Ireland; that is the only term I can use for it.</P>
    <P>Every city around the country has a joyrider problem.  I know about young people's problems as I am involved with 3,000 young people in college every day. The thing uppermost in their minds and what they describe as a national scandal is the fact that they cannot afford car <Col N="1405" /> insurance, although many of them would like to be able to drive.  The temptation to drive a car uninsured is great.  The law, as I understand it, states that for a first offence of no insurance an endorsement is given and for a second a six month ban is imposed.  Surely that law is inadequate. The time has come to ban uninsured drivers from driving with a fine in the first instance and a jail term on a further offence.  We should keep in mind that our insurance premiums pay for the damages, awards and costs incurred by uninsured drivers involved in crashes.</P>
    <P>I try to be as constructive as possible. The cost of motor insurance premiums is a serious problem in this country.  I speak for everyone affected and especially for young people.  I ask the Minister to bring the matter to the attention of his Government colleagues and to make sure something is done now rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and welcome him to the House.  A great deal has been said by the two previous speakers, all of which I agree with, and I do not intend to go back over it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take a long and serious look at the high cost of motor insurance, a crippling national burden which leaves many of our companies unable to compete.  Senator Raftery referred to the report by Coopers and Lybrand on the cost of private motor insurance in Ireland.  The survey of premiums indicated that the differential was on average 48 per cent higher for comprehensive cover and 133 per cent higher for non-comprehensive cover than in the UK.  That confirms what we all suspected. It is extremely difficult for young people to get motor insurance cover.  In many instances, as every Senator knows, young people trying to start a small business cannot do so because they cannot afford the cost of motor insurance.  There is great temptation to drive without insurance and we have heard of 75,000 people driving without insurance in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are points which could be made with regard to insurance brokers.  I <Col N="1406" /> understand they get a 5 per cent take on premia.  Do insurance companies ever divulge their expense ratios?  Do we ever hear the cost of handling claims?  How much wastage is there?  I hear there is great inefficiency in the claims departments of insurance companies and a great deal could be done to improve efficiency there.</P>
    <P>The cost of advertising amazes me. One frequently sees insurance companies advertising for motor insurance, yet we know they are already reluctant to take on motor insurance and say that it is one of the least profitable areas.  I get the impression &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; from statements made by the Insurance Federation of Ireland that their attitude is that if people want to make claims, they should be free to do so since it is the customers' money.  They hike up premiums to cope with the situation.  That is unfair on the public and an unrealistic response.</P>
    <P>With regard to legal and medical expenses, my husband is a surgeon who had on occasions to give evidence in the High Court.  He dreads such occasions because the inefficient manner in which the legal business is conducted disrupts his whole day.  He has no idea at what time of the day he will be called on and I am sure he would be delighted to have his day disrupted if he got anything like the money mentioned by Senator O'Keeffe.  I do not know who receives those amounts but my husband has never received anything of the sort although I accept what Senator O'Keeffe says.  It is unreasonable to expect a consultant who has to be in an operating theatre to be available at any hour of the day to attend the High Court within a couple of minutes.  Sums awarded for medical and legal expenses are colossal.  In a recent case a third party received £11,000 in settlement of a claim and legal fees amounted to £6,000.  That seems unrealistic and totally out of proportion.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made about deviations in the level of awards.  In the UK figures are laid down for whiplash, a broken arm or whatever and they stick to those figures, whereas here, as Senator <Col N="1407" /> Raftery said, generous judges pay out claims which are three to five times higher than in the UK.</P>
    <P>One way to reduce the cost of claims would be to reduce the number of accidents.  We need realistic enforcement of traffic laws, a crack-down on speeding, drunken driving and dangerous driving. If we improved traffic surveillance on the roads we would see a realistic reduction in the number of accidents.  People take risks all the time on Irish roads because they do not think the chances of being caught speeding are significant.</P>
    <P>On holidays in Italy many years ago my husband was driving the car and he, unlike me, is a most law-abiding person. We were stuck in a long row of vehicles on a narrow road for ten or 12 minutes. He suddenly saw a space to move out, but moving out obliged him to cross marginally over the white line.  Within seconds, he was pulled into the side of the road by a motor cycle cop and duly given a dressing down.  For the rest of the holiday in Italy we drove with extreme caution.  If the same thing happened in Ireland with serious and realistic penalties, people would drive more safely and the number of accidents would be reduced.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of consistent traffic law enforcement.  I do not blame the gardaí because the gardaí are understaffed and their equipment is out of date to deal with the problems they encounter.  We need effective deterrents to bring down the number of accidents.  We saw the magnificent ways in which gardaí coped with drunken driving over the last two Christmases.  We know how those measures forced the seriousness of drinking and driving on our attention.  Now, before many people go where they will take a drink, they decide how they are going to get home and make arrangements. That proves that Garda crack downs work.  Would insurance companies be prepared to contribute to the cost of law enforcement to maintain the present cost of premia?  I was under the impression &mdash; I may be wrong about this &mdash; that two years ago when the Garda <Col N="1408" /> initiated this clamp down on drunken driving that insurance companies contributed to the costs of the campaign but I have not been able to confirm that.  I would like to see that happening.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe referred to the deplorable condition of many cars on Irish roads, yet there is no effective method for removing unroadworthy cars from the roads.  There are a range of improvements which could be made.  I ask the Minister to look at traffic law enforcement to see what can be done. Motor insurance costs are a crippling national problem and we must put all our efforts into seeing what improvements could be made to reduce the cost of motor insurance for everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to the House and reiterate the sentiments expressed by other speakers that he will make an excellent job of his portfolio.  I read in the paper today that he has been taking a stick to male chauvinists in golf clubs, telling them to get their house in order and to provide equal opportunity in golf clubs for women as well as for men.  I wish him luck.</P>
      <P>I would like to continue with a point made by Senator Hederman in relation to enforcement of traffic laws.  She is correct when she says we have a dismissive attitude to traffic law enforcement.  When we drive from A to B, we take chances we would definitely not take in any other European country.  Like Senator Hederman, I have had occasion to travel in Europe and I have always been extremely careful to abide by the traffic laws for fear of being detected, but in cases of speeding and taking chances overtaking cars, trucks and so on at home, we tend to believe that the chances of being detected are low and consequently we do not abide by traffic regulations as we should.  This is not a criticism of the Garda Síochána; resources have not been provided to ensure adequate policing of the traffic code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What causes accidents?  Something must cause them and 99.9 per cent are caused by human frailty in some shape <Col N="1409" /> or form which is the reason for our high rates of motor insurance premia.  Our accident proneness may be part of our Celtic inheritance; we are casual in our approach to everything.  That can be an advantage in some instances but is not appropriate to driving practices.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the high cost of insurance premia here is the multiplicity of accidents and claims made and there is a significant difference between claim figures in this jurisdiction and in the UK. Motor insurance cover is 48 per cent higher for comprehensive cover and 133 per cent higher for non comprehensive cover in Ireland than in the UK.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Raftery talk about his experience in Belgium.  When he came back to this country he said he paid two and a half times more here for the same cover he had in Belgium.  There has to be a reason for that difference.  The statistics I quoted come from a comparative review by Coopers and Lybrand for the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin the average cost of claims in Ireland is 74 per cent higher for comprehensive cover and a massive 141 per cent higher for non comprehensive cover than in the UK.  We have to look at the cause for the disparity between the jurisdictions in relation to a number of different areas, claims frequency, claims cost, number of accidents, high repair costs and the type of preferred cover.  It is significant to note that claims frequency in this country is half the annual UK rate but the percentage of claims involving personal injury award is about five times higher than in the UK. A disturbing statistic reveals that we have two and a half times the number of UK fatalities; two and a half times more people are killed here in relation to the incidence of casualties and the number of vehicles registered.  That is an alarming statistic.  I would have expected with the huge volume of traffic on UK motorways and frequent accidents and pile-ups that the number of fatalities there in comparision with this country would be greater, but that is not so.  These findings are taken from an expert review by a <Col N="1410" /> group of accountants who did an indepth comparison of Irish/UK insurance history.</P>
    <P>The high cost of spare parts is another factor; costs are increasing all the time and people because of other financial pressures defer buying new tyres and paying for car maintenance, which ultimately increases the potential for road accidents.  When traffic laws are not implemented people presume that nine times out of ten they will avoid detection for traffic law violations and vigilance is thereby reduced.</P>
    <P>Motor premia costs in Ireland are rising faster than car prices and the rate of inflation; car prices are high but motor insurance costs are increasing at an enormous rate.  A number of factors contribute to the excessive cost of premias. Third party awards are high, we have high accident levels and the Irish have become a litigious people.  We tend to follow up every opportunity to obtain a few pounds.</P>
    <P>I question the incidence of sharp practice by solicitors who advertise on a no win no fee basis, encouraging people who would not otherwise get involved in litigation to think they have nothing to lose by doing so, since if they do not win they will not have to pay.  One result of this opportunity is the enormous increase in premia costs to cover insurance claims.</P>
    <P>The report also indicated the different types of loading insurance companies put on different premia to cover all the different types of costs.  We need to take a fresh look at the motor insurance industry to come up with a solution to this enormous problem.</P>
    <P>It is easy when there is a problem to pick a scapegoat to blame and in motor insurance costs the scapegoat has been the young driver.  Young drivers have been identified rightly or wrongly as the group most likely to cause traffic accidents so their premia has been heavily loaded.  Unfortunately many young people have difficulty getting jobs and in many cases jobs open to them entail driving, but when they try to get insurance cover they find the cost is greater than the price paid for the <Col N="1411" /> vehicle.  You see the insurance companies themselves advertising every day in the paper: &ldquo;Young and energetic person needed to sell insurance&rdquo; but they have to have a motor car if they are going to get involved.  The whole thing is a chicken and egg situation, because when they get a car they have to get insurance on it. When they send in a proposal form which asks what age they are, the premium is loaded on them with the result that a lot of them cannot afford it in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>What amazed me altogether is the recent development whereby the insurance companies have these blacklists. If you were to get all the blacklists of types and categories of people they will not cover, I would suggest that almost every category will not be covered by some insurance company or another. I was absolutely amazed to see that, for instance, the crews of oil rigs are on a blacklist with one insurance company. Why they would pick people in that category to deprive them of insurance amazes me.  Another category are tarmacadam contractors, who are on another black list.  There are, of course, all the standard ones like bookies and jockeys who for some insidious reason are barred or put on this black list.  If they want to get insurance then the premium will be absolutely loaded against them. Is it just that today an insurance company wakes up and says &ldquo;Look, we will blacklist this particular category of people because we want extra money?&rdquo; It is absolutely unbelievable.</P>
    <P>On the legal costs, wrangling over liability, as was mentioned in relation to solicitors fees etc., takes up a large percentage of the total payments made by insurance companies.  That is never received by the victims being compensated. In fact, there have been instances where the victim did not receive any cash whatever at the end of the day. All the cash awarded went towards paying the legal costs involved.  As has been mentioned, all of these people are making enormous amounts of money out of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> By and large, the cost of motor insurance in this country is absolutely catastrophic and I think it is high time we drew up proposals whereby at least the people would see that they are getting value for money.  It is horrific to think that people who have been driving for 30 or 40 years or whatever, have never had an accident and have a full no claims bonus are still burdened with huge amounts of money to pay if they want to take out insurance.</P>
    <P>Again, I come back to the young driver who passes his test, gets his full licence and wishes to be added to the parents insurance.  The cost of adding that young person to a parent's insurance is almost as much as the full insurance cost itself. As Senator O'Keeffe said earlier, that leads to young people taking the chance of driving motor vehicles without insurance and that is causing enormous problems.  We should have some sort of a system in place whereby it is recognised that people have been driving for a certain length of time and have a full no claims bonus.</P>
    <P>It is not all that long ago since my own insurance was £19 plus a £2 membership fee.  The enormous increases that have taken place in the whole insurance field in the interim are just unbelievable.  You are talking about between £300 and £600 for any type of insurance cover at the moment.  Where is it going to stop?  If we do not cry halt now and try to remedy the situation, when will it happen?  We are driving the cost of insurance away out of reach of quite a substantial number of people, particularly young people; and it is no wonder, as I said, that quite a substantial number of those people are taking the chance of driving without insurance.</P>
    <P>I would support 100 per cent the call by Senator O'Keeffe for a support claim tribunal to reduce the attendance cost.  I think this claims tribunal is extremely important in order to reduce all of these additional costs for certain experts, be they engineers or medical people, who attend at court and charge enormous fees for such attendance.  In some cases they may never be even called.  They just <Col N="1413" /> happen to be on call and for that they are paid enormous sums of money.  The result is that the cost of insurance for the ordinary individual becomes enormous.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to motor insurance at present is very serious.  We are at a crisis point and I would appeal to the Minister to take this matter in hand.  I know he is very concerned about the whole area of motor insurance, but I think that it demands immediate and urgent attention.  When you are paying for something you are looking for value for money.  What we have got to do in this instance is get value for money, and the vast majority of the general public do not think that they are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>I was always under the impression that in law an insurance company had to cover an individual when an application was made, but I have had experience of specified motor insurance companies refusing to cover particular people for very spurious reasons.  I am anxious to know if it is a point in law that a person must get insurance, even though the premium may be loaded, and that the insurance company must reply with an invoice or whatever setting out what the cost would be. I have had experience of cases where the insurance company refused point blank to cover the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>If you are calling on Senator Upton, Sir, I would have to question the order in which speakers are being called, without any disrespect to either yourself or to Senator Upton.  It would appear &mdash; and to me this is quite extraordinary &mdash; that the Fine Gael group are now allocated every sixth slot.  That has not been the position heretofore and it would appear to be the position that is arising today.

      <P>Thank you, Senator Howard.  You will realise no discourtesy is in any way intended to your good self <Col N="1414" /> or indeed to the Fine Gael group, but it is my understanding that a speaker for each group recognised in the House is entitled to be taken in turn.  This is the practice and procedure.  It is on that basis I am given to understand that Senator Upton is the first speaker for Labour and therefore on this established basis I am calling on Senator Upton.</P>

It has been the custom for many years, as you rightly suggest, that a speaker for each group speaks in turn but over and beyond that, it is the privilege of the Chair to decide which speaker is to be called at a given time.  So, I am calling Senator Upton on both bases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first time I have spoken in the House when this Minister was present.  I congratulate him on his appointment and I wish him well.  I am sure his promotion to the position of Minister will help the city of Cork.  That is desirable, even if I am not from Cork myself and I hope to represent parts of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers have already referred to the differentials in the cost of insurance premiums in Ireland and in the United Kingdom.  The figures have been given indicating that for comprehensive cover in this country it is something like <Col N="1415" /> 48 per cent higher and 133 per cent higher for non-comprehensive cover.  Much of the cost of insurance is centralised on younger drivers and on certain categories of drivers and there seems to be a particular loading on drivers based in Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  That creates enormous problems for this segment of the population.</P>
    <P>Claims under comprehensive insurance cover are up to three times more expensive in this country than in the United Kingdom.  Personal injury costs are reckoned to be four times more expensive here than in the United Kingdom.  The rates of fatality per million cars or vehicles are considerably greater also in this country.  Despite this, the number of claims which are made here seem to be lower than in the United Kingdom, although it has been suggested that this data may arise because of the fact that a certain number of small cases are not reported.  We have then a fairly serious problem in relation to the costs of accidents and this in turn working its way back to the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>There must be a considerable number of causes for this reality.  The one I would imagine is important is the way we drive. Some Irish people, who outside their car are the most pleasant, courteous and civilised people, suddenly change when they get behind the driving wheel and become aggressive, disagreeable and insistent on having things their way and taking precedence over other drivers when a little common sense would indicate otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, also the problem with the standards of our roads.  They leave a great deal to be desired.  I imagine that has to be a factor in the genesis of some of the accidents.  The way we park must also contribute to some degree. People here in many cases abandon their cars rather than park them.  They simply throw them away.  They leave them and walk away from them.  Then they come back oblivious to the fact that what they did created a serious risk of accidents or creating serious problems for the rest of the community, who are forced to wait while they have a chat, for example, with <Col N="1416" /> somebody they meet on a casual basis. That is a great pity.  It seems to be very difficult to enforce the parking regulations. There seems to be a sort of culture of ignoring parking regulations.  I imagine the people who have the unpleasant job of enforcing these regulations experience a lot of hostility from irritated motorists who are, for the most part, oblivious to the regulations, and, where they are not oblivious to the regulations, the attitude is, &ldquo;what harm is it anyway?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is also the standard of car maintenance. That is very important.  That, in turn, goes back to the broader costs of keeping a car and that is tied up with the cost of insuring cars.  There is also transport policy &mdash; our inability to seriously address transport policy and in particular our inability to seriously tackle the basic questions of transport policy in urban areas, especially in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In many ways I see a certain amount of merit in freeing up the legal business so that people in the law can advertise and offer their services.  But, I tend to recoil from some of the advertisements now being used to promote services for people who happen to be injured or to have a claim.  I have to acknowledge that there is a certain amount of merit in creating competition between legal firms and creating an openness in legal matters which did not pertain until fairly recently. However, I find distasteful the tone of some of those advertisements.  People used to talk about people being involved in coffin chasing, but this is a form of ambulance chasing.</P>
    <P>Then there is the awareness of most Irish people about the causes of accidents. I honestly do not believe that the public are fully aware of the causes of accidents.  I am sure the Department of the Environment, or what used to be An Foras Forbartha, do a good job analysing accidents and trying to figure out why accidents happen on different occasions and in differing circumstances.  I am not happy that the results of the research done by the Department of the Environment is adequately communicated to <Col N="1417" /> the public, nor am I happy with the level of preventative measures which are at present being utilised.  There must be great scope for making people aware of fairly simple basic things they could do which would help to reduce the risk of accidents and which should result in the elimination of a large number of accidents.</P>
    <P>The number of fatalities in this country, as I have said, is considerably greater than in the United Kingdom.  There must be a number of factors causing that which are easy to tackle.  I know that the factors which relate to the standards of roads and so on are enormously difficult to tackle because of the expense involved. But there must be fairly basic things in relation to behaviour which could be addressed.  Very large numbers of the public are not aware of the factors which create accidents.  You see &ldquo;back spot&rdquo; signs on the roads and that is to be welcomed; I suppose they do serve some purpose, although one would have to express a certain degree of alarm as to the impact these signs make on people.</P>
    <P>There was a small research project carried out by a psychologist in University College, Dublin.  He analysed the impact which passing signs had on motorists. I must say that it was with some alarm I learned that the impact was relatively minor.  When the subjects in this experiment were asked to list off the signs they had passed in the last mile before the analysis was run, quite large numbers of them were totally oblivious to the fact that they had passed certain warning signs and so on.  Worse than that, some of the subjects were quite confused by the signs.  They had drawn erroneous conclusions from what they had seen.  Further, in relation to some of the signs, despite the fact that the sign had registered with a certain proportion of the sample, it still had very little, if any, impact on how the motorist behaved.  I think that is an important discovery with significant implications.  It is the kind of thing we should be seeking to address.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of insurance, I would like to take up a point made earlier by Senator McKenna.  It relates to my <Col N="1418" /> belief that the Government should now seriously consider the introduction of a no fault liability system in relation to insurance such as that used in Canada. This would reduce legal costs because of the removal of the need to prove negligence. That would be very important.  It would also simplify the system.  It would streamline it, it would remove uncertainty and it would undoubtedly eliminate the astronomical legal costs for motor insurance claims simply because these claims would no longer need to be processed through the courts.</P>
    <P>I want to make specific reference to the situation in relation to the insurance of motor cycles, which I believe is in urgent need of modification.  It is totally unacceptable that apparently in this country at present there is only one company which is prepared to insure motor cycles.  There is a clear obligation on the Government to sort out the insurance market so as to allow some choice for a motor cyclist where the question of insurance is concerned.  The fact also that passengers on motor cycles apparently are not insured when the motor cyclist is insured is another very serious anomaly in the law and should be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are two fairly clear implications to that.  First, there should be an obligation for passengers to be insured.  If the Government are not prepared to insist on that obligation, I am beginning to think that there might be a fair case to be made for banning pillion riders on motor cycles.  The risks which are attached to the use of motor cycles worldwide, but particularly in this country, are enormous.  There is a very high risk of injury and accident attached to the use of motorcycles.  I must confess I do not fully understand what the reasons for that are, but certainly the statistics are very alarming.  That is one area on which the Government should focus and come up with some solutions which would limit the risks attached to the use of motorcycles.</P>
    <P>The under 25 motor car insurance market is also nearly a monopoly and it creates dreadful problems for people in this age group who need to use a motor car for their job.  There is a special problem <Col N="1419" /> for young Dublin people in this category, who have an extra burden to carry because not only are they loaded because they are under 25 years of age but they are also loaded because they are resident in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister and the Government to spell out what the implications of the Single European Act and the Maastricht Summit will be in relation to the motor insurance industry here. Our motorists some years ago were given the false impression that our entry into the European Community, the introduction of the Single European Act and so on would result in a substantial reduction in the cost of motor cars. Obviously, that has not materialised, and I would like to hear the Minister's view in relation to the effects that the Single European Act would have on the cost of motor insurance in this country.</P>
    <P>I have a few final points.  Some people seem very anxious to go to law in this country.  I wish people would be less anxious to have recourse to law to sort out their differences.  I also wish people were more realistic in relation to what damages they can expect to obtain in certain categories of cases.  A lot of the time these cases never get to court, but enormous expenses are generated because the cases get to the Round Room down in the Four Courts where they are settled.</P>
    <P>There must also be scope for a less contentious approach to the definition, extent and implication of injuries.  I imagine that many injuries are fairly clear cut in terms of the effect which can be predicted from them.  Most doctors, broadly speaking, would come to the same conclusions in relation to the effects of certain types of injuries.  I would hope that in many of those cases those matters could be taken as read, that they would be agreed, rather than situations arising where doctors, whose time is very expensive, find themselves down around the Four Courts, perhaps spending four or five days there, as somebody already suggested, and not even being called.  I would hope that in many of those cases <Col N="1420" /> a written report should be adequate to describe what is involved.  Certainly, there must be considerable scope for saving in that matter also.</P>

      <P>Just to clarify for Senators, the situation is that there has been a custom that speakers for each group will be called in turn.  The Members of the Seanad may or may not wish to change this custom, but the actual Standing Orders of the House state &mdash; it is under Rule 31 of our Standing Orders &mdash; that if a Senator desires to speak he shall rise in his place and if more than one Senator shall rise at the same time the Cathaoirleach shall call upon one of them and that Senator shall address the Chair.  That is the only actual rule, whatever customs there may be or not be &mdash; and some years back the custom was that there was no particular order as such, even though it was then the custom simply to move from one side of the House to the other side.  What I would suggest, if I may, to Senator Howard and other Senators is that this be discussed by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges or through the Whips.  I appreciate Senator Farrell's gesture and his courtesy and also Senator Howard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of the cost of motor insurance. Could I also say that, despite the difficulties I had to contend with, I was also expressing a view this morning on the Order of Business that the time limit proposed for this debate was far too short.  I was confirmed in that view by the excellent contribution that came from Senator O'Keeffe.  It was regrettable that he had to condense his contribution and leave aside parts of a well thought out, <Col N="1422" /> worthwhile contribution in order to come within the time frame.  Putting important matters such as this in a short time frame is not satisfactory.  Motor insurance is a burning issue, particularly for young drivers.  I accept that there is an obligation on a number of interests, including ourselves as legislators, to take the necessary steps to improve this situation. There are a number of interests involved in the steps that are necessary to make an improvement.  There are the steps that we can take as legislators and they have been enumerated here.  I endorse many of the points put forward by previous speakers.  There is a very clear obligation on the insurance industry to take a number of steps.  There is a clear indication that they are providing a smoke-screen to cover their failure to do so. There is the contribution that must be made by the general public and the courts.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the review carried out by Coopers and Lybrand on behalf of the Insurance Federation of Ireland in relation to rates of motor insurance in the UK compared to the rates applying here.  Coopers and Lybrand are a reputable company.  This report makes interesting reading.  It is a source of very useful information. The report was sent to me, and I am sure to all my colleagues, by the Irish Insurance Federation.  They enclosed with the report a covering letter which purported to give a condensed picture of the findings and conclusions of the report.  Having read the report and the letter, I regard the letter as presenting a very selective representation of the report and of many of its conclusions, focusing on and exaggerating aspects of the report that are favourable to the high cost of insurance in Ireland and clearly ignoring parts of the report which are less favourable to the performance of the Irish insurance industry.</P>
    <P>I find the attitude of the insurance industry as reflected by the letter and its selective representations as highly unsatisfactory. The contribution of the Irish Insurance Federation to the high cost of motor insurance is a substantial one and it would be in the interests of everybody <Col N="1423" /> if they faced up to that fact.  If they believe that by commissioning this report and then selectively presenting the favourable aspects of it to us they can evade their obligation to reduce motor insurance costs, they are very much mistaken. I admit, as I said earlier, that we all have a responsibility as far as reducing motor insurance costs are concerned and it extends beyond the Irish Insurance Federation, but not to the extent that they would have us believe.</P>
    <P>One aspect of both the report and the letter from the federation is their silence on the high cost of motor insurance for young drivers.  I am surprised that a company such as Coopers and Lybrand ignored or failed to focus on the very serious matter of the high cost of insurance for young drivers.  Apart from the fact that this report looks at the cost of insurance <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United Kingdom &mdash; we can bear in mind Senator Raftery's remarks earlier today about his experience in relation to the cost of insurance on his car between here and Belgium &mdash; an EC survey was conducted in 1990 based on a selection of family cars.  In that survey Ireland came out highest of all the EC countries for third party insurance.  We are the third highest in the EC for comprehensive insurance. Not alone were we the highest in one case and the third highest in the other but the rates were substantially in excess of the EC average.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe referred correctly to the pressure which the insurance industry used some time ago to remove the assessment of accident compensation from juries.  The claim was that once the juries were removed from the scene the level of compensation would fall, leading to a drop in insurance premiums.  The reality is that that has not happened.</P>
    <P>In June last year Fine Gael produced a policy document in relation to the matter of insurance cover for young drivers.  I quote briefly from it:</P>
    <P>Young people cannot afford the appalling cost of motor insurance. <Col N="1424" /> Some drivers with clean records have been quoted premiums of over £2,000.</P>
    <P>I know of a 19 year old driver who was quoted a premium of £3,000.</P>
    <P>While young drivers do have worse accident records, no figures sustain the view that young drivers are a seven times greater risk to insurance companies as such premiums suggest.  The problem is that the insurance companies do not want to take the trouble in assessing the risks of young drivers. That is the industry's response to the failure of a company to make a starter policy for young drivers viable.</P>
    <P>It goes on to suggest that certain matters need to be looked at to help to bring about this situation.  It speaks of better driving skills, safer roads, stricter law enforcement, tighter controls on claims and a better deal from insurance companies.</P>
    <P>If insurance companies or the Irish Insurance Federation wish to claim that young drivers as a group predominantly feature in road accidents, that is no reason to condemn every young driver. It is basic justice that each individual be first given the opportunity to start with a clean sheet.  If the logic pursued by the insurance companies in categorising all young people into one group were to be followed to its logical conclusion, then young people would be discriminated against in practically all walks of life.  It is only right that until a young person has an accident the normal premium levels should apply.</P>
    <P>The question of a starter policy, as advocated by my party, should be given serious consideration.  Starter drivers would be quoted only for third party cover and the premium would be about £750.  The following special conditions should apply: the insured would have a clean licence and not be in breach of any of the restricted driving requirements. Claimants would be liable for the first £500 or 10 per cent, whichever is the lesser, in cases other than in personal injuries.  The normal no claims bonus would not apply for the first three years <Col N="1425" /> and all insurers would be expected to take a share in the starter driver pool. Starter drivers who make a claim would face an escalation of their premium costs related to the cost of their claim.</P>
    <P>Some points already mentioned in the debate are covered in the report, for example, the question of a quantum of damages to be introduced to control the cost of settling different forms of payment and the need for a claims commission. Senator O'Keeffe referred to the desirability of a data base being provided by insurance companies.  We believe that greater information should be supplied by the insurance companies and the reasons for the loadings should be identified.  What was proposed in the report last June is a logical approach to a serious and urgent matter and I am not aware of any serious consideration being given to it by the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>I received the Coopers and Lybrand report with a covering letter dated 2 March and I quote briefly from the letter. It states: &ldquo;I enclose herewith for your information a copy of the above report which I hope you will find of interest&rdquo;.  It said that the Irish Insurance Federation commissioned this independent report in order to establish once and for all the key factors which contribute to the high cost of motor insurance in Ireland compared to the UK.  It continued that the findings of the report will help to focus on the ongoing debate on motor insurance costs, on the real issues that must be addressed by the Government, by the public at large and by the insurance industry if we are to succeed in our joint efforts to contain or alternatively reduce insurance costs in Ireland.  I have no quarrel with the letter so far and I agree with the statement that there are problems which must be addressed by the Government, by the public at large and by the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>However, I have difficulty with the next paragraph of that letter which states that the report confirms beyond any doubt that the high level of Irish motor insurance premiums compared with the UK is more than justified by the significantly higher differential in claims <Col N="1426" /> costs between both countries.  The report, I suggest, does no such thing. If I or anybody else were to base our judgment on this letter, the insurance industry would escape all responsibility and criticism for the scandalously high premiums that apply here, particularly for young drivers.</P>
    <P>In their letter they talk about an action plan and the main factor leading to the huge differential in claims costs.  They talk about high accident frequency, the standard of the road system and the maintenance of roads, the standard of road traffic law enforcement, the level of awards for pain and suffering, the level of professional fees and the late settlement of some claims.  There are many other issues identified in the report as contributing to high insurance premiums but this letter is silent on them.</P>
    <P>There are issues highlighted which are not favourable to the insurance industry but they are swept quietly away.  The final claim made is that the late settlement of some claims is one of the major factors in all this.  I ask to what extent is the insurance industry themselves a party to the late settlement of claims?  That is something that they should examine.</P>
    <P>The report compares certain areas in the UK with certain areas here.  For example, it takes Dublin city and county and it takes the rest of Ireland and compares them with certain areas in the UK. It also noted that certain Irish insurance companies include the counties of Kildare, Wicklow and Louth as being within the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Smaller areas are used in the UK by the Insurance industry for the assessment of claims.  I suggest that because the insurance industry in Ireland divides the country into two parts, there is a somewhat lazier attitude by the insurance industry in Ireland in investigating aspects of the situation which are approached in a much more comprehensive way in the United Kingdom. To a certain extent, that is a reasonable indication of the attitude of the insurance industry to this issue both here and in the UK.</P>
    <P>I want to deal very briefly with a few <Col N="1427" /> aspects of the report, particularly page 24, on which the letter is silent.  The report states that the no claims bonus element largely contributes to the differential between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  In the Republic of Ireland, the full no claims bonus varies between 40 and 55 per cent, with one company giving 70 per cent full no claims bonus.  With the exception of that company, the average is 40 to 55 per cent while the corresponding figure in the UK is 60 to 65 per cent.  I do not know if using the term &ldquo;rip off&rdquo; would be a little over the top but I am disappointed that the report did not justify the 20 per cent difference and, more to the point, I am amazed that the covering letter which sought to interpret this report should be silent on that aspect.  The only reference to age is on page 25 where two cases are instanced.  In the case of a 37 year old male requiring comprehensive cover, there is a 33 per cent premium variation in the Republic over that in the UK, but in relation to a 24 year old male the difference is 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>The table on page 28 signifies that the claims frequency in the Republic is substantially lower than in the United Kingdom.  This letter does not refer to that fact.  The report states that to a very great extent, that is compensated for by a high accident-casualty rate in the UK especially in the minor injury category, a higher incidence of vehicle thefts in the UK &mdash; I thought we were fairly up in that league ourselves &mdash; and a tendency not to claim in the Republic in regard to minor damage incidents.</P>
    <P>In regard to what needs to be done, a number of things were mentioned.  I agree that there is need to tighten the law.  I believe there is merit in the Fine Gael proposals I outlined in relation to young drivers.  The attitude of the courts must be looked at.  I am disappointed that the Coopers and Lybrand's report did not give examples of the compensation levels for similar claims in the United Kingdom and the Republic.  I wonder why they failed to do so.  That is one essential element that is missing from the report. <Col N="1428" /> The insurance industry should examine very closely how premiums can be reduced and not try to wash their hands of responsibility by sheltering behind favourable extracts from the Coopers and Lybrand report.  There is an obligation on us all to see what we can do.  Perhaps if we were not constrained by time we could develop what we, as legislators, could do.  Unfortunately, I have been beaten by the clock.</P>

      <P>I had a motion before the Seanad some time ago dealing with motor insurance and that in some way might have contributed to the production of this very glossy report because the matter was also debated in the Dáil.  I say congratulations; it is a wonderful report, an excellent report.  I am sure every insurance company was singing with joy. Coopers and Lybrand could not have done a better job for the insurance companies but to hell with the rest of the community.</P>
      <P>The report states that some occupations are regarded as likely to result in higher risks, for example, students, journalists and actors.  That is a false statement.  It is not that they are regarded as &ldquo;likely&rdquo; but &ldquo;definitely&rdquo;.  Anyone listening to the radio the other morning heard a list of occupations, plumbers, bakers and so on; every man with a trade is included.  There must be at least 75 per cent of the insurance business blacklisted for higher premiums.  I can only include that it is another way of increasing insurance premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard spoke about comparisons in England and Ireland.  If they wanted to bring out a balanced report why not take Belfast to represent Dublin and Enniskillen to represent Tralee? Surely it would have been more sensible to take those two areas within the same country, and with a similar volume of cars and type of roads.  That would have lent credence to the report.  Is there any good reason somebody who lives in Beleek should pay 25 per cent less for insurance than the person who living in Ballyshannon three miles away?  Does anyone suggest there is a difference in driving attitudes, conduct, rules of the <Col N="1429" /> road, regulations or anything else between people living in different areas? Going to Cornwall and Cumbria to find areas to compare with Dublin and Tralee was a deliberate move to bring out such a report.  There is the old Irish saying that the man who pays the piper plays the tune.  They payed the piper and he played the tune to suit them.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe it takes longer to fit a tyre or a replacement bulb or headlamp in Ireland than it does in England. Anyone who had repairs carried out in garages in England knows that is not right.  I dismiss that report completely.  It is a glossy report solely and wholly for insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The jury system has been abolished in claims cases.  The high number of insurance cases settled on the day of the trial amazes me.  Anyone who has any experience of this knows that counsel advises one not to settle but as soon as one is on the steps of the courthouse he will say it would be best to settle now. He will quote several cases similar to the one being brought where the claimant lost.</P>

If the parties settle, then their time is not wasted defending in the courtroom.  Something must be done about that.  I said before that the no foal no fee system must be outlawed.  It is grossly unfair.  Why should people not go to court if it costs them nothing?  I do not have as high a regard for the law and the courts as I did, especially given some of their, decisions. There is no good reason someone who broke his leg in an accident in Dublin should get four or five times more than the man who broke his leg in Beleek.  It does not make sense.  They would probably have the same orthopaedic surgeon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating why insurance costs are so high.  Something must be done.  There is no competition.  It is a closed shop.  The biggest criminals on our roads are drunk drivers and there are many of them.  If somebody who has had an accident gets into an ambulance or goes into hospital before the garda arrives they cannot be tested to see if they had consumed an excess of alcohol. That law should be amended to take account of that.  If the tests are carried out in the hospital the results should be made available to the gardaí.  That is a loophole which is costing insurance companies and insurers a lot of money and it should be plugged.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the speed limit increased to at least 65 miles per hour.  It would be safer than to have it at 55 miles per hour because if everybody drove at 55 miles per hour there would be very big traffic jams.  If a person was driving at 55 miles per hour how could one pass him out without breaking the law?  People do not maintain a steady driving speed of 55 miles per hour.  Everyone would agree that 65 miles per hour would be appropriate, particularly on our main roads.</P>
      <P>On-the-spot fines could solve many problems but I will not elaborate on that at this stage.  Young drivers are discriminated against in a very big way. Young people who wish to work, particularly those living in rural Ireland where there is no transport service, must have a car, yet they are ripped off by the insurance company.  There should be a flat rate premium of £500, £700 or whatever. If the young person has an accident and it is their own fault, they could increase the cost of insurance to £2,000. It is grossly unfair to put a loading on somebody for a crime they have not committed. That is unjust and something should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts are chock-a-block with cases.  Insurance companies say it is cheaper <Col N="1431" /> to settle a claim for £700 or £800 than go to court.  So, regardless of whether one is right or wrong if someone puts in a claim against you, insurance companies will settle it automatically.  That is grossly unfair.  If everyone who submits a claim is paid, it will push up the cost of premiums. I know of cases where people want the claim to be contested but the company say they will settle because it would cost too much to go to court.  That is an issue we could talk about for a long time.  I hope today's debate will ensure that something will be done about the high cost of insurance.  I appeal to the Minister to bring in rules and regulations to curb the high price of insurance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I am sure he has heard enough about beef at this stage to last him for the rest of his life.  The meat industry in Ireland is quite different from that in any of our European counterparts.  Indeed, I can think of no other country in the world, with the exception of New Zealand, which has got such a dependence upon grass-based products, particularly beef and mutton. We are also in an unusual situation in the Community in that we have 600 per cent self-sufficiency in beef.  As a consequence, <Col N="1432" /> we are exporting 85 per cent of the product.  That means, of course, that we have greater difficulty getting to the main markets than most of our European competitors.  To put it in context as far as the beef and mutton are concerned, they make up about 45 per cent of gross agricultural output and supply roughly 25p in every pound of net foreign earnings as well as giving jobs to thousands in the processing sector.  Very importantly, all these jobs are based in rural areas.  That is a consideration we cannot overlook.</P>
      <P>We call this an industry, but as far as I am concerned it is anything but an industry; it is more of an accident than an industry.  That is why it is so accident prone.  It has never been planned.  It has largely been built up by people who started out as cattle dealers, cattle tanglers, unlike the dairying industry which was managed, planned and expanded by professionals who were trained, I am proud to say, in my own faculty in University College, Cork.  That leaves us in a very weak situation inasmuch as we are very dependent now upon intervention buying.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to tell this House that last year 88 per cent of all steer beef in Ireland went into intervention.  That is an appalling figure.  It got worse every year in the 1980s.  Ten years ago we had much more dependence on intervention. We are now facing into a situation where, due to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are going to have very restricted intervention in the future. Additionally, within the GATT negotiations there will be pressure to reduce the availability of intervention.  Above all, other countries, especially the US and the Cairns group, have targeted export refunds, on which we depend very heavily because we export a large amount of our beef out of the Community.  All in all, our beef industry is facing a rather rough time.  As a consequence, the economy is facing a rough time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our two main meat processors, Goodman and UMP, are in trouble.  About 12 months ago I spoke on the Goodman factories here.  I said at that time that <Col N="1433" /> they should have been allowed to go into receivership.  I said that the banks, who gave hundreds of millions of pounds in unsecured loans, should have taken the rap.  I could not see why Irish people should end up paying the hundreds of millions that were owed, because that is effectively what would happen.  The only way the banks could get their hundreds of millions was by the processor reducing the price of livestock and in various other ways.  Effectively, the international banks &mdash; because there was only £10 million of money from Irish banks involved &mdash; would be squeezing hundreds of millions of pounds out of the Irish economy. I believed then it should have been kept going under a liquidator and the various units sold off to interests which would not be burdened by the debt and could carry the industry forward in a more planned and rational fashion.  I say the same thing here today.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am disagreeing with some of my colleagues in the other House, but at least I am going to be consistent.  I see no reason why taxpayers' money should be used to bail out and effectively to ensure that foreign banks again get money they put in.  I believe banks are in the business of risk taking.  If you are taking risks, you occasionally pay the penalty.  I do not see why the Irish taxpayers should be expected to pick up the tab and let the banks off, when obviously they neglected to supervise the management of the plants to which they had lent whatever amount of money.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I would hope that the liquidator, whom I understand is now in Mayo, will manage, with the aid of funds from Irish banks and perhaps some help from the Government, to keep the units functioning, to secure the jobs of those people who are in a desperate plight at the moment and to pay the farmers who are left once again without money for cattle they have produced.  It is a gross misjustice that that should ever be allowed to happen.  It has happened already here in the past.  Twice in my memory farmers were left without their money in the Clover Meats debacle.  That should not be allowed to happen.  We <Col N="1434" /> need legislation to protect producers and traders.</P>
    <P>It may come as a surprise to the House to know that people who sell cattle through marts are protected, because the marts are covered by the Auctioneers and Agents Act, 1967.  There is a requirement there to put up a bond so that the seller will be protected and get the money.  It may also come as a surprise to learn that as far back as 1921 the US brought forward legislation which they called the Packers and Stockyard Act, 1921.  That Act required all operators in the livestock and meat sectors to put up a bond to ensure that people who were owed money would be paid.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why various Governments did not take steps in all of those years to ensure that the like of this could never happen again, to ensure that people who are making very little money and in some cases no money on the cattle &mdash; even losing money in some cases &mdash; would at least get the price they had hoped they were getting and that the cheques would be honoured.</P>
    <P>This is a particularly sad situation because most of these plants are located in a part of the country which is denuded of population due to emigration and which depend extremely heavily on farming, and particularly on food processing. For these plants which are located west of a line by and large from Charleville to Sligo to be allowed to close would, indeed, be a major disaster for the west of Ireland.  It would also be a disaster for other reasons.</P>
    <P>Closing off 30 per cent of the lamb processing at this time of year, when we are coming into peak lamb processing time, would effectively destroy the market and any real competition we had for the lambs.  Farmers would take a disastrous price for them.  Second, in relation to beef, closing down 15 per cent of our meat processing would only ensure that the Goodman organisation would increase their percentage of the total kill, thereby giving Goodman an even greater dominance in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I said in the European Parliament in 1987 when I brought a motion before <Col N="1435" /> Parliament that the Commissioner responsible for competition should take a look at the beef sector in Ireland.  I was concerned about the dominance of the Goodman group at that time.  It was not a very popular or, indeed, profitable exercise to be engaged in at that time.  I believe there was no real competition, and there was price fixing.  I got very little support at that time, but subsequently I noticed that more people agreed with me. On 11 November 1990 I noted that Commissioner MacSharry accused the Irish beef processors of price fixing, so it was out in the open at last.  Here we have a situation where the biggest beef processor is going to get bigger still if UMP is allowed to close down.  I do not believe it will close down.  At least some part of it will stay the course, but that will require urgent action by the Minister, the Government and the Irish banks who, incidentally, are very free with risking their money in Britain and the US but are extremely reluctant to take any chance with their money to develop native industry, particularly in the food processing sector.</P>
    <P>It probably came as a surprise to most people to learn that of the £500 million owed by Mr. Goodman only about £10 million was from Irish banks.  There had been up around £100 million, and they reduced it to about £10 million before the collapse occurred.  That must make foreign banks very suspicious of what is going on in Ireland.  It must make them feel that the Irish banks knew something and got out before the collapse.  I hope they would at least at this late stage risk some of their money to secure the jobs in UMP and ensure that the producers are paid for their livestock.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a moment on the agriculture policy as far as the beef sector is concerned.  We in Ireland made our share of mistakes in relation to beef; we made little else but mistakes.  It cannot be said that the Commission did a great job on it.  How could we commend a Commission that presided over a policy which went in the following direction? In 1987 every live animal produced in <Col N="1436" /> Ireland cost the taxpayer £250, of which the Irish producer got 13 per cent.  By 1990 the cost to the taxpayer had gone to £500 per animal, of which the Irish producer got 8 per cent.  The cold stores, and presumably the processors and various other people in between, creamed it all off.  While the farmers' income was dropping dramatically the cost to the consumer was going up equally dramatically. There has been no attempt either at Commission level or, indeed, here in Ireland to reduce our seasonality.  On the contrary, seasonality has been encouraged particularly by Aids to Private Storage which we had in vogue in the late eighties; they have been withdrawn since.  Intervention selling enocurages seasonality, because if a man can get the same price for an animal in October as he can get in April &mdash; an animal that is going into intervention &mdash; he will go for the animal that is cheaper to produce.  We are now in a situation where seasonality is significantly worse than it was ten to 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>We need to organise ourselves in a manner which will ensure a reasonably constant supply of material.  If we get the right quality product at the right price and in continuous supply, that is the only way we can break into the marketplace. About this time last year I heard the chief buyer of Tesco's speaking in Kinsale.  He outlined what his company did in relation to beef.  They started a programme at farm level, selecting their producers and telling the producers in detail exactly what they wanted, having the cattle killed as they wanted them, hung as they wanted them, and so on; I believe the Minister was present at that meeting. During the discussion the chief buyer was asked what impact that had on their sales of steak.  Their sales of steak at the time when beef consumption was dropping dramatically increased by 250 per cent. In other words if we go about it the right way we can gain market share.  That means that in future we start planning at the consumer's plate, not as we did in the past at the producer's plough.  That means a total shift in thinking.  That means that we go from the consumer <Col N="1437" /> back.  Every link in the chain must be put in place and be equally strong.  If a link snaps, we are going to lose out.</P>
    <P>At the moment, there seems to be no planning at any level in the industry from producer to consumer.  The only philosophy seems to be to get rich quick, particularly among the processors.  That attitude of knocking as much as you can out of grants, loans, subsidies and intervention is a short term policy which has come a cropper and we are all, in one way or another, paying the price.</P>
    <P>In the short term, I hope the Minister will be able to get good, reputable companies interested in buying some, or all, of the UMP plants.  Our co-ops withdrew from processing in the meat sector and I hope they will return to it.  However, I know from talking to them that they will not in any significant way get involved further in this area until they are confident there will be a level playing pitch. In other words, they must be confident that opposition will not be cutting corners. They must be sure that the people operating plants, owned by private individuals, will be playing the game according to the rules.  If that happens, and if Avonmore, Golden Vale, Dairygold and Kerry increase their share, I think the future of the beef industry and, indeed, the red meat industry could be assured, but it will not happen overnight.  It will take planning and discipline on the part of producers and processors.  It will take a major effort in terms of investment to generate markets particularly on mainland Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Given what is happening today, he has had a difficult day and he will be involved in other negotiations.  We appreciate his presence here today.  I would like to commend him for the efforts he is making to procure a favourable resolution of what has become a terrible problem, particularly for people living in the west.  I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to thank the Leader and the Whips for facilitating this debate. It is very good to see that the House can respond speedily and quickly to topical <Col N="1438" /> matters of this nature and address them when they are of enormous public concern. We should reflect that public concern. It is good that we can have this debate and the Leader and the Whips are to be thanked in that respect.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the closure of the UMP plants &mdash; and we hope it may not be a closure &mdash; have been pretty well documented throughout the day.  There is perhaps no great need for me to go into them in enormous detail other than to say that all of us are terribly concerned about the 400 people involved in this predicament.  The full-time employees of the UMP group and the other 600 part-time employees find themselves in this predicament.  That is where the human tragedy lies.</P>
    <P>Another group of people we must be concerned about are the farmers and the suppliers to the plants, but particularly those who have supplied cattle over the past few weeks and may now have to seek recourse to get their money back.  I understand that it has been certified by the examiner that £2.25 million was paid out during the period of his examinership as being due to farmers.  I know that a figure of £1.5 million was quoted in the paper this morning, but I would really like to know how much is outstanding to farmers and what hopes they have of recovering these moneys particularly where they were paid by the examiner. My understanding of it is that they would be preferential creditors, that people who are paid by the examiner are entitled to their money in full.  Perhaps that has been clarified already in the other House today, but of course we are not meant to know what goes on there.  I will ask the question again because somebody was admonished for referring in the other House to us.  I only had that by hearsay, of course.  I would not have any first hand knowledge.</P>
    <P>There is a very facile suggestion that all of this occurred because £4 million was not advanced.  Of course, that is very wide of the mark indeed.  It was not a question of advancing £4 million; it was a question of whether £4 million would follow £45 or £50 million, or whatever <Col N="1439" /> the figure is, that is outstanding from this particular group.  It has also been suggested of course that their assets are of the order of £50 million and that in that respect their liabilities might look tolerable.  It needs to be pointed out however that the assets are only worth what can be got from them on the open market.  My suspicion is that on the open market they would be worth significantly less than the £50 million which was being plucked from the air.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past 24 hours comparisons have been made with the Goodman situation, with the fact that the Oireachtas was recalled and that it dealt with the difficulties in the Goodman organisation by the adoption of the Companies Bill.  We have not been so speedy in this respect.  Of course, the fact of the matter is that the procedure is exactly the same in both cases, the difference being that the examiner in the case of the Goodman group was able to find a solution and to bring the company forward, whereas in this particular case the examiner was not succesful.  Whether the examiner is successful or not, it is good that that particular legislation is on the Statute Book and that we have this procedure. The examiner can look into the affairs of the company and it can be put under the protection of the courts.  The legislation was right and it is still right.  It is not very helpful to say that the legislation was at fault.  It was very widely welcomed at the time.  People realised the necessity for it going into the autumn period when there was a huge kill.  The plants were able to operate and to handle the kill physically, apart altogether from the financial aspects, which of course would have been quite devastating had the company ceased to trade.  The examiner succeeded in that case.  In this particular case he has not succeeded and that is regrettable. However, when apportioning blame, it is not very helpful to point the finger at the examiner.</P>
    <P>Significant efforts had been made by the Minister and by other members of the Government from what I have heard, to try to resolve this problem.  The banks <Col N="1440" /> have a role and I will come to that in a moment.  The other point that occurs to me is this.  I have heard people blaming the Government, the banks and everybody in sight, but I have not heard anybody blaming the management.  For a company to get into this situation, the management must have had some role in getting it to a point where it cannot continue to trade.  How did these debts arise?  To what use was the borrowed money put?  Was it put to proper use? There is also the whole question of insurance.  The other thing that needs to be said, apart from the inability to raise £4 million from the banks, is that it was not a fire in Ballaghaderreen which caused the collapse of this group.  That is not the reason the group collapsed, nor did the failure of the examiner cause it.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the creditors for a moment and to ask again what is the status of the cheques that were paid by the examiner.  My understanding of it is &mdash; and the Minister is open to correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that cheques which were issued by the examiner have been returned.  Those cheques had preferential status, so I have difficulty about that and whether the amounts certified can be paid.  I understand that the examiner has to go back to court and vouch for these particular payments.</P>
    <P>We have to look carefully at the role of the banks and what their responsibilities are.  The one thing that would appal me above all else would be to find that it was inter-bank warfare which precipated this particular incident.  Certain banks may have appeared to have got off more lightly than others during the course of the Goodman debacle.  There is now a question of whether some banks are going to get their own back on the people who may have got rid of some of their liabilities prior to the collapse of the Goodman group.  If banks at war with one another could be so selfish and so obsessed by their own internal profits that they would completely disregard the quality of the life of an entire generation of people in the west of Ireland, that would not be acceptable banking.  I do not think that that is in the traditions of <Col N="1441" /> Irish banking, as I was brought up to know it.</P>
    <P>The examiner is on record as saying that he thought he could save the group. That again brings me back to the role of the banks.  Have they blocked payments from the examiner?  As I understand it, these cheques were stamped under the protection of the High Court.  What protection does the High Court give to these people?  Was it correct that one group were prepared to go ahead, but because others were not they decided that they could not?  There is the question of one group of banks getting better guarantees than the other group of banks.  We are back to the same thing.  To what extent is inter-bank rivalary at the heart of this particular difficulty?  The banks have a social responsibility as well as a financial responsibility.  The banks need to think of the consequences.  What are the consequences for the banking situation in the west of Ireland and in the rest of Ireland?  The suppliers to these companies are affected, the people with mortgages who work in these companies are affected.  All those people are in debt to the banks.  The banks need to remember that.</P>
    <P>Another matter of deep concern to us is the welfare of employees and some suggestions have been made as to how their jobs can be protected.  I know the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet and the two Progressive Democrat Ministers, Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley are trying to ensure that these jobs are protected.  The objective for the receiver must be to keep the plants going at all costs in order to sell them as a going concern.</P>
    <P>Trade in this area is sensitive; our products can be displaced from British supermarket shelves overnight, if continuity cannot be guaranteed or if product source is threatened.  The processing must continue, markets must be protected and I understand that the Minister will meet the receiver during the next 24 hours.  I hope he can find a solution which will take these matters into account.  The Coop plcs now so active in the dairy sector and in other sectors could involve themselves <Col N="1442" /> more in the beef sector.  The quality of their activities would enhance the beef sector.  I am confident they could operate profitably there to the advantage of the country and of farmers and employees in the food sector.</P>
    <P>UMP are responsible for something like 30 per cent of sheep and lambs killed and 15 per cent of cattle slaughtered in Ireland.  This brings us back to the matter even more apparent in the Goodman Group debacle of the consequences of particular groups achieving a dominant position within an industry; over half the Irish beef industry has collapsed into receivership in the past two years.  We need a rational debate on why the Irish beef processing industry has reached such a sorry state and how it came to rely on a couple of large players.  I am sure the House knows the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, has taken action to curtail possibilities for this type of dominance where ownership of factories falls into the hands of a small number of people.  There are lessons to be learned by all of us from the consequences of monopoly situations where financial troubles in one group inevitably affect large numbers of workers and farmers and threaten the survival of entire communities.  For that reason it is desirable to see the cooperatives involved.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that people in any part of the country should lose their jobs but it is particularly regrettable in the west of Ireland where such efforts are being made to revitalise rural communities.  I attended the large conference held in Galway at which the bishops launched their initiative on western rural development and I was very impressed by the spirit of self-help evinced there.  A crisis such as this is a body blow for that spirit of self-help and I hope it will not deter people from taking initiatives to improve the welfare of the people in the west.</P>
    <P>The beef industry has been gone into in detail by Senator Raftery and there is not much more for me to add.  I agree with what he says about the dominant role of intervention in the market but companies as commercial entities have <Col N="1443" /> identified intervention as the most profitable option and as long as intervention exists it will be capitalised on.  If, as I have heard, only 15 per cent of money from Brussels for beef support goes to farmers, why can processors not trade more profitably and thrive on 85 per cent of that money?  Farmers attempt to live on prices received for cattle and the small proportion of money from Europe, yet those who get so much more proportionately do not seem to be able to conduct their affairs efficiently or to continue to trade profitably.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report identified the potential of our beef and food processing industries and I hope that potential will be realised and protected.  The Minister when he was a junior Minister was active in promoting that potential.  Out of this incident may we go forward to protect jobs in the west and to protect the livelihoods of all our people by developing an industry we can be proud of instead of one of which at times we are ashamed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his new appointment; I know he has particular expertise and ability in this area. As somebody who comes originally from the west, having been born and reared in Sligo where there is a UMP factory, I am concerned about recent developments in UMP.  It seems like a tragedy that in one fell swoop 1,500 jobs should be lost and virtually 1,500 families affected.  Most of the jobs in questions were permanent; and an industry and jobs which were perceived as permanent now seem about to go down the tubes overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I query the position of management. How could a company possibly accumulate a debt of £50 million?  It is insufficient to blame everything on the fire in the UMP factory at Ballaghaderreen.  The situation must have been seriously out of hand prior to that and now that the situation is further compounded by the banks' refusal to co-operate, we have a classical situation of profit before people, and entire communities in Sligo, Roscommon and Mayo are put at risk.  Concern <Col N="1444" /> for those communities must be the bottom line for us.  We cannot under any circumstances turn our backs on communities dependent on UMP jobs and on funding generated from this branch of the beef industry.  Agri-business is our single most important indigenous industry. It is a shame that it has been allowed to develop on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, with no overall organisation, no short term or long term policy.  The industry has degenerated into a monopolistic concern controlled by a tiny number of individuals, a situation which should never have arisen in an indigenous industry, our largest exporting industry situated at the heart of many Irish communities.</P>
    <P>We must look at the effect of this current devastating blow on communities that have been hard hit in the past by emigration, loss of jobs and lack of morale.  An area along the western seaboard that has experienced endemic unemployment is now going to find itself pulverised by this development.  The entire community will be affected because cash will not be there to be spent. Suppliers will not be able to supply goods as the cash will not be forthcoming. Cheques, it appears now, are not going to be honoured in certain areas.  This unbelievable situation follows on other employment disasters along the borders of Sligo-Leitrim.  The coal industry in Arigna was hit suddenly by decisions taken by the ESB and the workforce of 250 people in Arigna lost their jobs.  On one hand we talk about creating a jobs forum and, on the other, we cannot guarantee the retention of jobs in areas of viable industry.</P>
    <P>Mr. Guilfoyle, as examiner, has tried to bring together the banks involved &mdash; The Banque Nationale de Paris, Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland &mdash; and has failed.  It is hard for the lay person to understand why there could not be mutual agreement on what is necessary in the short term to avoid receivership. The Banque Nationale de Paris was interested and I understand that the Irish banks would have had first claim on the company's remaining assets; the French banks were allowing the Irish banks first <Col N="1445" /> claim if it ended in liabilities.  There appears to have been some internecine warfare between the Irish banks and the Banque Nationale de Paris and I would like to know the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>Why was one bank prepared to go ahead and why did two others refuse?  As a Government we have to do what was done in the Goodman bail out.  There, the banks were virtually compelled to sit around the table, to take hard decisions and to accept that it was in their interests to ensure that the company did not go into liquidation.  In this case the examiner has failed to achieve that outcome because of the rigidity of the Irish banks' stance; the company is being forced into receivership so that the operation can be restructured and the banks can divest themselves of debts of £50 million.  In other words, the assets will be stripped away and we will end up with a fractured operation.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see who will gain here other than the banks.  The conditions they insist upon to resolve the problem are not in the interests of the local communities but in the interests of the banks' profit agenda.  Our priority and the Government's priority must be to protect the interests of local communities, but the banks have been allowed to dictate the agenda which will result in loss of jobs, rationalisation of various factories and inevitable closures.  That will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>Questions have to be asked of the banks before we consent to receivership and the Minister will meet the receiver during the next 24 to 48 hours.  If receivership involves restructuring what will the consequences be for jobs?  Are we putting the cart before the horse?  Can we guarantee that jobs will not be lost, that the package put together by the receiver will retain existing jobs?  I do not think that conclusion will be forthcoming from the receiver.  The banks have taken a hard headed approach to guarantee their profitability and competitiveness in a <i>laissezfaire</i> market-place.</P>
    <P>In the Goodman affair, the Government recalled the Dáil to enact legislation, the Companies Bill, to ensure a <Col N="1446" /> bailing out process and funding to prevent the company going bust.  That showed initiative and has been largely successful.  The banks came together and pressure was put on them to comply, but in this instance the banks are applying the pressure, which is wrong.  The Government like Pontius Pilate has washed their hands, and said: We will allow UMP to pass from examiner to receiver subject to conditions imposed by the banks.  Communities in the west are being thrown to the wolves and the Minister must intervene at this point.  His talks with the receiver will be crucial in deciding the outcome for UMP.</P>
    <P>UMP's closure will have devastating effects on farmers already savaged by the reduction in beef and lamb prices; all areas of the west are currently expressing low morale.  Anybody travelling around isolated farming areas and rural towns, crossing the hinterland of Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Donegal and north Galway, will perceive the sadness of the situation; there is little optimism there about the future of farming.  Unless we take a positive interventionist approach to preserve these jobs the outcome will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>We need also to look at the long term future of the beef and meat industry.  This extremely important industry has been allowed to go from step to step on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis without any Government long term plans.  We need a short term plan to save United Meat Packers but the long term plan is even more important and should have been put in place some time ago.</P>
    <P>What is our vision for the development of the agri-business?  Can we afford to allow one company like the Goodman company to control most of the beef business? Can we allow another company to go bust with no explanation as to how debts of £50 million were accumulated without public knowledge?  What is the desirable level of supervision in this most important industry?  What are our plans to extend the marketing and processing of beef?  All this must be dealt with in the long term.  Given the failure of the two biggest beef companies, the Goodman <Col N="1447" /> company and now the UMP company, the agri-business is clearly not founded on firm ground.  It is imperative that the Government intervene to prevent an important national resource being allowed to continue without supervision, without a plan and unprotected from monopolising.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years this country has faced a number of crises similar to this one.  In every single case it has fallen to the Government to spearhead a response.  The Goodman affair was not an isolated event; there have been others. The Government intervened quickly in that case and in the ICI affair, where the banks were rescued from the consequences of ICI's collapse.  The Government were criticised for their part in the ICI affair but their action ensured that the banks were not undermined by the effects of the ICI affair.  Similarly, when Dublin Gas faced a crisis the Government took action to save the situation. The best example of Government intervention occurred in the PMPA affair.  When the PMPA faced liquidation an administrator was appointed, legislation introduced and an ailing company saved.  The PMPA are now trading satisfactorily again thanks to a levy put on insurance premia at the time and Government assistance to devise a viable solution.</P>
    <P>There are precedents, in the Goodman affair, in Dublin Gas, in ICI, in PMPA for direct Government intervention to ensure that the implications of industrial fallout on large numbers of vulnerable people are not sustained.  UMP is a perfect example of such a crisis and the Government have no choice but to take the initiative.  There is a perception abroad already that the Government are doing very little for the west.  The bishops have had to take the initiative in job creation and in trying to stem emigration; the Government are not able to sustain and retain existing employment there.  It will look very bad if Deputies on the Government side go home at the weekend and tell their communities that the Government do not have an answer to <Col N="1448" /> their problems.  They are leaving it <i>lais-sez-faire</i> fashion in the hands of the receiver.</P>
    <P>The farming industry and the agri-business are organised separately.  EC supports coming through under the Common Agricultural Policy are not being channelled to the farmer.  Scandalously, less than 20 per cent of the money coming through from the EC over the last 20 years has reached the pockets of the producers. Obviously well heeled operations, and brokerages of one type or another exist among producers, hauliers, processors and others.  We do not seem to know where the money goes, but it is not going to the prime producer and that matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>We have asked on numerous occasions in this House for a debate on the operations of the banks and have not had it yet.  The banks are not fulfilling their national responsibility and are being allowed to impose conditions in areas subject to a national policy.  We need a debate in this House on how the banks do their business, because they do not have a <i>carte blanche</i> to operate as they wish.  There is evidently another agenda here behind the scenes putting profits once more before people.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to hear what the Senators have to say on this tragic situation which is completely outside the control of the Government and of the Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  We have to face up to the problem and see how we can help to resolve it.  I appreciate the constructive contributions made by Senators and will remain on to listen to the remaining contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to record a few points in relation to my own and the Government's involvement in this matter.  The UMP group's financial difficulties have been rumoured for some time.  It appears that a reorganisation of the group's debt structure was necessary following discussions with its main bankers, a syndicate of seven banks, lead by the Banque Nationale de Paris.  The problem which brought <Col N="1449" /> about this immediate crisis was the fire at the Ballaghdarreen plant.  Short term credit facilities of some £15 million were arranged to help the group survive in the aftermath of the fire.  When repayments on these loans became overdue, Mr. Des Guilfoyle was appointed examiner to the group by the High Court on 17 February last with permission to borrow £3 million. On 2 March 1992 he was given permission for further borrowings of up to £4 million. On last Monday, 9 March, his period of examinership was extended for a further week to enable him overcome substantial difficulties he had encountered in arranging a financial package to enable him to continue to operate the group while he prepared a report on its viability for the High Court.  Intensive negotiations have taken place since Monday between Mr. Guilfoyle and the three banks involved, BNP, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  These discussions concluded late yesterday afternoon and it was not possible to find agreement on additional funding.</P>
    <P>The Irish banks had the strongest reservations about the prospects of a positive outcome of the examinership.  They believed that if moneys were put forward now this would simply delay an inevitable complete overhaul of the UMP operation. Accordingly they were not willing to put forward the necessary funds. Under intense pressure from Government circles the two main Irish banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, came together with the examiner.  They agreed to provide the required cash of £4 million, but only on the strict condition that this money would be repaid at the end of the examinership.  They made it abundantly clear that they did not wish to be involved in the UMP operation on a longer term basis.  The examiner could not satisfy this condition as he could not guarantee that the money would be available at the end of the examinership.  Alternative proposals for super-preferential status were rejected by the banks.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, my colleague, Deputy B. Ahern, Minister for Finance, contacted the President of BNP in Paris and asked the bank to reconsider its <Col N="1450" /> decision.  It was all to no avail.  The essential difficulty which could not be overcome was a failure to achieve consensus between the banks on how to deal with the huge burden of overhanging debt. That is what I meant about it being a sad day when Government, State agencies and Members of the Dáil and Seanad are faced with a commercial company that has a massive debt problem.  If companies want to operate in the commercial world, they should have a sufficiently prudent management in place who would not allow this to happen because they have a responsibility to their workforce and creditors to run a good show.  They cannot expect Governments or State agencies to ask the taxpayer to bail them out when they run into a problem like this.</P>
    <P>As late as this morning my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has had a meeting with top executives from the two main Irish banks, AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  The Minister impressed upon them the concern of Government that they should act in the national interest in protecting jobs and in assisting an industry of vital national importance which has excellent propects for the longer term. The banks have responded in a very positive manner and they have indicated unequivocally their wish to act immediately and constructively in finding the best possible solution to the present crisis.</P>
    <P>The banks are ready to work with the receiver in providing working capital to secure an immediate resumption of activity in all the plants.  The banks are also ready to provide the necessary financial support for potential purchasers of individual plants.  The Irish banks believe that the only constructive way forward is to remove the very large burden of debt on this company.  They confirm that there would be no problem about providing £4 million but they felt that this would serve no useful purpose because of the large overhang of debt which is of the order of £50 million.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the positive response that has come this morning from the Irish banks.  I welcome, in particular, <Col N="1451" /> this support for continuing operations in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the real difficulty is with the west of Ireland plants.  I understand that there is no difficulty finding purchasers for the southern plants who will keep them as a going concern with their full complement of jobs.  We are extremely concerned about the west and to ensure that those plants are maintained as going concerns, that jobs are retained and that small creditors and farmer creditors are protected as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Banque Nationale de Paris, the main creditor, will also respond positively so that jobs can be protected and that a strong and viable industry will emerge from the receivership.</P>
    <P>Many unfounded allegations and criticisms have been made, some of them downright dishonest and untruthful.  I want to refer in particular to the allegations made in many quarters that the Government showed more energy in the Goodman situation than on this occasion. For the benefit of this House I want to put the record straight.  The Government gave no money whatsoever &mdash; not a penny &mdash; to rescue the Goodman group. What the Government did do was to speed up the enactment of the same legislation which has now been used to appoint an examiner to the UMP group. After that it was a matter for the banks involved to come up with a rescue package, which they did.  The Goodman case was different to this one in that a large number of bankers were directly involved in the Goodman case but, in this case, there was one main banker, the BNP group.  When the Irish banks were asked to become involved, their attitude was why should they be involved with that massive debt when they were not the main bankers involved.</P>
    <P>Once the examiner was appointed to the Goodman group, no further action was taken by the Government, unlike the UMP case, where there were long discussions and strenuous efforts made by Ministers, officials and State agencies <Col N="1452" /> together with the banks and examiners to find a solution to the problem.  Given the size of the company's liabilities, a constructive receivership is the best method of ensuring that the plants will continue in operation and that jobs will be protected.  With receivership one puts the overhang of debt to one side; it does not cloud the issue.  As Senator Raftery said, that was a risk taken by the banks concerned.  If they are at a loss because their assessment of the company was not as good as it should have been, so be it. As far as the taxpayer, the creditors and farmer suppliers to the company are concerned the debt is taken out of way and a fresh start can be made.  There is every reason to believe that the plants will be bought from the receiver.  On that basis, they would commence their operations free of the large debt that has encumbered UMP.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis make the point that it would be welcome if the co-ops and plcs not already involved in the beef and meat business became involved.  They have a tremendous record in the dairy industry. They have a record for good management, they are farmer controlled and they have a quality product which, unfortunately, has not been the case in the beef industry.  I would like to see Avonmore, Dairygold, Golden Vale and others involved.  Then we would have a more broadly based and better structured industry.</P>
    <P>In the Goodman case, the banks largely controlled that operation and their first priority was to get their money back.  If UMP continued on the same basis, the banks would control about 60 per cent of the beef industry and their first priority would be for a return of their money, and the only way that could be done would be by squeezing margins to the farmers and taking it out of the industry.</P>
    <P>There is an inherent profitability in the beef and sheep industries and I have no doubt that these plants will go on to operate profitably.  As I mentioned earlier, the banks have given undertakings that <Col N="1453" /> they will be willing to fund the purchase and ongoing operations of the plants.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to inform the House that I have spoken to the receiver, Mr. John Donnelly, and I have arranged to meet him tomorrow in Agriculture House.  I will be putting to Mr. Donnelly that the Government's priority in this matter is the preservation of the jobs involved through keeping the plants operating and through their earliest possible sale.  I will also discuss with him the need to protect, in so far as is possible, the position of the farmer creditors and the other small creditors.  I will offer the receiver my fullest co-operation and that of my Department and of other Departments and agencies in finding a way through this impasse which will be to the benefit of the economy, the food industry and the farming community.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the co-operation of all concerned, the future of all UMP plants will be secured as a result of this receivership.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> Having said that, I take the Minister and his Government to task.  This is a serious issue and there are many aspects to it.  We have the catastrophe in the meat sector.  This group together with the Goodman group accounted for a massive proportion of the Irish meat trade and there are question marks over the desirability of two giants controlling such a huge sector which is vital to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the social consequences of this for many people, especially those in the west.  There are all kinds of question marks about the position of the banks in relation to development issues.  The bottom line ultimately is what the Government perceive as their role in this issue, what input will they make and will they arrange for a satisfactory outcome to the issue?</P>
    <P>I come from County Mayo and wish to make the Minister and the House aware of the extent of this social catastrophe in the area where I live and explain why it is so different from an event of this nature happening in north Cork, Wexford, Waterford or in parts of Meath and Kildare.  Deputy Higgins when speaking in the Dáil referred to what he described as the black triangle.  In the eastern part of County Mayo successive censuses of population over the last 50 years have recorded that the biggest drop in population compared to every other rural district took place in the Swinford rural district, namely, the black triangle.  It is an area with very poor land, small farms and virtually no industry except a small tourist industry.</P>
    <P>When Halal, as it was called until recently, grew in Ballyhaunis from a very small company employing a few workers to a giant company, it became a huge part of the fabric of economic and social life in east Mayo.  The group had four plants and employed about 900 people. My understanding is that about 600 of these workers were employed in the two western plants which are relatively near one another.  They were only about 20 miles from one another one in Ballyhaunis and the other in Ballaghaderreen. As I said at the outset, this <Col N="1455" /> area is not like north Cork, Meath or Dublin.  There are no alternative employment opportunities there.  The traffic out of Knock to London has diminished as a result of the economic problems in Britain.  These workers cannot get on a plane at Knock and find a job in the south of England next week.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside entirely the meat sector and the problems therein or any intellectual arguments about the banks or objective arguments about the role of Government and whether they should intervene, this in human terms is a catastrophe for this part of Mayo and gave rise to the emotiveness among Deputies from the region in the Dáil.  I hope the Minister appreciates that there is an understandable, highly volatile reaction to what is happening in Ballyhaunis.  The Government must be aware of the dimension of the catastrophe and the Government must make a massive input to ensure a satisfactory outcome to this ugly mess.</P>
    <P>There are positive things in the sector. If there is anything basic in life it is food, and if there is anything basic about the Irish economy it is agriculture and animals. We are a member of the European Community and there is a support system there.  While markets from time to time are not satisfactory, there is a broad market for Irish beef and lamb.  I hope that restructuring will take place.  We have the necessary resources &mdash; grass, animals and markets.  Having said that, it is not all that simple.</P>
    <P>I see the point in not throwing £4 million, £5 million or £10 million after £60 million or £70 million.  It could be argued that to do so would be to shore up a highly geared unsatisfactory borrowing structure and, at the end of the day, would force the company to service the debt on massive overdrafts, leading to higher production costs than are desirable and, maybe in the medium term, an unsatisfactory deal for the farmer selling lamb and beef.  I can see that clearly.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the receivership as constructive receivership.  The merit in many receiverships is that one <Col N="1456" /> clears the debt, there is new management and a new broom sweeps clean.  There is a very solid, lean foundation and one takes it from there.  I go along with much of that argument.  The danger in it &mdash; we are talking about social issues here, not economics &mdash; is this: there is one plant in Charleville in north Cork which might very easily be picked up by one of the southern or south-western co-ops.  There is another plant in County Wexford adjacent to Waterford and Rosslare Harbour and the continental markets; it is a leaner unit and that may, in turn, be picked up.</P>

      <P>I am sure it will be, but I cannot speak with any certainty.  My fear is for the two plants in Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen which employ 600 of the 900 workers.  It may not be that easy to arrange that they are picked up in the market-place.  One of the consequences of a constructive receivership might be that the plants in the south-east and in Munster are picked up pretty smartly and there will be a big problem in Ballyhaunis.</P>

      <P>And of the problems as well.  The Senator will have time to speak on this and he might afford me the same privilege.  This is a deprived area.  At the end of the day the Government will have to take account of the position and address the issues.  The Minister said words in his speech which were nice to hear, but I want to see them <Col N="1457" /> implemented.  He spoke about the Government being, in his words, &ldquo;extremely concerned&rdquo; about the west. This is east Mayo and not west Mayo where there is a tourist industry and where in Westport there are about 1,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry. There is no fishing industry here.  This is the black triangle and there is an overwhelming responsibility on the Government to sort out the problem here.  We are talking about the means to solve this issue.  It is a little early today to propound the ultimate solution, given that the receiver has only been appointed and that we do not know the true internal position of the company.  No doubt that will be made known to the Minister at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the position of farmer creditors.  My understanding is that cheques totalling £4 million have been issued to farmers.  Some say that these cheques will bounce.  This must be investigated.</P>
      <P>The Minister had discussions with senior representatives of the two largest Irish banks, Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland.  We appealed to them to hang in there, but without success.  I was amused to hear the Minister say in his speech &mdash; it struck me as being very Irish &mdash; that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, spoke to the president of the Banque Nationale de Paris, having been rejected by senior executives in two Irish major banks, in an effort to help bail us out.  It is ironic and very Irish.  It is no wonder that the foreign bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point but if there is no core support from the major banks within the Irish system we will not get much mileage in Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It raises other questions about the banks and where we stand.  We had a debate in this House yesterday in relation to the development of Waterford Harbour, the new berthage, cranes and so on to facilitate lo-lo container traffic.  A <Col N="1458" /> massive proportion of the Irish trade is held in Waterford now, partly because of the death wish in relation to Dublin Port. There was a major European Community financial input and satisfactory negotiations were concluded with Bell Lines, one of the biggest shipping companies on this island.  The Minister asked for the consent of the House to very substantial loans being guaranteed by the Government. This is against the background of letters of comforts having been thrown out the door together with Government policy decisions in the last four to five years that there would be no Government guarantees for the future, that it would be viability all the way.  In fairness to the Minister, he pointed out that negotiations took place with a number of Irish banks leading to refusal in every case to get their feet wet on that project.  The reality was that there would be no new project at Waterford unless the people, through the Oireachtas, agreed to guarantees being given by the Government. There was a question mark over the banking system in relation to that just as there is about this issue and in many other areas as well.  It is for these reasons that there has been a consensus in this House on the entire issue of the banks and there has been a call for a debate by a Member of the Minister's party for some time which the Leader of the House has agreed to and which is to take place within a couple of weeks.  It is ironic. When we look at projects in Ireland in agriculture, industry and the services sector we see that they are financed from outside this country with very limited support from Irish banks.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely serious matter.  I have confidence that the issue will be sorted out if it gets the attention it deserves.  Food is scarce and we have all the resources necessary to produce meat. My huge concern as a Mayo man is the social issue in so far as the workers and farmers in the west are concerned.  I can objectively take on board what the Minister is trying to achieve by what he describes as constructive receivership.  I see the merit in cleaning up the debt and in the plants being picked up.  The plants <Col N="1459" /> in Munster and Leinster may well be picked up, but I fear the consequences for Ballyhaunis and for Ballaghaderreen. For these reasons, I would appreciate if the Minister, who will devote a great deal of time to this issue in the coming days and weeks, would bear my words in mind.  It is crucial that the Government, whatever the cost at the end of the day, given the horrific alternative of unemployment, make certain that the plants of Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen survive, not just as skeleton plants but as viable ones employing many people and handling lots of cattle and sheep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment and thank the Minister for attending here at short notice.  It shows the concern of the Minister. I know his schedule was interrupted by the House restructuring its order this morning.  However, the Minister has responded to that and I compliment him on it.  It shows how seriously he takes the matter and how seriously he takes the concern of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>As a Roscommon Senator, I would say that today has possibly been the worst day as far as Roscommon is concerned for a long time.  I say that in the knowledge that only two hours ago I left a meeting in Bord na Móna headquarters where they took a decision to walk away from a £30 million investment in the Derrynafadda Bogs and the developments in Ballyforan.  Earlier this year the Arigna Mines were closed.  The power station has not closed yet, but closure is on the way after 30 years.  Today we have a receiver in the Ballaghadereen plant, where between itself and Ballyhaunis there are 600 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any county that can survive an attack from the north-west, the north-east and the south in a period of a couple of months, and indeed in a period of a couple of days as far as two of the attacks are concerned, should be looked up to. However, I am not so sure that our county and the people living there will be able to withstand this on their own.  I plead with the Minister, the Government and State agencies to save Ballaghaderreen <Col N="1460" /> plant.  We do not have that much going for us in our county, but at least one thing we have are good, hardworking small farmers.  We have lots of sheep and good cattle.  We have a number of outlets, one of them being Ballaghaderren. If Ballaghaderren is allowed to go down then the whole area of north-west Roscommon will be isolated. This area is in a pretty desolate state as it is.  In fact emigration levels from north-west Roscommon are possibly only second to Leitrim, and that is a sad reflection on us all.  If the plant in Ballaghadereen is closed, that part of Roscommon will be a wildernes.</P>
    <P>Possibly 900 jobs nationaly could be lost as a result of this crisis.  Why is it that in a very popular industry where there are big profit margins, a £50 million debt could be allowed to accrue?  It is extraordinary that in a viable concern which has been in operation for 18 years a debt of £50 million was allowed to accumulate. Who is in charge of these operations?  A company who buy and sell products at a profit should not accumulate such debts. I do not believe that the right people are operating the meat industry at present.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Dardis's view that we will be far better off when the meat industry is in the hands of the co-operatives because we will then have people operating this industry who have a genuine interest in farming.  Farmers are hard working people and it is appalling that, tonight, farmers in the west have cheques for £5,000, £6,000, £10,000 and, I believe up to £14,000 that are not worth the paper they are written on.  The people in Roscommon have been through this before.  We remember Towey and that cheques were not honoured at that time. I am not asking for direct payment to this company, I ask the Government, the Minister and all involved to restructure this company with a view to maintaining jobs.  I am not worried abut the company going into receivership provided proper action is taken and that the people in charge do not run up a bill of £50 million. That is not the way the meat industry should develop; that is not the way to develop confidence in business and it is <Col N="1461" /> not the way to foster farmers' confidence in meat outlets.  There have been many revelations about the meat processing plants over the past few years which have destroyed the good name of meat processors at home and abroad.  Hopefully, some day farmers will taken on board what I believe to be their proper position, that is the proper organisation, processing, retailing and exporting of their own produce.  We would be much better off if that happened.</P>
    <P>What about the farmers who are owed money?  I understand that a couple of weeks ago a notice was put in the paper by the examiner guaranteeing that all cheques would be honoured.  Does that guarantee stand today?  The examiner left this morning and he is no longer in charge.  What is the position in regard to all those cheques that are owed to people around the west and, possibly, all around Ireland tonight?  Will the receiver honour the guarantee the examiner put in the paper; if not, it is another breach of confidence, another undermining of the credibility and confidence in Government support.  Confidence is of paramount importance where a farmer's livelihood &mdash; his earnings for the year &mdash; is tied up in one cheque.  In fact, 35 per cent of it might be owned to his own bank and his farm might be in jeopardy, not to mention the stock he has given away. I ask that the farmers be looked after.</P>
    <P>The 900 jobs which are at stake are just one aspect of this operation, there are many ancillary industries, the hauliers, the processors, the meat and bone meal people, etc. who make a living from United Meat Packers.  Those 900 people directly involved from one-third of the possible number of people who would eventually be involved if this operation is allowed to close.</P>
    <P>I am glad this debate has not been a political one; political point scoring would not benefit the young people and their families in Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, Charleville and elsewhere, who may not have money to pay their mortgage in a month's time.  I hope there is a consensus and a determined approach by all sides on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> Finally, I hope the Government and their agencies will support the people of Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, and those who worked for United Meat Packers. People will not be upset if the company goes into receivership provided their interests are looked after in in the restructuring of the company.  We, in Roscommon, wait for continued positive response from the Government and their agencies that they will protect the interests of the families in the west, particularly in Roscommon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to the House. The fact the Minister is present is a clear indication of the interests he and the Government have in this difficult problem. I also thank the Leader and the Whips for allowing this debate to take place.  I also compliment the Leader for extending the debate and thank the House for agreeing to let others who have an interest in this problem contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six speakers, all concerned with the west, have already contributed.  I do not wish to take from the west, but I want to remind the House and the Minister that there is also an east and a south-east of this country.  A sheep slaughtering plant in County Wexford, is also involved.  It should be noted that County Wexford has the second highest unemployment rate in the country.  That came about when agriculture started to go downhill and the agricultural services in Wexford collapsed.  I appeal to everybody &mdash; I am confident Senator Ó Cuív will join the campaign for the west &mdash; to remember that there are difficulties in the south-east also.  Senator Staunton inferred that there is no difficulty with Charleville or Camolin, that the problems there would right themselves.  The doors of Camolin are closed; there is nobody working there today.  If jobs are lost in United Meat Packers it will add to our difficulties.  The Minister mentioned the west as having particular problems but the south-east also has problems.  Therefore, I ask people to be even-handed when dealing with this issue.  Do not let anybody be conned into the belief that the banks or <Col N="1463" /> anyone else will be any more reasonable in regard to Wexford than in regard to the west, but I accept that the west has always had problems.  I was interested to hear Senator Staunton mention the development of the port at Waterford.  I will not mention all of the developments that have taken place in the west because we should not be competing; we should be here as a group of Senators looking after the people in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Finneran, spoke about the difficulty for farmers who have been paid by cheques that are not worth the paper they are written on and this is at a time when farmers need to buy fertilizer and other farming materials.  As Senator Finneran said, one of those cheques could represent a farmer's wages for a full year.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to tell us this evening that regardless of the procedures adopted &mdash; I hope his plans to keep those plants open will be adopted &mdash; and the farmers in question will be paid.  Too often in the past farmers have been left as non-preferential creditors as happened in the case of Clover Meats.</P>
    <P>As the slaughtering of cattle and sheep has ceased, farmers will have to keep their stock and feed them on fodder which is already in scarce supply.  Thankfully, we have had a mild winter and fodder is probably in greater supply than might otherwise be the case.  The fact that more sheep and cattle have to be kept on the land is disturbing the plans farmers set out to achieve at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>The necessity to reopen those plants immediately has been overlooked in this debate.  The Minister said the banks are prepared to play some role but he must apply stronger pressure on them because their cavalier attitude to these and other difficulties demonstrates total irresponsibility, and I make no apology for saying that.  Profit seems to be their only concern and that applies to Irish banks in particular.  The banks must be told they have a major responsibility to the industry, the workers and the farmers. I acknowledge that the Minister has a <Col N="1464" /> particular interest in this problem and that he has done all he can, but it is the immediacy of the problem I am talking about.  I understand the Minister is meeting the receiver tomorrow and that the receiver will do all he can to ensure the properties are sold and back in operation as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister to meet with the receiver, the farmers, the banks and the workers immediately to ensure that all interests are represented and that the non-operational plants will become operational as soon as possible, next week at the latest.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government have been criticised for not doing what they did in the Goodman case, but that should not dampen their enthusiasm.  This is a whole new ball game and an enormous number of people are facing ruin.  Having said that, the impression this morning was that the plant was gone and that the business was dead; it is not gone and I am sure this House will give its full support to the reopening of the plant as soon as possible and ensuring that anybody who has lost out will be fully compensated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtosach báire, gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht bheith sásta fanacht chomh deireanach seo tráthnóna agus an méid de ghnóthaí atá idir lámha aige.  Lá dubh, dorcha, dubhrónach é dúinne, go mór mhór san iarthar agus san oirdheisceart, an scéal seo faoi UMP.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for staying late for this debate.  It is important that we should be given an opportunity to express our strong feelings on this matter.  In passing, I might mention that a fish factory in Rossaveel in Connemara is also part of the UMP group and the future for those employees is also uncertain tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first concern is in relation to the payment of farmers.  When this problem arose in the travel industry, bonding was introduced.  However, following the failure of Clover Meats and many marts, we still have not instituted a system of bonding for farmers.  I hope that a system of bonding is instituted for the agri-business, both in marts and livestock plants, <Col N="1465" /> to ensure that all farmers' payments are bonded.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Senator Hugh Byrne, pointed out, the consequences of a farmer having sold a year's supply of cattle to a factory and not getting paid for them could result in tremendous knock-on social and human costs within the community.  We must also take cognizance of the position of the small suppliers, the transport people and the people who supply all sorts of raw materials to such a factory.  There are 900 jobs on the line with 1,800 people in support jobs who are also worried tonight.  The consequences for the sparsely populated area of the west are catastrophic because, aside from the physical consequences of potential loss of employment and ruin for farmers and suppliers, there is also the social consequence of the breaking of confidence that has been carefully built up over nearly 20 years.</P>
    <P>I remember dealing with Sher Rafique in 1975 and 1976, shortly after he came to this country, and I saw at first hand the tremendous potential for his business.  At that time we were exporting live lambs to Italy and following our lead he took on the marketing of lamb on the Italian market.  This was the first time that a steady outlet was provided for the small hill men of the west.  Over the years that market has ensured steady prices each autumn.  That is now gone.  I hope the people concerned &mdash; the Government, the banks and the agencies &mdash; will ensure that there is no break in the continuity of the operation in those factories.  They should immediately seek people to run them and ask the banks, particularly the Irish banks, to put up the finance to ensure that slaughtering will continue.  If this does not happen, the consequences are too serious to contemplate.  Some serious questions need to be answered. The IDA seem at times to encourage the big companies at the expense of the small ones.  As a result certain industries tend to be concentrated in too few hands which resulted in the serious of collapses in the beef trade in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Because we are an island nation there is a limit to the size of our market and <Col N="1466" /> supply.  I have always favoured a policy of diversity, ensuring that a maximum number of people are involved in the processing side of the industry.  If necessary there should be a marketing authority as in the dairy industry &mdash; An Bord Bainne &mdash; to ensure that a product is marketed internationally.  However, I have always opposed the policy that ensured that the number of big players in any industry are very small and that 80 per cent of an industry can be concentrated in a small number of hands.</P>
    <P>I think everybody knows the consequences of doing nothing.  I compliment the Minister on his efforts in this case and I appreciate the time and effort the Government have put in.  I hope the banks will ensure continuity of production. This company must be helped out of its financial debt.  If the company were to continue in business with a debt of £50 million, they would spend the next ten years working for the banks.  The banks took the risk, the risk went sour and as far as I am concerned, that is the banks' business, not ours.  The banks have the advantage of having access to information and should have to say why they took this risk.</P>
    <P>A receivership which would quickly dispose of the factories to people who would be able to manage them profitably, and which would not leave them with an outstanding debt, is the only rational way out of this problem.  The situation was allowed go too far to enable the company to be rescued in the normal way.  The amount of money to be repaid is too big. However, I want to stress the necessity to ensure continuity of supply or outlets for the farmers as well as work for the employees to ensure that confidence in that community is not eroded.</P>
    <P>Finally, we often talk about the cost of rescue packages and saving jobs, but for every job lost between the difference in income tax and PRSI revenue the State would get from the company as opposed to the cost of keeping the worker on social employment, is about £10,000 per annum.  In this case the loss of 900 jobs is a loss of £9 million per annum minimum, not to mention all the social <Col N="1467" /> consequences to the State.  If you take it every direct job creates two indirectly, you are talking about £27 million per annum.  When we look at it that way it becomes apparent why we should ensure that those 900 jobs, and the ancilliary jobs, are saved, that the factories continue to function and that this black day for the west is averted.  I hope there will be a sign &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; on the factories in the coming weeks and, since we have not yet instituted a system of bonding, that farmers would be guaranteed payment.  If not, the consequences for confidence in agriculture, particularly in the west, will be disastrous.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is the first time I have had an opportunity to congratulate him in his well deserved appointment.  Like everybody else, I am confident he will do a very good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef industry has been in crisis for almost 12 months and it is ironic that the second largest company is now in receivership.  We should review the beef situation and possibly, in the next debate on this issue, have a broader look at the potential for the beef industry.  The potential for job creation in the beef industry has not been tapped.  The potential for job creation in the added value products in the &ldquo;fifth quarter&rdquo;, as it is <Col N="1468" /> known has not been tapped; the potential for job creation is enormous.  The IDA and others have issued reports on this over the past 20 years but very few of their findings have been put into operation. It is time we had a look at the industry in the context of its potential for job creation, for added value, for better prices and better return to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt there is a great deal of concern among the workforce of UMP.  Over the weekend 900 will not know if they will have jobs this day week; I hope they will.  The Minister is confident they will.  I welcome that confidence and hope it bears fruit.  Some of the plants are very productive and, hopefully other meat processors will purchase them and bring their expertise to bear.  I congratulate Sher Rafique for the contribution he has made to the economy of the west and to other parts of Ireland, since 1974.  I have a particular interest in the Charleville area.</P>
