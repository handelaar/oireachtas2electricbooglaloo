      <P>I would like to welcome Senators back after the summer recess, looking refreshed.  I am sure we will have a non-controversial enlightened session which will be of benefit to the country and to ourselves and I look forward to that.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ó Cuív that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to provide resources to repair damage caused by coastal erosion in County Galway.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment, in view of the difficulties at Mount Usher Gardens, to provide funds for the immediate provision of sewerage systems to service Ashford and Rathnew for connection to the treatment works at Wicklow town.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator McGowan of the following:</P>
      <P>The difficulty that Irish citizens have in securing a visa to visit the United States while a citizen from Northern Ireland does not require a visa.</P>
      <P>I received a notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make an immediate provision of £50,000 for the rebuilding programme at the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin in line with the clearly <Col N="3" /> expressed wishes of Seanad Éireann and Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator Costello of the following:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that proper procedures in accordance with international human rights conventions and natural justice are put in place so that those seeking asylum in Ireland are humanely treated and their case fairly considered.</P>
    <P>I have received a notice from Senator Keogh of the following:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to confirm his commitment and that of the Government to the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, and, in particular, its ferry services.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to give approval for the contract for a new reservoir and town water tower at Castletroy, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Cuív, Ross, Norris, Costello, Keogh and Kennedy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ó Cuív's and Senator Ross's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello, Norris, Keogh and Kennedy may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator McGowan as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of Ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I give the Order of Business I am sure Members would like me, on their behalf, to congratulate President Robinson and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on their mission of mercy to Somalia.  I sincerely <Col N="4" /> hope all world leaders and those with power to improve the lives of people in Somalia will respond appropriately.</P>
      <P>On today's Order of Business, it is suggested that we take item No. 1 between now and 2 p.m. and item No. 2 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with Senator Wright in congratulating President Robinson on the major success of her trip to Somalia.  I would also like to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and to the Irish aid workers for the enormous contribution they are making.  Since the President is a former Member of this House where she spent most of her political career, it should give this House particular pride in the role she has carved out for herself and the contribution she has made.  I hope the Government will show their sincerity by moving rapidly to restore the level of ODA funding which has been cut very drastically in recent years.</P>
      <P>On today's Order of Business, may I say specifically that I misunderstood the Leader of the House about discussion of the EC motion ending at 2 p.m.  I would be happier if we gave two full hours to the EC motion and if Item No. 2 was taken after that.</P>
      <P>On looking at today's Order Paper I have to ask myself if it was for this the Wild Geese fled given the amount of insubstantial business on the agenda.  In view of the Cathaoirleach's exhortation to begin the session in a constructive way I ask the Leader of the House if he will give us, preferably today, a detailed schedule of the legislation to be taken this session.  Will he also arrange as soon as possible for a full-scale debate on the financial and economic crisis and for a debate on the Green Paper on Education which debate he has committed himself to, together with a debate on the old question of overseas development aid and Somalia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House appreciates the fact that we can now save our necks since a new clock has been <Col N="5" /> installed on the other side of the House. It will be very handy indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Murphy is happy with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to President Robinson.  On the Independent benches we take particular pleasure in this, since she left these benches to take on another role.  We are delighted she is doing so well and join in the congratulations to her and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews.  Some of our Members have put down a motion to that effect.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House there is a view that Fianna Fáil Members spent their holidays much further away from home than the rest of us.  There is a vicious rumour going around that Senator Honan is looking so well and that this means she did not stay in Clare for the entire three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>How much time did Senator O'Toole spend in Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appreciated that the Leader of the House arranged for this House to return at least at the same time as the Dáil.  Perhaps a work ethic will now permeate both houses of the Oireachtas.  I am not being negative about Members of this House who have always been available to do their work.</P>
      <P>I want to raise an urgent matter and that the need for a full comprehensive debate on the Green Paper on Education which was published before the recess. At the end of the last session a commitment to a discussion was given.  I know the Leader of the House is well disposed towards it and I hope he will respond positively.  &ldquo;Education for a Changing World&rdquo; needs to be addressed at Oireachtas level at an early stage before people take up strong positions on the subject in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to the President and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to all who went out to Somalia, including my colleague, Deputy <Col N="6" /> Michael D. Higgins.  This country, unfortunately, is going to have a continuing credibility problem as long as our ODA contributions continue to decline, placing us at the bottom of the league of developed nations in aid matters.  Could the Leader of the House indicate the present position in relation to the proposed foreign affairs committee?  It has a gestation period longer than that of the elephant and I wonder when and if we are going to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks regarding President Robinson's recent visit to Africa and the way in which she was able to focus enormous world attention on the plight of people there.  I hope the Irish Government will seize the opportunity to expand the role of the President which might encompass helping other nations and representing this country in ways that hitherto a President has not been allowed to do.  She is an extraordinarily credible person and capable of enhancing this country's image in many ways.  I hope the Government will take note of her international standing.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he will allocate for a full debate in this Chamber on the European Monetary System and the current currency crisis.  There is a need for Seanad Éireann to debate this issue in the immediate future and hope it will happen next week.  Members of this House have an enormous contribution to make in that area and we should not wait for the other Chamber to set the ball rolling.  It is now a matter of urgency that Ministers should address this House on the issue allowing Members here to make a reasonable and important contribution to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate President Robinson on her marvellous work in Somalia and Deputy Andrews, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who acquitted himself exceptionally well and who had been there previously.</P>

      <P>What about Kilkenny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate President Robinson on her initiative in going to Somalia and I also compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Her visit showed the wonderful contribution our voluntary organisations and many individual Irish people are making there.  Their efforts compare starkly with the decrease in overseas development and over the past number of years.  This has undermined to a degree the President's good work and the international publicity accorded to her.</P>
      <P>It is a pleasure to see three Bills before the Dáil at present that have passed this House.  They are the Electoral Bill, the Censorship of Films Bill and the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages Bill.  We took the initiative and now the Dáil starts a session by dealing with our legislation.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House to ensure that this House becomes and remains a forum for the initiation of important legislation such as the Electoral Bill which we had before the summer and a forum for the discussion of important issues.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Leader that we have an early debate on the economy specifically orientated towards job creation.  If we can deal with job creation all the other elements of the economy will fall into place.  We must have an early debate on the Green Paper on Education.  We have only got until the end of the month &mdash; according to the Minister for Education &mdash; to put forward proposals if we are going to have any say in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider introducing the White Paper on marital breakdown in this House so that it will be given a full and comprehensive debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to nominate a specific time for the education debate?  We may be the last forum for that debate.  The teacher <Col N="8" /> unions are holding conferences on it and have been doing so.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate President Robinson on her tremendous work in Somalia and to stress that it is not sufficient for us to say that the Irish are a giving people on a voluntary basis.  We are not showing the appropriate lead in Government when we fail to increase overseas development aid.  I also request an early debate on the White Paper on marital breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House to ascertain when the Solicitors Bill, which I understand has been debated in the other House will be introduced to this House. Will it be introduced this term?  Secondly, will the Leader of the House ascertain from the Minister for Justice if he will intervene further in the free legal aid dispute which is creating problems in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is not on the Order of Business but I am sure he will take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ludicrous that somebody caught red-handed importing £3.5 million worth of cannabas gets free legal aid with a view to avoiding justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt, you will agree with me that this House is not a place where major announcements are usually made.  May I thank Senator Honan for announcing that the Government have taken a decision to retain the Shannon stop-over?  I was glad to hear it.  I am not sure the Minister will be pleased that Senator Honan told us before the Minister announced it but I am sure Senator Honan, knowing her formidable talents, would not have made the announcement if it were not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan has her usual confidence in a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any temporary arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not relevant and Senator Ryan should not provoke other Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be able to provoke Senator Honan.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues about the wonderful work undertaken by our President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  As a frequent critic of the Government, I should like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his positive action on Somalia.  I hope the Government will follow through.  Can I say to Members that it is insufficient to tell the Government to increase ODA, if, at the same time, people demand that the Government reduce taxes.  The consequence of doing our duty at home and abroad is that we have to maintain a high level of taxation.  I support that and I invite my colleagues to be consistent and not to play games about important matters.</P>
      <P>If we debate overseas development aid and listen to the people in the Third World we will realise that we have to move beyond aid to human rights and solidarity. We will not solve their problems by financial aid alone although it is the immediate necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also ask the Leader to allow us to debate social welfare expenditure so that we may invite the Minister for Social Welfare to the House to clarify some of the more ominous comments he made during the past few months about what we can and cannot afford?  The State is spending a smaller proportion of gross national product on social welfare now than it did six years ago.  If the Minister thinks we are spending too much, he takes a different view from the rest of us and we could do with a detailed debate on that matter, where the Minister could explain many of his comments, perhaps unscripted, made outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.  His comments have <Col N="10" /> frightened many Irish people regarding their future prospects of a secure income. I would welcome an assurance from the Leader on such a debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the call by Senator Manning for a programme of legislation from the Leader and I hope it will be forthcoming.  I am anxious that the debate on the economic/financial position be divided into a debate on currency difficulties and then a separate debate on the jobs issue.  I hope the Leader of the House will ensure that a senior Minister such as the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Finance will be present when we give a specific response here concerning job creation. Our proposals should go to Government and a response follow.  The country expects that from this House.</P>
      <P>We have talked about the role of the Seanad.  Nothing would do more credit to the Seanad than such a debate.  We could not take a better initiative than to have a comprehensive detailed discussion on jobs shortly and to come up with specific solutions rather than a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I praise President Robinson for her excellent work and support calls for a debate on overseas development aid.  I also support my colleagues who called for a debate on the White Paper on marital breakdown.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to Motion 41 on the Order Paper.  Prior to the summer recess the Leader of the House agreed to a debate on the Sixth Report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies dealing with Bord na gCon and I now ask the Leader of the House when that debate will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the well deserved tributes paid to President Robinson and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seek two points of information from the Leader of the House.  I support the call by Senator Manning for an urgent debate on the recent and continuing difficulties in the financial markets and the resulting economic difficulties.  It is a very <Col N="11" /> serious issue and it is only right that such a debate be given priority in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated that there will be a second Finance Bill this year, dealing principally with the Single Market operative from 1 January 1993.  Could the Leader of the House indicate when that Bill is likely to come before the House?  I suggest to him that the Seanad might be the appropriate forum for the introduction of that Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate President Robinson on her wonderful work during her trip to Somalia and on her approach to her position as President.  She has been true to her promise to make the Presidency a more reflective and open office.</P>
      <P>With regard to today's business, namely, reports on developments in the EC, the time for this debate will probably be extended since the Order of Business has taken so long.  In the present climate I do not think these reports can be separated from the overall economic situation. Senator Cullen called for an open debate on the economy.  Much of the economic situation is interlinked with Europe with regard to unemployment as distinct from job creation and many developments in social welfare are unbelievably bad.  If anybody were to document it is would make frightening reading.  These developments are tied into the European scheme and I support Senator Cullen in his call for a full debate on the economy.  With regard to a debate on marital breakdown, I would be prepared to wait a little longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like clarification on the proposal to end the EC debate in two hours.  Will it be continued next week?  Is there a time limit proposed on contributions?  I realise there is a generally positive and cheerful atmosphere here this morning and I do not want to break that too harshly but there are matters of a much more urgent nature to be debated than this pallid fare.  I refer to the disastrous economic climate, the fact that international speculators are gambling with jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="12" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must wait for that debate when he can make his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important issue and it would be better if it were addressed in a more direct manner.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Her Excellency, the President, and Deputy Andrews and point out that the Independent Senators have a motion down to this effect.  I would have thought that we could have looked at that today.  It need not necessarily be the motion in the name of myself and the other Independent University Senators but we ought to respond to what the President and the Foreign Minister have done.</P>
      <P>If I might make a suggestion, I realise the President has already addressed a meeting of both Houses of the Oireachtas but there is provision in our rules for this House to be addressed by distinguished personages who are not Members of this House.  Would it not be an idea to invite the President to brief this House formally some time during the next few weeks on the visit to Somalia in order to keep up the pressure?  What I think she is trying to do is to keep up the pressure of publicity in the international arena and I suggest the Leader might consider this as a method of assisting both the President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has done extraordinary good work and visited Somalia prior to the Presidential visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards motion 35 on the Order Paper, the response of the Government to the European Court judgment, I am sorry to say, is still relevant to this House. I am going to be very well behaved, a Chathaoirligh, as you realise I almost always am and I am not going to move an amendment to the Order of Business but I cannot guarantee that I will not in future because since we last met and had some discussion on his matter, in direct contradiction to what the Irish Ambassador told the European Commission on Human Rights that it was intended to deal with this matter effectively and comprehensively before the end of the year, the Taoiseach said it was at the bottom <Col N="13" /> of his list of priorities &mdash; a matter of fundamental human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the House if it would recommend that the Chair would send a get well message to the Speaker of the Federal Assembly of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic who was a distinguished visitor to this House and since the recess has been involved in a very serious car accident.  I am sure all sides of the House would agree to this.</P>
      <P>My main reason for speaking is that I am somewhat disappointed that the announcement made in the past two days about the county enterprise boards has not been raised here this morning.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would arrange a debate on the announcement because I am seriously concerned at yet a further erosion of the role, power and status of local representatives. There is room for only one representative, the chairperson of the local authority concerned, on these proposed enterprise boards.  It seems to me that a trade union-business axis with no political input at all and what it is now doing is giving power without responsibility to people.  It will discourage quality people from getting involved in local government at the lowest level.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Leader programme &mdash; and I appreciate the Chair allowed a great deal of latitude to people who raised less important matters this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, one example, we have an administrator in our part of the country allegedly going around public meetings saying that if he receives representations from elected public representatives he will throw them in the bin.  What sort of a State are we living in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant, <Col N="14" /> unfortunately, to the Order of Business but I am sure the Leader will take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the request that we have a debate at an early stage on the proposed enterprise boards.  I do not wish my remarks to be misinterpreted.  I fully applaud and encourage the initiatives of the Government in trying to tackle the unemployment crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposed introduction by the Minister for Justice of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill whereby sentences that seem to be too lenient can be referred to the DPP.  It is most appropriate at this time in view of the absolutely ludicrous decision of a justice last week.</P>

I am sure it is something that she would welcome.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Green Paper on Education, it was published at a time when schools were just breaking up and teachers were involved in examinations.

      <P>I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have an early debate on the whole question of international finances which are fluctuating very seriously as the days go by and also to encompass in that debate the position of the Irish economy including the matter of jobs.  All these areas are interlinked. A debate is needed urgently and should be held very quickly.  I understand there will be a debate on jobs next week but I would see included the wider issue of the international scene and the economic climate outside Ireland.  Will the Leader arrange for such a debate at the earliest opportunity possible?</P>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to our President on her excellent work in recent days representing this country and to our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, for the part he played in the Third World area as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and indeed long before he was appointed Minister.</P>

      <P>I join in the request for a debate on the Exchange Rate Mechanism as an aspect of the total economy.  The influence that such a debate might have on the markets or on the parasites who have been feeding off those markets in recent weeks is questionable.  In fact, it <Col N="17" /> is even questionable whether this Government or any other Government have an influence on those people who are serving only their own interests and not the interests of society as a whole.</P>
      <P>One aspect which has not been covered and which we might usefully debate is the whole future of the bloodstock industry. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has brought forward proposals in respect of how the industry should be regulated through the Turf Club and the Racing Board and has proposed a new authority. It would be very useful for the Members of this House to examine those proposals in detail and to give their views on them. This morning I visited Goffs bloodstock sales and I know the depths of depression which exist in that industry at the moment and anything we can do to advance its cause will be welcome.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I join with the expressions of support and congratulations to the President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

It has been a bit like the first day back at school as it were but I must point out that we have the reforms which Senators looked for to deal with the matters we are talking about.  There are new ways of introducing motions, matters of concern and so on and we will adhere more rigidly to it in the future.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not pay tribute, as Cathaoirleach, to Deputy Andrews, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was the first Foreign Affairs Minister from Europe to visit Somalia in August and, of course, a very warm tribute to a former Member of this House, President Mary Robinson, on her initiative in going to Somalia and becoming, as she said herself, the voice of the unfortunate people of Somalia.  Ireland can certainly be proud of her and, indeed, I think in international terms it was a fantastic week for this lovely country our ours.  I now call the Leader of the House.</P>

      <P>On today's Order of Business, <Col N="18" /> we will carry over Item No. 1.  I have arranged for the Minister for Finance to start the debate on the Report of the Ombudsman at 2 p.m. If it is agreed by the House, we will conclude today on Item No. 1 at 2 p.m. and come back next week on it or whenever suits the Whips.</P>
      <P>With regard to a detailed list of legislation, in the last 10 days I have written to each Minister seeking support in initiating legislation in this House.  It would be fair to say it was successful in the last session and I have no doubt that again we will have legislation initiated in this House.  Next week I hope to have the up-to-date situation regarding what we will deal with between now and Christmas.</P>
      <P>The economy was mentioned by several Senators today and it would be our intention to have a debate on that subject next week and obviously on issues such as the jobs forum, the economy itself, the money markets and the new enterprise boards.  I agree with Senators on this issue and have no doubt that the expertise in this House should be considered on the setting up of these important boards before they actually come into being.  I hope that next week, again subject to agreement with the Whips we will debate that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Green Paper on Education we will have a full day debate on that on 22 October and more time if it is needed.  Before the Minister left on his latest visit to Somalia he made contact with my Office through the Chief Whip, Senator Ryan, and said he would be very pleased to be afforded an opportunity of coming to this House on his return. Unfortunately with flights and so forth he only arrived back this morning.  It was our intention for him to come in today but I hope as soon as it is feasible for him to do so he will give us a briefing on his visit to Somalia with the President.</P>
      <P>As regards the foreign affairs committee I am still extremely confident that committee will be established as soon as possible.  Between the Northern Ireland talks, Somalia and other commitments, the Minister involved had a very busy schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The seven half-yearly reports which we are considering this afternoon cover the period from January 1988 to December 1991. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I welcome this opportunity to reflect on the evolution of the European Community over that period and on the significance of present events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since January 1988 the EC has undergone a series of remarkable and historic events.  Briefly, these included: first, the peaceful and orderly achievement of German unification in a European framework and the integration of the former East Germany into the Community.  One of the high points of the Irish Presidency in 1990 was the positive welcome awarded to this development by the European Council which met in Dublin on 28 April 1990.  Second, against the backdrop of momentous events in Eastern Europe, the Community took a further important step in the process of European integration.  Important preparatory work on the negotiations leading to the Maastricht Treaty took place <Col N="20" /> during the Irish Presidency.  Agreement was reached during that period on the date of convening of the Intergovernmental Conferences on political union, and economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The two Intergovernmental Conferences ran for a 12 month period and the result &mdash; the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; represented a balanced compromise between the member states.  The ratification process has not been easy in a number of member states and much of the argument has related to the openness of decision-making and the principle of subsidiarity.  The principle of subsidiarity is a recognition of the need to ensure that the Community does not take action where that action would be better carried out at national level.  The concern that decisions should be taken as close as possible to those affected is, of course, one we share in Ireland.  The Government are also aware that Community institutions could be perceived as distant and bureaucratic. The subsidiary debate is, therefore, a timely one.</P>
    <P>However, we must also ensure that the idea of subsidiarity does not undermine the capacity of the Community or its institutions to function.  The Community has become deeper over the last 40 years. The Maastricht Treaty continues this process but the principle of subsidiarity is spelled out to ensure that there can be no fears that decisions that are best taken at national level will be taken away to some distant central point.</P>
    <P>Just as there can be no renegotiation of the Treaty there can be no rolling back of the Community and its accomplishments. There can be no diminution of the competences of the institutions, particularly the Commission, which is the guarantor of the Treaty and has always shown a particular sensitivity to the interests of the smaller member states. In particular, the role of the Commission as the initiator of draft legislation must be preserved.  This is a position which Ireland will argue at the Birmingham European Council on 16 October.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Treaty was approved by the Irish people in the refuerendum <Col N="21" /> on 18 June.  Before Ireland can ratify the Treaty, a number of other conditions must be met.  An amendment of the European Communities Act, 1972, is required to give effect in national law to the Treaty on European Union.  The Bill will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate and approval in the coming weeks.  We will then have the opportunity to discuss all the developments that have occurred in Europe during the past few months in considerably more detail than the time allowed today.</P>
    <P>The passage of the Bill will allow the State to ratify the Treaty on European Union.  At the Lisbon European Council in June, the Heads of State or Government confirmed their decision to ratify according to the agreed timetable which was by the end of December.  The General Affairs Council meeting in New York on 21 September indicated the high priority they attached to the speedy and successful conclusion of the process of ratification of the Treaty as signed at Maastricht.  It is the Government's intention to ensure that Ireland's ratification procedures will be completed by that time.</P>
    <P>One area of Community development has been particularly in the news in recent weeks, that is Economic and Monetary Union.  The turbulence in the exchange rate system in the seventies, following the oil shocks, showed the importance of stability in exchange rates for the proper functioning of the Common Market. Ireland has been a member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism &mdash; the ERM &mdash; since it was set up in 1979.  Our policies have enabled us to maintain our currency in a strong position in that mechanism.</P>
    <P>Preparations for stage 1 of European Monetary Union were completed under the Irish Presidency in the first half of 1990 and that stage began on 1 July 1990. The Maastricht Treaty sets out the further two stages.  The final stage will start in 1997, or at the latest in 1999, for those member states which qualify.  Others will, of course, be able to join later as and when they qualify.  Qualification depends on meeting certain criteria such as low <Col N="22" /> budget deficits, low inflation as well as low or decreasing accumulated debt.</P>
    <P>The meeting of Finance Ministers of the Twelve on 11 June 1990 identified inflation and budget deficit as the two main impediments to convergence.  The Irish Government have pursued for some years now policies which have brought our budget deficit under control, steadily reduced our accumulated debt and given us an inflation rate that is one of the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>These policies are necessary in themselves to form a basis for a healthy economy &mdash; the burden of financing our accumulated debt simply had to be brought down.  However, these policies also mean we are able to maintain our strong position in the present European Monetary System and that in fact we are one of the very few member States which would qualify to enter the third stage of monetary union if it were to begin today.</P>
    <P>Our main economic priority remains, of course, the task of tackling unemployment. Sound economic policies remain a basis for this.  The Maastricht Treaty revises Article 2 of the existing Treaty to make it clear that the Community must have among its main tasks that of promoting within the Community a high level of employment and social protection.</P>
    <P>The third and final stage of monetary union, which will come into effect, as I said, in 1997 or 1999, will involve a total and irreversible linking of the participating currencies leading in effect to a single currency, the ECU.  Ireland is committed to this objective.</P>
    <P>Recent events on the currency markets confirm that we must move forward to a single currency.  In the third stage there will also be a single European Central Bank &mdash; one in which we, like other participants, will have our say so that the monetary policies that count in Europe will be taken in the interests of all.</P>
    <P>Closer integration of the European economies must be paralleled by increasing the extent and effectiveness of the Community's cohesion policies to ensure that the economic and social disparities between the richer and poorer member <Col N="23" /> states can be reduced.  Since the Treaty of Rome, the Community has developed mechanisms &mdash; primarily the Structural Funds &mdash; to boost the prosperity of the less-developed regions.  Following the Single European Act, the Structural Funds were doubled in amount with a particular emphasis on the areas of greatest need, including Ireland &mdash; the so-called Objective 1 regions.  Between 1989 and 1993 Ireland will have received over £3 billion, or 10 per cent of the funds.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty further strengthens the commitment of the Community to economic and social cohesion by the creation of an additional Cohesion Fund. This will be set up in 1993, specifically to help the four poorest member states meet the costs of additional infrastructural or environmental projects.  The Community can thus be expected to pursue, through to the end of this decade and beyond, its policies to facilitate increasing convergence between the economies of the member states.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community is at present in the course of negotiating the financial perspective for the coming years, in the package we call the Delors Two package. In this the Commission proposes substantial increases in the Community's structural actions, particularly for the less developed regions &mdash; the Objective 1 regions, which include the whole of Ireland.  We are pursuing these negotiations with vigour, and we are aiming to achieve the kind of increase proposed by the Commission.  This provided for a doubling for Objective 1 regions in the four less developed Community countries, taking the increase in the structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund into account.  The presidency is to launch the final negotiation phase shortly so that we can have decisions by December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The end of December, 1992, will see the completion of the single market of the European Community.  The Single Market will provide for the freedom of movement of goods, persons, capital and <Col N="24" /> labour within the Community.  To date, over 90 per cent of the 282 measures needed to complete the Single Market have been agreed at Council level. Though great progress has been made, the Commission has identified certain areas where more work is required. These include the creation of a European Company Statute, the establishment of a Community trade mark, frontier controls, cultural goods and double taxation. In the meantime each member state of the Community is engaged in the task of transposing measures agreed at Council into national law.</P>
    <P>European integration is not, of course, an end in itself.  It is a means of achieving the wider objective of promoting the well-being of all Community citizens. This implies policies which ensure that the benefits of economic progress are reflected in improved living and working conditions throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The increased emphasis placed on the social policy aspects of the Community's agenda in recent years is, therefore, most welcome.  Ireland is participating fully in the effort to give practical expression to this social dimension.  This mirrors the Government's commitment to social consensus, an essential condition, in our view, for sustainable economic development at both national and Community levels.</P>
    <P>The Community's Social Charter, adopted in December 1989, sets out the fundamental principles and objectives of Community social policy.  Ireland is a signatory of the Social Charter and is committed to working for its effective implementation.  In the same spirit, we also subscribed to the Maastricht agreement on social policy.</P>
    <P>The increasing problem of drug smuggling and addiction, which is a worldwide one, is a matter of concern to all member states.  The European Council meeting at Strasbourg in December 1989 set up a high level committee composed of the personal representatives of the Heads of State or Government, to co-ordinate and give direction to all aspects of the fight against drugs.  During the Irish Presidency in the first half of 1990 this committee <Col N="25" />&mdash; called CELAD &mdash; drew up a plan for co-ordinated action against drug smuggling and addiction at national, Community and the wider international level.  This committee has continued to develop its activity to tackle the increasingly international activities of the drugs barons.</P>
    <P>I turn now to agriculture a very important sector.  The recent agreement on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy represents the culmination of months of difficult negotiation on the future direction of agriculture policy.  The need to adapt the Common Agricultural Policy to meet the demands of changing circumstances had become increasingly evident following a series of adverse market developments in recent years.</P>
    <P>The central objectives of the reform are to tackle the problem of surplus production while safeguarding the income position of farmers. Reduced market support and the lowering of prices should lead to a better balance between production and consumption and increased consumer demand.  The consequential income loss to farmers will be compensated by direct income payments. These adjustments will help to secure the long term viability of the Common Agricultural Policy in the changing context in which it now has to operate.  This is of crucial importance to Ireland in view of the considerable benefits which the policy confers on this country.</P>
    <P>The reform also ends the uncertainty that had existed in the agricultural sector and enables producers to plan with confidence on the basis of assured support arrangements.  This should ensure that the agriculture and food sector can continue to contribute substantially to the overall development of our economy.</P>
    <P>The final compromise agreement, moreover, represents a very substantial improvement from the Irish perspective compared with the proposals originally presented.  This is particularly the case in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to retiring Commissioner MacSharry for the high level <Col N="26" /> of commitment, dedication and work he put into the very difficult renegotiation and realignment of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I wish him every success in the future.</P>
    <P>The Community is a major player on the international stage and in the world economy.  It is the world's largest exporter &mdash; responsible for about 15 per cent of world exports &mdash; and is the biggest market in the industrialised world.  The policies it pursues externally are thus of considerable importance.  Ireland, which is itself so dependent on trading for its economic progress, continued in the period under review to make a sustained input to EC formulation of policy on relations with third countries.  Within Europe these relations are particularly close and they have assumed added importance in light of the changes which have utterly transformed the continent's political landscape in recent years.</P>
    <P>The ties which the Community has been developing with the members of EFTA, with the Central and Eastern European countries and with the Mediterranean States should be seen against that background.  The Community has pioneered the process of closer integration as a contribution to stability and has followed a similar approach in relations with its nearest European neighbours.</P>
    <P>In May this year the lengthy negotiations to establish a new and more structured framework for EC relations with EFTA were brought formally to completion with the signature of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. This will essentially extend the Single Market to a 19 State area with conditions of equal competition throughout.</P>
    <P>Four of the member states of EFTA have separately applied for membership of the Community and another application is expected shortly.  Internal work, preparatory to an enlargement, is being done under the UK Presidency.  Formal accession negotiations, as agreed at the Lisbon European Council, would start only when the Delors II package is completed and the Maastricht Treaty ratified.</P>
    <P>The Community's relations with the <Col N="27" /> countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been the focus of increasing attention since the historic changes there beginning in 1989.  Support for the difficult transformation under way, both at political and economic level, has been a consistent element in the Community's approach.  Humanitarian aid has been despatched to the particularly needy cases of Albania and the Baltic States. Wide ranging technical assistance in connection with the development of market economies has been provided under the Community's PHARE programme.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, new agreements on the political and economic aspects of relations between the Community and these countries are being negotiated.  In the cases of Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak Federated Republic, the association agreements have been signed and the goal is to complete the ratification process by the end of this year in respect of Poland and Hungary.  The evolving situation in Czechoslovakia has to be taken into account in the case of that ratification.  Negotiations with Bulgaria and Rumania are still in progress.</P>
    <P>The situation in the former Soviet Union has also called for increased activity on the part of the Community. Humanitarian aid had been provided to a total value of around one billion ECU and further such aid is planned.  Ireland has played a role in this Community action.  Substantial quantities of meat and dairy products were sourced from stocks here.  In addition, members of the Army served with the EC Task Force established to monitor the distribution of the aid in Russia.</P>
    <P>The Community formerly had a co-operation agreement with the Soviet Union but with the break up of that country it has become urgent to establish a framework for EC relations with the individual republics.  The mandate for the Commission to negotiate partnership and co-operation agreements with the republics was approved by the General Affairs Council on 5 October.  Negotiations should open shortly on agreements which would cover commerce as <Col N="28" /> well as economic co-operation and assistance and political dialogue.</P>
    <P>The Community's major role in world trade had meant a major effort in the period under review in connection with the Uruguay Round negotiations of GATT.  The negotiations are aimed at further strengthening and liberalising the world trading system while also bringing new areas, such as services and intellectual property, within its scope.  The negotiations on agriculture have been difficult though this is by no means the only area where significant further effort is required.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with Community partners, remains committed to the goal of an early conclusion of the round on the basis of a substantial, global and balanced agreement.  In regard to agriculture it is important that the Community be afforded full credit for the major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which has been agreed.  The compensatory payments under this reform must be classed as permissible under a new GATT agreement.</P>
    <P>The period under review witnessed important progress in the Community's development co-operation policy.  The Fourth ACP/EC or Lomé Convention came into effect in September last year. Formal negotiations on the new Convention began in 1988 and continued over a series of negotiating conferences at ministerial level.  While the Commission formally conducted the negotiations on the Community side, Ireland, with the other member states, was actively involved in the formulation of the negotiating mandate and advised the Commission throughout.  The negotiations were conducted at all times in a constructive spirit of partnership.</P>
    <P>Like its predecessor, the new Convention is a wide ranging agreement and includes provisions for trade co-operation, the stabilisation of export earnings from commodities, industrial and mining co-operation, financial and technical assistance and protection of the environment. The arrangements for the financing and management of Community aid are set out in the Internal <Col N="29" /> Financing Agreement negotiated under the Irish Presidency in the first half of 1990.</P>
    <P>The Community had devoted a lot of energy in recent years to improving co-operation with non-ACP developing countries.  In particular, in 1990 the Community agreed on new guidelines to govern its relations with Asian and Latin American countries and formulated a new policy for Mediterranean countries. Under these new arrangements, the overall level of Community aid to both areas has been substantially increased.  The period covered by these reports has also seen growing recognition of the role of women in development and of the importance of environmental protection in our co-operation with developing countries.</P>
    <P>The EC has provided food aid and other emergency aid to many countries over the years and was among the first of the international donors to react to the tragic situation in Somalia.  The EC's programme of emergency assistance has so far provided 253,000 tonnes of food aid for Somalia.</P>
    <P>The process of European political co-operation has enabled the Community and its member states to look outwards, to other parts of the world, on the basis of co-ordinated positions.  In the period covered by these reports, the Twelve have worked closely together on Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, Central America and other regions.  They have developed common approaches to nuclear non-proliferation, human rights and other issues of broad international concern.  Within the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and in other organisations, they have often been able, by speaking with one voice, to work more effectively than individual member states acting alone.</P>
    <P>Recent years have witnessed a transformation of Central and Eastern Europe, the consequences of which have major implications for the Community today.  It fell to the Irish Presidency in 1990 to co-ordinate the Community's immediate response to these events &mdash; to <Col N="30" /> facilitate German unification and to pave the way for new relationships between the Community and the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Major progress has now been made in establishing democratic systems and in securing respect for human rights throughout the eastern part of our continent, but the era of change has also brought with it its own uncertainties, dangers and tragedies.</P>
    <P>In the former Yugoslavia in particular, the dissolution of a state held together by the force imposed by a Communist regime has been accompanied by tragic consequences for all concerned.  The European Community and its member states have, from the outset of the crisis, made every effort to resolve the conflict and bring about a settlement.  These efforts, closely co-ordinated with those of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, have been pursued through the Conference on Yugoslavia, originally chaired by Lord Carrington and now enlarged under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Vance and Lord Owen; through the efforts on the ground of the EC monitor mission, in which Ireland has been an active participant, and through the exercise of the collective weight of the Community to seek to persuade the parties, especially Serbia, to co-operate in bringing about a peaceful settlement.  The Community and its member states are also playing a major part in humanitarian relief efforts.</P>
    <P>In the former Soviet Union, the transformation, welcome in itself, has also been accompanied by severe tensions in many areas.  These reflect the enormous adjustments &mdash; political, economic and social &mdash; necessitated by the collapse of Communism.  While there are clear limitations on the extent to which the Community can ensure that the crisis now being faced in many parts of the former USSR will be overcome through peaceful and democratic means, the Community has been making, and will continue to make, a major contribution to this end.</P>
    <P>The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) has now 52 <Col N="31" /> participants instead of 35.  More than ever before the participating States are united as to values and objectives.</P>
    <P>The Vienna Concluding Document of January 1989 agreed a mechanism which gives countries the right to investigate suspected human rights abuses in other States.</P>
    <P>The Charter of Paris, adopted at the CSCE Summit in 1990 provides for new structures and institutions including regular meetings of Heads of State or Government and of Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  A Summit in Helsinki in July, attended by the Taoiseach, further broadened the work of the CSCE, for example, by strengthening its ability to mediate in situations of potential conflict and intensifying, through further negotiations now beginning in Vienna, cooperative approaches to European security.</P>
    <P>The end of the Gulf crisis saw the US Secretary of State, James Baker, painstakingly preparing the launch of peace talks between Israelis and Arabs.  I am glad to say that this initiative was to bear fruit before the end of 1991 and that Ireland and our partners in the European Community are working actively to contribute to the success of those negotiations.</P>
    <P>The decision by President de Klerk in September 1989 to abandon the policy of apartheid was followed by the release of Nelson Mandela.  Consistent pressure by the Twelve played its part in bringing about this change of direction.</P>
    <P>While the abolition of the so-called statutory &ldquo;pillars of apartheid&rdquo; is an important step, the legacy of nearly 50 years of apartheid will not be removed so easily.  Ireland with its partners in the Community has been encouraging the parties to implement fully the National Peace Accord of September 1991 and to advance the negotiating process aimed at achieving a united, democratic, nonracial South Africa.</P>
    <P>The period in question witnessed positive developments in the peace process in Central America, most particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador.  Meetings <Col N="32" /> held under the San José arrangements, including a meeting in Dublin in 1990, have for many years been an importance source of support for dialogue within and between Central American States.</P>
    <P>The European Community worked hard, in collaboration with Australia, Japan, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, and others, in support of efforts to bring an all-party agreement in Cambodia.  This has led to one of the most ambitious &mdash; and essential &mdash; peacekeeping operations in the history of the UN.  I am concerned that the Khmer Rouge have yet to demonstrate in practice their full acceptance of the UN plan.</P>
    <P>In the field of nuclear non-proliferation, the Community has been gradually developing a common policy. During the Irish Presidency in 1990, the European Council adopted a declaration on Nuclear Non-Proliferation for the first time.  Last year, the European Council adopted a second Declaration which covered chemical and biological weapons and called for restraint and transparency in transfers of conventional weapons, in particular towards areas of tension.</P>
    <P>The experience of European Political Co-operation to date, and the expectations of the Community's partners in other parts of the world, suggested the necessity, in the context of the Maastricht negotiations, to develop stronger procedures in the foreign policy area.</P>
    <P>The House has already had a detailed and extensive discussion on the outcome of Maastricht.  I believe, however, that this House will agree with me the Treaty strikes the right balance between the need for a coherent European Community role in world affairs and the desirability of maintaining checks and safeguards in such areas as decision-making and the future relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The ground has been laid for Ireland to continue to contribute to the Community's international policies on the basis of the values which have always informed our approach to these issues &mdash; which come down to placing the rights and welfare of individual men and <Col N="33" /> women at the centre of our preoccupations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome his wide ranging contribution to this debate.  I accept that we will probably not be able to do justice to this enormously important and all-embracing topic on this occasion.  We will have another opportunity to do so when this House amends the European Communities Act, 1972, between now and the end of December.</P>
      <P>This debate, limited as it may be, is nonetheless extremely timely given the difficulties of the last few weeks and the post-Maastricht referendum perspective we are now developing because of various difficulties.  It behoves all of us, particularly those of us in political life, to try to help the electorate to understand what the Maastricht Treaty is all about. Even at this late stage the one criticism we must all accept is not that there was so much wrong with Maastricht, but that the Treaty represented a step too far, and too fast.  Consequently, people were genumely afraid of what was involved because they could not make sense of it and voted no.  The people of Ireland overwhelmingly endorsed the Maastricht Treaty, as no other in Europe has.  Other countries have, through their Parliaments, endorsed it and agreed to its ratification but we are the only country where the people have actually said yes with any great clarity.</P>
      <P>The people deserve to have their fears allayed.  They deserve to have the language of the debate pitched at a level everyone can understand.  Those of us, in these Houses, who have become familiar with the topics and &ldquo;Euro-speak&rdquo; are inclined to slip into the jargon.  Even when we are trying to explain the issues we are not really communicating, because of the language we use.  As a result, many people who otherwise would be very supportive of what we are doing, have been left behind because they cannot make sense of it.  As I said, it was going too far too fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the introduction to the reports we are debating today states, section 5 of the <Col N="34" /> European Communities Act provides for the Government to make a report twice a year to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the EC.  This is, ostensibly, what this exercise today is all about.</P>
    <P>The reports now being debated &mdash; from June 1988 to June 1991 &mdash; cover a period of very rapid development in the European Community which followed a period of 15 years of very slow progress. Between 1973 and the mid-eighties there were no dramatic achievements.  For us there were very important steps taken, such as our entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, but, generally, up to the period of the mid-eighties, there was no exhileration in the pace of change in Europe.  Since then, however, there has been a lot of action and things have been changing very quickly.</P>
    <P>To look back on the historic evolution of the Community we must remind ourselves that in 1957 the Treaty of Rome gave us the EEC &mdash; the European Economic Community; in 1987 the Single European Act gave us the European Communities, or EC; and in 1992 the Maastricht Treaty will give us European Union.  I hope we are still of the same mind that we were in June and July when we debated this issue.  Today, we are looking at the present difficulties in Europe as we rapidly approach 1 January 1993, the deadline we have spoken about for so long for the full implementation of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Within the European Community in the last few years, apart from the very rapid progress in terms of its institutions, we have seen German unification; outside the EC we have seen the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, Eastern and Central Europe have been looking more and more to the European Community for stability.  As the Minister said, the two 1991 intergovernmental conferences led to the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in December last year. The intention of the Maastricht Treaty will be to give the Community European Union.  I wonder will it.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Euro-sceptics have grown in number and recent developments <Col N="35" /> have added fuel to their case unfortunately. The direction the Minister has pointed out is the only direction for Ireland.  Whether we are talking about the overall Maastricht Treaty and ultimate European Political Union, prefaced by the completion of the European Monetary Union, it is the only way for Ireland, as a small, open, exporting country. We are very much European in our perspective.  I would hope that those of us who are in a position to do so will be able to allay the fears of the Euro sceptics and the Euro cynics whose numbers grow daily.  We have an enormous job to do but it behoves us to get out there and do it.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty proposes the establishment of a European Central Bank for a European single currency. Doubts over this plan for full monetary union greatly increase the pressure on the Exchange Rate Mechanism and have caused chaos in the currency markets in recent weeks.  So, too, did the Bundesbank. The problem goes back to German unification.  Their demand surged following unification fuelling inflation and their budget deficit expanded much to the Bundesbank's alarm.  There was an increase in interest rates to control the situation.</P>
    <P>The Deutsche Mark is effectively the anchor currency in the Exchange Rate Mechanism and it is not expected to be devalued.  Many economic commentators now say that German unification called for substantial appreciation of the Deutsche Mark against most of the other ERM currencies.  A dearer Deutsche Mark would have allowed the Bundesbank to cut interest rates sooner and this, above all else, needs to happen. Germany must cut its interest rates if the Exchange Rate Mechanism is to return to any degree of stability.  The Exchange Rate Mechanism deserves to be preserved. It was a mistake to regard the prevailing parities as fixed in the ERM and requiring protection at all costs.  The ERM system was designed to cater for regular realignments.  The Deutsche Mark needed to be revalued, post-unification <Col N="36" /> against other Exchange Rate Mechanism currencies, but the Bundesbank could not get agreement from France and others even though it offered to lower its interest rates in the interim.</P>
    <P>Recent history deserves to be recalled. Britain rejected a German proposal on 13 September for a controlled realignment within the ERM but Germany went ahead and invested heavily in propping up sterling in the ensuring difficulties. On 16 September sterling was withdrawn from the ERM after extraordinary selling overcame the system.  Italy suspended the lira and Spain devalued the peseta at 5 per cent.  Chaos ensured.  Since then, pressure has come on the so-called stronger currencies.  The French franc, in spite of, or perhaps because of, France's weak endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty has suffered accordingly.  However, the Bundesbank has rallied to the franc's defence and invested heavily to resist devaluation of the French franc.  The question has been posed whether the pound sterling, when it joined the ERM in 1990, was correctly valued at 2.95 DM. The British economists say it was correctly valued based on its purchasing power; the German economists say it was too highly valued.</P>
    <P>Where does this chaos leave us, the people of Ireland?  Where does it leave our economy which is an open exporting economy?  We are still in the ERM, thankfully, with a huge appreciation of the punt against sterling, a 3 per cent increase in our interest rates and little hope of short term respite for mortgage holders and traders, particularly exporters, to the UK.  The UK takes more than 30 per cent of our exports. Most exporters depending on that market now have their workforce, or a proportion of their workforce, on notice, as their margins are decimated overnight and they are working at an immediate loss.</P>
    <P>We look towards a United Kingdom that is hostile to Europe.  We look to Europe as committed Europeans and we are caught in the middle of the currency chaos as no other country in the EC is. We deserve the support of the Community <Col N="37" /> as never before at this critical period.  We are the only country whose people have convincingly endorsed the Maastricht Treaty.  Europe's investment in our country since 1973 has been well rewarded particularly in recent months. As far as I am concerned, Europe still owes us.  We have proved to be worth every ECU spent.  We were not found wanting when the Community needed us most, when it came to the final step of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>If all the talk on cohesion and convergence means anything, it means that the Community and the institutions of the Community rally to help weaker states, particularly in times of crisis.  This Government have every right to look to Europe to step in and help the Irish economy or a lot of the good that has been done in recent years will be undone overnight and we will add dramatically to the 300,000 on our dole queues.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Commission. He said: &ldquo;The Commission... which is the guarantor of the Treaty has always shown a particular sensitivity to the interests of the smaller states&rdquo;.  We can call on the Commission immediately to show that sensitivity and to show that it can react rapidly to a country when it is needed.  We are caught between our dependence on the UK market for over 30 per cent of our exports, with sterling outside the ERM now, and with the Irish punt inside the ERM.  Unlike any other country, Ireland is suffering and is being squeezed between competing philosophies at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Senator suggesting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to have the answers.  Apparently the economists cannot agree.  They all have different answers.  We have to look for the answers to those who know much more than I do on how to run an economy.  I am suggesting we will have to find many of the answers at home and that now, as never before, the Community must rally to Ireland's aid because when they needed Ireland they got an overwhelming <Col N="38" /> endorsement from us.  If cohesion and convergence and looking after weaker and peripheral economies means anything at all and if all the Euro-speak is to be translated into reality, now is the test of the willingness of the institutions of Europe to rally to the aid of a weaker country.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Finance is already in negotiation with Europe on the implications for Ireland of this currency chaos, particularly sterling's withdrawal from the ERM.  I am not suggesting we tie ourselves to sterling at the cost of our commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism and to the other currencies of Europe.  That would be a retrograde step but I recognise acutely the position in which our mortgage holders, our traders, our exporters to the UK find themselves. Those already on the dole queues are likely to be joined by thousands more unless we have a resolution of the problem. There will be no panacea for this but I would like greater evidence from Europe that they recognise the critical position we are in now and that they will respond.  Only they have the institutions and the paraphernalia that can respond.</P>
      <P>There is one other point in regard to the Minister's speech I would like to make.  He defined the principle of subsidiarity. This definition I have not had in writing or seen in print before from the Government and I question it.  It is a very honest definition and it is how we always felt it worked but it is not what I understood subsidiarity to mean.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>The principle of subsidiarity is a recognition of the need to ensure that the Community does not take action where that action would be better carried out at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With one stroke of the pen this Fianna Fáil-led Government have obliterated decisions taken at local and regional level in our country.  What about local government? Is it any wonder we have not heard a word about local government reform? This was to be one of the pillars of this Government.  It was certainly one of the planks the Progressive Democrats <Col N="39" /> insisted on when they joined with Fianna Fáil.  Where is local government reform now?  Perhaps local government is obsolete. What about the principle of taking decisions at the lowest possible level that is effective or can we not pass the national level in this country at all?</P>
    <P>I take exception to the Minister's definition of subsidiarity.  It is honest perhaps but it is one we need to look at and see if that is what we all understand the principle of subsidiarity to be.  It is not my understanding of it and I am very committed to true local government, not the present system of rubber-stamping central Government.  We all await with bated breath the reforms that have so long been promised but so little heard of from this Government.  Perhaps now we know why reforms in this area are not needed and why local government may be obsolete.  Decisions will be taken at national level and no further down the line.  Interesting, disturbing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not actually say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It says: &ldquo;At national level&rdquo;, I am subject to correction.  I am only reading what is before me and it disturbs me.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to a very important aspect of the European Community as it impacts on our economy, namely, the Common Agricultural Policy and its reform.  None of us would argue with the need for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  That was overdue and the present system was unsustainable by any criteria but we have to be more honest with our farmers, young and old, in relation to the impact of the reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very uncertain times ahead for our farmers in the context of these reforms.  Young farmers who will not inherit a well-stocked farm or a farm with good production rights established on it will be limited to an enterprise in dry stock, cattle.  There was a possibility if the cereal issue was to be resolved on a regional or national basis that that area would have been open to young entrants <Col N="40" /> also but now, at the request of the farm organisations, we are moving in the direction of individual quotes for tillage.  That probably rules tillage out so any farmer inheriting land that is not well stocked &mdash; land an old uncle might leave to a favourite niece or nephew &mdash; has one option under the Common Agricultural Policy reform and that is dry stock, cattle but if you have not a very understanding bank manager that option is effectively ruled out as well.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility, I suppose, of an increase in sheep production from the national reserve.  In theory that is there as well but if this works as effectively and as efficiently as the national milk reserve I would not lose any sleep waiting for it if I was a young farmer.  Given the chaos in the sheep markets, which is another knock-on effect of the currency chaos in recent times, nobody would be looking towards an increase in sheep production but in theory that option might be there as well.</P>
    <P>Where does that leave our young, well-educated farming population today? They all cannot inherit well stocked farms.  Let us be honest with them.  We are mouthing about the need to educate them and the importance of doing that but is anybody standing up and saying that under this reform of the Common Agricultural Policy there is effectively no future for them.  After this generation have spent their active lifetime on the land there is virtually no future for those coming after them.  It will be essential that a new pre-retirement scheme as agreed in the Common Agricultural Policy is sold effectively and made to work in this country to allow land mobility by transfer, sale or rent to our young and well-educated farmers.</P>
    <P>I am very sceptical to the point of being cynical about the so-called guarantees on the compensation payments promised in return for the price reductions and the production controls in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is dishonest of this Government to pretend they can guarantee compensation payments beyond one, or at most two, years. The reforms are being phased in over <Col N="41" /> three years and, while the price reductions and production controls will be permanent, how can any Commissioner guarantee indefinitely adequate compensation levels, given the annual budget fixing in Europe and the likely change of Commissioners?  We know there will be a change now but the likely ongoing change of Commissioners, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament are part and parcel of the democratic system in Europe.  The Commission cannot commit its successor to a certain line of spending but it can commit to it production controls and price reductions; it cannot commit the incoming Commission to guaranteed compensation payments.  Who knows what pressures will be on the Common Agricultural Policy spending in a few years time?  What do this Government mean by guaranteed compensation?  I think they have been sold a pup in an effort to get approval for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I hope our farm organisations and our farmers realise where they are on this issue.  As a country we will need every pound or ECU of compensation we can get from Europe.</P>
    <P>Between now and 1995 the gross agricultural output in this country will decrease by over 14 per cent, that is, £447 million.  Direct payments, that is, the existing premia, the Common Agricultural Policy compensation measures and all the disadvantaged areas headage payments, will double to £617 million in the same period.  In other words, direct payments will account for half the net farm income by 1995, an increase from one-fifth in 1991, and farmers will be dependent on Europe for half their income by 1995.  At the moment they are only getting one-fifth of their income from Europe.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform will impact least on the milk sector provided the farmer has a viable quota.  However, the reforms will be major for all the other sectors &mdash; that is, beef, sheep meat and cereals.  For the single suckler system direct payments, already an important part of income, will <Col N="42" /> represent over 100 per cent of net income by 1995, in other words, there will be more in payments from the market and fewer expenses.  For other beef systems the income before subsidies is likely to strongly negative in 1995, with subsidies being equal to two or three times the net income.  For lamb we cannot predict the 1995 live premium level but it is likely that it will be well over 100 per cent of the market price, less expenses &mdash; that is, net income.</P>
    <P>The 1995 compensation for cereals will be equal to or greater than the net income.  In other words, the Common Agricultural Policy reform means that, with the exception of milk, agricultural prices are being cut to a level equal to or lower than production costs in this country.  Our farmers' incomes will be the Euro subsidy, the cheque in the post. Maintaining the level of compensation into the future is the key issue for farm organisations and politicians and I do not like what I see.</P>
    <P>In County Wexford, which is not any different from many other counties, farmers were late into milk.  Wexford is mainly a dry stock and tillage county, a county of farmers who invested heavily when advised to do so on joining the European Economic Community in the early seventies to bring their land and their buildings up to standard and to maximise production.  They invested heavily on the promise of a return from their various enterprises.  Immediately they were into production controls of one kind or another, perhaps the best understood at this point would be the milk quota but production controls have extended far beyond milk at this stage.  Their ability to make their bank repayments and to expand their enterprises to fund investment was cut immediately.</P>
    <P>What answer have this Government for the farmers of Wexford and every other county who are on their knees at this time.  We had better hear it fairly quickly because their patience is running out.  At this stage they are exasperated and are beginning to understand that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was wrapped up in a lovely <Col N="43" /> package, a good PR job, is not what they thought.  The reality is dawning and the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food should realise that they can no longer treat the farmers of Ireland as fools because, effectively, that is what they have been trying to do.</P>
    <P>With 300,000 people already out of work and the dramatic appreciation of the punt against sterling, with over 30 per cent of our exports going to the UK and the fact that we have yet to take account of the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms on the economic life of this country, there are very difficult times ahead.  Many generations of Irish people gained their dignity from being self-employed on their own land.  The cheque in the post is the Commission's response to over-production but this cheque in the post takes no account of our family farming tradition.  Let us remember that there is nothing common about an agricultural policy where certain member states can afford to pay national aid to their farmers, which is five or six times greater than other member states can afford.  We need a level playing field before the Community's agricultural policy deserves to be called a common policy.  This point has been missed in the so-called reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>I have made this point at least on three or four occasions in this House and I cannot get an adequate response from this Government as to how they will ensure that the Community's agricultural policy will be a common policy.  I would also like farm organisations to put greater emphasis on this point because whatever their achievements and successes may make for their members, unless the playing field is level, unless the policy is common, our farmers will be handicapped compared with the Germans, French and others.  Our Government and our people cannot afford to subvent farmers to the same extent as the Germans, French and Dutch.  Let us get this right or we are at nothing.  It is adding to what I think is a dishonest picture that is <Col N="44" /> being painted for our agricultural community at the moment.</P>
    <P>Children in this country, reared to believe that they, too, would work the land, have a very uncertain future. Another segment of our population is left without hope.  Let nobody tell me that we cannot create a significant economic linkage between our capacity to overproduce quality food and the hunger problems facing Somalia and other countries on the Horn of Africa and the new democracies of Eastern Europe and Russia.  Surely in marrying our surplus to their great need there lies one of the greatest challenges yet for our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>I would like to say how proud I am of our President's success and great work in Somalia and in the UN during the last few days.  I compliment her sincerely, as I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, on their commitment in this area.  They have allowed the world to see how the Irish people, as well as the Irish Government, view with alarm the lack of support in terms of the great needs of Somalia and many other people around the world.  We are a generous nation; we have always been generous in a voluntary capacity but I am afraid our ODA record is an embarrassment to the people of Ireland. The Minister referred to an increased commitment to ODA but that has to be translated into action and we must see the money on the table.  However, it is very easy to be carried away on a wave of euphoria and to say that we will increase our contribution.  We need a commitment to attain the UN levels within a clearly defined deadline.</P>
    <P>The Single Market is around the corner &mdash; 1 January 1993.  Recently a package was announced by the Government to support jobs in companies exporting to the UK that are in serious trouble because of the appreciation of the punt against sterling.  I hope this will be immediately translated into action and that there will not be a bureaucratic tangle between those who need help and the Government.  This would slow down the effectiveness of the package but I <Col N="45" /> am prepared to give it an opportunity to operate before we comment on it.  It is welcome as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The quest to create jobs in this country is well recognised.  The tragedy of those without work, the hopelessness and lack of dignity must also be recognised.  I am concerned about a group of 1,000 people in this country who are going to lose their jobs as a result of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.  This Government have paid no attention to this group.  If we were to create 1,000 jobs in the morning there would be flag waving and luncheons and IDA press receptions and PR launches of one kind or another and there would be great whooping it up around the counties where the jobs were being created.  This is understandable and let us not decry good news because there is a lot of bad news around but when the Government are in a position to protect 1,000 jobs and they refuse to call down finances that is available in Europe to do so I must question what they are about. I refer to the 1,000 customs clearance and freight forwarders who will find themselves redundant from 1 January onwards.  Madame Scrivener in Europe has provided 30 million ECUs to help this category of people who find themselves without work through no fault of their own but because of a European decision on restructuring the organisation of the economies of Europe.</P>
    <P>This money is there to be drawn down. The case has been made by the Minister for Finance.  The national body, the local bodies, Rosslare Harbour Customs Clearance and Freight Forwarders have presented their case.  They have come to the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC.  They have spoken to the MEPs.  They have come backwards and forwards and have got nothing from this Government.  There must be a will to help save 1,000 jobs, to redeploy, to retain, to redirect the skills that are available in this workforce.  I cannot understand how the Government are sitting on their hands and ignoring 1,000 jobs that with the stroke of a pen on the 1st January will be gone.  They are not even being <Col N="46" /> phased out over a few weeks.  Their work will be gone on 1 January.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister present to ensure that the Minister for Finance draws down the money available in Europe to help this sector.  If the European Community is to have the benefits that we are all so quick to tell the public about, we must be honest about the downside and we must do everything possible to help those who will be adversely affected by decisions that are in our greater interest.  Please let me see some activity from this Government in relation to Customs Clearance and Freight Forwarders from Cork, Rosslare Harbour, Dublin and Dundalk.  The issue is there.  Nobody appears to be listening. It is possible to draw down compensatory moneys to help them.  Please let us have some result because January is around the corner.</P>
    <P>There is a certain irony in the fact that the current President of the European Community is one John Major.  He presides over a party that has been described as <i>á la carte</i> Europeans.  That is a kind description.  Where does the President of the European Community stand on the future of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, on the future of the Maastricht Treaty, on the European Community itself?  He and his party have no policy on Europe. They blame the Germans for the present currency chaos and they want the Maastricht Treaty rewritten.  They are negative and hostile to the European vision and yet until the end of this year the hands that drive the Community are in Britain. That is a very disturbing scenario and the rest of the Community should make clear in no uncertain terms to Prime Minister Major, and indeed to his colleagues who will preside over all the other ministerial Councils, exactly where we want Europe to go, where we want the Exchange Rate Mechanism to lead us.</P>
    <P>The British people, and indeed the Bundesbank, need to be told that the vision of Europe is to have a Central Bank of Europe culminating in a single currency and no selfish interest, however well motivated, whatever hidden agenda there may be in relation to the Bundesbank's <Col N="47" /> future or indeed the double agenda of the British people and John Major must prevent that.  Mr. Major says one thing to the British people and something else when he is in Europe.  Whatever hidden agendas may exist there must be a single message as far as Ireland is concerned: that is, that we know where we want to go, we must remain part of the ERM and, if at all possible, avoid devaluation.  Not all economic commentators, who are much wiser than I, feel that is an option indefinitely.  I hope it is a realistic option for us.  Our message must be that we accept the objectives of the Maastricht Treaty and we insist that Europe recognises that we are caught between our difficulties with sterling outside the ERM, on the one hand, and the punt within the Exchange Rate Mechanism.</P>
    <P>I would like to again thank the Minister and I look forward to some response and an in-depth ongoing debate.</P>

      <P>When I saw the number of documents we were supposed to debate in two hours I thought it could not be done.  I am glad the House has agreed that this will be a continuing debate to allow for as many Members as possible to talk about the developments in the European Communities since 1989.  Since then we have gone through many phases in the evolution of the concept of a united Europe.  When we read the aspirations of the earlier developments and when we read what is in these reports we may say that very little has been done but I hope we will see changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time that I have today, I will deal with the problems of people who are dying, all over the world and what Europe can do.  I think that might be better than dealing with the problems the currency crisis is causing for certain people, the major unemployment crisis <Col N="48" /> we have, the prospects for farming and the various other developments that have to take place in Europe.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here today about the visit of President Robinson to Somalia and we hope her visit will have an impact on the world over and above the impact that it has made on the media up to now.  In essence, there has been no worldwide impact so far.  The press got the opportunity yesterday in New York to speak to her and I hope they will take on board the deep impressions that she was able to give to them as a result of her visit to Somalia.  Again, we must not forget that the visit was one in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs took a major part.  Indeed, it has to be said that the Minister visited Somalia initially and what he saw and what he said when he came back made a strong impact on people here and in the European Community.</P>
    <P>While we all saw on television or read in newspapers about the appalling situation in Somalia, I do not think the full impact of the poverty of the desolation of that and similar places will ever be felt unless people experience it themselves. Unless people can smell poverty they do not know what poverty and death are about.  Poverty and death are widespread in today's world.  When television can convey the experience of smell then people will be enabled to know what death and deprivation are about.  The deaths taking place in Somalia do not arise totally from a natural disaster, from the desertfication of the Horn of Africa or from drought.  They are the result mainly of an horrific civil war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of discussing <Col N="49" /> the latest annual report of the Ombudsman. Our judiciary and others in high profile public positions are appointed by or on the nomination of the Government. The Ombudsman is unique in being appointed on the nomination of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I consider it appropriate, therefore, that the report should be discussed in the Oireachtas. This is the eighth such report and it affords the reader an excellent overview of the service which the Ombudsman and his staff provide to the public.  It also gives politicians a useful citizen's eye view of the day-to-day application of the various public services.</P>
      <P>Having read the report, my general reaction has been one of satisfaction on a number of fronts.  First, it seems to me &mdash; and I hope I am not over-interpreting the words of the Ombudsman &mdash; that the report reflects a much improved relationship between the Office and the various institutions which fall within its remit. One noticeable feature of many earlier reports was the recurrent comments by the Ombudsman of the feelings of unease and suspicion which seemed to be held by a small number of public servants towards the activities of the Office.  While most public servants would agree that this view was somewhat wide of the mark, it was only natural that the process of adjustment to a new investigative institution should give rise to some trauma. However, any feelings on the part of public officials that the Ombudsman was engaged in an anti-public service &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; seem, thankfully, to have been fully dissipated in the light of experience of the Ombudsman's activities over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reading of the latest report suggests that these feelings have been almost entirely replaced by an attitude of co-operation and good-will.  The improved environment is due, in part, to the greater awareness on the part of public, officials of the actual role played by the Office &mdash; an awareness enhanced by the publication of the annual reports and the regular debates in the Oireachtas of these reports.  I am satisfied that the improved relationship between the Office and <Col N="50" /> public servants is also due to a greater consumer consciousness on the part of individual public servants.  At political level, we are doing all that we can to foster an ever increasing awareness of the client.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be foolish to imagine that a stage would ever be reached where the Ombudsman's Office and public agencies would always see things in the same light.  Inevitably, occasions will arise when the Ombudsman and individual public bodies, as they confront a problem honestly but from different perspectives, do not see eye to eye.  I am sure that this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Administration in any area, may, of course, develop a particular way of looking at things and having taken a position it may be reluctant to abandon it unless obliged to do so by heavy fire. The function of the Ombudsman is to bring a different, more humane, perspective to bear and to bring, as he has done in this report, individual cases to the attention of the Oireachtas.  What I find most heartening in this respect is the considerable evidence that both the staff of the Office and personnel from the relevant public bodies have displayed a willingness to sit down together and talk through the various problem cases which arise in a spirit of co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is a source of satisfaction to see that the Office has had a significant impact on the quality of service being enjoyed by the public.  Too often, public service bodies have been characterised &mdash; unfairly in my view &mdash; as hidebound by red tape and more concerned with a rigid adherence to rules and regulations than with meeting the needs of the people whom they serve.  Report No. 8 of the Ombudsman should serve to dispel any such notions.  Time and time again, the report highlights instances where the Ombudsman and his staff, by dint of judicious intervention, diligence and persistence and with the co-operation of public servants, have managed to unblock the system and ensure that members of the public with a legitimate grievance received satisfaction.  Indeed, it is pleasing to note the openness of <Col N="51" /> so many public bodies to review their decisions in an unbiased way in the light of comments made by the Ombudsman. As a rule, where bodies were asked to review their decisions, they seem to have taken on board any recommendation which the Ombudsman made to them, unless they were debarred from so doing by legislation or regulation or some other genuine obstacle.</P>
    <P>On a related point, it is also heartening to see that the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman has levelled off at around 3,000 since 1988; before that, the annual level of complaints received was running at over 5,000. There is an ever growing awareness of the existence and functions of the Office since its inception; this enhanced awareness has been brought about by the publication of the annual reports, Oireachtas debates, media coverage and, in no small measure, by the highly commendable programme of regional visits undertaken in recent years by Ombudsman Office staff to various centres around the country. The fact that, despite the undoubted enhanced public awareness of the Office and its role, the number of complaints has decreased since the early years and has seemingly levelled off, indicates yet again that our Government Departments and other agencies are continually improving the quality of service which they offer to the public.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman would not, I know, claim exclusive credit for these improvements. His reports and his comments about these organisations are but one element of the feedback which Departments and their managements receive. Elected representatives still have an important role in conveying to Ministers the reaction on the ground to the operation of public agencies and it would be wrong to play down the contribution which individual Ministers have made to bring Government closer to the people.</P>
    <P>In commending the work of the Ombudsman, it would also be churlish not to extend a sincere well done to the great many public servants who continue to perform their duties with efficiency, <Col N="52" /> good humour and sensitivity to the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>One feature of this report which I am sure struck the Members of this House as forcibly as it struck me was the painstaking efforts which the Ombudsman and his staff were prepared to undertake in order to establish the facts of particular cases and then, having satisfied themselves that the complainants had a genuine grievance, the unrelenting efforts which were taken to ensure that the problems were rectified.  If I might, I would like to select two cases which I felt, exemplify this thorough-going approach.</P>
    <P>One concerned a student who had been refused a grant to pursue a post-graduate degree course.  In the process of investigating this case, the Ombudsman's investigators interviewed the complainant and her parents, the manager and officials of the local authority involved and officials from the Department of Education.  The Ombudsman also sought the advice of senior counsel on the interpretation of the 1981 higher education grants scheme under which the student was making her claim.  The investigators also studied the documentary evidence relating to the case.  The efforts of the Ombudsman paid off in this instance and the payment of the student's grant was approved.</P>
    <P>Another case, where the tireless efforts of the Ombudsman to achieve a satisfactory result impressed me greatly, concerned an elderly gentleman who had had eye operations performed privately because he considered that the health board did not appreciate the gravity of his problems and that they would not treat him in sufficient time to avoid total loss of vision.  The health board had refused to meet the cost of the two private operations.  The Office undertook a most comprehensive investigation into the complaint made by this gentleman. Detailed inquiries were made of the health board concerned; discussions were held with two consultant ophthalmologists, the gentleman's own GP and, of course, the gentleman himself; investigations were also undertaken of certain hosptial records.  Finally, following <Col N="53" /> discussions involving the Departement of Health, the health board agreed to implement the recommendation of the Ombudsman that the gentlemen be compensated in full for expense incurred in having the operations.  Such diligence and perserverance, which characterise the work of the Ombudsman, and his staff generally, deserve all our praise.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong to conclude, however, that the Ombudsman is prepared to pursue any and all complaints uncritically.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Ombudsman operates within clearly defined legal guidelines. His Office is staffed by high calibre personnel who are experienced in evaluating cases and in forming sound judgments which are entirely consistent with the remit given to the Office by the Oireachtas.  It is worth nothing in this connection that of the 2,957 complaints which were finalised by the Office in 1991, 1,129 &mdash; or 38 per cent &mdash; were not upheld.</P>
    <P>Among the useful functions which the Ombudsman has served since his appointment has been the highlighting of anomalies in existing legislation and regulations.  I have noted, with pleasure, over the years that many of these anomalies have subsequently been rectified by the responsible Ministers &mdash; sometimes arising directly from the comments of the Ombudsman and sometimes following reviews of the areas in question which were being undertaken independently of the Ombudsman's comments &mdash; but there is no denying that the Ombudsman has been an influence for positive change.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problem areas, where the Ombudsman considers that anomalies exist, which are highlighted in the current report and which, I know, my colleague Ministers and/or the relevant public bodies will examine with a view to seeing whether reform is feasible in these cases.</P>
    <P>One such issue concerned the absence of a training allowance linked to mild forms of handicap.  The Ombudsman considers that this position creates a serious problem for both applicants and <Col N="54" /> medical and administrative personnel in the health boards.  He reports that he has brought this matter to the attention of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Another anomalous situation, pointed out by the Ombudsman, concerning the DMPA scheme concerned what he considered to be the negative effects of the present income assessment arrangements on handicapped people who have some savings.  As a result of the existing regulations in this regard, the Ombudsman was unable to uphold a particular complaint about a reduction in DPMA because of the existing regulations.  He asked the Department of Health to consider this matter in the context of their review of the DPMA scheme.</P>
    <P>The report also highlights the difficulty where health boards have shown a reluctance to accept an application for DPMA from a person currently being paid unemployment assistance from the Department of Social Welfare.  The Ombudsman has expressed the view that health boards could carry out the medical examination and financial assessment for DPMA prior to the person discontinuing the unemployment assistance claim.  If a person was deemed eligible for DPMA they could then &ldquo;sign off&rdquo; from unemployment assistance in the knowledge that DPMA payments would commence immediately.  He suggested, as an alternative, that the health boards might give an undertaking that social welfare allowance might be paid in the interim period while DPMA eligibility was being examined.</P>
    <P>Another DPMA case considered by the Ombudsman arose from the fact that a man's DPMA has been withdrawn on marriage because of his wife's earnings. The Ombudsman has pointed out to the Department of Health that he considers it inequitable that the method for assessment of means of payments for able bodied persons makes certain allowances for the individual circumstances, whereas the method for assessment for disabled persons does not.</P>
    <P>The report also draws attention to the difficulties encountered by persons between 16 and 18 regarding payments of <Col N="55" /> DPMA. This issue was raised in previous years by the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman considers that if a health board fails to take the appropriate steps at the time of a person's 16th birthday, any individual qualifying for DPMA should be paid arrears of DPMA from his 16th birthday.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is also of the view that the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1986 and 1987, give rise to an anomaly in that patients on a large income but with a dependant will not be charged for in-patient services arising from a long period of hospitalisation after 30 days, while a person on a very low income without a dependant will be liable for charges.  The Ombudsman asked that this anomaly be appropriately addressed within the context of the Department of Health's review of the regulations governing maintenance charges.</P>
    <P>The report also draws attention to the fact that the minimum post-rent income guaranteed under the income maintenance system does not apply to a family which rents accommodation from a local authority under a differential rent scheme.  As a result, in the case investigated by the Ombudsman, the family in question was refused rent allowance which would in other circumstances have brought their income to the appropriate SWA level after payment of rent.  The Ombudsman initiated discussions with the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Welfare concerning this anomaly and the two Departments undertook to examine the issue raised in the complaint.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has served an important public function in highlighting these anomalies.  I have no doubt that, with the spirit of co-operation which is in general evidence in the report, the issues raised in the report will be given thorough consideration and, where feasible, the necessary reforms put in place.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we Irish do not have a tradition of making constructive complaints about the quality of service offered to us.  Too often, we have felt &mdash;<Col N="56" /> whether consciously or sub-consciously I am not sure &mdash; that we had no right to question the decisions of those who provide public services.  It is difficult to say why this should be so; it may be an inherited attitude from the pre-Independence generations who frequently saw the State and its agencies as inimical to their best interests.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that up to very recently there has been an insufficient awareness that the function of public servants is to serve us and that, in a very real sense, public servants are the employees of every citizen in this State.  A related attitude was the belief that making complaints was a futile exercise as they were sure to fall on deaf ears on the part of an officialdom which was unwilling to consider complaints on their merits. Shades of the old American adage that &ldquo;You can't fight City Hall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I personally feel that we, as consumers of public services, are growing in confidence in our dealings with public authorities. We are taking the public service off its pedestal and that is no bad thing either from the point of view of the individual citzen or from the perspective of the public servant himself.  I think that most public servants feel more comfortable where their clients approach them on a basis of equality.  As politicians we should welcome enthusiastically the growing evidence that citizens are no longer prepared to take second best.  By questioning decisions citizens are helping to strengthen our democracy and demonstrating the essential health of our system of Government and public administration. An attitude of complacency or even resignation on the part of the citizen towards the public decision making process is inimical to the development of a strong civic culture and inevitably breeds a culture of alienation which, in turn, gives rise to a whole range of anti-social attitudes and behaviours.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of developments in recent years which have contributed to this much needed shift in public attitude.  We as a Government are committed to making Government and public authorities generally more accessible <Col N="57" /> and more accountable to the public. One initiative which is under consideration at present is the question of the feasibility and workability of freedom of information legislation.  If it proves possible to proceed with such legislation it will serve to bring Government closer to the people and help them to understand the mechanisms through which the decision making process operates.</P>
    <P>The weekly briefing sessions for the media, initiated by the Taoiseach are another example of bridge building between Government and the citizen. Not least among the factors which have wrought this change in public attitudes has been the Ombudsman's Office.  The Ombudsman has shown &mdash; and I feel that this is particularly evident from the report under discussion today &mdash; that far from not being able to fight &ldquo;City Hall&rdquo;, the citizen is now able, often through the good offices of the Ombudsman, to sit down with &ldquo;City Hall&rdquo; and help it to see the shortcomings in its own systems and, where necessary, to change these systems to make them more user-friendly.</P>
    <P>There are numerous books and booklets, both official and otherwise, which set out in detail the public services which are available to the citizen and the cost of such services to the Exchequer, and these are all very useful to the general citizen, the student of Government and the politician.  The Ombudsman's report is, I think, unique in that it goes behind the clinical details of the various services provided by the State to provide an insight into how these services operate on the ground and how these services, and their administration, are perceived by the general public.  The report lends a human dimension to any discussion about our public services.  As such, I would certainly feel that the annual Ombudsman's report should be on the reading list for every student of civics or of public administration.</P>
    <P>As the Ombudsman and his Office complete another year of operation, I have no doubt about the valuable role they play in Irish public administration. They are making a significant contribution towards removing any friction <Col N="58" /> which may exist between public service institutions and the individual citizen. They have done much to ensure that solutions are found to some of the more difficult problems which arise occasionally when the public deals with bureaucracy. Finally, I am convinced that the Ombudsman and his staff are contributing in no small way to the generation of an atmosphere of greater openness and public accountability which this Government is determined should be the hallmark of all our public institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is keeping to his well established tradition of appearing in this House for any matter under his responsibility.</P>
      <P>This is a debate we all welcome because we have rarely in the past had an opportunity to comment on the operation of one of the more important if less publicised offices of State.  It is appropriate that this debate is taking place on the day when the Irish insurance industry introduces its new insurance ombudsman to the public.  In that regard I would like to wish Mrs. Marilyn Quinn, the new insurance ombudsman, well with her new responsibilities.  I think that what is happening in the insurance industry is indicative of a general welcome trend among major industries.  These bodies are beginning to realise that they are accountable and that frequently it is in their own interests to have a structure whereby cases can be examined.</P>
      <P>In the past the secretive cumbersome procedures of these companies often created the impression that the big guns would always win and that the individual with a grievance was unlikely to be successful. It is good to see these old-fashioned attitudes breaking down in the insurance industry and in some other industries also.  I hope other industries will follow that example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a growing need in our society for better appeals procedures.  The Ombudsman, effectively, is an appeals procedure whereby an appeal is made, the evidence examined in a factual, objective, non-partisan way and a conclusion <Col N="59" /> reached.  Much frustration in different areas of society results from people's belief that they will not get a fair hearing, that the dice is loaded against them and that their reasonable grievance will not be addressed.  This belief applies in a range of areas.  Senator Costello would probably agree that problems are created in the penal system by the absence of proper appeals procedures in certain cases.  It is certainly the case with examinations and there is growing popular concern that while justice may be done in an examination, it is not always seen to be done.  There may be a need, where a student has a legitimate cause for grievance, for a case to be properly openly and comprehensively investigated &mdash; I am not talking about a frivolous or a vexatious case.</P>
    <P>The communications media could look at the example of other countries where an Ombudsman has been appointed. Politicians and others in public life, frequently feel a sense of grievance against the media.  We may be right or we may be wrong but we learn quickly to develop thick skins in politics.  If the media had an Ombudsman system which would investigate complaints speedily and fairly &mdash; the complaint may be found justified, or not &mdash; people would feel that they were getting a fair hearing.  An appeals system might dissipate much frustration and current anti-media feeling and much of the extraordinary expense attaching to legal cases might not be necessary.</P>
    <P>The late James Dillon was fond of saying that within the world of Parliament the parliamentary question was the guarantee of the right of the citizen.  It meant that the rights of the most humble person could be raised in a sovereign Parliament and that the Executive would be held accountable for its actions in dealing with that person.  There is not much doubt that over the years the Dáil question &mdash; unfortunately we do not have a similar system in this House &mdash; was a substitute for much of what the Ombudsman is now doing, although the Dáil question, as the Minister well knows, continue's to fulfil that purpose also.  It is <Col N="60" /> important for people to know that if they have a grievance against the public service it can be raised in the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have seen the growth of Government lead to complexity and to a proliferation of agencies. The Dáil question was frequently not the best way to have grievances redressed. The best way is to have a grievance addressed on the spot through normal representation by the person or by a public representative.  Where that is not feasible the Dáil question has been enormously useful but growth and complexity of administration made that more difficult. Clearly, by the 1980s that system was not working adequately and many people in those years had the impression that bureaucracy in many cases appeared to be self-serving rather than orientated towards the public.  Frustration was felt at all levels, by the complainant and by public representatives who frequently came up against what they saw as a stonewall, where they were passed from Billy to Jack, where red tape appeared at every opportunity, where a problem that looked almost resolved would suddenly return again.  Frequently, the way in which it might be resolved appeared disproportionate, necessitating either raising the matter on the Adjournment in this or the other House or the launching of an attack on the area public service allegedly involved.</P>
    <P>The arrival of the Ombudsman was designed to ensure that the public service would be accountable.  The office of Ombudsman has been one of the great success stories of the past eight or ten years of Irish politics and today, it is an accepted part of our public service.  It has been successful, first, because the legislation was sensible, and allowed for a reasonably slow start.  The number of functions allocated to the Ombudsman has increased over the years but not quickly enough for the office to be submerged and its functioning obstructed.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the success of the office of Ombudsman has been the personality of the Ombudsman and the quality of his staff.  The Government of <Col N="61" /> the day, in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, made an inspired choice when Michael Mills was asked to become the first Ombudsman.  The term &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; was unfamiliar, a strange word which most people did not know, but the association of the office with Michael Mills gave it a public face and an immediate acceptability.  People knew that this person was not on one side or the other but commissioned to ensure fair play.  With acceptance by the public came credibility and perceived integrity.</P>
    <P>The office of Ombudsman is not a one man show.  Those of us who have dealt with the Office over the years appreciate the general quality and dedication of its staff.  The Minister rightly paid tribute to the painstaking way in which the Office goes about establishing the facts of every case, coming to problems with an open mind, establishing rights and reaching an objective conclusion.  The Minister rightly said also that the Ombudsman does not start off from an anti-Establishment position; he starts off by trying to establish the facts.  An office is partly defined by legislation but even more so by the personality of the incumbent and those who work with her or him.  The growth and acceptability of the Ombudsman's Office owes a great deal to the only holder so far and to his staff.</P>
    <P>The Office has also shown the commendable features of tact and patience. The Minister was more gentle today than he might have been a few years ago in referring to the reaction of many people in the public service to the Office of Ombudsman.  I, too, might have shared his outlook on this a few years ago.  In the early years of the Office, some Departments were resistant and regarded the Ombudsman as an intrusion into their way of doing things.  They felt that his appointment cast a slur on their integrity or they were not prepared to accept the greater degree of accountability to which the Minister referred and which is becoming part of public service ethos.  Undoubtedly, hard battles were fought in those days and the Ombudsman had to fight hard to ensure that he was accepted, not <Col N="62" /> as a whim but as a result of Government Statute with an obligation to fulfil.</P>
    <P>Those battles have been fought and almost won, although I still hear varying stories that not all Departments or sections of the public service accept fully that the Ombudsman has a statutory right to investigate, to seek documents and to examine all that happens.  He does not have power to impose his will but it would be unconscionable for any section of the public service not to accept the findings of the Ombudsman.  I am happy to hear the Minister say he believes that that attitude is now a thing of the past.  I hope it is but this happy state was not achieved without some tough battles and I am glad to say that the result has been very much in favour of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Minister has looked at different aspects of the current report of the Ombudsman.  I do not intend to go into this in detail because, to a great extent, the report speaks for itself.  I compliment whoever wrote and presented this report for the clarity of the language and the easy, straightforward way in which the cases are set out.  This is an example of what an official document should be, designed so that the ordinary public and public representative can understand it.</P>
    <P>It gives a very good account of what the Ombudsman has been doing for the past year.  I am interested in what he had to say about Telecom Éireann.  There is no doubt, and any public representative will confirm this, that in the eighties a large part of the representations of any public representative concerned Telecom Éireann, especially from old people and people who felt they had been wrongly billed.  In many cases it was manifest that they had been wrongly billed; many old people fear using the telephone and others use it very sparingly and it seemed almost impossible to get a satisfactory response from Telecom.  They were judge and jury in their own case.  Clearly, new technology has improved the situation.  I also hope the efforts of the Ombudsman and better public relations will improve the situation so that Telecom Éireann will be mentioned less in future reports.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has some very wise <Col N="63" /> things to say on pages 35-37 of his report on the increasing problems arising out of the closure of pedestrian ways in residential areas.  There can be all sorts of reasons some people want them closed. Local authorities may want them closed in response to representations by people who see these pedestrian ways used for cider parties, as places where criminals hang out, etc.  There may be good reasons for closing them but that can be a great inconvenience for other people.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman in his report has set out very good guidelines which should be followed in future by all local authorities &mdash; it is predominantly an urban problem. On page 37 he lays out the approach he took.  Local authorities would be well advised to look at that because it could save them problems in the future.</P>
    <P>There are other issues covered &mdash; the anomalies which affect separated people who can often feel friendless and lost within the system.  I was interested also in the section on the rights of those who want to use Irish as the language to conduct their official business.  We have had experience of that in this House in recent times.  I have great sympathy with people who feel their right to conduct their business through the Irish language &mdash; the first official language of the State &mdash; is not always possible through the procedures and mechanisms which are available and that their constitutional rights are less because of that.  I am glad the Ombudsman has taken up that point.  We have to be consistent.  We cannot have constitutional provisions or adherence to the Irish language and then, because it costs money or it is inconvenient, deprive people of the full use of those rights.</P>
    <P>I also notice from reading the report and from my own experience that the work of the Ombudsman has been enhanced by regional visits.  It is very important that the Ombudsman and his staff get out of Dublin and set up their offices in different parts of the country. There are obvious reasons for this.  The people who will most want to avail of the services of the Ombudsman are not often able to travel to Dublin or to find their <Col N="64" /> way to the Office of the Ombudsman to make their complaints.  I repeat, the telephone answering service in the office is always courteous and is clearly designed to ensure that people who are not used to making official phone calls are properly accommodated.  As I said, the regional visits are very important and bring the Office to regional areas. Through advertising in the local newspapers people will be aware that the Ombudsman or his Office will be present at a particular time and they can go in person and talk about their complaint.</P>
    <P>I hope the profile of the Ombudsman could be further enhanced through having a regular slot for the Ombudsman on a radio programme, not high profile television programmes.  The radio phone-in, talk-in, the conversational type programme, has become a staple part of public life.  In one sense, part of the nation talks to the other, or the nation talks to itself.  It strikes me that the work of the Ombudsman could be enhanced by having access to these programmes where the Ombudsman would explain just what it is he and his Office can do. Thus, people will be aware what complaints can be dealt with by his Office.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is symptomatic of the more open society in which we live, a more accountable society, but nobody would deny it still has a long way to go. I am doing historical research on Dáil debates of the thirties, forties and fifties and I am often struck by the contrast in the attitude of Ministers then with the attitude of Ministers today.  In those days Ministers felt they did not have any obligation to tell either House very much. The official attitude was tell them as little as possible.  For the most part, Deputies and Senators did not seem to think there was anything remiss in that.  It was a more closed, authoritarian type society.  The newspapers were not investigative.  We did not have the proliferation of media, for good or ill, that we have today.  The Government did not see any need to publicise what they were doing.  Government publications were spare and sparse and written in language that was often unintelligible, couched in legal and official <Col N="65" /> language that no ordinary person could understand.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous change in that attitude.  We are a much more open society now.  The Office of the Ombudsman is a good example of where the public service is accountable in an open way for its actions and in the interest of the ordinary citizen.  The report of the Ombudsman, written in good, clear, crisp English, is an extension of the right of people to know what is being done on their behalf and with their money.  In spite of the recent Supreme Court judgment we are a much more open society.  I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say about the possibility of a freedom of information Act.  I will believe that when I see it, nonetheless I encourage the Minister to go ahead with it.  It is a privilege to be associated with this debate on this most worthwhile report.</P>

      <P>Before calling Senator McKenna I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am sure he will enjoy this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new portfolio.  This is the first formal opportunity I had to convey my best wishes to him.</P>
      <P>I will begin by complimenting the people who prepared this report.  As Senator Manning said, it is written in plain language.  It is not couched in legal jargon or anything like that.  Anybody reading this report will readily understand it.  That is extremely important because the Office of Ombudsman operates as an appeals mechanism on behalf of the general public.  It is very important that whoever wishes can read the report and see exactly what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also compliment and congratulate the Ombudsman and his Office on the marvellous work they are doing.  It highlights the long distance we have come since the Ombudsman was first appoined by the Oireachtas.  It has been said by the Minister and by Senator Manning that there was a lot of scepticism, fear, doubt and a <Col N="66" /> kind of &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; sentiments expressed by the public service in many areas in relation to the Office of the Ombudsman. There was fear and doubt expressed by many public representatives in relation to the Office.  Many public representatives felt that the Ombudsman would take over a lot of the jobs and problem solving that they would see as being directly related to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned Question Time in the Dáil and the Adjournment debate in this House as the means generally used by which Members highlight problems.  That was the traditional method of doing things.  That was the type of attitude displayed towards the Ombudsman initially which I am very glad to say has disappeared.  All accept now that the Ombudsman is a necessary Office in the scheme of things.  It indicates the great distance we have come.</P>
    <P>In relation to protection of consumers, the basic protection they had was the Sale of Goods Act which was enacted in 1893. That was their only protection for a considerable period of time.  Then we had the Hire Purchase Acts, 1946 and 1960, the Consumer Information Act, 1978, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and the Data Protection Act, which is the most recent one, and is very important to the general public.</P>
    <P>The credit institutions have introduced an Ombudsman also.  I very much welcome today's development in relation to an Ombudsman for the insurance industry. Consumers are also protected by the law of contract.  They now have the means at their disposal to rectify their complaints.  While we had legislation on the Statute Book, very few consumers knew their rights and even if they did, the fear and cost of the court process prevented many people from undertaking actions for compensation.  The appointment of the Ombudsman was a very welcome development and it educated the public in relation to what their rights are.  This is where the Ombudsman comes into his own.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is a defender of the people and his Office operates a type of appeals mechanism.  He comes at the <Col N="67" /> same problem from a different direction. That is not, by any means, to cast aspersion on any individual in the public service.  Everyone recognises they have a job to do and, by and large, they do an excellent job.  Their terms of reference are different from those of the Ombudsman. That is why with the introduction of the Office of Ombudsman, more and more of the public became aware of their rights and of the responsibility of the public service towards them.</P>
    <P>In relation to cases in which the Ombudsman would not be directly involved and which would not be within his terms of reference, he can advise people on what direction to go and who to contact.  By educating the public they will become very much aware of the avenues that are open to them.  Apart from the fact that his Office are doing an excellent job in terms of appealing on behalf of certain individuals, he is also educating the general public in relation to a whole range of other areas where they have rights under the law.  That is good.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman mentions in his report &mdash; and it was mentioned already by Senator Manning and the Minister &mdash; that the number of complaints have levelled off in the region of 3,000 per annum.  That is significant.  Everybody was of the opinion at one time that no matter what area of the public service one dealt with, whether it was with Bord Telecom, the ESB, local authorities, health boards or whatever, there was a multiplicity of difficulties under which people operated and that everyone who dealt with those sectors had problems. That is by no means the case.  In relation to Telecom Éireann the Ombudsman stated in his report that there is a significant fall-off in the number of complaints received in relation to services provided by Telecom Éireann.  He instanced the fact that many of the problems would have been solved by the itemised billing service that Telecom Éireann have recently introduced.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints in relation to Telecom Éireann about the <Col N="68" /> number of card operated telephones as opposed to coin operated telephones. The Ombudsman in his report highlighted a cross-section of complaints; I know he could not include all 3,000 complaints. I wonder if any of the complaints he got related to this problem.  I have had numerous complaints from people who say that if it is late at night and they wish to make a telephone call they cannot do so because most of the public telephones have now been converted from coin operated telephones to card operated telephones. I appreciate that the reason behind it is a very good one.  At the same time, it causes problems for many people where they do not have access to call cards to use in those telephones.  I wonder if, in the course of his work over the years, the Ombudsman has come across that type of complaint.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Passport Office comes into the Ombudsman's bailiwick but we have received complaints in relation to the difficulties people experience applying for passports, particularly at high season.  There are huge queues outside the Passport Office all through the summer and one would pity the members of the public who queue there for hours to get a passport.</P>
    <P>I am delighted and compliment the Passport Office on their initiative in offering passports for the months of October and November at the reduced rate of £35.  It is a marvellous opportunity and encourages people to get their passports during the off-season.  We are all at fault when it comes to renewing our passports. We decide to go on a holiday or a business trip and find at the last minute we do not have a passport and there is a big rush to get one.  The people we find fault with are the staff in the Passport Office and not ourselves.  I compliment them and the Department of Foreign Affairs on their initiative I do not know how many people are aware that that facility is available for the months of October and November and I appeal to the public to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has to deal with a significant range of cases which we, as public representatives, have come across. <Col N="69" /> Public representatives were sceptical and looked with a jaundiced eye when the office was set up by the Oireachtas but I am glad to say that in a number of the case studies mentioned in the report, he says that public representatives made representations to him on behalf of members of the public.  That is a good development.  The more we co-operate in providing a service for the public, the better the service.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning had a side swipe at the media when he referred to an ombudsman for the media.  That might not be a bad thing.  In relation to the media, a good development in recent times has been the fact that many programmes discuss current affairs and problems affecting the general public.  That is very much in evidence in local radio where almost daily there are slots where people phone in complaints and the radio station usually has some expert to advise what course of action should be taken. That is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>It was a marvellous decision by the Ombudsman and his staff to undertake regional visits so that people in the country could make their complaints in person.  It is important that problems are discussed face to face rather than over a telephone because it is easier to explain on a one-to-one basis.  That is a great development.  The Ombudsman indicates also in his report that it is his intention to extend that programme for the next year.  His staff are to be complimented for doing that.  As a result, his Office and his work will be highlighted and more people will be aware of this service.</P>
    <P>The Consumers Association of Ireland produce a monthly magazine called &ldquo;Consumer Choice&rdquo; which gives details of the protection and redress available for consumers.  As well as that, it is an educational experience because when people have a grievance and deal with the Ombudsman, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade or the Consumer Association of Ireland they find out the situation.</P>
    <P>It is significant as stated in the report, that only 18 per cent of all complaints were upheld.  The Ombudsman said there <Col N="70" /> were a number of cases where he would have preferred to give a decision in favour of the complainant but because of the legislation in place at the moment he could not do so.  The majority of the cases were ones he could not justify.  He went on to say that almost half of the complainants got assistance in some form or other.  What he probably means is that he advised them on the direction they should take &mdash; I referred to this earlier.</P>
    <P>People are satisfied when they know that a case was made on their behalf and that because of X, Y or Z their case did not warrant compensation or the Ombudsman could not find in favour of them.  That is very important because the alternative is that people would be under the misapprehension that they were not getting the service the help from the public service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned higher education grants and means testing.  He instanced case studies of individuals who had problems in some areas.  I appreciate there are problems because there is a lot of controversy about higher education grants; there is a divide I am not too happy with and a misunderstanding about the breakdown between the PAYE sector and the self-employed.  PAYE people are under the impression that there is nothing they can do about higher education grants but that self-employed people have a means by which they can get around many of the regulations.  Some self-employed people who appear to be in a better financial position qualify for higher education grants for their children while some PAYE workers who do not appear to be so well off, do not qualify. From my experience, the number of cases in which that would happen is not large but the Ombudsman's office could be used to examine this aspect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the generous increases in income limits for higher education grants announced by the Minister for Education. I am concerned, however, that when the self-employed submit their accounts for higher education grants, by a strange anomaly interest on particular loans, which is allowable by the Revenue <Col N="71" /> Commissioners for income tax purposes, is not allowed by local authorities and vocational education committees for higher education grant purposes.  I do not understand this.</P>
    <P>We have all had occasion to decry the Revenue Commissioners and to tell them in no uncertain terms what a mean bunch of individuals they are in the way they treat the general public.  They throw the book at you at every opportunity.  Incidentally, I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of the Revenue Commissioners offices in Nenagh which took place as a result of the Fianna Fáil decentralisation programme and the 200 staff involved are very welcome.  However, by and large, the perception of the Revenue Commissioners is that it is very difficult to get anything from them but if they are owed something they must be paid immediately.  However, they allow interest on loans for certain expenses but when the same type of accounts are sent to local authorities and vocational education committees for higher education grant purposes the interest on those loans is not allowable.  As a result, the income on the basis of which entitlement to a higher education grant is determined is higher.  I ask those responsible to reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in relation to home improvements grants and differential rent schemes were also mentioned. People find it difficult to understand that they have to pay X number of pounds one week and X + Y pounds the next week.  The Government introduced a house buy-out scheme a couple of years ago and it was an unbelievable success.  I was amazed at the number of people who opted not to get involved in the scheme, although it offered them the opportunity to buy their own homes at a very low cost.  In many cases one would not get half a site for the price at which people bought out their homes.  It is only with hindsight that those who opted not to do so realise the great opportunity they lost. I had occasion some time ago to ask the Minister for the Environment to consider such a scheme again because I think it <Col N="72" /> would be of enormous benefit to many people.  The responsibility for maintenance would be transferred to those who would buy their own homes.  Much money is being spent on repairing local authority housing at the moment.</P>
    <P>Regarding people who apply for house improvement grants, there is a delay between the date on which they apply for the grants and when the inspector comes to inspect the type of property involved and the work undertaken.  There can be a substantial time lag.  In many cases people have arranged for a builder to do a job at a particular time and, in all innocence, they decide to go ahead.  As they have made the application they think there will be no difficulty.  Then the inspector arrives and they subsequently get a letter from the Department stating that, because the work was started before the inspector had passed it, there is no grant payable.  We should look at that problem.  It should be stated quite categorically that people should not begin reconstruction until such time as they get the all-clear from the Department.  We should try to shorten the time span between the date of application and the inspection of the property.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister and Senator Manning, I wish to compliment the Office of the Ombudsman for the tremendous work being done, for the efficient and sensitive way they handle people's complaints and for making people more aware of the fact that there is somebody there to protect them, there is somebody there to whom they can appeal.  Allied to the developments that have taken place over the years, it is a reassurance for the public and for specific individuals who may have felt, heretofore, that there was nobody they could turn to.  If they had a complaint, they were deterred from taking any action because of the enormous cost involved.  Now they know there is somebody to whom they can turn.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is the forerunner for all of the other developments that have taken place.  There is now an ombudsman for the credit institutions, and one for the insurance industry.  I have no doubt there will be an ombudsman for a variety of <Col N="73" /> other activities coming onstream.  This is a result of people being educated, knowing their rights, of getting involved and expressing their unhappiness with the way in which things are being conducted. The reactions from institutions, financial institutions and the insurance industry has been on a voluntary basis.  One has to recognise that.  The only Ombudsman whose office has a statutory basis is the Ombudsman we are talking about here. The ombudsman for the credit institutions and for the insurance industry is a facility those institutions themselves have undertaken to provide.  It is most worth while.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Manning, I would definitely welcome a Freedom of Information Act.  It is most necessary and I would be an advocate of it.</P>
    <P>I again want to compliment the Ombudsman and his staff for the excellent work they are doing and to hope they will continue the good work in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is entirely appropriate that we should have this matter as the first item of business on our first day of work in the autumn session.  It is appropriate that we should be discussing a matter concerned with the extension of democracy, with consumers rights and the right to know &mdash; a report from that watchdog of the public, the Ombudsman. It is appropriate that we in the Seanad should give our support to open democracy so far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report.  I am delighted to see that the Ombudsman is doing the work with the same degree of efficiency and effectiveness as has been the case over the years.  It is extremely important that the Ombudsman should be an independent and impartial person entirely separate from the Government and that he should deal with the public affairs and matters of concern to the public in relation to all the public institutions of the State.  Above all, it is important that the Ombudsman actually has the powers to do what he is delegated to do under the law.  He can summons the people responsible for the decisions leading to a <Col N="74" /> complaint to appear before him and he can summons all files, decisions and all other matters relating to any complaint before him.  That is the essence of a watchdog institution like the Ombudsman. It must be an independent body with powers to ensure that all necessary information is made available and that nothing can be withheld.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the existence of the Ombudsman has prevented many petty actions being taken in the courts. Complaints that can be dealt with through an honest broker &mdash; which, of course, the Ombudsman is &mdash; might otherwise have gone to costly law cases which would have been of little benefit to the consumer.  The Ombudsman has also taken some of the burden of work off us, the politicians, because until the Ombudsman was appointed politicians were seen as the first in the line to be consulted when a complaint arose and were expected to deal with that complaint. The Ombudsman is now known throughout the country and is often the person first contacted, frequently by phone.  We should be delighted that some of the burden of our work is being taken from us by the Ombudsman's Office.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy that a number of areas have been omitted from the scope of the Ombudsman's brief.  The first such area is the private sector.  The Ombudsman's functions relate to public bodies &mdash; semi-State bodies, local authorities, health boards, Government Departments, Civil Service, Telecom Éireann, An Post and so on &mdash; but they do not extend to the private sector.  That obviously has its problems because, naturally enough, public complaints are not limited to within the public sector.  We need an extension of ombudsman type facilities to cover areas in the private sector about which there is a large number of complaints from time to time.</P>
    <P>I note with approval the establishment today by the insurance industry of its own ombudsperson.  That is very much to be welcomed.  I have here before me the annual report of the Ombudsman for the credit institutions, that is, the banking institutions and the building societies.  It <Col N="75" /> is tremendous to see private bodies producing such reports.  This ombudsman was appointed under the Central Bank Act, 1989, and the Building Societies Act, 1989, which gave powers to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment to establish such schemes.  These are voluntary schemes which dealt with a wide variety of complaints. Over 400 complaints came to this body alone, about 70 per cent of which related to the banking sector.  Quite clearly, there are certain areas of private enterprise where there is need for such schemes.  Numerous other areas could be covered as well.  There are many complaints relating to the construction industry, the retailing sector and the farming sector.</P>
    <P>Another area I would be concerned about is the whole area of recruitment to employment.  Pay and conditions of employment are specifically excluded from the brief of the Ombudsman.  That is good enough.  The employer/employee relationship is regulated by means of trade union negotiation.  However, very often, and increasingly so at the present time, many companies are specifically preventing trade unions from organising within their area of employment.  Now we have what has become known as the &ldquo;yellow pack worker&rdquo;, where the employer goes for the cheapest possible unit on the labour market, the most effective unit from his point of view.  By and large it is the young people in our society, fit, eager and well educated, who are employed on a part-time basis and not given their full entitlements under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The 1977 legislation is subject to much abuse and we need some watchdog monitoring system to deal with the very low wages being offered in these institutions and the very poor working conditions that exist there.  We can see around us in the city areas such as fast food outlets and various public houses.  Young people are taken on, but when they reach the age at which they would have statutory entitlements they are either let go and replaced, or taken on on a parttime basis, <Col N="76" /> specifically to ensure that they do not get any statutory entitlements.  Thus the employer can avoid paying as many State contributions, taxes and PRSI as possible. That is an area into which we could very usefully see an extension of the Ombudsman scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another area which has been specifically deleted from the Ombudsman's responsibilities and that is the area of the Department of Justice in relation to the Garda Síochána and the prisons.  In the Scandanavian legislation from which we derived the office of Ombudsman, one of the primary functions of the office was to look into the system of justice and the prison system. Our Department of Justice specifically had that provision excluded.  They did not want anybody prying into their affairs, least of all a public watch-dog like the Ombudsman.  They operate under the Official Secrets Act and do not want an impartial or independent observer.</P>
    <P>The Garda have gone some way towards rectifying the problem by establishing a Garda Complaints Body in recent years.  That is to be welcomed. However, there are still many cases outstanding, we still have the Nicky Kelly case, the calls for inquiries into the heavy gangs etc.  I will not go into that.  Nothing has been done about the prison system. There is no appeals system within the prison system nor is there a public appeals system.  There is no independent, impartial body to which staff, prisoners, their relatives, or anybody else, can appeal.  The general public might have queries to raise.  We know about the high level of suicides and drug abuse in our prisons and we have heard, from the Annual Visiting Committee of the vicious assaults and activities in the prisons, yet, we do not have a public body or a public individual who has the authority to listen to those complaints, to compel those people against whom the complaints are being made to appear before them or to make information available.  The riots etc. in prisons will continue until this is done.  I would ask the Government to reconsider that situation and to amend the 1980 Ombudsman Act to extend the <Col N="77" /> operation of the Ombudsman's powers to cover the prison system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be possible to set up further ombudspersons in the public area.  According to the report 45 per cent of the complaints related to the public service, and the Civil Service, and 28 per cent related to Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of complaints about health boards, local authorities and social welfare. One can see that this coincides with the cutbacks in those areas in recent years, particularly in the health boards. The quality of the health service is very difficult to maintain, given the cutbacks in funding.  The local authorities are finding it impossible to make ends meet, particularly in relation to maintenance of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is becoming a major issue in itself.  The cutbacks and the statements by the Minister for Social Welfare over recent months will lead to an enormous increase in complaints.  There has been a significant increase already but there will be an enormous increase reflected in next year's report.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Ombudsman's Office is both symbolic and real, symbolic in the sense that we can say, as a people, that we know there is a service that can be availed of even though we may not need it.  We have an open democracy. The consumer has rights.  The person who is appointed as watch dog for consumer rights has the power to carry out the functions for which he was appointed. The figures show that roughly half of those who lodged complaints benefited; 18 per cent of the complainants had their complaints fully resolved and 31 per cent received some assistance from the Ombudsman.  In other words, roughly 50 per cent of complaints were justified. That is a high proportion.  Some assistance, if not full assistance, was given by the Ombudsman in 49 per cent of the cases that came before him.</P>
    <P>The cases which came before him are probably only the tip of the iceberg because the Office of the Ombudsman is not as universally known as it should be. In the advice centres I operate, it is very <Col N="78" /> seldom that anybody suggests going to the Ombudsman.  I go to the corporation, the health authority or the Department of Social Welfare but it is extremely seldom anybody suggests that the Ombudsman be approached.  I would be the one to make that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Ombudsman can do this within the context of his own Office, but we need to highlight his powers, role and work.  The suggestion was made earlier that there could be a media programme in which representatives of the Ombudsman's Office would provide information.  That would be a wonderful programme on radio or television, or a column in one of the newspapers.  I would like to see a development along those lines.</P>
    <P>There are areas where we can reduce the work of the Ombudsman by providing professional services.  We have already, on our Order Paper today, a motion from Fianna Fáil calling on Seanad Éireann to request the Government to set up a press council.  Why not have a press council which would regulate the standards and professional capacity of the press?  That would prevent many complaints.  I think it would be a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>I have represented the teaching profession in the past.  For many years we have been looking for a teachers' council who would be obliged to impose a professional element of self-regulation on our members in relation to the way they carry out their duties, and dealing with the conditions of employment, standardisation, teachers' rights and entitlements and complaints about the teaching and education services.  Every profession should have a council or body concerned with establishing and regulating standards. That would reduce a lot of the complaints from various quarters against various professionals.  The legal profession should also be monitored in this way.</P>
    <P>People have looked for a Freedom of Information Act for many years but this Government, and Governments in the past, have been reluctant to provide it.  It would be another avenue to reduce the <Col N="79" /> work of the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman should be a last resort.  We should have suffient structures in place at Government, local authority, health board and education levels as well as in private companies and, in the professions. If we had this self-regulatory mechanism it would be a line of defence and would ensure that standards were maintained.  It would also reduce the number of complaints to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There are many complaints about local authorities and there is an argument to be made for decentralisation.  In the Civic Charter of Dublin Corporation there is a proposal that the services provided by that local authority should be accessible to the people of the area.  There is not much sense in having all of the services of the whole city centralised in one or two bunkers down in Christchurch, with people having to travel miles at high expense to themselves and waste considerable time.  There should be an office in people's own area where they can get information, where they can pay their rent, ask for their entitlements and make their complaints.  That would save the politicians a lot of problems.  It is something that we as legislators will have to study.</P>
    <P>There are areas where I would see that the Ombudsman legislation should be amended because areas have been specifically excluded.  There are other areas that perhaps require a separate ombudsman.  For example, in New Zealand, and I think in Australia, there is an ombudsman simply to deal with the whole area of health.  He has got similar powers to those of our Ombudsman.  We give patients in our hospitals a charter of patients' rights but we do not give them an ombudsman.  We are giving them something on paper that will be posted on every wall in every hospital but it will be very hard for them to ensure that those rights are enforced.  We could usefully look at high problem areas and think in terms of what has been done in other countries in extending Ombudsman schemes to those areas.  We could focus <Col N="80" /> on the work our own Ombudsman is doing in those areas as well.</P>
    <P>The message is that we want an open society, we want to ensure that our citizens have access to whatever information they need.  If there is some matter that requires redress we want the Ombudsman to be empowered to do that and we would like this extended to the private sector as well.  I welcome the annual report of the Ombudsman as a statement of how we are operating our society in a democratic fashion and an extension of accountability by ourselves as legislators.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a ghabháil don Aire go dtí an Teach seo inniu.  I would also like to join with the other Senators who had high praise for the Ombudsman and the work he does. Certainly he deserves all our praise.  He was known to us before he took this job and he is doing it in a clear, concise and efficient manner.  Not alone is his Office easy to approach but he himself is easy to approach.  On three occasions when I looked for him in person I was able to speak to him.</P>
      <P>It is nine years since the Ombudsman's Office was set up and Mr. Mills was appointed.  It is a statutory Office.  By and large, most sections of the public service are co-operating with him but there are a small number of sections that are not co-operating with him after nine years.  I would appeal to those sections to realise that this is a statutory Office and that they are obliged to give him their full cooperation and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned that people do not know enough about those things.  In the technical school I went to in Grange we were taught that education was for life and there was always a special time for discussing various subjects that would apply to us in years to come.  I have found this very useful ever since.  I wonder does any school study the Ombudsman's report?  One thing that is lacking in our schools is a sense of pride in ourselves.  How many schools hang out the national flag?  Instead of looking for more officialdom to enforce this teachers should adopt a more patriotic approach. <Col N="81" /> Patriotism is something I spoke about before and I will speak about it again. It does not mean being involved with subversives; it means love of one's school and of one's area.  If we started with pride in ourselves and in our place and educated children accordingly it might be a very good exercise to help us all in the years to come.</P>
    <P>When I looked at the report I saw that 28 per cent of the complaints that are received concern Telecom Éireann.  Telecom are giving a good service now; I will give them credit for what they are doing well and I have no doubt our telephone service is the best in the world.  Nevertheless they seem to act in a very dogmatic manner compared with, for instance, the ESB who do not come within the remit of the Ombudsman.  If your bill is overdue you will get a reminder from the ESB and you will get another reminder and indeed a collector will come to collect the amount due but Telecom Éireann will disconnect you straightaway without even notifying you. They did start, and I complimented them on it, to ring and tell people their account was overdue.  Very often it is just an oversight.</P>
    <P>The problem often arises where people have a private account and a business account and where they usually pay both accounts every two months.  Telecom have now put in a system whereby a business account must be paid monthly and people could find their business telephone disconnected after six weeks although they pay their account every two months.  This leads to a lot of bad PR for Telecom.  It is time they brought down their rates.  When I see on the graph that 28 per cent of complaints to the Ombudsman are about telephone accounts, I wonder how many problems do we not hear about?  I read with interest the way the Ombudsman went into detail on those and some of them were resolved but the number of complaints is still very high.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the health boards and the local authorities.  The health boards are providing a very important service in the area of social <Col N="82" /> welfare, disabled person's maintenance allowance, help to the handicapped and so on and yet only 11 per cent of the complaints are against health boards. That is extraordinary when you consider all the services they provide.  Again, when you consider all the services the local authorities provide and they account for only 14 per cent of complaints. Those two sections are to be congratulated and complimented.  They certainly must be doing their job very efficiently because, by and large, they are dealing with all the problem areas.</P>
    <P>A new problem for local authorities is rights-of-way in housing estates.  Many rights-of-way have had to be closed because of hooliganism, vandalism, cider parties and so on.  When they are closed it causes inconvenience and many problems. In some of the cases which were examined here, planning permission was applied for to close the area, planning permission was received and the statutory time limit had elapsed and only when the bars were going up did the objectors come on the scene.  They said they did not know about the situation until they saw the workmen on the job.  There is need for better PR in that regard.  When an area is to be closed, I know the local authority put a notice in the paper and it is discussed at local authority meetings and so on but it might be wise if they erect a notice in the area itself saying it is the intention of the council to close the roadway and anyone having any objections to same should lodge them in writing by a certain date.  That might be one way of solving that problem which seems to be a fairly major one.</P>
    <P>Another case I am interested in was where the Department refused to pay a liquid milk subsidy because the farmer did not send in his application within 28 days.  Despite the fact that all kinds of representations had been made, the Department refused to pay.  The Ombudsman took on the case and it took him quite a long time to get to the root of it but he discovered there was no legal right to deny the man his subsidy because of a late application and eventually the <Col N="83" /> man was paid the subsidy but only after four or five years.</P>
    <P>I know one particular case where a man sent in his application for beef subsidy. Three of his cattle had punched ears so he did not include those because the subsidy had already been paid on them. However, when he want in with his cards, the Department told him, there was only one that was punched and that he had put in the card for that one, which was not the case.  They would not come out to examine the cattle because there was a strike on at the time and they would not pay his headage.  It is something I will be going to Michael Mills with because I believe it is grossly unfair that headage payment was stopped on 27 cattle when the man had a genuine case and had evidence of such, but because of some inefficiency in the Department they punched cattle they should not punch and they did not punch cattle they should punch.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was in the cattle mart business my staff had problems with an official one day and he said there was no room for mistakes.  Some time afterwards someone came in with a card they had got from the Department.  They called in the official and showed him the card.  He said that was a clerical error and he would put it right.  My bookkeeper said: &ldquo;When we make a clerical error it is a mistake but when the officials make a mistake it is a clerical error&rdquo;.  I believe officials sometimes take a particular line and they do not look at all the angles.  I have always maintained that if someone is entitled to something they should not be penalised because of some technicality or because they made an error, which can be proved was an error.  In the case which Michael Mills followed up including the milk subsidy of £5,000 he considered the penalty was too great.  He proved the Department were wrong.  It is very important that we avail of the Ombudsman if people feel a wrong has been done.</P>
    <P>It was said we should avail of radio and television to air grievances and complaints. I do not think radio or television is the place for the complaints because <Col N="84" /> usually it becomes one-sided.  When you read this report you realise the amount of work the Ombudsman does and the number of files he reads.  Fifty per cent of the cases he received were unjustified, 25 per cent were justified and the other 30 per cent were cases where the local authority or relevant section was right but they enforced rather harsh rulings and the Ombudsman got them to agree to give more time in some of the rent cases and so on.  That was good but, again, he found that only 25 per cent of all the complaints were justified.  You can imagine cases like that being discussed on television.  I saw recently where a person said they were living on £130 a week. According to my assessment, the person in question was getting £220 a week.  They were right in saying they were only getting £130 in dole but they conveniently left out that there was £50 a week of children's allowance, free shoes, free clothes, free school books, medical card, subsidised rent.  All this was conveniently left out and this is where I feel the media, when they discuss cases, do not give a fair and honest report.  I could name several cases of this nature that were highlighted on television and on radio which were not accurate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the health boards, I was very pleased to see a break down of the statistics.  The North Western Health Board, of which I am chairman at present, had the lowest number of complaints of any of the health boards.  Of a total of 26 there were four complaints outstanding, ten were resolved, five cases where assistance was provided, one discontinued, two withdrawn and three not upheld.  I believe that is a good record for our health board.  For all the health boards the total on hand was, 394; resolved, 75; assistance provided, 101; discontinued, 48; withdrawn, 6; not upheld, 73.  I am very proud of the health boards when you see those kind of figures because we all know they are dealing with a very sensitive area.  They are dealing with the health of the people and the services for the handicapped.  I would like to put on record my congratulations to them on the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Other speakers deviated from the report and so will I.  I welcome the ombudsman for the insurance companies. It may remedy a problem and I have been making a case for this for some time.  Insurance companies started a system where up to £10,000 would not be contested in court; it was cheaper to pay. Even though insured people said they were not in the wrong they were not listened to.  This ended up in many false claims.  Now they are starting to carry out checks.  I read in a newspaper recently where it was alleged that someone took £230,000 out in those type of claims by faking accidents, putting five people into a car, driving up behind them in an insured car and the five people claiming.</P>
    <P>There was an article on the case in the <i>Evening Press</i> a couple of days ago.  I hope the ombudsman will listen to the insured because it was the insured who were paying that bill; the insurance company only issued the cheque.  You and I and every citizen who paid car insurance was paying that bill.  It was our money. As I said, I hope the insurance ombudsman will look into this.</P>
    <P>We had debates here on how the cost of motor insurance could be reduced. When there is an accident and an injured person gets into an ambulance or goes into hospital he or she should be blood tested; in fact, everybody involved in a road accident should be blood tested and if they are over the alcohol limit that should be made known.  I know of a case in my own county where a man acted as good Samaritan and parked his car at the scene of an accident.  Someone banged into him and took an action against him.</P>
    <P>The anomalies in the insurance business are colossal and the insurance companies themselves are responsible.  I sincerely hope the insurance ombudsman will listen to the insured as well as to the injured party.  The injured party seems to get all the attention but the real injured party is the one who is paying the bill.  It is the same with crime.  All the sympathy is for the criminal but no word about the victims.  They are forgotten.  We must have psychological services, community services, psychiatric services, etc.  It is <Col N="86" /> said of the perpetrator &mdash; poor fellow, is not right or he would not do it but there's no word about the person who was abused, whose house was robbed or place broken into.  I have had experience of this.  I know what it is like to see your windows smashed and your lockup shop raided and damaged.  The last time I was raided I did not bother reporting it because it was a waste of time; hundreds more people are not reporting crimes. All you do is try to provide more security to keep your premises safe.  There is far too much emphasis on the injured and not enough on the other party.  I hope some movement will be made in that direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I am pleased to see it before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the report and I am also impressed that there is a levelling off of complaints.  In addition to the office of the Ombudsman, it is extremely necessary to provide, in the short term, an advice centre in each major town.  For example, in the towns of Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; this could be repeated throughout the country &mdash; there should be a drop-in centre in the form of a caravan in the market square where people could meet a civil servant face to face and discuss their social welfare entitlements, etc.  That would take a lot of the stress and strain off local and national politicians and it would be in the interests of the people.</P>
      <P>We have too many bureaucratic agencies, too many layers of red tape.  I am thinking specifically about people who are seeking to set up new employment and that kind of thing.  They have to deal with far too many agencies, starting with the IDA.  People have to fill in too many forms.  This is clear if you analyse the report and it is causing a problem.  For the recent ESF third level grants the forms which had to be filled in providing simple information which could be double checked by the local county councils and vocational education committees were horrendous.  It was almost impossible for any lay person to fill in those application forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> The forms were atrocious.  I came across a couple of such cases, they could only be filled in with the assistance of an accountant and a solicitor.  That is most unreasonable.  I ask the Minister to take this matter back to Government and ensure that we will never again have such application forms.  The same applied to forms for headage payment applications and subsidies some years back.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an ombudsman for the insurance industry is welcome. That move is not without significance.  It is also to be welcomed that a woman has taken up that position.  There are many anomalies and great difficulties in the insurance area.  For example, there is the cost of car insurance for young people.  I refuse to be convinced of the arguments from the industry and others about the need for such a level of car insurance.  All these problems must be teased out.  There is also the question of liability and the cost of public liability insurance for residents' associations, etc. which must be examined.</P>
    <P>There is a need to widen the role of the Ombudsman.  I would not object to the Ombudsman being involved with the media.  I am not convinced that on all occasions our national media are whiter than white.  There has been a tendency in recent years to slip into the tabloid press type of attitude that exists in England. God keep this country from the level of journalism and of comment we read in those papers.  If only to preserve existing high standards in the media and to ensure no slippage, we should extend the role of the Ombudsman into the media.</P>
    <P>It is important that justice is done and is seen to be done and in this area the Office of the Ombudsman has a particular significance.  That is important.</P>
    <P>My views on this report would be that we should get rid of layers of agencies and duplication for applications, etc.  Application forms which require simple information should be simply worded, simply laid out and capable of being filled in with ease.  The role of the Ombudsman <Col N="88" /> should be extended.  It would be helpful if the Office of the Ombudsman were complemented by accessible centres of advice, where people could drop in, have a cup of coffee and discuss their difficulty with a civil servant.</P>

      <P>Coastal erosion is a major problem in the Connemara area.  Serious damage has already occurred to roads and piers and there is a serious problem of coastal erosion adjacent to many burial grounds. As the Minister is aware, the land of Connemara is poor and for that reason it is difficult to get suitable burial grounds and many traditional burial grounds are located near the sea.  It is a cause of great local distress that coastal erosion may cause graves of relatives to be exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to make <Col N="89" /> money available to rectify the damage already done and to commission a survey to establish what cost effective measures might be taken to ensure that areas of potential damage will be protected against future coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion impinges generally but particularly on farmland.  There are places where cost effective steps could be taken in the form of preventative maintenance. There are other places where I accept no cost effective steps could be taken to stop coastal erosion such as some areas exposed to the Atlantic where no measure could roll back the tide.  In these areas a survey should be carried out on the present situation and where it would not be cost effective to stop possible erosion some scheme of compensation should be put in place to compensate farmers for loss of farmlands.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis go mbeadh an cineál talún a bhfuilim ag tagairt dó, thar a bheith beag i gcomhthéacs talún iomlán na tíre. Tá mé ag caint ar acra anseo agus dhá acra ansiúd.

Tá sé tábhachtach mar sin go mbeadh íocaíocht le fáil ag feirmeoirí an chósta má chailleann siad a gcuid talún.

      <P>Ina dhiaidh sin is é soláthar airgid an fhadhb is mó.  Titeann an príomhchúram sa ghnó seo ar an rialtas áitiúil agus d'iarramar ar na húdaráis sna contaetha thart faoin gcósta tuairisc a ullmhú maidir le creimeadh cósta.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection rests, with local coastal authorities, some of which have undertaken protection work themselves.  Owners of private property have, of course, a role in protecting their own interests.  My Department's role is to faciliate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.</P>
      <P>Parts of our coastline, including areas in County Galway, are subject to coastal erosion.  As Senators will appreciate, the reshaping of parts of the coast is an ongoing natural phenomenon.  Material is eroded from some locations and deposited in others, particularly during storms.  The removal of beach material is also a contributory factor to coastal erosion.  In this regard the Oireachtas has recently passed the Foreshore (Amendment) Act, 1992 which will protect and safeguard our valuable beaches and sand dunes.  It is every citizen's responsibility as well as privilege to cherish and preserve the unique and beautiful heritage of sands, sand dunes and cliff systems around our coast.  My Department have the responsibility to protect the public interest by controlling what material may be taken from the seashore and the means, times and conditions for taking or disturbing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selfish or greedy exploitation of the seashore can destroy a priceless resource and it may be difficult or even impossible to reverse the damage.  The Foreshore <Col N="91" /> Act, 1992, was put in place with its tough penalties in order to protect our valuable beaches and sand dunes from people who vandalise them for commercial purposes.</P>
    <P>We accept that coastal erosion is something over which we do not have total control; however, I would suggest that we have some control over it.  This Act will ensure that steps are taken by the Department of the Marine to give power to ban sand or stone removal from any beach or classes of beach; to ban any specified method of sand removal; to control the quantities or times of any removals or disturbance; to ban any activity or vehicle which disturbs the seashore; and local authorities can take action themselves.</P>
    <P>When valuable property or vital services are threatened, there is a strong case for making available the necessary resources for protection works.  It is important to realise that worthwhile schemes, designed to give long term relief, are generally expensive &mdash; £2 million for Arklow, an estimated £4 million for Bray and £6 million for Rosslare Strand.  Furthermore, appropriate solutions require study, often over a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>My Department have limited funds at their disposal for coast protection schemes.  These funds are committed to ongoing projects at Rosslare Strand, the Maharees, County Kerry, and the maintenance of existing coast protection schemes at Rosslare Strand and Rossnowlagh, County Donegal which my Department are statutorily required to maintain under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  It will not be possible to provide funding for coast protection works in County Galway this year.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department requested each local coastal authority to submit priorities for coast protection schemes with a view to drawing up a national programme of coast protection works for the coming years.  The House will appreciate that before definite decisions can be taken it is necessary that we receive from the maritime counties with an erosion problem the necessary basic information.  Despite the strong case the Senator has made, his own county of <Col N="92" /> which he is a member of the local authority, has not yet submitted proposals for coastal protection works.</P>
    <P>The National Coastal Erosion Committee, comprising local authority engineers have recently produced their report on &ldquo;Coastal Management &mdash; A Case for Action&rdquo; and I have received a copy.  This will be given careful consideration in my Department and I will be considering it and relevant other solutions in conjunction with the maritime local authorities.</P>
    <P>We are well aware &mdash; I come from a maritime county &mdash; of the problems being experienced by counties along the coast and would be anxious to formulate some policy in relation to erosion.  I ask the local authorities at the earliest possible date to submit their proposals in order that we may continue with our efforts.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Mount Usher (County Wicklow) Gardens.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I bring this motion on the Adjournment before the House because Mount Usher Gardens, Ashford, County Wicklow, are in danger of closure.  I do not think that could have escaped anybody's notice in the last month.  During the summer months the press publicised the danger to Mount Usher, one of the prime tourist attractions of County Wicklow and of Ireland.  It is a great irony that the foremost garden in the garden county is now threatened by practices which are hostile to the environment.  It will be a bad day for Ashford, Wicklow, and for Ireland if Mount Usher has to close.</P>
      <P>During the summer months I was asked by Mrs. Jay, the owner of Mount Usher Gardens, to visit the gardens to see for myself what was happening.  I did this in early June before the controversy broke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two features threatening Mount Usher of which the Minister will be well aware.  One is the threat to the Vartry river and the second is the threat from an adjacent sewage treatment plant. It is incredible that any county council could have placed a sewage treatment plant beside one of the prime tourist attractions in its county, yet this is what happened.  Wicklow County Council <Col N="93" /> placed a sewage treatment plant to deal with Ashford sewage beside Mount Usher many years ago.  That sewage plant is now overloaded and foul odours are emanating from it having a dreadful effect on visitors to Mount Usher.  Many visitors have complained.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that no owner would have gone public on an issue like this unless she or he was absolutely desperate.  To some extent going public is self-defeating because it is telling the world about the dangers, the difficulties or the lack of attractions of this spot in Ashford, County Wicklow, but so desperate was the owner of Mount Usher and the residents of Ashford that they decided to go public to induce the Minister and the Government to do something about this problem before it was too late.</P>
    <P>The problem is acute.  There is a plan before the Minister to pump the sewage from Ashford and Rathnew into the new plant in Wicklow town, which has just begun operation, but that plan at the earliest estimate will not come into existence until 1997.  We are now five years away from that and Mount Usher will have to put up with five more years of foul odours, of tourists being put off and of acquiring a bad reputation.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that Mount Usher and Wicklow cannot wait until 1997 for action to be taken.  If these foul smells continue, nobody will be going to Mount Usher by 1997.  People will either by-pass it because it has a bad reputation or it will be sold by the present owners either for development or to someone who wants to close the gardens completely. One way or the other it will be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I do not exaggerate.  Bord Fáilte have written to Mount Usher this summer telling them that they no longer comply with the standards Bord Fáilte expect from a garden with such an international reputation. They do not think they can advertise it any longer because of the foul smells which confront tourists when they go there.  The Historic Gardens and Houses Association also wrote to Mount Usher during the summer saying they will also have to reconsider the membership of Mount Usher Gardens for its association <Col N="94" /> because it is in danger of non-compliance with those standards.</P>
    <P>This is a tragedy for Ireland.  It is a tragedy for tourism and employment in the area.  Everybody maintains that it is somebody else's responsibility.  Wicklow County Council maintain that it has a great deal to do with Dublin and there is nothing they can do because the plan is with the Minister.  The Minister is not responding to letters from the Mount Usher owners.</P>
    <P>The other element of this tragedy is the appallingly low present level of the Vartry river which flows through Mount Usher.  That low level is now threatening the ecology of the area and particularly the plant life.  An extraordinarily comprehensive study by Mr. Adrian Hamilton of the Vartry River in County Wicklow, called &ldquo;The &lsquo;Death of a River&rdquo;&rsquo; was issued in 1991.  In summer months that river is down to a trickle and urgently needs more water.  It was declared a salmon river by the EC, and by the Government as far back as 1982.  The fish life which used to flourish in that river is no longer as healthy as it once was.  If the Vartry River, which is the life blood of Mount Usher and other parts of Ashford, County Wicklow, and of Hunters' Hotel and other prime tourist spots, is allowed to die, not only will the village of Ashford but one of the great tourist spots of Ireland will be allowed to die.  We have a combination of a river being allowed to run dry and a sewage plant being allowed &mdash; and the emphasis must be on &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; because it is neglect and lack of action which is killing this prized heritage. The Minister must provide the funds not just to facilitate the end of these foul smells but to make sure that it happens long before 1997.  Otherwise Irish tourism, Wicklow tourism and Ashford tourism will suffer an appalling loss and Mount Usher will have to be closed.</P>

      <P>I am pleased at an opportunity to respond to the question raised by Senator Ross, that is, improving sewerage facilities for Ashford and Rathnew.  The elimination of pollution and the provision of modern sewage treatment and disposal arrangements is a <Col N="95" /> priority objective of this Government. Significant progress continues to be made in providing new and improved treatment plants at various locations throughout the country, including Tuam, Athlone, Clonmel and Baltinglass which has recently been completed.  The economic and social benefits of these schemes will greatly enhance the development potential of these and other areas in years to come.</P>
      <P>The environmental action programme published in 1990 outlines the Government's objectives and strategy in relation to the provision of water supplies and the disposal of sewage to inland and coastal waterways.  Since the publication of this programme over £210 million has been invested by this Government in a water and sanitary services programme.  This high level of investment clearly demonstrates the high priority given to this programme by the Government.  Local authorities, including Wicklow County Council, have made great progress in the planning and design of new schemes. These will be integrated in the water and sanitary services programme in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The urban waste water directive which was anticipated in the environment action programme will require local authorities to put in place appropriate sewage treatment, sludge management and disposal arrangements for major coastal towns.  I am glad to note that the Wicklow authorities have commenced the planning of schemes to service Arklow, Bray, Greystones, Newtownmountkennedy and Wicklow town that will meet the requirements of this directive.</P>
      <P>The existing sewerage system serving Ashford was provided in the mid-seventies and is located downstream from Mount Usher Gardens.  This treatment plant is in good condition and well managed but is operating to its full capacity and beyond that at peak tourist times. The discharge from this works is also situated downstream of Mount Usher Gardens and as such does not influence the river water quality in these gardens. Any pollution encountered in the Vartry River at the gardens is unlikely to have come from the treatment works.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I understand that there have been reports of odour problems associated with these works, especially during the dry summer season.  This would obviously have adverse implications for the tourist status of the gardens.  The reduced flows in the river during the summer months have not helped the situation but despite these adverse circumstances river water quality throughout the Vartry River is very good. This has been attested to by periodic reports of the environment research unit. Given that the existing works at Ashford and Rathnew are operating at full capacity, Wicklow County Council have prepared a preliminary report which examines the options for investment. This report is currently under consideration in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the case made by Senator Ross.  I have taken note of the points made by him in relation to Bord Fáilte, the Historic House and Gardens Association, and his reference to fish life; all the points raised by him will be brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the proposal to which I have referred, which is with the Department will be given serious consideration by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and would like to ask him, in view of the urgency he acknowledges, if he would recommend to the Minister for the Environment that he meet representatives from Mount Usher so that they could impress upon him the seriousness of the problem, not just for Ashford and Wicklow but for Ireland as well.</P>

      <P>I do not want to sound facetious but the case made by Senator Ross has been so impressive that I doubt if any deputation meeting the Minister could make it more impressively. However, I will advise the Minister of the Senator's request and I will also relate to him the impressive case made by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 14 October 1992.</P>
