      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to intervene in the current dispute at RTE.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to accede to the expressed wishes of Seanad Éireann and Dublin Corporation by making a substantial cash grant from lottery funding for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the present overcrowding in prisons which is exacerbated by the number of persons imprisoned for minor motoring offences.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make extra funding available <Col N="150" /> through the Eastern Health Board for Wicklow community services.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The attempt by the Minister for Energy to end the practice whereby ESB customers can pay for appliances through their ESB bills.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make provision for the northern access road from the new motorway bypass to the town of Kilcullen to Kildare.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Toole, Norris, McGowan, Ross, Ryan and Dardis as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator O'Toole's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Norris, McGowan, Ross, Ryan and Dardis may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I give the Order of Business I would like to express condolence from this side of the House to Senator Howard on the death of his wife, to Senator Hussey on the death of his brother and to Senator McCarthy on the death of his father.</P>
      <P>It is intended today to take Items Nos. 1 and 2, the latter being Second Stage of the Patents Bill, depending on the agreement of the House as to what way that might be dealt with, and to take Item No. 3, the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, Second Stage (Resumed) which stage we hope to conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not aware that Item No. 1 was being taken today.  Perhaps the Acting Leader could explain to us the way in which the Limerick Markets Bill will be taken.  Secondly, may I ask the Acting <Col N="151" /> Leader to ensure that, in relation to the programme of reforms which was agreed to by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges over the Christmas recess and which I think had the agreement of all groups in the House, that there will be no delay in having the reforms implemented.  That would greatly assist in improving the way in which the House does its business.  I know he is totally committed to them, but I would like him to give a timescale for that.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, will the Acting Leader remind his constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, of the commitment he made in this House some time ago that the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights against the Irish Government would be reflected in legislation in the very near future.  I would like to remind him of that solemn commitment which was made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity to wish you, Sir, every success in your new role and to assure you of my personal support and co-operation during you term of office.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Acting Leader of the House if he has decided on a date to take Item No. 8, that is the discussion of the report of the new Industrial Policy Review Group.  I live in Abbeyleix, where it was announced this week that Manchester Tools, half of the industrial facility in the town, was closing.  It came as a very severe blow and I would like an early opportunity to discuss this, because last year the Government closed two post primary schools.  It leaves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senator McDonald will not mind me intervening, but if at all possible we should try to raise matters which are relevant to the Order of Business and not have subsequent follow-on speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but perhaps the Acting Leader might indicate when we can have an early discussion on this matter.  It is very important especially since one of the major problems in the <Col N="152" /> country is unemployment and we seem to be losing more jobs than we are gaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Manning said about urging the Acting Leader to come to the House with some specific information about the Government's response, which is long delayed, to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  In fact, I signalled to the Whips that I would be proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that we take Item No. 40 on the Supplementary Order Paper, which is the item in my name and that of Senator Ross dealing with this matter.  I am happy formally to propose that amendment to the Order of Business, but because I understand there are other attractions &mdash; not in this Chamber &mdash; in the nature of a farewell party, I will not push it to a vote on this occasion.  However, I will continue the pressure which I think is appropriate until we get some further information on that matter.</P>
      <P>I would like also to ask for a debate on Northern Ireland.  For the past eight months I and many other people have been asking for such a debate.  There is a motion in my name and that of Senator Murphy supporting the Government in taking whatever measures are necessary to prevent the Provisional IRA provoking a sectarian civil war in the North of Ireland and I am sure that many people would like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senator to refrain from making a speech.  I would prefer if he would put a question specifically to the Acting Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine.  I will just leave the question there, because I think people would like the opportunity to comment on remarks, of, for example, Mr. Gillis, and Minister O'Kennedy recently which are very topical indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the fact that you have selected as the matter on the adjournment my colleague's motion on the RTE dispute because I think that perhaps renders redundant Motion 46 in the names of the Independent Senators <Col N="153" /> calling on the Government to intervene to encourage a speedy resolution of the RTE dispute.  I am happy that matter will be taken on the Adjournment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the expression of condolence to the Senators who have been bereaved, Senator McCarthy, Senator Hussey and Senator Howard.</P>
      <P>I would also like to express my concern about the serious industrial relations difficulties which are ongoing in RTE.  It is necessary that every effort should now be made to try to reach a solution.  It is a pity that politicians of many parties have found it necessary to protest at the fact that they were covered on RTE last night, apparently against their will.  Certainly in the case of my colleague, Senator Costello, he has found it necessary to write to the Director General of RTE protesting at the way in which he was treated last evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the Acting Leader of the House in the expression of sympathy to the three bereaved Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader of the House if he could make arrangements for an urgent debate about one of the most pertinent issues affecting this country at the present time, that is, the broadcasting strike in RTE.  It is symptomatic of the problems this country is having in recent months that at the end of the day there is not a national television service to even tell us about these contemporary events.  That is quite outrageous and the matter should be resolved.  May I point out to the Acting Leader that Motion No. 46 on the Order Paper, in the names of Senators Norris, Murphy, O'Toole and Hederman, requests the Government to intervene immediately to encourage a speedy resolution of the RTE dispute and I ask the Acting Leader to arrange a <Col N="154" /> debate on this very pertinent, important issue.  It seems to some of us that the Government are not politically concerned about resolving the dispute in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing the Cathaoirleach's commitment to Seanad reform I would again like to raise with the Acting Leader the possibility of the extension of Seanad voting rights to the University of Limerick, Dublin City University and the other appropriate third level institutions and to ask if any advances have been made in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second my colleague's proposed amendment to the Order of Business and say that, regretfully, on a quick look through the Government's list of Bills expected to be published this session.  I can find no reference to the promised legislation reforming the law in response to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, which suggests that it is not going to be published this side of Easter.  This suggests a lack of reforming zeal.  Therefore, there is a considerable case to be made for Senator Norris's amendment.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Independent group I would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy.  There is something particularly touching about three Members of this House being bereaved within a short period of time and our group would like to be associated with the expresssion of sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my satisfaction that the RTE matter is going to be dealt with on the Adjournment.  It is an outrageous irresponsibility on the part of the national broadcasting service not to enter into negotiations at this point.  I was always a very staunch supporter of national broadcasting. I never saw the need for an independent service but I must say that the developments of the last week have made <Col N="155" /> me change my mind.  The Members of the Oireachtas who were, so the story goes, lured into going into RTE last night were extremely naive not to know what they were doing and their actions have not helped the dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification in regard to Item No. 1 &mdash; Senator Manning referred to this matter &mdash; if agreed to, the item deals with the order for laying the report before the House and for printing.  The next stage is the Fourth Stage in the Seanad, which cannot be taken until at least ten clear days have elapsed from the day the report has been ordered to be laid before the House.  That would be approximately 10 February 1992.  As Senators know, it is Private Business which comes on the Order Paper before public business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I respond to Senator Manning.  The Cathaoirleach has outlined Item 1, I hope, to the Senator's satisfaction.  As regards the reforms, whatever role I may have to play in the Seanad in the coming months or years I reiterate my total commitment to reforms and I am quite sure the new Cathaoirleach will be of the same mind. I hope with all our efforts that we will be before this House in the not too distant future with some reforms that I believe will be to the benefit of the House and its operation.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Norris and Ryan mentioned the European Court ruling. While there may not be a Bill in the legislative programme coming before us in the next session, I am aware that a White Paper will be announced in the near future and I am confident the issue will be addressed in that White Paper.  I would ask the Senators to bear with me on that and perhaps next week I will have more definitive information.  I know this item has been the subject of an amendment to the Order of Business on several occasions, but I would ask the Senator to hold the matter in abeyance for one week and not to pursue the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the <Col N="156" /> question of industrial policy.  Subject to agreement by the Whips, we will definitely have a debate on that most important document dealing with industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the various issues raised by Senator Norris and one in particular.  May I just say that the former Leader, now Cathaoirleach, suggested to the House over the past few weeks that some progress was being made on the possibility of a debate on Northern Ireland?  All I would like to say is that I hope that can be brought to a successful conclusion in the coming weeks.  I would like to think that this House would not be debarred from having a debate on any issue.  That is my own personal view and I hope that, given time, that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I think the fact that the broadcasting strike is on the Adjournment today deals with that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The law governing the grant of patents is almost 30 years old. The last revision resulted in the Patents Act of 1964, which is now out of date in many respects.  The provisions of that Act are not particularly conducive to expeditious examinations of patent applications. Accordingly, a principal objective of the present Bill, which will replace the 1964 Patents Act, is to establish examinations procedures for patent applications which are less officially time-consuming. The opportunity is also being taken to modernise the law in many respects and to bring it into line with that of other European countries, particularly our EC partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another main objective of the Bill is to enable the State to ratify the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  I should like to give the House some information on these two international agreements.  The most significant of the two is the European Patent Convention, which was signed by Ireland and 14 other European countries in Munich in September, 1973 and which has been ratified by all EC countries except Ireland.  It has also been ratified by Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein.  Many representations have been made in recent years by certain industrial sectors, by the Confederation <Col N="158" /> of Irish Industry and by Members of the Oireachtas pressing for ratification by Ireland of that convention.  After ratification it will be possible to designate Ireland as a country in which patent protection for an invention is sought in addition to any or all of the other states which have ratified the convention, and for that purpose the applicant only requires to make one application to the European Patent Office (EPO) in Munich, whereas prior to the convention individual applications had to be filed with the national patent office of each state in which patent protection was required.</P>
    <P>The European patent when granted by the EPO will have the same status in each of the designated states as if it were a national patent granted by the respective national patent offices, the effects will be the same in each state, and revocation of the patent by the national authorities will be possible only on the grounds specified in the convention.</P>
    <P>Finally, the duration of the European patent &mdash; a 20 year term &mdash; will be the same in each state.  Accordingly, the convention holds many attractions for innovators seeking patent protection.  I am particularly pleased to be including in the present Bill provisions for ratification by Ireland of that convention, thus fulfilling the commitment to ratify signalled by Ireland's signature of the convention in 1973.  In any event, ratification is regarded by research-oriented industry as an important national incentive in the encouragement of industrial investment and innovation.  Most of our Community partners ratified more than 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Patent Co-operation Treaty earlier.  This treaty was concluded and signed in Washington in June 1970. It has been ratified by the Community member states &mdash; with the exception, again, of ourselves.  It has also been ratified by the EFTA countries, the USA, Canada, Australia, and various other countries around the world.  The idea behind the treaty is to streamline patent application filing and novelty search procedures for applicants wishing to obtain patent protection in a wider number of <Col N="159" /> countries around the world.  Applicants may make one central application &mdash; generally to their local patent office &mdash; designating the countries in which patent protection is required and the novelty search is carried out by an International Search Authority whose report of the search is then furnished to the patent office of each country in which protection is sought.  Final examination and grant is performed by the various national offices.  This system economises considerably on the amount of work an applicant would otherwise have to do in order to satisfy the multiplicity of individual national requirements.</P>
    <P>A further objective of the Bill is the creation of a special system of patent protection for smaller type inventions. This is the short term patent with which Part III of the Bill deals.  I will return to this subject later.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being prepared I took the opportunity to review the procedures for examination and grant of patents under the present law.  The present long drawn out procedures were a cause of concern to me in view of the large and growing backlog of applications awaiting examination.  There was no prospect of eliminating this backlog without changing examination procedures.  I took steps, therefore, to include in the Bill new provisions which will speed up examination considerably.  Because of the existing large backlog I have taken the opportunity in the Transitional Provisions of making the new examination procedures applicable also to all applications on hand when the Bill becomes law otherwise the existing backlog, if processed under the present law, would take years to eliminate.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Seanad I will now outline the principal features of the Bill and I will elaborate on certain of the objectives to which I earlier referred. Part I contains a listing of definitions and terms used in the Bill.  It clarifies certain matters relating to orders or rules made under the Bill and provides for repeal of the present law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Part II, Chapter I, confirms the continuation in being of the Patents Office and the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks while Chapter II lays down the criteria an invention must satisfy to be patentable, namely novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability, and defines these criteria.  It provides that patents cannot be obtained for certain subject matters such as scientific theories, computer programmes, methods of medical or veterinary treatment, inventions whose exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality and plant or animal varieties.  These provisions about what is patentable are quite different from and more specific than our present law which basically provides for the grant of a patent for any new or useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter. The provisions proposed bring our law into line with that of other European countries and are based on the corresponding provisions of the European Patent Convention.  I should explain that the convention has acted as a harmonisation instrument generally in that those European countries which have ratified it have also tended to adopt the legal concepts of the convention in their own domestic law.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of Part II deals with the making of applications for patents.  These provisions are broadly similar to the present law with a few exceptions.  The possibility to file what is called a provisional specification, with an application followed later by a complete specification, is being abandoned.  Under the Bill a specification describing the invention and which includes claims defining the matter sought to be protected will be required with an application.  It will be possible, nevertheless, to have a filing date accorded to an application which is not formally in order provided the minimum requirements of section 23 are complied with and provided that any formal deficiency is corrected later.  It will be possible furthermore for an applicant to file an application and claim the priority of an earlier application he has filed in the office for the same invention, whereas <Col N="161" /> at present only the priority of an earlier filing abroad could be claimed.  These changes are more in line with modern practice elsewhere and are generally in the interest of applicants.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part II deals with the procedures for search and examination of applications.  As may be expected from my earlier remarks, the provisions here are different in a number of respects from the present law.  For an applicant who obtains a patent for the same invention in, say, the European Patent Office, or in Germany or the UK, it will still be possible to submit the specification of that patent as evidence of novelty and inventive step in respect of the Irish application. Where no corresponding outside patent application has been made, a search report on the invention will have to be established after the filing of the Irish application.  The search report will be established under the authority of the controller by arrangement with an outside office which is capable of doing an adequate novelty search.  When the foreign granted patent or search report as the case may be become available, they will be laid open to public inspection by the Controller in conjunction with the application and the applicant will be requested to submit any amendments to the specification of his application in the light of these documents.  Any amendments will also be open to public inspection. The office will check whether the subject matter of the application is patentable or not.</P>
    <P>These procedures replace the elaborate examination burdens imposed under the present law and which have led to the enormous backlog in examination of applications to which I referred earlier. Up to now the whole onus to identify amendments has lain with the Patents Office and the procedures which have to be observed are time consuming.  I am satisfied that the new procedures, which are not unlike those in operation in some European countries, will work well in practice and make for a much more efficient and streamlined system of examination.</P>
    <P>I should point out also that the public <Col N="162" /> will have the possibility to inspect applications at all stages.  There are provisions, in the public interest, enabling applications to be made to the Controller or the court for revocation of a patent on any of a range of grounds specified in section 58; the grounds include non-patentability of the invention and non-entitlement of the proprietor to a patent therefor.  Thus, the system provides for a reasonable balance between the interests of the patent holders in protecting inventions and the rights of the public to have full inspection of all documents comprising an application so that revocation of a patent can be requested where this appears justified.</P>
    <P>The term of a patent, under the Bill, will be 20 years; it is currently 16 years. The 20-year term is, again, the norm applying in Europe and is also the term of a European patent under the convention. The research and development costs involved in developing and perfecting an invention can be substantial.  In the case of certain inventions such as new pharmaceuticals, official authorisation is required before the new substances can be put on the market.  These authorisations can take a long number of years to materialise, resulting in a significant erosion of the term of the patent. For these reasons also the longer patent term is justified.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Chapter VII of Part II dealing with infringement of a patent follow generally the lines of the present law.  However, the Bill also provides, in accordance with the principles of the European Patent Convention, that proceedings may be instituted after grant for acts of infringement committed before the patent was granted.  This is necessary to deter third parties from committing infringements in the interval between the date of publication of a patent application and the grant of the patent.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill makes provision for the grant of short term patents.  The provisions here are completely new to Irish law and were devised because of my concern for the smaller inventor who may find the task of obtaining a normal patent too costly and time consuming and, <Col N="163" /> therefore, a disincentive to protecting his invention.  I have set out on the basis of making the task of protecting the invention as easy as possible so that the inventor can concentrate his energies on perfecting the invention and, most importantly, on its marketing.  I have framed provisions, therefore, which will ensure that short term patents will be capable of being obtained without undue official obstacles and I intend to provide for lower official fees for these.  I hope that what I have provided will prove encouraging to the smaller individual inventor and small companies and an incentive to commercialise useful inventions.</P>
    <P>The period of protection of a short term patent will be ten years.  This will particularly suit the less technologically complicated inventions which by their nature may not have very long life cycles but which nevertheless have an important place in the whole process of industrial innovation and in the encouragement of new project start-ups.  I should make clear that short term patents will not be confined to small inventions and, indeed, it will be possible for an applicant who has applied for a short term patent to make a simultaneous application for a full patent and later abandon whichever application he does not wish to pursue.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Bill, Part XII, contains those provisions which are necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  In the case of the European Patent Convention, what is basically required is that applications for European patents designating the State be treated as having the same legal status as national applications made to the Irish Patents Office; and that European patents designating the State, granted by the European Patent Office, be treated as if they were patents granted under our own national law.  Part XII of the Bill fulfils these requirements making also a number of consequential and other miscellaneous provisions.  An important provision is that if the language of the specification of the granted European <Col N="164" /> patent is not English, French and German being the two other working languages of the European Patent Office, a translation in English of that specification must be filed with the Irish Patents Office and published here in order for that patent to have effect in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards the Patent Co-operation Treaty, in order to enable Ireland to ratify this treaty, the Bill provides that Ireland may be designated in international patent applications filed under the treaty. The Bill also specifies in section 127 that, as permitted by the treaty, an international application designating the State shall be deemed to be an application for a European patent designating the State. Availing of this possibility has certain desirable advantages.  It means functions concerning international applications which would otherwise have to be performed by the Irish Patents Office will, instead, be performed by the European Patent Office and the result at the end of the day will be the grant of a European patent designating Ireland having the same effects which I previously mentioned in relation to European patents.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to mention another patent convention, namely the Community Patent Convention, which was signed by Ireland and the other Community Member States in 1975.  It will not be possible to ratify that convention on the basis of the present Bill because an amendment of the Constitution is required before ratification of this convention can take place.  This matter is being kept under review in the context of other possible amendments of the Constitution which are likely to arise in the period ahead in relation to matters dealt with at the Maastricht Council.</P>
    <P>I commend the principle of this Bill for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum to the Patents Act, 1964, it is stated that the law relating to patents for inventions is intended to encourage invention by giving to inventors exclusive rights of exploitation for a limited term of years while, at the same time, providing adequate safeguards for the general <Col N="165" /> public against unjustified and faulty patents and against abuse of monopoly rights.  Thus, in a nutshell, a patent is in effect a bargain between the State and the inventor whereby he is given a monopoly right in his invention for a period of years in return for the disclosure and his invention.</P>
      <P>Patents relate to workable new ideas. In turn, those ideas which are applicable to industry will relate to products or processes, machinery, mechanisms, electrical and electronic devices, materials and their modification or synthesis, chemical compositions and so on.  Patents, therefore, are about ideas, reduced to specific methods of processes or to the workable product resulting therefrom.</P>
      <P>It is in that overall context that I welcome this Bill.  Its two main objectives are to update and modernise our domestic patent law so that it is in harmony with the laws of other European countries, especially our EC partners and to enable Ireland to ratify two important international patent agreements.  They are the European Patent Convention, the EPC, which was signed by Ireland and 14 other European countries in Munich in 1973 and was ratified by all our EC partners, except Portugal, and has also been ratified by Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein and secondly, the Patent Co-operation Treaty which was concluded in Washington and signed by Ireland in 1970 and which has been ratified by all the Community member states, except Portugal and Ireland, and which has also been ratified by the EFTA countries, the United States of America, Canada, Australia and various other countries around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a country like ours which is much dependent on industry any Bill to reform and streamline patent law and procedure after 28 years is certainly to be welcomed by this House.  However, I cannot help thinking the present Bill has been put before us now mainly because of extreme pressure from our EC partners to do something about it and also because of the implications of the judgment given by Justice Barron in the High Court on 13 March 1987 in the case of the State, <Col N="166" /> Jacob Rajan and others <i>v.</i> the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks.</P>
    <P>The creation and development of new technologies and industries and the encouragement and growth of commerce is essential to the economic well-being of Ireland.  To achieve advances in these areas depend not only on the ingenuity of scientists, engineers and others but also on the investment necessary to develop new ideas and to set up new enterprises as well as the ability to market these enterprises effectively.</P>
    <P>Intellectual property rights, that is patents, registered designs and design right, registered trademarks, service marks and copyright, play an important part in bringing these factors together.  In all cases they give legal protection to the ownership of new ideas or brand names and they give the proprietor the right to stop other people exploiting his property. They create for the inventor a system by which he can benefit from his ingenuity, be it the invention of an electronic timer, the design of a fashion shoe, the marketing of chocolate bars under a new brand name or indeed the creation of a new musical.  Typically, the rights will be sold or licensed to others or will be used to safeguard investment in new ventures so that the ideas they represent may be developed and exploited to the ultimate benefit of us all.</P>
    <P>With over 30 million patents published nationwide and with an extra one million appearing every year, it is clear that patents are an immense source of technical and commercial information and much of that information is unique to patents. However, there is sometimes an unfortunate tendency to associate patented inventions simply with gadgets or gimmicks or with major technological and scientific advances.  Both these views are oversimplifications of the true position and, as a result, worthwhile inventions may go unrecognised.  Virtually all machines, products and processes and individual parts of them across the industrial spectrum are patentable provided, of course as the Minister has indicated, <Col N="167" /> that they satisfy under this legislation three important criteria: they must be new, they must be inventive and they must be capable of industrial application.</P>
    <P>The Patents Office in Dublin receives about 4,700 applications per year while the intake of patents at the Patents Office in London is over 30,000 applications per year.  These figures underline the fact that patents are not confined to major technological advances.  They cover such diverse subjects as agriculture, medicines, games, paints, electronics and photography &mdash; anything from a small detail in an electric switch to a new form of transport like the first hovercraft.</P>
    <P>Lord Halsbury, a noted specialist in this area, tells a very interesting story concerning the history of the hovercraft. Sir Christopher Cockrell had his invention put on a secret list by the British Ministry of Supply until within one week of the collapse of the convention date application.  They then told him that he was a free man and could patent it anywhere he liked without making any provision for him to do so.  Wisely, he went to his old employers, the Marconi company, and they sent him to Lord Halsbury.  He set the machinery moving and they had the patent application put through before the lapse of the convention date. Christopher Cockrell's invention, as we all know, was patented all over the world but had that one day gone by, he would have had to refile in London and a Swiss inventor who had filed in Geneva during the course of that particular convention year would have had priority.  This demonstrates that time is of the essence as are speedy decisions in regard to matters such as patents.</P>
    <P>The patents system has a long history and must be almost as old as the making of products in quantity.  While some isolated incidences may be found earlier, the granting of patents for inventions may be said to have begun in the last part of the 15th century.  In 1474, the Republic of Venice, by an ordinance, recognised the right of an inventor to secure exclusive rights in his inventions and patents were thereafter commonly issued in <Col N="168" /> Venice.  A recipient of one of the Venetian patents was Galileo Galilei who in 1594 received a patent for an invention relating to pumping water.</P>
    <P>Lord Nathan in his famous paper to the Royal Society of Arts in 1976 cited the earliest known patent for invention or something like it as having been given by Henry VI in 1449 for the making of coloured glass for the windows of Eton College.  Patents for inventions were granted in England with some degree of frequency for the first time during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.  Exclusive monopolies were granted by the Queen, not only for new inventions but also for the manufacture or sale of staple commodities.</P>
    <P>D'Ewes journal of the Parliament of 1601 refers, for example, to the unwarranted behaviour of a patentee holding the monopoly in respect of the sale of <i>aqua-vitae</i> and vinegar in the town of Warwick.  The matter first came before the courts in the famous case of monopolies in Darcy <i>v.</i> Allien in 1602.  This case concerned the exclusive right to import, make and sell common playing cards.  The grant was held void as being contrary to both common law and diverse Acts of Parliament.  Eventually in 1624 the statute of monopolies was passed to curb abuses and excesses and to regulate the whole matter.  The statute of 1624 contained the famous section 6 which recognised the validity of the grant of letters patent for new inventions.</P>
    <P>It is well recorded by Charles Dickens in <i>A Poor Man's Tale of a Patent</i> that obtaining a patent in days gone by was a very chancy and expensive business. Since Dickens's day, however, there have been very many developments in the inevitable progress of the patents system. The first comprehensive statute which provided also for the establishment of the Patents Office was passed in 1852 and the first modern statute was passed in 1883. Our present system is based on the Patents Act, 1964, which in turn was largely built on the foundations of the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act, 1927.  That legislation has served this country well but, as the Minister <Col N="169" /> indicated here this morning, it is clear that from the thorough reappraisal of the whole patent system which was carried out in the United Kingdom in the period 1967 to 1970 by a committee under the able and distinguished chairmanship of Sir Maurice Banks, substantial reform is also required in this country to provide a system which is better adapted to the needs of industry and inventors in these modem times.</P>
    <P>The Banks committee examined in detail the United Kingdom's Patents Act, 1949, upon which our 1964 Act is largely based.  They emphasised that in many ways it was necessary to make a fresh start &mdash; and that is what we are endeavouring to do in this legislation &mdash; by replacing outdated concepts, giving effect to new ideas and taking into account the many important international developments that have taken place in the patents field in recent years. There has been a remarkable and healthy upsurge in international patent co-operation over the past 25 years or so.  The pressure for this has come from two main sources.  The first is from the many industries which trade internationally in one way or another and which would obviously derive benefit if national systems could be harmonised so that patents enjoyed much the same rights wherever they were obtained and could obtain those rights without the necessity, as at present, of going from country to country; and, the second is from the national patent offices in the various countries over-burdened as they are with the problems created by the extensive growth of patent activity and the increasing complexity of technology.  The results of this activity can now be seen in four developments.</P>
    <P>There is the Council of Europe or the Strasbourg Convention of 1963 which provides for harmonisation of fundamental concepts of patent law and is the basis on which the rest of the international agreements have been concentrated. Secondly, there is the Patent Co-operation Treaty of 1970 which was worked out at a conference of countries in Washington and which included the <Col N="170" /> United States, Japan, our European partners and many developing countries. That system provides for a potentially worldwide system for sharing the work of processing patent applications.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the Patent Co-operation Treaty is the streamlining of patent application filing and novelty search procedures for applicants wishing to obtain patent protection in a large number of countries around the world. Applicants may make one central application, generally to their local patent office, designating the countries in which patent protection is required.  The novelty search is carried out by an international searching authority and its report of the search is then furnished through the national office of each country in which protection is sought.  The final examination and grant is performed by the various national offices.</P>
    <P>The PCT system provides substantial benefits to patentees and the national patent offices and provides for a further degree of harmonisation of national patent laws.  It should also economise considerably on the amount of work an applicant would otherwise have to do in order to satisfy the multiplicity of individual national requirements.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the European Patent Convention, 1970, which will enable an applicant via the European Patent Office in Munich by means of a single application to obtain a European patent having effect as a national patent in as many of the contracting countries as he desires.  In addition, the revocation of a European patent by the national authorities would be possible only on the grounds specified and the duration of a European patent, a 20-year term, would be the same in each state.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is the Community Patent Convention, 1975, which provides for a single patent to be obtained via the European Patent Office having a unitary and autonomous effect throughout the European Community.</P>
    <P>The CPC was signed by Ireland and other Community member states in 1975 but, as the Minister indicated in his speech, it is not possible for Ireland to <Col N="171" /> ratify this convention without amending the Constitution.  Perhaps the Minister when replying would indicate why this is so because there is another opinion that this legislation could be made applicable in this country without amending the Constitution.  I accept the Minister has indicated that an amendment to the Constitution is the appropriate measure to take but perhaps he would indicate whether he has advice from the Attorney General on this matter.</P>
    <P>All these international arrangements are interlinked and should eventually give industry and inventors from Ireland and elsewhere the opportunity of obtaining substantially uniform protection over much of the world, and more easily than today.  However, these international instruments cannot stand alone.  They must be grafted into our national patent system since this will not cease when these instruments come into force.  It will continue to serve those who are not concerned to use the European system as well as providing the legal framework for patents obtained by one or other of the international avenues.</P>
    <P>In formulating a new code we must be conscious of the need to follow as closely as possible the European Patent Convention. There are two main reasons for this correspondence between the convention and our future law.  First, it is to avoid duality of standards between Irish patents and European or Community patents.  Without this the patent situation would be in a state of chaos and confusion. Secondly, it will be of considerable assistance to practitioners and inventors to be able to adopt substantially the same practice whether (a) they are seeking an Irish national patent from the Patents Office in Dublin or (b) a European or Community patent from the European Patent Office or (c) an American or other international patent via the Patent Co-operation Treaty.</P>
    <P>Patents and patent protection raise a number of practical questions.  (1) What is a patent?  (2) What do patents do?  (3) What do patents not do?  (4) What is patentable?  (5) Who is entitled to a <Col N="172" /> patent?  (6) How is a patent obtained?</P>
    <P>What is a patent?  A patent is a contract between an inventor or applicant and the State, whereby the inventor or applicant gets a monopoly from the State for a certain period of time in return for disclosing the details of the invention.  The patent system thus ensures that information on new inventions is made available for eventual public use to encourage technical and technological development and to discourage secrecy.  Under this legislation an Irish patent will last for a maximum period of 20 years dating from when the application for the patent was filed.  To keep it in force during this period annual renewal fees have to be paid starting from the fourth anniversary of the filing date.</P>
    <P>What do patents do?  A person who makes an invention does not need a patent in order to carry it out.  He already has a right to do this so long as the invention is not already protected by somebody else's patent.  What a patent does is to give the owner or proprietor the right to take legal action to prevent other people exploiting a patented invention without the proprietor's consent.  Suppose, for example, a patent is granted that has effect in Ireland.  It gives the proprietor alone the right to the manufacture, use, importation or sale within Ireland of the invention for which it has been granted.  This right can be used to prevent competition while the proprietor develops a business based on the invention or another person or company may be allowed to exploit the invention and pay royalties under a licensing agreement. Alternatively, the patent may be sold outright by means of an assignment to another person or company.</P>
    <P>The monopoly right given by a patent is not of course, enforced automatically. It is the responsibility of the proprietor and not of the Patents Office to look after his rights by finding out whether some one else is infringing them, that is, making, using, selling or importing the invention of the patent without permission and then deciding whether to <Col N="173" /> take legal action.  Of course, the mere existence of a patent may deter would-be infringers, or enable the proprietor to obtain some financial recompense without the need to take legal action.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to guarantee that a patent, once granted, is valid.  Anyone, for example a person accused of infringement, can apply to the court or to the Patents Office for &ldquo;revocation&rdquo; of a patent, that is cancellation for the reasons laid down in the legislation.  If he succeeds, the patent must either be revoked entirely or be amended to remove the reasons for revocation, if this is possible. In addition, anyone may comment on whether the invention in a published but not yet granted application is patentable by sending observations to the Patents Office.</P>
    <P>What patents do not do.  Possession of a patent gives no other rewards and should not be taken as an indication that an invention has merit or commercial value.  In addition, it should be noted that a patents office does not and cannot give financial or other reward or support for an invention.  It does not take sides in disputes between an applicant or patentee and any other party.</P>
    <P>What is patentable?  Not all inventions qualify for the grant of a patent.  Under this legislation to be patentable an invention must (i) be new; (ii) involve an inventive step; (iii) be capable of industrial application; (iv) not be excluded.  The concept of newness or novelty is defined in section 11 of the Bill.  To be patentable the invention must never have been made public, in any way, anywhere in the world, before the date on which an application for a patent is filed or before the priority date.  Inventive step is defined in section 13 of the Bill.  An invention involves an inventive step if, when compared with what is already known, it would not be obvious to someone with a good knowledge and experience of the subject.</P>
    <P>Industrial application is defined in section 14 of the Bill.  In order to be patentable an invention must be capable of being made or used in some kind of industry.  This means that the invention <Col N="174" /> must take the practical form of an apparatus or device, a product such as some new material or substance, or industrial process or method or operation.  &ldquo;Industry&rdquo; should be understood in the broadest sense as including any useful, practical activity.  It does not necessarily imply the use of a machine or indeed the manufacture of an article.  It includes, of course, agriculture.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 deal with excluded inventions.  No matter how ingenious, unusual or beneficial an idea may be, an invention is not patentable if it is merely a discovery, a scientific theory or a mathematical method &mdash; section 9 (2) (a); an aesthetic creation such as literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work &mdash; section 9 (2) (b); a scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act, playing a game or doing business or a programme for a computer &mdash; section 9 (2) (c); or the presentation of information &mdash; section 9 (2) (d).  However, if the idea necessarily involves more than abstract aspects, so that it has physical features, for example, special apparatus needed to play a new game, then it may indeed be patentable. It is not possible to obtain patent protection for the mere aesthetic outward appearance of an article, for example the shape, configuration, pattern or ornament, which gives it &ldquo;eye appeal&rdquo;, although this may be suitable for design registration.  However, it may be possible to obtain patent protection if the outward appearance has a functional as opposed to a mere aesthetic purpose.  In addition, it is not possible to get a patent for an invention if it is a new animal or plant variety, or if publication or exploitation of it would generally be expected to encourage offensive immoral or antisocial behaviour.</P>
    <P>Who is entitled to a patent?  When an invention is made it belongs to the inventor unless his rights have been given to somebody else, for example by means of an agreement or contract of employment. If the invention resulted from collaboration between two or more people each person may be entitled to a share in the ownership and should be named in any patent application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> How may a patent be obtained?  This legislation, when passed, will enable application for a patent to be made in any one of two ways depending on the requirements of the applicant.  (1) An application to the Patents Office in Dublin for an Irish national patent and the procedures and conditions for obtaining this patent are set out in this Bill.  (2) The applicant can file a Single European patent application under the EPC system.  When granted, such a patent will also be valid in any one or more of the European countries that are listed as &ldquo;EPC contracting states&rdquo;.  The applicant can file an international application under the PCT system.</P>
    <P>In comparing these alternatives the applicant will have in mind that if it is decided that only a patent that will have effect in Ireland is needed then it is much simpler and cheaper to make an Irish national patent application.  If patents in several countries are required it may be cheaper to use the EPC avenue or perhaps the PCT avenue than to make a national patent application in each.</P>
    <P>This Bill updates the patent law of this country.  As the Minister has indicated, it contains many new provisions as to what constitutes patentability in an invention, sections 9 to 14, as to what the term of a patent shall be, section 36, as to what the effects of a patent and a patent application shall be, sections 40 to 45, and as to the grounds upon which a patent may be revoked.  In respect of each of these aspects the Bill follows the corresponding provisions of the European Patent Convention.  The other, European countries which have ratified the EPC have adopted similar provisions in their domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in any analysis of this legislation, it is interesting to compare and contrast the provisions of the Patents Act, 1964, with the provisions of this Bill.  However, there are, in my view, a number of areas which are of special concern.  First, I think we can all agree that any new code of patents should encourage and stimulate investment in <Col N="176" /> all levels of industry and it seems to me that the question of expense in carrying out the provisions of the Bill after the application stage is crucial to success. Indeed, the vital importance of expense has been highlighted by Lord Nathan in his address to the Royal Society of Arts which was published by the society's journal for December 1976.  He stated:</P>
    <P>A patent system can collapse by being too complicated or too expensive, and by failing to adapt to current needs.  A situation can be reached in which it is thought that there is more to lose than there is to gain by applying for patents.  If that situation arises, patents will die out and secrecy, with all its advantages and dangers, will be the only source of protection.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the Minister, and the Minister of State who cannot be with us today, will take to heart that important comment from a person like Lord Nathan, a person well versed in the intricacies of international patent procedure. For that reason, therefore, I would urge the Minister to give consideration to the setting up of a new patents court to be constituted as part of the Chancery Division of our High Court.  This proposal was recommended by the Banks Committee in the United Kingdom and is justified, in my view, by industry's need which was strongly urged in that committee for resolute decision and more certainty in the interpretation of the law.</P>
    <P>Second, there is the lack of comprehensive and specific provision in this Bill, provision which is made, incidentally, in sections 36 to 40 of the UK Patents Act, 1977, which recognises the special rights of employee inventors and also introduces the concept of an award scheme to encourage invention by employees.  An important group of sections in the UK legislation deals with the rights of employee investors.  It contains a major innovation in that it gives employee investors statutory rights which they did not hitherto enjoy in the United Kingdom, and which they do not currently enjoy in this country.  These rights of ownership in employees' inventions <Col N="177" /> are at present regulated in Ireland &mdash; and would be in my view, regulated in the future, unless there is a change in this legislation by the common law concerning master and servant.  The British legislation, therefore, seeks to reconcile the conflicting interests by putting on a statutory basis the law concerning ownership of inventions made by employees and provides a right for an employee to obtain a reward in defined circumstances. It also prevents for the future an employer taking advantage of the weak bargaining position of his employee by requiring him to divest and sign away any rights he may have in the invention that he later makes.</P>
    <P>Third, there is, I believe, an urgent need to augment and strengthen resources and personnel at the Patents Office in Dublin and to ensure that the functions and the role and duties of that fine corps of professional examiners in that office are put on a statutory basis. That is certainly not done in this legislation. The problems facing the Patents Office have been highlighted in many annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General over many years.  In the report for the year ended 31 December 1990 he states:</P>
    <P>In various previous reports I referred to my submission, some years ago, containing proposals about the organisation structure of the Office. No action was taken during the year under review in relation to these proposals. Staff numbers in the Office have fallen progressively since the commencement of the public service embargo (from 96 to 77) so that the number of staff serving is less than what it was in 1971.  In the meantime, work on all fronts has increased considerably in terms of volume and complexity. It is inevitable that while this situation prevails work backlogs will remain and revenue will be foregone.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the year the Government decided that the question of establishing the Office as a State-sponsored body operating on a commercial basis should be examined.  This <Col N="178" /> matter will no doubt receive attention during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, today that this matter has received Government attention and that the Minister, before we conclude the passage of this Bill, would be in a position to indicate to us whether he proposes to bring in any further amendments to put into legislation and, on a statutory basis, that particular recommendation.</P>
    <P>The critical and unsatisfactory situation in the Patents Office itself was highlighted in the case of The State (Jacob Rajan and others) <i>v.</i> the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks in 1987.  In that case, briefly, a dispute arose in the Patents Office between the Controller and the members of his professional staff as to the arrears of work existing in the office.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Patents Act, 1964, it was the duty of the professional staff to examine all applications made to the Patents Office for both patentability and novelty.  In order to decrease the backlog of applications the Controller directed the examiners to allow certain applications through with limited investigation and in certain cases without any investigation whatsoever.  The professional examiners refused to carry out these instructions because they would be, in their view, and later in the view of a court, in breach of their statutory obligations if they did so.  Decisions were subsequently taken by the Controller to refuse to several of the examiners an increment in their salary which would otherwise have been payable to them.</P>
    <P>In the High Court, in a very important decision in this area, Justice Barron held, (1) although by virtue of the relationship between the professional staff and the head of their department the examiners were subject to the direction of the Controller, that did not entitle the Controller to direct the examiners as to how to perform their statutory duties, or to direct them to refrain from performing these statutory duties; (2) the decision made by the Controller to refuse the increment <Col N="179" /> payable to some of the examiners was made by reason of the refusal of the examiners to follow the directives issued by the Controller; (3) since that disciplinary action was based on an invalid directive it must itself also be invalid. Since that case concerned the determination and, in my view, a determination which was not open to compromise with the professional examiners, since the Controller sought over a number of years to limit these excellent professional examiners in the performance of their duties, I must say that I view with some concern the statement in the explanatory memorandum under the heading &ldquo;Authority of the Controller&rdquo;. I quote:</P>
    <P>The Bill takes the opportunity to establish clearly that authority in relation to all matters concerning the grant of patent rests with the Controller. In a High Court judgment delivered some years ago it was held that under the present law, patent examination staff have a certain authority independent of the Controller.  This was not intended when that law was being drafted and the position has given rise in practice to certain managerial problems.</P>
    <P>It seems that what that memorandum is now saying is that in some way when the Controller could not get his way over the past number of years, since his appointment, he is now trying to put some of those examiners into limbo, making it impossible for them to perform their professional work.  They are highly qualified people, with the finest qualifications one could find in any Department.  I urge the Minister to consider that and to consider putting the role, the function and the duties of these people on a statutory base.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I would like to take the opportunity again of welcoming the main provisions of this Bill.  I hope it will strengthen and modernise our patent system, that it will be of much benefit to industry and to investors and indeed to the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the House and compliment him on presenting this Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  Ireland has only once ratified patent laws since the foundation of the State.  That was in 1964 and that legislation still exists.  It is incomprehensible that in 28 years things have not changed or gone forward.  It is about time we brought in legislation which is appropriate to the developments that have taken place over that 30-year period.  It is vitally important that we come into line and conformity with our European partners.  We signed the European Patent Convention in 1973 and yet we have not ratified it.  As far as I know, Portugal is the only other EC member state not to have done so.  Of course, we are not talking about the Community patent law because of the problem which the Minister referred to earlier.</P>
      <P>We are all well aware that industrial sources in Ireland, and in particular the Confederation of Irish Industry, have been pressing for a considerable time to have the new legislation brought before both Houses and passed into law.  When this legislation is passed we will, as a country, be able to participate fully in patent protection.  It will be possible to apply to the European Patent office in Munich for protection which will guarantee protection within Europe.  We all know how long it takes at present to have a patent examined in this country because of the difficulties that exist in the Patents Office to which I will advert briefly at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the European Patent Office which is based in Munich.  I would like to express my regret that it was not sited in Dublin.  We are all aware that the Government tried very hard to get the European Patent Office for Dublin.  It would have meant a lot to us.  It would certainly have created a mobility of people and of industry into this country which unfortunately did not come.  I appeal to the Minister that in future we should fight and try to get our due share of the spoils of Europe.  I do not believe we have succeeded in so doing to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new legislation the duration <Col N="181" /> of the patent will be 20 years and not 16 years as at present.  This is just and fair because of the time and money involved in research and development.  I know research and development refers to most products but the pharmaceutical industry is probably the classic example we are all aware of and hear so much about.  We all realise how expensive is research and development of pharmaceutical products and God knows how many failures the pharmaceutical companies have before they actually get a single success.  There is another problem about R and D in the pharmaceutical industry which adds to the time lag of getting back some money from the success of developing a good drug product, namely, that they are subject to the necessity of having to obtain the authorisation of the National Drugs Advisory Board and sometimes that procedure is not too rapid and that adds to the time lag before the product comes on the market.</P>
    <P>I know we have the other side of the coin to consider in relation to pharmaceuticals. We have the generic companies. However, I believe the time lag which has taken place &mdash; we almost introduced this legislation in 1988 &mdash; has given them sufficient time to adapt themselves and their plans to deal with the future development of their generic named products.  I think if it had been introduced in 1988 out of the blue it would have been a precipitous decision because at that time the Industrial Development Authority had grant-aided a number of generic companies in this country for developing pharmaceutical products which were coming off patent and it would have been a rather conflicting situation were one arm of the State, namely Big Brother Government, to introduce legislation to make projects non-viable that had been grant-aided by another arm of the State. I believe that since there was that delay the generic companies have had sufficient opportunity to gear themselves for this eventuality.</P>
    <P>When multinationals and generic companies are compared, the multinationals will say they are the larger employer, that they research and develop products and <Col N="182" /> that generic companies would not have products to sell without multinational research and development.  That is partly correct.  Generic companies would say that when drugs come off patent they can supply those drugs to the market at 40 to 50 per cent less cost than the multinationals' price when they are on patent. The Bill needs to acknowledge these facts and it does so reasonably well.</P>
    <P>The Minister might bear in mind that few multinational companies do any R and D in this country, a matter not unrelated to this Bill.  One excuse has been our short term patent law.  More pressure should be exerted on companies which make large profits here to do some R and D in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend the Controller of Patents, Seán Fitzpatrick, on the excellent job he has done under very difficult circumstances over a number of years.  He has shown an exceptional degree of dedication to his job despite inadequate office facilities.  He has lacked computerisation and library facilities.  People have to go outside the country to find necessary information on patenting.  He has had staffing problems and has experienced legal difficulties arising from intransigence among examiners in his office.  I totally disagree with Senator Kennedy, as regards who was in the right there.</P>

      <P>I am giving my personal view.  Senator Kennedy expressed his personal view.  I stand by the Controller of Patents.</P>
      <P>This legislation will expedite the examination of all patents and provide special arrangements for smaller type inventions which will be dealt with more expeditiously and at a much cheaper rate. This is important because small inventions are often the novel idea of people with little money whose rights must be respected.  In the past there were disincentives for brilliant people with little money; it was not worth their while to have patents examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> The granting of a patent gives a monopoly for a period to the inventor or conceiver of an idea.  Inventors should be allowed to reap the financial rewards of their ideas and the work put into their development and this is satisfactorily dealt with by this commendable Bill.  I thank the Minister for bringing it before the House and for his co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Harney, to the House.  I do not have much to say on this Bill partly because I have been in communication with groups, such as the Federation of the Irish Chemical Industry, who indicated clearly to me that they want a speedy passage for this Bill.  I raised this matter at the end of 1988 and of 1989 as a result of a letter I received during 1988 from one of the principal pharmaceutical companies in the State, some of which I wish to put on the record because it seems to me that the Bill meets some of their concerns.  The letter was from Smithkline &amp; French (Ireland) Limited and this is the relevant part:</P>
      <P>Ireland signed the European Patent Convention in 1973 but to date this has not been formally ratified.  The Convention provides for 20 year patent protection.  It is a matter of urgent concern to Smithkline Beckman which employs 730 people in Ireland, through its subsidiary companies &mdash; Smithkline and French &mdash; Dublin, Allergan &mdash; Mayo, Beckman Instruments &mdash; Galway and Penn Chemicals &mdash; Cork that legislation be introduced to extend patent protection in Ireland from 16 to 20 years.</P>
      <P>This would bring Ireland into line with practice throughout the rest of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced on 1 August 1989 with the expiry of patent protection in Ireland for cimetidine, a constituent of Tagamet &mdash; a drug that dramatically reduces the need for hospitalisation of ulcer patients, we urgently seek your support to have the inadequacy of the existing patent regulations resolved by <Col N="184" /> legislation of the Oireachtas during the early days of 1989.  While we are aware that such legislation is in preparation and expected to be placed before the Dáil in the coming year, it is of critical importance to Smithkline Beckman that we are not exposed to the loss of patent protection through a technical inadequacy in the legislation as it now stands.</P>
    <P>Smithkline Beckman has an investment of over £100 million in its Irish operations and has demonstrated its commitment to Ireland and will continue to do so in the future.  We earnestly need your help as an elected parliamentarian to ensure that the necessary patent protection legislation can be introduced and enacted in the coming Dáil session.  If for any reason the ratification of the European Convention to give 20 years patent protection in Ireland is delayed the implications for the Smithkline Beckman Corporation and indeed for much of the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland which employs over 12,000 people, are a cause for considerable concern.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter in the Seanad at the end of 1988, at the beginning of 1989 and throughout that year and sporadically since then.  The explanation I received was that a constitutional impediment existed, the nature of which was never quite explained to me.  This was hinted at again at the end of the Minister's speech, where he says:</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to mention another patent convention, namely, the Community Patent Convention which was signed by Ireland and other Community states in 1975. It will not be possible to ratify that convention on the basis of the present Bill because an amendment of the Constitution is required before ratification of this Convention can take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to imply that the Government are preparing such amendment to the Constitution as would be necessary for placing before the people, together with other amendments to the <Col N="185" /> Constitution proposed in the wake of the Maastricht Summit.</P>
    <P>He concludes by saying: &ldquo;I recommend the principle of the Bill for approval of the House.&rdquo;  He does not say that he recommends the Bill.  That is interesting selective use of language, to approve and recommend the principle but to hold back from suggesting that the Bill is a complete answer to our patent problems. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, can expand a little on this.</P>
    <P>I do not know if in consultation with her advisers she might indicate what is the constitutional difficulty or problem; I have never had that explained to me.  It now seems that we have overcome two thirds of our difficulties here and yet the remaining one third is described as a constitutional difficulty that may be resolved in the light of some other amendments proposed to the Constitution.  It would be useful if that could be cleared up.</P>
    <P>In the light of correspondence I had in 1988 and 1989 with various pharmaceutical companies I telephoned the Federation of the Irish Chemical Industry. They indicated that they did not require any further amendments.  The extension to 20 years from 16 is one of their principal objectives and they want this Bill on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  For that reason I fully support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Kennedy said about paragraph 6, in the explanatory memorandum.  It seems that the High Court goes one way in its interpretation while the intention of the Bill may be otherwise.  I concur with him that if we ask experts to examine patents to see if they meet the test of novelty or originality we should accept their professional judgment and not open it to arbitrary challenge by the Controller. There should be a concession made to the authority of these people.  I am sure the Minister will deal with this and other matters raised more properly by Senator Kennedy.</P>
    <P>No amount of patent legislation of this kind will completely protect the indigenous ideas and originality of the Irish people.  I am sure the Minister is aware <Col N="186" /> of what happened in Waterford three or four years ago which illustrates the point made by Senator McCarthy about the question of research and development by multinational corporations.  I cannot now recall the name of the successful computer company involved in Waterford whose parent company in America suffered financial difficulty.  There had been a very fine research and development unit in the Waterford Company which had succeeded in developing and patenting new ideas.  They were patented by the parent company which, when it got into financial difficulty, closed down the Waterford operation and repatriated to the United States the ideas that had been developed in Waterford.  Irish originality was rewarded by being absorbed back into the United States economy with no positive spin-off for Ireland.  I am not sure that any legislation can effectively protect the national interest of a small country like ours, and I completely agree with Senator McCarthy when he says that we have people of considerable intellectual originality and ingenuity quite capable of producing inventions that are of benefit, not just to the Irish people, but to humanity at large.</P>
    <P>I will end by posing a hypothetical question to the Minister, the reason for which may become clear subsequently. Consider the case of an Irish scientist who developed a drug which had a dramatic impact on the AIDS virus, that could inhibit the trigger mechanism by which the low level of infection is catalysed into the full-blown AIDS infection.  In order to acquire financial support the interest in their invention might be sold to a company, perhaps a multinational company, which decided, cynically, despite the global implications involved, that it was in their financial interest to defer production of this new drug until market conditions met their financial requirements. Is there any means by which some international, supernational, global agency such as the World Health Organisation or the United Nations could act in the interests of humanity to break that patent?  The world is facing the challenge of AIDS.  A country like Uganda may <Col N="187" /> lose the best educated of its population to this disease and many other countries are faced with similar problems.  Whatever the legal ramifications, there is a moral obligation on the world community to ensure that this tragedy is not compounded. This may be a very complicated question and I would not expect the Minister to be able to answer it off the top of her or his head but it is a problem that may arise &mdash; if not in this country then in some other country.</P>
    <P>The rights of patentees should not supersede the rights of humanity as a whole and I would like if the Minister could direct some attention to this problem in communication with other European countries and perhaps with the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.  In the Waterford case an invention that would have benefited the Irish people was repatriated to America. No profits accrued to the Irish people. There was no reward, no recognition of the original genius of the Irish people.  It would be an even greater tragedy if, for example, some breakthrough was made in the field of AIDS prevention, or in the inhibition of the spread of the virus, and for purely commercial reasons this was not made available for the benefit of humanity.</P>
    <P>Having made these general points I welcome the Bill, although I regret it has taken so long to introduce the measure. Other speakers have spoken about the time scale and I look forward to the completion of this process because, as I have indicated, there is a clear suggestion at the end of the Minister's speech that this is not an ultimate solution to the problem but that a remaining difficulty may only be resolved by a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before us, another Bill which is finally making its way before the House because of obligations binding upon us by European conventions.  Nevertheless it is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The processing of patents in this country has been much too slow for years. The Bill should streamline the processing <Col N="188" /> of patents across Europe which would spare companies and inventors much effort in relation to unnecessary repeat applications for patents.</P>
    <P>I express a certain level of concern about our capacity to process patents. I understand that in December 1990 a backlog of 20,000 patents awaited processing while over the past number of years staff numbers in the Patents Office have decreased significantly.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised in the debate on this Bill particularly in the other House in relation to the extension of the period of patents from 16 to 20 years.  That has been a matter of concern to various elements of the Irish pharmaceutical industry.  Companies such as Penn Chemicals who have been in contact with Senator Norris are anxious to secure a 20-year period for patents.  Certain other companies in the generic drug industry in this country are also anxious to see that period of 20 years reduced to 16 and maintained at that period.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat agnostic on the issue. The case may be argued either way and will depend on one's point of view, on the balance of circumstances and perhaps on the drug or invention in question and the amount of money spent on its development, etc.  It is imperative that the drive for new and better inventions continues.  That is particularly true in the case of disease but also in relation to 101 other different aspects of life.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of drugs, the pressures placed on drug companies at international level are absolutely enormous and merit our concern. The dangerous consequence of such great pressure may be that international drug companies will cut corners in new product development, testing and marketing. Large numbers of pharmaceutical products are constantly coming on the market, many of which are basically the same. Large numbers of products do not add anything to the efficacy of treatment, we would be better off if much of the futile effort put into that kind of carry on were directed towards new products and new ideas.  The same principle applies to other areas of industry.  Over the last number <Col N="189" /> of years in this country we have had a rash of these &ldquo;me too&rdquo; products.  One of the best examples was the production of &ldquo;imitators&rdquo; of Baileys Irish Cream. There seemed at one stage, to be 101 different types of Irish creams.  Now most of them have duly faded away and the people who developed the original product continue to dominate the market. This development is an indication of the way industry work and think.  Some of the resources utilised in producing imitation products which usually fail in the long term should be diverted towards the encouragement of new ideas and their development.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill to allow for small inventions to be protected by short term patents is welcome and should encourage small-time inventors now coming up with ideas to continue to do so.  While this development is welcome, I sympathise with people in Eolas &mdash; what was the IIRS &mdash; who have to deal with some of these inventors because a number of their inventions are bonkers, nutty and totally off the wall.  Some people in Eolas had their hands full dealing with people who came in from the street with new inventions which were a load of rubbish and, rather like many politicians, there were not in a position to tell people so directly.  Nonetheless, among many useless ideas will come some useful ones and encouragement is needed to develop those which would be of lasting benefit.</P>
    <P>The Bill should bring about, to some extent, an improved climate for research and development in Ireland, the levels of which are much too low at present.  It should be a matter of considerable concern to everybody that a recent survey of international industrialists rated Ireland as twenty-second out of 23 industrial nations in terms of our technological capacity.  These are among the delightful facts one finds in the new industrial policy review report produced recently which I welcome.  Most of it is very encouraging and worthwhile and I am delighted to see it being published.  That report draws attention to the fact that in terms of the amount of money invested in R and D, <Col N="190" /> expressed as a percentage of our gross domestic product, the Irish proportion is considerably lower than all but two or three other European countries.</P>
    <P>Given that the Irish economy is a small economy compared to most other European countries one realises how inadequate our effort is in relation to research and development.  I am not one who believes that from research and development everything else will flow.  I envisage research and development as part of a broader industrial policy and if we hope to expand industrial development we will need greater investment in research and development.  We will need it, not only in the high tech industries, where its need is patently obvious, but also in low technology industries where it is essential that new processes be developed together with new ways of dealing with different aspects of industry and new ways of processing material and so on.  It is essential that we develop and patent new ideas there.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris was stimulating as always and raised some interesting matters in relation to drugs which might treat AIDS and possible complications about the patenting of such drugs, the moral obligations to put these drugs on the market and so on.  It is a sad reality that market conditions are a key factor in deciding when new products which have been patented are released on to the market.  I do not doubt that many companies release products on the market simply to maximise their profits and that is particularly regrettable in the area of drugs.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of what happens to Irish inventions and Irish ideas. I would imagine that if some Irish person or group of scientists developed a good idea and had it patented, the most likely outcome would be that sooner or later they would be bought up by a multinational company with enormous resources.  Innovative Irish inventors and scientists can expect to encounter much the same phenomenon as promising young Irish footballers, who play for one or two years for some of the clubs here and sooner or later are bought by the <Col N="191" /> money available for the international market.  That is what happens in this country and there are precedents to bear that out.</P>
    <P>This trend is also part of the wider brain-drain phenomenon which affects not just new inventions but many other aspects of Irish life.  It is also happening in the United Kingdom where many of the better and more successful British scientists are now being offered enormous amounts of money to go to America so that their ideas can be used there.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect that I would like to mention briefly arising from the remarks of Senator Norris in relation to drugs for the development of AIDS and so on.  There are all sorts of very interesting moral questions here, such as the need for investment and the obligation on countries and on international agencies to ensure that drugs are developed to treat conditions not prevalent in western society and, accordingly, for which little money is made available.  A classic example of this phenomenon took place in this country in the fifties and sixties when the late Dr. Vincent Barry in the medical research laboratory of Trinity College developed a useful drug for the treatment of leprosy.  The drug could not be made viable on the international market and people who suffered from leprosy did not have the money to pay for the drug.  Accordingly the drug never reaped the rewards for the group which had genuinely come up with a useful product.</P>
    <P>On those few thoughts I welcome the Bill which I hope will go through the House rapidly.  I hope it will provide a stimulus to encourage Irish inventions and to encourage more research and development in Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having one of the self-confessed agnostics presumably is an asset at this stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill, of course, is welcome.  We will talk about some of the arguments in detail in a minute, but it is worth reflecting a little on the extraordinary situation where we have taken between 19 and 22 years, depending on which of the two, the treaty and the convention, that we sign.  In a country that has had since about 1979 a succession of Governments who have talked about an enterprise culture and about the need to create &mdash; as Senator Upton's colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has often talked about &mdash; the meteorological conditions for enterprise, the climate for enterprise, we have taken 22 years to sort out something as fundamental as protecting the rights of ownership of innovators.</P>
      <P>It is always easy to think about inventors as somewhat disorganised individuals operating out of their back shed with mysterious bubbling bottles pouring out under the door and sending noxious smells into the next door neighbour's sitting room but an enormous amount of patenting is done by large corporations, whether multinational or national, who spend large sums of money in the pursuit of innovation and new ideas.  One of the realities is that this is driven as Senator Upton quite rightly said, by the market but it is also driven by a perception of (a) whether your idea would be secure for commercial development afterwards and (b) whether the system of securing that would be half reasonable in terms of time scale.  I am intrigued by the state of our institutions which imagines that 22 years is a reasonable time to sort out the practicalities of securing the rights of an individual or of a corporation or of any company to an idea which its has developed.  That is an appalling reflection on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the priorities we have in this State seem to have been turned on their heads.  We are now in the ridiculous situation where we have a large number <Col N="193" /> of our institutions which are groaning with their inadequacy to deal with what the country needs, the classic example being the one we are now reforming, the Patents Office, which everybody knows was a nightmare for anybody with an idea.  It was not the fault of the people there; it was the fault of the law, the fault of the lack of resources.  Nobody is disputing the work of the people there.  At the time when we were letting that run down because of a zealous crusade to reduce public expenditure, we have daft tax policies being landed on us which in yesterday's budget will leave the likes of myself and my spouse better off by a sum of money every week that this State is prepared to give a married couple to live on.</P>
    <P>I have no idea where people get the idea that that sort of a daftness is more important than the reform of our institutions so as to encourage innovation and enterprise.  I have no idea why we did not model ourselves on some of the other countries like, say, Germany, which has a remarkable record for innovation and enterprise and which now dares to actually take more tax from people than we do.  That country is not, that I am aware of, going down the tubes; it is not going broke; it is not lacking in enterprise, because they make their institutions work.  Nothing could be a more shame-inducing testimony to the appallingly inadequate nature of all of our institutions than a 22-year gap and our failure to ratify an important international convention. It is one-third of the life span of the State.  We have left something sit and wait to be ratified.  That defies all logic and seriousness.  The State is riddled with legislation that is out of date in many areas and it is causing enormous problems to people.</P>
    <P>The debate &mdash; at least the parts I read in the Official Report of the Dáil &mdash; considered at great length the relative problems of the multinational sector of the chemical industry and the indigenous sector which was largely though not exclusively dominated by the production of generic drugs.  There were problems identified about the extension of 16 to 20 <Col N="194" /> years.  It would not be wise to over-emphasise the relative importance of the multinational sector.  The multinational sector is, first of all, what it says, multinational, and therefore a considerable proportion of the wealth it creates is exported &mdash; hence this country's dubious record as the greatest exporter of repatriated profits in the entire OECD by a factor of about four.  We have a scale of repatriation of profits which in some years even exceeds by a factor of four payments on the foreign part of our national debt.</P>
    <P>I do not have any great problem in principle in the world we live in with multinationals making a lot of money, because money that is made is used for something.  However, if profits that are generated are reinvested in Puerto Rico or in Mexico or in some other country with even lower wage rates than we have, then I am not sure what good it is doing. When you add into that the appallingly low level of linkage development between many multinationals and Irish suppliers of goods and services, you are further reducing the significance of that sector in the Irish economy.  By contrast the indigenous sector of the chemical industry, while it may employ only a fraction &mdash; and I understand the proportion is about 8:1 in favour of the multinationals &mdash; perhaps only about one-eighth of the numbers, it is indigenous.  It is, therefore, largely domestically owned and the wealth it creates remains in circulation in the Irish economy, hopefully by way of investment or else in some other way.  It will be more inclined to resource various commodities at home, if for no other reason that it will not have the multinational tentacles to resource them elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It would be a worthwhile study to look at the multiplier effect of an indigenous chemical industry, admittedly producing lower added value generic products, and to compare that with the allegedly hightech multinationals, which at the same time are not really integrated into the Irish economy and which are exporting a huge proportion of the wealth they create <Col N="195" /> without any of it being left behind to show any benefit to us.</P>
    <P>That is where the argument about the 16 to 20 years comes up, but I do not think it is an enormously important issue. There may well be some hiccups in the indigenous chemical industry as a result of this but if they had not been aware of the various conventions which have existed for the best part of 20 years in both cases and were not making some provision for the possibility of us catching up on the rest of the world eventually, then they probably would not have survived in business anyway.  I do not think we have a huge problem there.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting question on this as to whether the multinational side of the pharmaceutical industry &mdash; I have a certain interest in this &mdash; is as beneficial as we imagine.  In terms of patent law and in terms of what this is supposed to do &mdash; which is to improve the service available to people who want to secure their rights to an invention &mdash; we would want to remember that there are bigger forces than simply an unscrupulous individual wanting to steal an idea.  One of these forces is the increasingly recognised economies of scale which large scale industry &mdash; for instance, in mainland Europe &mdash; have which give them such enormous competitive advantages that even if an idea is developed here they will still have the capacity not to steal it, but to buy it on such favourable terms that no sane indigenous manufacturer here could refuse.</P>
    <P>The NESC report on Ireland and the EC developed this point to an extent that should cause alarm to anybody who is worried about the future of the country. It is not enough to develop ideas here; we have to make sure that the ideas once they are developed are actually produced and marketed from this country.  That is an extremely difficult issue.  A large part of the difficulty is not with financial terms but with the extraordinary creaking and groaning of large sections of the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to throw a few queries at the Minister.  Some of them are perhaps more <Col N="196" /> appropriate to Committee Stage, but I do not want to delay him too long on the Committee Stage or to delay myself for that matter.  In regard to the decision &mdash; and I realise that it is a European decision &mdash; to define what can be patented, there is a logic to it, but some of the terminology might not be clear, particularly section 10 (b) which deals with &ldquo;a plant or animal varieties or an essentially biological process for the production of plants or animals other than a micro-biological process or the products thereof&rdquo;.  The way genetic engineering is developing, the way biotechnology is developing, I am not sure that he is going to succeed indefinitely maintaining a distinction between a biological process and a micro-biological process.  It is contained in the Bill as a specific distinction and one that may well produce problems in the long term.</P>
    <P>I am also not a little amused, because it turns up at the strangest places, at the prohibition on the patenting of an invention &ldquo;the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality&rdquo;.  I always had this funny feeling that whenever the drafters of legislation &mdash; and not just in this country but generally &mdash; want to cover themselves against things they have not imagined they stick in a clause on public order and morality in case someone comes up with something nobody wants. I presume this might include weapons.  I cannot imagine &mdash; perhaps my imagination as I get older is becoming more limited &mdash; given the definition in the Bill, the sort of patents that people would come up with that might be contrary to public morality, but I suppose it might have to do with abortifacients and things like that.  Nevertheless, I am always a little tickled at the obsession with certain things and the way they pop up in the most extraordinary bits of legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is most welcome and given what I have said about its delay I suppose I should not delay it further.  I was intrigued by the Minister's reference at the end of his speech to constitutional problems dealing with the Community Patent Convention, and maybe he will <Col N="197" /> elaborate on that in his reply.  The best thing we can do now is to get moving and get this legislation passed.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us what he knows about the efficiency of the European Patent Office.  What sort are the delays?  What are the time delays involved there?  Are we still way behind them or have they developed a system of examining patent applications from which perhaps we could learn something; or is it simply that they are better resourced and better funded and have more staff?  What is the case?  There is definitely a huge problem there and I trust this legislation will meet the problem.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope &mdash; and Senator Kennedy made this point &mdash; that we are not writing into this Bill a relationship between the Controller and his staff which is different from the relationship which exists in many other State agencies in terms of the rights of the staff <i>vis-á-vis</i> their immediate boss.  With that said, what can anybody else do after 20 years but belatedly welcome the legislation and hope it provides the necessary stimulus to Irish enterprise and to Irish inventiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome enthusiastically the broad thrust of this long overdue Bill.  The five main provisions are: (1) to update current legislation on the grant of patents as contained in the Patents Act, 1964, thus harmonising laws applying generally in other European countries, especially by EC member states; (2) to enable Ireland to ratify the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty; (3) to establish more expeditious procedures in respect of examination of patent applications; (4) to provide for the protection of smaller type inventions by introducing provisions for the grant of a short term patents; and (5) to establish that the Controller is the sole authority in relation to all matters concerning the grant of patents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains new provisions as to what constitutes a patentable invention, what the term of a patent shall be, the <Col N="198" /> effect of a patent and a patents application and the grounds on which a patent may be revoked.  On these aspects the Bill follows the corresponding provisions of the European Patent Convention. Other European countries which have ratified the EPC have adopted similar provisions in their domestic laws.</P>
    <P>The EPC was signed by Ireland and 14 other European countries in Munich in September 1973.  It has since been ratified by all EC member states, including Portugal, and also by Sweden, Austria and Liechtenstein.  The principle of the EPC is that anyone seeking to protect an invention in a wide number of European countries may do so by simply making one application to the European Patent Office in Munich, designating any or all of the countries privy to the EPC in which protection is desired.  Previously it was necessary to file separate applications with each national patent office and comply with each country's separate national stipulations.  When granted by the European Patent Office, the European patent will have the same status in each of the designated states as if a national patent for the invention had been granted by the respective national patent offices.  The effect will be identical in each state and ratification of the patent by the national authority will be possible only on the grounds specified in the Convention. The duration of a European patent, 20 year term, will be the same in each state.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted in its present form, contingent on ratification of the EPC, it will be possible for patent applications to include Ireland in a list of countries in which protection is sought when making an application to the European Patent Office, thus avoiding the need to make a separate application to the Irish office.</P>
    <P>The Patent Co-operation Treaty was concluded in Washington DC and signed by Ireland in 1970.  The treaty has been ratified by all EC member states, except Ireland and Portugal.  It has also been ratified by the EFTA countries, the USA, Canada and Australia among others.  The primary objective of the PCT <Col N="199" /> is the streamlining of patent applications, filing and search procedures for applicants wishing to obtain patent protection in countries around the world.  Applicants may make one central application, generally to the local Patents Office, designating countries in which patent protection is required and the novelty search is carried out by the international search authority, whose report of the search is then furnished to the national office of each relevant country.  Final examination and grant are performed by the various national offices.  This system economises considerably on the volume of work an applicant would otherwise have to do to satisfy the multiplicity of individual national requirements.</P>
    <P>Let me address the Bill in greater detail.  Part XII of this Bill is important in the extreme.  Application of Article 119 affords Irish and foreign companies the opportunity to designate Ireland along with other member states of the EPC in one single patent application. Such a single patent application, with a single examination in a single language and with a single fee, will enable patent rights to be established across Europe in a cost effective, efficient and timely fashion.  Happily, it will no longer be the case that firms will be obliged to make separate applications in Ireland, with all the attendant time delays which the current system imposes.  Ratification of the EPC and the PCT will undoubtedly enhance Ireland's potential for industrial investment.  The proposed system will be of significant interest to those companies which form an integral part of the exporting sector of Irish industry and which accounts for in excess of 75 per cent of manufacturing output.</P>
    <P>The new system is also advantageous in that it will reduce substantially the pressure on the Irish Patents Office, which has now, I believe, a backlog in the region of 18,000 patent applications. The immense volume has resulted in the patent process being excessively protracted. It has been the experience that it has been taking from six to eight years for examination and grant of an Irish <Col N="200" /> patent.  In this context the current proposed legislation is welcome and should be music to the ears of those who have engaged in a tortuous patent process.</P>
    <P>Provision for the extension of the patents life from 16 to 20 years in harmony with the 1973 convention now brings this country into line with the system prevailing in the rest of Europe and indeed internationally.  This extension and consequent harmonisation is of the utmost significance in circumstances where, for example, countries are committing large expenditure on research and development and where there is a natural expectation that Ireland would offer the same time frame for recovery of that investment through subsequent commercialisation of any product developed.  It is important that the same regime should apply throughout Europe and internationally.</P>
    <P>Section 63 of the Bill provides for the introduction of a short term patent of ten years duration which provides a sufficient, inexpensive method by which small industry and inventors could obtain effective protection for inventions and innovations.  It has been brought to my attention that a flaw exists in the Bill as is currently drafted.  It appears that all that is required to establish the validity of a short term patent is mere novelty of the invention.  There is no provision included in the Bill to require any inventive step.</P>
    <P>There is every likelihood that this will have grave implications for Irish industry in so far as it will mean that many patents will be granted for trivial alterations which may manifest pure novelty but which will not have any inherent ingenuity. Such patents could potentially become a vociferous nuisance to industry, particularly if there is any frivolous or vexatious aspect, and would certainly serve to undermine the repute of the patent system.  However, I would have to say in favour of the short term patent provision, given that it comes within the definition of a patent under the term of the Bill, it will presumably also qualify as a patent for the purpose of relief from income tax under the provisions of the <Col N="201" /> Finance Act, 1973, as they stand.  The rapid procedure for obtaining grants of a short term patent will be extremely helpful in securing tax relief in the early stages and development of an invention.</P>
    <P>Some reservations have been expressed regarding the First Schedule to this Bill, which outlines the transitional provision applying to its enactment.  Patents which expire after commencement of the Bill will not be permitted any extension of the term.  Under the provisions of the transition arrangement, a patent expiring before commencement will be entitled to an extension only to a term of five years.  This may occasion very serious problems.  Heretofore extensions of up to ten years were granted under defined conditions.  In my view all patent petitions outstanding at the date of commencement should, of right, receive the due protection proposed for all patents that are extant at the date of commencement of the legislation, like an automatic four year extension.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates that during the last two years of the extended term third parties will have the opportunity to engage in particular activities related to the invention patented, excluding importation or placing on the markets of a patented product and being exempt from liability in respect of patent infringement. Such a measure would have consequences in that it could alter retrospectively the position and right enjoyed by patent holders under the 1964 Act.  In practice, a patentee would be placed at a singular disadvantage under the proposed legislation and it would effectively discriminate against him.  The positive aspect is that companies such as those engaged in the pharmaceutical or agrichemical fields who wish to obtain product authorisation prior to the expiry of patents are placed in a position where they may launch a generic product shortly after a patentee's exclusive rights have ended.  However, the rights of the existing patentee must be adequately protected and the legislation must be reconciled with that in the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> In general I welcome the Bill and perhaps the Minister would be good enough to clarify some of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the generally very positive attitude shown by Senators towards this Bill.  I know it has been a long time coming.  I think this is of some benefit in many ways because we have been able to introduce into the Bill many useful provisions which might not have been apparent some years ago and I think Senator McCarthy adverted to some aspects of that.  The short term patent system which is being introduced will be particularly useful, less costly and quicker for smaller inventors in particular as opposed to the large companies who spend a great deal of money on the registration of their patents.  The question of the dissemination of patent information will become an important new activity for the Patents Office in future when the backlog of patent applications is eliminated under the new more economical provisions which exist in this Bill for examination of applications.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to some of the points made by individual Senators, if I may, and any points I do not cover I can cover on Committee Stage if necessary. Senator Kennedy raised a query about the question of inventions by employees, but in reply to that I would say this Bill leaves it to the contract of employment to determine, as between employer and employee, who will have the right to an invention made by an employee.  That is the case under the 1964 Act and I think will continue to be the case when this Bill is passed.  We have had no representations in the Department to change this and we have, therefore, no reason to believe that this approach, which is inherent in the 1964 Act and again in this Bill, is not working well.  It seems to me it probably is and it seems to be the most sensible way to deal with the question rather than laying down rules that would apply irrespective of agreement between employer and employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kennedy raised the question <Col N="203" /> of the patent examiners and their position. I have deliberately decided not to give the examiners any particular statutory or specific legal status because of the problems which this has caused under the present law where, because they are independent to some extent and in some respects, no management directives about the performance of their work can be given and that was apparently confirmed in a High Court case some years ago.  They can, therefore, work at their own pace and in their own way.  A significant backlog has built up as a result, at the moment there are approximately 20,000 cases.  Applications are being lodged at the rate of 4,700 per year and the number dealt with is approximately 1,000 with the result that the backlog is getting significantly bigger each year. Obviously this cannot continue.  Under the Bill all matters including the examination of patents or applications, are to be the responsibility of the Controller and he will have authority to lay down guidelines as to the performance of examination tasks by the examiners.  The examiners will still do the actual examination.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy suggested that we might look at the question of a new court to deal specifically with patent applications or patent litigation.  This Bill provides that a certain jurisdiction will be given to the Circuit Court, particularly in regard to infringement proceedings under short term patents and this will help to reduce litigation costs which in the High Court are appallingly high and can act as a deterrent to the people involved.  I do not consider that there should be a separate court or division in the High Court.  I do not think that is necessary.  That is not the way the High Court operates because they do not have a Chancery division.  Any judge can hear any case, although in practice, for the most part, certain judges hear certain types of cases.  There is not enough litigation in this country at the moment to warrant having a separate court.  Hopefully, there may be less litigation here in <Col N="204" /> the future if much of it is dealt with in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made a point about a new drug to fight the AIDS virus.  The position would seem to be that if the company holding the patent refuse to work the invention they can be compelled to grant licences to others to do so.  Under the Bill the State can step in and take over the working of an invention in the interest of the public good.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of the Community Patent Convention and the constitutional problem to which I referred at the outset.  The difficulty about ratifying this Convention lies in the fact that the instruments involved in bringing it about are outside the legal framework of the Rome Community Treaty and, consequently, certain provisions in the Convention, particularly those conferring jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice and those relating to the Community Patent Appeal Court which will be established under the agreement, in the opinion of the Attorney General, suffer from constitutional infirmity as they are not blessed by the exemption for which the 1972 Third Amendment to the Constitution provides.  The House will recall that the words used there are &ldquo;acts necessitated by membership&rdquo; rather than the words originally proposed, &ldquo;acts consequent on membership&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This question will have to be looked at this year before the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  My preference would be to have a referendum wide enough to encompass not just the Maastricht Treaty but other treaties and conventions often of a purely technical nature which will arise from time to time consequent on our membership of the Community and this Patent Convention is a good example.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to justify having a referendum purely on the question of the ratification or otherwise of the Community Patent Convention.  I do not think we would be able to generate a high poll on such an esoteric topic.  It would be difficult to draft but, if at all possible, we should try to have what I might call an omnibus type amendment that would <Col N="205" /> cover this matter specifically and others of this type that are likely to arise in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy inquired about the question of constituting the Patents Office as a separate office.  I referred to this before.  I said that was the ultimate intention but we cannot do it until this legislation is passed.  Then we will be able to sit down to work out the mechanics of making the office autonomous or quasi-autonomous at least, and release it from the control on staff numbers which apply to it as a Civil Service office.  This office is self-financing.  It will not be a drain on the revenue.</P>
    <P>Even in its limited form of operation at the moment, the Patents Office is profitable from the State's point of view and will become, I hope, a great deal more profitable as a result of the passing of this legislation and the ratification of the European Convention.  Senators will be aware that in the recently published review by the Culliton committee on industrial policy they recommend that this might be done.  I can also see scope for doing something similar in respect of the Companies Office and the Government have decided that when things are straightened out there, most of that office will be decentralised to Kilkenny.  I am not certain that we would yet be able to decentralise the Patents Office, which is rather more complicated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McCarthy inquired about the prospects of getting one or other of these offices for Ireland and I concur with his sentiments.  However, this Government and previous Governments made numerous efforts in this respect without any great success.  One of the arguments put to us is that ten or 20 years ago, unfortunately, we were foolish enough to accept a Community office of some description, which exists in Ireland at the moment; it is extremely small and is not <Col N="206" /> of any consequence either in Irish or European terms.  I am not even sure what it does but it is quoted as a reason we should not consider ourselves in the running since there is at least one other member state which has not any such office.  The Patents Office would make a major contribution to the Irish economy if it were located here because I understand that 4,000 highly paid officials are employed in it in Munich and the numbers are increasing because the volume of applications and work is constantly increasing.  The European Community is not subject to the strictures on public expenditure and on staff numbers to which we in this country are subject.  As well as the 4,000 people who are directly employed, it generates a great deal of employment among patent agents, lawyers, engineers and advisers of all kinds who would locate themselves within the general area of an office of that kind for the purpose of advising applicants and representing them in contested cases and so on.</P>
    <P>The question of the location of the Community's trademark office is under preliminary consideration at present and the Government have applied to the Community for it to be located in Ireland. It would not be as lucrative from an employment and investment point of view as the Patents Office but nonetheless it would be, in Irish terms, a significant provider of well-paid employment.  I am sure that at the very least many hundreds of officials and advisers would locate here.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy referred to how little R and D is done by companies here. In particular he referred to multinational pharmaceutical companies and I accept that historically that has been the case. There are a number of reasons for it, the principal one being the taxation regime that existed here.  It did not make sense from a taxation point of view to use Ireland as a cost centre as opposed to a profit generating centre.  With the changes that have taken place in taxation in the past couple of years and aided by what was done in the budget yesterday, <Col N="207" /> that position is changing and from a taxation point of view Ireland is now a less unfavourable location for R and D. Ireland has available many well-qualified graduates and PhDs who could do this type of work at a more reasonable rate than might apply to people with equivalent qualifications in other countries. I am very hopeful that the increase in R and D which has been perceived in the past few years will gather pace and become much more significant in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill will give greater protection to inventions and the speedier registration of inventions will make a significant contribution towards establishing Ireland as a worthwhile location for research and development of all kinds not just in pharmaceuticals but in many other forms of activity.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan inquired about the difference between biological and micro-biological processes.  In so far as I understand it &mdash; and my understanding is finite on these matters, I emphasise &mdash; biological means breeding and crossbreeding practices to achieve new varieties, for example, both of animals and plants.  Microbiological involves scientific intervention to change the essential character of a product, for example, a technique which could make a plant more disease-resistant.  This could not be brought about by ordinary cross-breeding methods.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised some questions on the possible conflict that exists in respect of the transitional provisions in the Schedule to this Bill as between what one would broadly call the generic interest in this country and the broader interest of large pharmaceutical companies. There is a very definite conflict of interest as between the two.  We tried manfully and I believe successfully to try to balance the two interests there.  Nearly all the various interests recognise that the best possible job was done in trying to look fairly on the welfare and commercial interest of both groups.</P>
    <P>The extended period of patent protection which is not unique to Ireland but <Col N="208" /> will be common to the whole of Europe, could, I suppose, be seen as in some way detrimental to generic interests but those who are in the generic industry here will realise that we are 12 years behind the rest of Europe in adopting the 20-year patent.  They have had a substantial period where the normal rule did not apply to them.  The extension of four years is balanced by the fact that the extension periods that are allowed for at the end of a patent period under the 1964 Act of up to ten years on application to the court are being abolished so that the possibility of a 26-year patent period under the 1964 Act is now finally done away with.  Those two provisions in contradistinction to one another in the way I have explained is an example of how we have tried to balance the conflicting or competing interests fairly.  The majority of those involved on either side of the fence would agree that the efforts that have been made to act fairly as between the two have, by and large, been reasonably successful.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised in the course of this debate.  I thank Senators for their approach to the Bill and join with them in looking forward to its early enactment which will be of great benefit to the country.</P>

      <P>The immediate history of this Bill deserves to be put on the record.  For reasons that may be well known to most people in this House, the Minister was not in a position to put some of the history of this legislation on the record, although his role in it was most commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old Cork Milk Board there were only two registered suppliers of <Col N="209" /> milk.  The issue arose because of their tendering to supply liquid milk to the Southern Health Board and, in particular, to Our Lady's Hospital.  By miraculous coincidence year after year the two suppliers happened to tender exactly the same price.  It was one of these wonderful coincidences the world is full of.  I could not, for one second, suggest collusion. How could you?  People do not do these things in the world of competitive, trusting enterprise we have in this country, but there was something very funny going on.  It was funny first that they managed to arrive at the same price, and it was even funnier that those who were given the job of looking after funds in the Southern Health Board never seemed to notice that they were tendering the same price.  An upstart of a milk provider from outside the area tendered at a dramatically different price &mdash; the Minister had an involvement then, I do not think he has now.  It ended up with one hospital saving, I was led to believe, something like £30,000 on the price of liquid milk for one year.  I do not want to get hung up on the price but thousands of pounds were saved.  Instead of having a general celebration of the fact that market economics, for once, worked and that we had competition, we had urgent and immediate recourse to Europe with many people attempting to defend the indefensible which was that, effectively, a cartel had operated in a considerable part of Cork city and county and managed to keep prices at extraordinarily high levels relative to what the market could sustain.</P>
    <P>The legislation we have before us is the outcome of the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards which was brought about because they were deemed to be invalid under Community law.  I am assured that there is great need for this legislation because of the extreme seasonality in milk production in this country which could result, as it did in the past, in milk shortages in the less economical seasons, that is winter.</P>
    <P>Reading the reply the then Minister for Agriculture gave to a question in the Dáil on 5 December 1991 &mdash; columns <Col N="210" /> 443-444 of the Official Report &mdash; it is admittedly difficult to imagine shortages of anything in the dairy area when one considers that in 1990, 56 per cent of total butter production in the State was sold into intervention amounting to £204 million and 48 per cent of the total skimmed milk powder produced in the State was sold into intervention.  While the percentages for 1991 are not yet available, the figures suggest 185 tonnes of butter and 94,000 tonnes of skimmed milk were sold into intervention in 1991.</P>
    <P>The question a person from an urban environment like myself would ask is: where is an industry which has that scale of dependence on a dying mechanism going?  Are we, to a certain extent, legislating for something that will be so transformed within the next five years as to make this legislation meaningless? What will be the nature of the dairy industry or the dairying section of agriculture in two or five years?  Will there be a liquid milk industry?  Will it be economical in the light of what are called reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy for anybody to produce milk in this country?</P>
    <P>We can only compensate people if we are talking about marginal economics.  In other words, the objective of the legislation which is encapsulated in section 5 on the registration of contracts is to provide a guaranteed supply of milk, and that involves quality and a price in the contract that will be sufficient to ensure that in the periods of the year when it might be marginally uneconomical to produce milk, producers will continue to do so.  If the production of milk on a large scale becomes inherently uneconomical for most of the year, then the scale of compensation will be enormous.</P>
    <P>Having been educated here over the years by my colleagues about the woes of the agriculture industry, I am amazed at the number of people who assumed the Common Agricultural Policy would last for ever.  We are on the periphery of Europe.  It appears to me at least that the large scale importation of milk would have diseconomies associated with it in <Col N="211" /> terms of the need to preserve quality and value ratio.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we will need something more dramatic than a fairly light handed regulatory mechanism which does no more in terms of what is written in this Bill than a rational human being would expect, in other words, ensure quality and continuity and guarantee that a price would be offered which would ensure that continuity would be maintained. That is fine when large numbers of people want to produce milk and feel that, overall, the dairying sector of agriculture is profitable.  However, if policies formulated in Brussels are unsuited to many of the qualities that make Irish agriculture unique in terms of our climatic advantage and the fact that we can produce many things more competitively than anybody else if we are left with a level playing field, I wonder what will happen?  The possibility of this country being unable to produce its own milk is not as remarkable as it might seem, given that we do not seem to be able to produce so many other agricultural commodities like potatoes or vegetables to meet our own market demands.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the legislation but also for the hand he had in creating the situation where this legislation was needed. Subject to the caveats I have offered, it will meet the objectives required and hopefully in Dublin and Cork will introduce a fair amount of very healthy competition between competing suppliers of liquid milk which might even result in some benefits to the consumer, the unfortunate suffering creature who does not get the consideration that he or she deserves in most of the debates about agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is unique in all of the industries that I am aware of in which the obsession is eternally with the producer and his or her rights.  Every other industry that I am aware of has to think of the market and the consumer and then produce a product.  We have the reverse here where we have an obsession in agriculture with the right to produce and <Col N="212" /> apparently a compulsion then to ensure that somebody buys the product.  It would be very healthy for agriculture if we were to turn that around and create a dairy sector in the agriculture industry which actually saw itself as being primarily motivated by the needs of the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were established in 1936 and 1937 respectively under the Milk Act, 1936 in order to ensure an adequate supply of liquid milk all the year round in the country's two big urban centres of population.  We know liquid milk is necessary for areas of urban population and probably now that has changed and it is necessary in areas of rural population also.  When the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were established people who did not produce milk were able to call to a neighbour and get a jug of milk.  That was the system that prevailed at the time.  Prior to 1936 producer milk prices had fallen below the cost of production, causing a shortage of milk during the winter months.  That was why the milk board system was established to ensure that farmers would be paid adequately to supply milk to the urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the milk board legislation liquid milk for consumption in the Dublin and Cork sales areas had to be supplied under contract between producer and purchaser and could only be obtained from producers who were registered with the district milk board and producing milk within the production district.  However, in the event of scarcity of milk, the boards had power to license registered processors and distributors to bring milk into a sale area from outside the production area.  While the board system formerly applied only to the Cork and Dublin areas it constituted a model for the arrangements which applied in other areas.  The system worked well over the years and despite the exaggerated seasonality pattern which obtained in Ireland ensured an adequate supply of good quality milk for the liquid market throughout the year.  It was generally <Col N="213" /> regarded as having been a major contributory factor to Ireland's high level of milk consumption.  I understand that our level of liquid milk consumption is about 9 per cent of food consumption.  Liquid milk is vital in the diet.  Stephen Roche who brought honour to Ireland claims that milk was a great help to him and Jack Charlton, who brought honour to Ireland in another sporting area, praised Irish cheese.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the liquid milk market in Ireland should not be left without some regulatory system because of the risk of a free-for-all system which could leave the market short of liquid milk in the winter months as was previously the case in some areas outside Cork and Dublin.  The Minister said this legislation was necessary to ensure that we would have an adequate supply of liquid milk, that is milk for human consumption, available on demand.  From a producer's point of view it is not easy to produce milk all the year round.  Before the 1936 and 1937 regulations were brought into force you did not have the facilities to produce milk that exist now. People had to milk cows by hand as they did not have milking machines and it was hard work.  Those producers had to be paid for producing milk 365 days of the year.  It demanded effort and people who made the effort were compensated adequately and were paid a proper price.</P>
    <P>The production, processing, marketing and distribution of milk for direct human consumption is vital for the continuance of a strong and healthy dairying sector in Ireland.  The liquid milk industry provides a stable outlet for about 10 per cent of total milk production with high employment levels and good returns for producers.  At present there are 4,300 milk suppliers supplying 42 liquid milk plants with milk with a retail value of some £260 million per year.  There are about 5,000 workers employed in collection, processing and packaging.</P>
    <P>Over the years the milk industry has developed and even in remote rural areas there is delivery to householders.  They are now getting milk delivered every day. It is important that we have good quality <Col N="214" /> milk and that can be ensured by means of a proper register which is the task of the news agency.  I hope it provides better quality milk and that the industry will develop and prosper over the years.</P>
    <P>To have better quality milk we must have better housing and better milking facilities.  If we are to comply with EC regulations which not alone apply to the production of liquid milk but also the manufacture of milk, we will have to bring our milking equipment to certain standards and this is an extra financial burden on milk producers.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that adequate grants will be given to dairy farmers to allow them to bring their milking systems in line with EC regulations.</P>
    <P>Milk recording is very important, quality standards have to be maintained, there is a total bacteria count and a cell count.  Many dairy farmers and liquid milk producers are not in a position at present to know the cell count because they are not furnished with it, they have to pay a fee for it.  If they could get an individual count for each cow, they could cull the inferior cows and ensure that the cows they retained produced milk of a high quality.  Milk recording is very important.  A farmer who gets his results every month from his milk recording station, with his kgs per cow, butter fat content, protein content, and the cell count, could identify those cows that are producing low quality milk.</P>
    <P>Unlike most of Europe, liquid milk continues to be an essential part of the Irish diet.  While <i>per capita</i> consumption has declined from a peak of 211 litres, in 1984 to its present level of 176 litres per annum, Ireland still remains one of the largest milk drinking countries in the world, ranking third to Finland and Iceland.  In this regard I understand that in those two countries there are no door to door deliveries.  Since door to door deliveries are important for old people, it is essential that the processor has an adequate margin of profit to ensure this service.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago the opinion was that the processors made excessive profits and we had a milk price war.  Dunnes Stores <Col N="215" /> cut the price of milk.  That favoured people who could buy their milk from those stores at a reduced rate but in rural areas where there are old age pensioners and others who would not be in a position to go to those stores, it is important that they have a daily door to door delivery of quality milk.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of disease regulations and what would happen to milk from herds infected with tuberculosis, brucellosis and other diseases. Under the existing regulations any herd infected with tuberculosis is depopulated immediately and milk from such herds will not be accepted.  There is also a danger when two countries share a border that milk can be imported from the other country.  There should be a regulation to ensure that milk would not be imported to the detriment of our producers.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards will be abolished and replaced by this new milk agency. There is concern about the employees in those boards.  These agencies provided ancillary services, such as A.I. testing, etc.  I was disappointed to read an article in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> of 30 November 1991, headed: &ldquo;AI Boss Calls for National Data Base&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Today's farmers are brain-washed by highly skilled sales people, flashing glossy magazines which portray dairy bulls which are most impressive at a cost of £20 to £100 a straw with no guarantee of a calf or a repeat service.</P>
    <P>Further on Mr. Twomey &mdash; I should not have mentioned his name &mdash; said that in the terms of cattle breeding the UK and Ireland were ten years behind our EC counterparts.  I quote:</P>
    <P>In hindsight one could question the wisdom of purchasing our test bulls from the UK, as 90 per cent of their milk goes to the liquid trade.</P>
    <P>That is contradictory.  He continued:</P>
    <P>In recent years the Milk Board has concentrated on Holland, Germany, <Col N="216" /> Austria, France and Denmark for young bulls to be tested for entry into Irish AI.</P>
    <P>In one sentence he is condemning the glossy magazines and the test bulls and in the next sentence he is praising them. His comments did nothing to ensure that top quality, dairy cattle would produce top quality milk for liquid consumption in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the workers in the Cork and Dublin District Milk boards and I am sure the Minister will look after them, although he said there might be redundancies.  I appeal to him to ensure that these people are looked after and instead of being made redundant they should be employed in the new milk agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is essential to have a Bill to regularise milk supply because if we did not have such legislation we might run short and have to import milk.  The producers must be paid a price that will give them a profit to ensure a decent standard of living.  I am sure the Minister knows from experience that producing milk 365 days of the year is hard work.  These producers are not adequately paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a few observations on this important Bill.  On 11 December when we last had an opportunity to consider this legislation, the Minister told us that negotiations between the staff, the unions and the Department were ongoing.  I would like to ask the Minister what progress has been made in those negotiations.  I was disappointed to learn from the debate in this House that of the 115 employees in the two boards the Department had introduced a proposal which was aimed at encouraging over 50 of them to take redundancy.  It is now a feature of most rationalisation measures and even legislation coming through the Oireachtas that in order to have progress of change one must also have loss of jobs and redundancies.  It seems to be a malaise in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not seem to be able to get to a <Col N="217" /> stage where high technology and a high labour input are compatible.  Very important services were pioneered and developed by the milk boards and others &mdash; milk recording services, progeny testing and mastitis control.  I would like the Minister to assure the House and the agricultural industry that as part of whatever package is ongoing at the moment the more profitable portions of the activities of these two boards will not be hived off either to a management takeover or to the private sector.  This would be to the detriment of services that over the years may not have been profitable but nevertheless contributed to the quality, evolvement and development of the industry as a whole.  This is important.</P>
    <P>I hope the Govenment will ensure that we will have in the agricultural industry a continuation of the kind of back-up services initiated by the Department of Agriculture.  The agricultural advisory and research services, pre-Teagasc, had a wide range of services but it seems now the farmers of Ireland will have to compete and survive in the new marketing situation without the same input from those services &mdash; that is if we accept that the research services are to be cut back and that some of the stations are being disposed of.  Meanwhile, the industry here will have to compete with agricultural industries elsewhere that are well supported and have a favourable financial structure.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate what arrangements are being made for the continuation of these very important services.  Progeny testing has not been carried on at a sufficient level and our efforts at disease control, even though they have been costly, have not been effective.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a function in the shadow of Avonmore which is one of our leading co-operatives.  The milk on the table was from Glasgow Creameries.  I cannot accept that it is cheaper to import milk products than it is to wheel them across the road from one of the most modern co-operatives in Europe.  I take it that the import of milk products will be subject to licensing by the Minister's Department from a quality and disease <Col N="218" /> control point of view.  I am quite aware of the fact that from January of next year we will have absolute free movement and I am sure the Minister and his Department have all the necessary safeguards in place.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I still believe that the difference in price in the litre of milk from the farmgate to the housewife's table, with a 150 per cent or 160 per cent markup, is exorbitant and extraordinary.  We are told that we have the most efficient co-ops in Europe, that &ldquo;big is beautiful&rdquo; and that all these costings were going to come down once we got these huge multinational plcs in place.  Has the Minister power to look at the pricing structure? It is desirable from many points of view that milk consumption should stay high.  Even among our most eminent medical scientists it appears now that nobody can say milk foods are bad.  There seems to be a different view now and people are being told again that milk is a good wholesome food.  It is a food that is readily available here and is one whose use should be encouraged again.  Some people ask why there is a decline in the consumption of milk.  I believe that if the plcs or the co-ops were to allocate half the advertising resources now used to promote spreads and oil-based products in an effort to maintain the level of distribution of milk products the figures would be quite different.</P>
    <P>I accept that the basic purpose of this new agency would appear to be to ensure availability to the consumer at acceptable prices of high quality milk and guaranteeing the quality of products in all seasons. This is very important.  I wish the project every success and I hope they will be so funded as to be able to get off to a good start and proceed at full speed. Since the milk boards were set up in the mid-thirties it is true that the people supplying the liquid milk in both Dublin and Cork commanded a premium price. In the past it was more marked than at the present time.  What people fail to note is that the farmers who were in the liquid milk area or who were lucky enough or had sufficient influence to get the liquid milk contracts had the advantage over <Col N="219" /> their neighbours who did not have those contracts.  Their farmyards and their dairies were subject to regulations and they were subject to quite frequent inspections to ensure that the quality and the hygiene of the whole milk production operation was to a very high standard. To my certain knowledge that has been the practice during the years.  The old system has served the country well.</P>
    <P>I am one who very passionately believes that the future of the agriculture industry, whether this year or in 1993, has to be based on quality control and on quality products well presented in the marketplace when the consumer wants them.  In the meat sector which is very closely tied to the dairy sector, we must stop depending on intervention and begin instead to sell high quality produce at the premium prices that quality will command. At the same time the Department of Agriculture and Food must be in a position to guarantee that our herds are disease free.  I do not think it will be possible to do that without adequate research and recording facilities to enable the process to be monitored.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous onus on the Minister for Agriculture and Food and on his Department to ensure the continuation of the service.  It is not sufficient to say that the European Commission or the European Community have introduced new regulations.  There is one set of regulations and while they may be read in six or eight different languages and different nuances emphasised each time, the first priority of our Department and of Irish officials is to ensure the quality and continuation of Irish facilities and services.  Irish civil servants should not be fearful of making small dents or bends in European regulations.  Another option for the Minister is to make all his civil servants multilingual so that they could read through all of the different regulations and pick out the version that suits this country best.  This matter needs serious consideration because any paragraph translated into eight languages is going to produce different meanings before the job is finished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> I would like to see the Department of Agriculture and Food take a more <i>pro patria</i> view of regulations; otherwise we will not have much of an agricultural industry in the next few years.  It is difficult to get into any of the commercial banks in the midlands at present because farmers are all lining up for their seasonal greetings.  It is a bad economic sign to see so many people being called in for consultations and is a dire warning of something the Minister should be prepared to tackle from day one.  He has an opportunity in this legislation to ensure that those farmers who are brave enough to invest in Irish agriculture at present will have the back-up services they need to prosper and survive in agriculture and to pass on their holdings to another generation.</P>
    <P>The main problem now is that the younger generation are not interested in the meagre return on capital coming from Irish farming under the present stewardship. I hope the Minister will take a long hard view at that because he and his Department are in a frontline position. There is no point in hiding behind European Community regulations; Irish people have to live.  It is up to the Minister, who has the opportunity to play a significant role here, to have the regulations tempered in order to give Irish people the best possible advantage and opportunity.  The Minister and his officials know that this country is well placed to be a front-runner in the provision of high quality agricultural products across the board.  All we want is the guidance, support and the regulations that will allow us to do that.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank most sincerely the Senators who have contributed to the debate on this Bill.  It is an important measure.  Having regard to the day that is in it, it is not the most earth-shattering activity in this building and I am particularly grateful to the Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am heartened to find so many <Col N="221" /> Senators supporting this proposed legislation, which will have wide-ranging and long term effects on an important segment of our dairy industry.  I am no less grateful to those who offered qualified support coupled with constructive criticism. I can assure them that I have listened carefully to all they have had to say and will take account of their views.  In bringing this Second Stage to a conclusion, I would like, if I may, to comment on the issues which have been raised in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>The one issue on which I think nearly all Senators expressed concern is the future of the staff currently employed in the milk boards' ancillary businesses.  As I indicated in my opening address, this issue is of crucial concern to me also. The fact is that technological innovations have led to a decline in demand for some of the services provided by these businesses so that the boards are now, by any standards, considerably overstaffed. This, in turn, has led to a deterioration in their financial position.  It must be understood, therefore, that even if the boards were not being abolished, the question of rationalising the staffing position would still have to be addressed at this juncture.  As I have already indicated, the minimum number of voluntary redundancies necessary to return these businesses to economic viability will be effected so that the long term employment prospects of the remaining staff will be secure.  My Department are engaged in discussions with the trade union which represents the interests of the vast majority of the employees concerned, and it is my expectation that these negotations will be concluded in a mutually satisfactory manner before the proposed new agency is established.  I assure Senator McDonald in particular that anything that can be done to ensure no employment is lost in the changes will be done.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the rumour mentioned by Senator Dardis and referred to again by Senator Upton that five staff at Enfield were to be made summarily redundant as from 1 January is and was totally without foundations, as time has <Col N="222" /> proved.  I would appeal to all concerned not to heed any such scare stories.  They breed alarm and suspicion and are not at all conducive to creating the atmosphere of trust and confidence needed to bring about a speedy solution to the problem with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>I can also assure Senator Doyle that there is no hidden agenda in taking the Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad prior to its passage through the Dáil.  In fact I do not have any hidden agendas. As I explained the last day, I am a person who believes in the Seanad.  I was a former Member, and intend to remain a former Member, but I also and equally look on the Seanad as an ideal forum in which to introduce legislation to get the comments and contributions of Senators and to open up discussion throughout the country.  When legislation goes through the Dáil it is in better shape following Senators' contribution and public debate.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that even were this Bill to be passed into law, its provisions would not take effect, that is to say, the milk boards would not be dissolved or the new agency established until such time as the Minister should make an order to that effect.  Therefore, the passage of this Bill would not in itself preempt matters in so far as the interests of the staff are concerned.  Neither is there any basis for the Senator's suspicion that the board's ancillary businesses were deliberately run down in anticipation of the board's dissolution.  The fact is that in recent years technological advances have meant that many farmers have been able to obtain the equipment necessary to carry out artificial insemination operations on their cattle, and that is the civil servants' way of saying, do-it-yourself. Unfortunately a lot of such spoil-sport activity is taking place now in rural Ireland and has created its own problem at Enfield.  This, on the one hand, has reduced their costs and decreased their reliance on agencies such as the milk boards to provide this important service and, on the other hand, has led to a reduction in the employment potential of that service sector.</P>
    <P>Senators Doyle and Raferty raised the <Col N="223" /> question of how the agency could decide on what constituted an appropriate price for the producer to have the contract registered.  Senator Doyle went on to speculate whether the proposed new procedure would be acceptable to the EC Commission having regard to their well known prohibition on all forms of price fixing.  In reply I can say that the Bill was drafted in consultation with the Commission. They are completely <i>au fait</i> with its provisions and on the basis that it had the support of all sides of industry, signify their complete approval of its contents.</P>
    <P>The central task of the agency would be to ensure that contracts for the supply of liquid milk will adequately compensate farmers for the costs of all year round production.  In carrying out this task the agency will have regard to all interests and to ensure this producers, processors, distributors, consumers and retailers are represented on the agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery also made a suggestion that retailers should be registered with the agency.  I would remind the Senator that under the Milk and Dairies Acts retailers are already required to be registered with the local authorities and to comply with certain regulations in relation to hygiene.  While the proposed legislation will ensure that an adequate supply of high quality milk is available to the consumer all year round it is primarily a milk supply regulatory measure rather than a public health measure.</P>
    <P>Senators Raftery and Doyle expressed concern about the retail price of milk having regard to the price the farmer receives for the raw product.  Again I can only say that the retail price is an issue which does not come within the ambit of this Bill.  Any excessive mark-ups which may be due to restriction on competition are a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  I understand he has been rather active in this area in recent months.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan suggested that the agency be allowed to engage in activities other than now provided for in the Bill in order to promote the industry and improve the quality of production.  I can <Col N="224" /> only reiterate that the agency will have a role under the Bill in ensuring the quality of milk supply; the other activities he referred to are already well looked after by the commercial concerns in the industry and by the National Dairy Council.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to a large US based firm which is engaged in the provision of livestock breeding services world wide and which at one stage expressed an interest in the boards' ancillary businesses.  I understand that this company was involved in discussions with an Irish co-operative that was also interested in purchasing the boards' businesses. However, the sale of these businesses could not proceed at that stage as the staff issues were not resolved, and I understand the American firm have since proceeded with alternative arrangements elsewhere in Europe which is a pity.  It would certainly have provided a great opportunity for Ireland as a base for international breeding.  Regrettably the negotiations did not prove conclusive and that particular international breeding operation has gone elsewhere.  At present there are no negotiations in progress for the sale of either the boards assets or of their businesses as going concerns.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and Senator McDonald asked how milk imported from Northern Ireland and elsewhere in Europe might be affected by the Bill.  This Bill deals only with milk for liquid consumption that is produced within the State; the importation of drinking milk from other areas in Europe is subject to separate legislation and that legislation is not affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also asked for an estimate of the amount of levy which would be payable by the processor under the provisions of section 7.  The levy which is at present payable to the milk boards is 0.862 pence per gallon and since the agency will have responsibility for supplies of milk for liquid consumption not only in the Dublin and Cork areas but throughout the country, it is hoped that the resultant economies of scale will facilitate a redution in the levy.  It is envisaged that the agency will be self-financing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I express my thanks and appreciation to the Senators.  Today Senators Brendan Ryan, Kiely and McDonald contributed <Col N="226" /> and I appreciate their contributions to this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue a number of people want to speak on and I wish to share my time with a number of people. I will take ten minutes, five minutes for Senator B. Ryan and the last five minutes between Senator Costello and Senator Cassidy who would like to contribute to this debate.  I would appreciate it if I was given notice after nine minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on record that Senator Costello asked me for the time so that he can clarify the position as to how he appeared on television last night, which is a good point at which to start.  I think the RTE management have behaved despicably in their coverage of the budget last night when Members of this House and the other House were tricked into giving interviews, not realising they were giving them to RTE and, on finding that out they contacted RTE, asked that the interviews not be broadcast, but nevertheless management went ahead and broadcast.  I think that is a <Col N="227" /> disgraceful breach of trust, but it is symptomatic of the way this dispute was dealt with from the beginning.</P>
    <P>There is a plethora of news personnel at the front of this House, people with cameras, people from different organisations, news organisations, most of them foreign.  This is a critical time in the democratic process in this country.  I am not making any comments on the internal affairs of Fianna Fáil, but it is a matter of public debate now who the next Taoiseach will be, and there is no denying that fact.  The Taoiseach has today given notice that he is resigning, and there will be a new Taoiseach.  It is of absolute importance that people are fully informed on this matter and the public broadcasting service of RTE is now an essential ingredient to our democratic process.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we have to tune into Sky News, a European organisation, to get nationwide coverage of what is happening.  I recognise the fantastic work being done by the independent stations, but this issue is not being covered by all the independents and, there are large pockets of the country not being fully informed at the moment.  All possible steps must now be taken to restore a full service on the basis of an equitable and comprehensive agreement between unions and management.</P>
    <P>Exploratory Labour Court talks are now in progress.  I understand they began approximately an hour ago.  This is a fine opportunity to resolve the difficulties in RTE.  I call on management to show the same flexibility as the union side and to take a positive line on the crewing issue. I want to put on the record that there has been an attempt to paint the NUJ, in particular, in this instance as some sort of a Luddite organisation who are resisting change and development.  All that has happened in RTE is that technology is moving at such a pace that it has, as in all aspects of life, led to redundancies and a reduction in the number of personnel.</P>
    <P>The function of the union is to find the common line between protecting jobs and employment, ensuring the quality of <Col N="228" /> the service and ensuring that the service in general benefits from the improved technology.  In this situation the NUJ had indicated that they were prepared to accept the reduction in the crewing numbers required by RTE.</P>
    <P>However, the station is making a huge saving and gaining productivity.  This is a fact.  If they lose one person from the camera crew, they are getting two persons doing three persons' work.  That is a huge saving for the station.  It is a gain in productivity.  In any sphere of life, that is a bargaining position and you pay for that.  The trick is to find the common line, the fair line, the centre line, and management have been extraordinarily irresponsible in attempting to find that. I believe the staff are entitled to seek compensation for the extra productivity which will be achieved on their backs.</P>
    <P>The decision to demote and sack staff during the early part of this dispute to my mind bore all the hallmarks of a planned catalyst for the exacerbation of an already difficult situation, and I cannot see it in any other way.  Attempts by management to have programme editors exempted from NUJ directives is really a very thinly disguised attempt to break the power and influence of the NUJ.  The world knows that they can continue providing a service by claiming that the editors of programmes are management and that therefore they should continue to provide the service.  That is simply an attempt to undermine the operation of the union.  It seems to me &mdash; and I dislike saying this &mdash; that there are personnel in RTE at the moment who seem to be working hard to present a macho line, to see who is going to be the most hardline in this situation, in some kind of an attempt to impress people.  I find it most unimpressive and it shows a very poor understanding of what good industrial relations are all about and the importance for people to recognise the needs on both sides of the table and to try to find a consensus.  I do not see that happening at the moment.  In effect what management seem to be trying to do in RTE is to break the power of the union.  They are attempting to neutralise the union, and <Col N="229" /> what they are doing cannot be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Management have to take responsibility for the escalation of the dispute. They keep deferring the talks, they refused to sit down and talk.  A position obtained since before Christmas and suddenly, out of the blue, they chose to escalate it in an attempt to bring the matter to a head without talks.  That is not an acceptable industrial relations process.</P>
    <P>I believe that the democratic process is being poorly served by the lack of comprehensive coverage and reportage. The coverage we are getting at the moment is erratic, unprofessional, makeshift, and unacceptable.  The democratic process requires reportage.  At present, as I see it, the RTE Authority are in breach of their legislative mandate to inform and educate, among other things. The nation is not being informed by RTE at the moment.  The authority have a responsibility in this area.  The chairperson of the Authority should be making the necessary moves to conciliate and to ensure an early resolution of the difficulties there.  The Minister should ensure that all possible steps were taken by the Authority to have management resolve this dispute, which is harmful to democracy and damaging to a major semi-State industry.</P>
    <P>It is no longer acceptable for people to take this sort of hard line, hammer the workers, which seems to be coming from RTE at the moment.  I am not saying all the right is on one side or the other.  I freely concede that in any dispute there are two sides.  Having recognised that fact, people then decide how they move towards each other, listen to each other's point of view, listen to the validity of the cases being made, and then try to find a resolution.  I cannot help thinking &mdash; and I speak as a trade union official &mdash; that there is another agenda in RTE at the moment, and the agenda goes beyond the resolution of this particular dispute, that it is part of a long term attempt by senior management to undermine and usurp the authority of the National Union of Journalists in particular.</P>

      <P>I want to reiterate what I said at the beginning.  The public interest is being poorly served.  At a critically and crucially important time in the political development of this country, with major changes about to take place, with major moves taking place, with candidates putting themselves forward to lead this country, we demand that the public be informed and hear about it.  We demand that there be full, fair, accurate and comprehensive reportage and in order to achieve that, I am asking the Minister to intervene.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of great regret, and it is no disrespect to the Minister of State, that neither the Minister for Labour nor the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications could be here to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>This is a serious problem and it is a pity, to say the least, to see primitive standards of industrial relations being practised by people in RTE who apparently believe they have to flex their macho muscles to make a good impression, presumably on their political masters, to prove that RTE are as tough as anybody else.  Remember that, much as it is maligned by many people, RTE's capacity to produce programmes at low cost is better than virtually every other broadcasting station in Europe.  It produces television programmes per hour at prices that are inconceivable anywhere else.  Those who talk with their magnificently free flowing phrases about RTE being overmanned would want to look at the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However there are more serious and more sinister things.  Last night's television news, for instance, carried a long list of comments on the budget from people one knows would not be sympathetic to a strike.  With the exception of a couple of people who were apparently ambushed under very dubious circumstances, not surprisingly there was no comment from a large section of Irish <Col N="231" /> society &mdash; from the trade union movement and from the large number of bodies that speak on behalf of the poor. Obviously, they were not there because they choose not to be there.</P>
    <P>Now it is a news story in itself that a huge section of Irish society declined to participate in RTE's strike breaking exercise. It should have been part of their news programme.  To leave it out was a deliberate manipulation of the national news service by RTE in the interest of RTE management's handling of this dispute, and that is a fundamental breach of their national duty.  They have an obligation to be impartial about their own problems.  They cannot use the national air waves as a propaganda weapon in their own attempt to break the power of two trade unions.  That is very serious and very wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications have a particularly serious duty to ensure that RTE do not continue to use their own broadcasting service, our broadcasting service, because that service does not belong to RTE management, it belongs to us, and we are entitled to the truth about RTE as we are entitled to the truth about anything else.</P>
    <P>The second point is the extraordinary precedent that is being established by RTE, where people who carry out the instructions of their trade unions according to the well established practices are being demoted by senior management in RTE &mdash; not because they broke any rules but because they carried out the ordinary rules of a trade unionist, which is that you do not do other people's work when they are on strike or when they are locked out.  That is well established and no half responsible employer under any circumstances would expect people to do otherwise.  RTE have attempted or purported to demote two people because they refused to carry out instructions to break the strike.  Members of a union who are on strike were instructed to break that strike, they refused, quite properly, and RTE purported to destroy them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> I wonder does anybody in the Government or anybody in RTE management realise what damage they are doing?  How long will it take to heal the wounds? Ultimately, they will have to persuade people to work, because the only way you can get good people to work well is by persuasion.  You cannot coerce them; you cannot force them.  You can make them do a limited amount, but if you want to get the maximum creativity, imagination and productivity out of people, you do it by persuasion.  Given the bitterness that will now exist, even the resentment that will exist, a whole layer of management in RTE will have to spend the next year or two simply winning back the goodwill they have so irresponsibly sacrificed in creating what is effectively a lock-out.  They apparently wanted a row.  They have got their row and the ultimate, final, consequences of it will be a disastrous deterioration in the spirit, the atmosphere and working relationships between people in RTE. They and the Government which allowed this strike to continue should be ashamed of themselves.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for allowing me four minutes.  I have been very concerned about this dispute in RTE and particularly about the manner in which industrial relations have been conducted. It is not proper industrial relations to sack or demote people because they refuse to break a strike. Particularly in RTE, which should be an example of good communications, we would have expected that there would have been good industrial relations and that they would be giving us an example of how to conduct those relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even worse, I must refer to my own experience last night as a Senator leaving Leinster House after the budget.  I came out with a couple of guests and met the only team on the premises at the time.  It was a three person team, not a two person team, so I did not expect it to be an RTE camera team.  The person who came over to me spoke with an English accent and asked me if I would do an interview &mdash; I pesumed straight away that it was Sky <Col N="233" /> News who had interviewed me this time last week when the House was sitting.  I did an interview on the budget.  As I was going out the gate it occurred to me to check.  I came back and asked the team where they were from and they informed me that they were from &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;.  At that I said, &ldquo;There is an industrial dispute on and I cannot allow the interview to be used&rdquo;.  They agreed that it would not be used but subsequently I heard it had been used on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; against my expressed wish and against an agreement we had entered into.  I wrote to the Director General this morning and I would like to put that letter on the record.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms at the editorial decision to transmit an interview with me on the Budget on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on Wednesday, 29 January. When I discovered that the three man camera team was from RTE I asked that the interview not be transmitted. They informed me that they would not use the material and I thanked them. Later that night I was informed that the material had been used.  As Labour Party Senator and Trade Unionist I am appalled at your breach of trust.  I hereby request an explanation and an apology.</P>
    <P>I consider that behaviour was immoral, a nasty form of activity from a public service station.  I believe that management deliberately provided a team, one that masqueraded as a different team from what it really was, and that in itself was a deliberate attempt to induce Members of this House and the other House to break a strike under false pretences. That is the most despicable behaviour I have seen in a long time and it is not something I would have expected from a public service medium, a communications medium, that we in this House have been defending over the years.  We can all remember the long and heated debates we had there.  Yet management treat Members of the <Col N="234" /> Oireachtas in this fashion.  I think it must go out in the strongest words that we protest against it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think there is an onus on management, on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and on the Government to see that we do not have this Thatcherite behaviour from RTE, whose operations are funded from public money.  That is what is causing this dispute to continue for such a length of time.  They should urgently resolve this dispute.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Senator O'Toole for giving me time to speak on this matter.  First, I want to congratulate your good self, a Chathaoirligh, on being elected to the Chair and look forward to working with you over the coming years.</P>
      <P>As spokesperson for the Government, I welcome the talks taking place now in the Labour Court in relation to this dispute.  I hope that the programmes will be back on the air within a couple of days. Any strike is an unfortunate occurence in any industry and, very often there are no winners.  On the occasion, as previous speakers said, it is an opportunity lost of capturing an historic occasion which is taking place here at the present time.  In the public interest I congratulate the local radio stations who over the past week rose to the occasion of informing the public by extending their news bulletins and increasing their staff to cover the various events, such as the budget and now the retirement of our Taoiseach and the forthcoming appointment of our new Taoiseach.  These are matters of great public interest.  They positively concern the Government party, the largest political party in the country, over the last number of years.  Naturally enough, they are extremely important from a media point of view.  I do not want to go into the pros and cons of the strike, but that they are back in the Labour Court and talking is indeed progress.  I look forward to a resumption of work in the very immediate future.</P>

    <P>This dispute concerns operational practices and manning levels of camera crews who are members of SIPTU.  The NUJ became involved when two of its members were suspended for refusing to co-operate with the new arrangements. The problem which gave rise to the dispute was the compensation to be paid to those affected by the introduction of the new system.  In a recommendation in November the Labour Court recommended that the parties enter discussions on this item and, in the absence of agreement being reached, the court said it would be prepared to have a further hearing of that specific point.  The Labour <Col N="236" /> Court has invited the parties to discussions and they are in progress as I speak. The Minister for Labour has already welcomed the discussions.  Again, on his behalf, I ask both sides to approach the talks in a spirit of co-operation and goodwill so that a solution can be found which will lead to a speedy resumption of services.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that with these talks under way it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this time.  I can assure the Senators that I will immediately convey to the Minister for Labour the views expressed by the Senators who took part in the debate.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 February 1992.</P>
