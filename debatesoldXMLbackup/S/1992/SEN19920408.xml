      <P>I have notice from Senator Ó Cuív that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of Health to make resources available to the Western Health Board to enable them to provide geriatric care in homes that are nearer to the families of the patients.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make resources available to the Midland Health Board to enable them to provide additional bed spaces for long <Col N="314" /> stay patients at St. Peter's Hospital, Castlepollard, County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that the proposed closure of the Irish Productivity Centre on the 30 April is averted and that adequate support is granted to the centre to continue its successful co-operation between the social partners and Government to improve productivity in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Cuív and Cassidy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ó Cuív's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Cassidy may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Neville as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have been in communication with them, the Whips will understand the position we find ourselves in today.  We are taking item 1 &mdash; the establishment of an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment &mdash; until 6 p.m., we will have a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take item 50 &mdash; Private Members' Business, the Fine Gael motion on Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Order of Business is not agreed.  I do not understand and the Leader has not indicated why item No. 1 has suddenly appeared on the Order Paper today without prior notice.  If it was going to be taken, that should have been known last week.  I think it is a very bad idea that the Order of Business should be changed at short notice.  The Order of Business was ordered <Col N="315" /> and agreed last week, so we will be opposing the Order of Business today.</P>
      <P>I also want to ask the Leader of the House if he could make time available next week either for statements or for a debate on the present controversy arising over the Mastricht Treaty and the proposed referendum.  He said in the past that he would try to facilitate the House with a debate on this subject before the end of the session.</P>
      <P>Could I also use this opportunity to say to Dr. Joe Hendron in West Belfast that, in spite of what the chairman of Bord na Gaeilge said, a vote for him is not a vote for British imperialism?  As a democrat I think all in this House hope he will be successful tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Picking up on the same topic, since 1 January we have buried 39 people in the North of Ireland and this House still has not discussed the North. I ask the Leader to accept the need for an urgent debate on the killing, assassination, murder and bombing there.  It is important, particularly in the light of Senator Manning's last comments, that we would all have the opportunity to express our views in this matter.  I would ask that a debate on Northern Ireland be taken as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Before we conclude this session I feel we are entitled to ask for and receive from the Leader an outline of the programme of legislation which he intends initiating in this House over the next period of weeks.  It is not good enough that we should be ordering our business on a week to week basis.  Senator Manning raised the question of how quickly we put today's Order of Business together without discussion last week. On the breakdown of the figures, clearly one of the four places reserved for Senators on the Joint Committee would be for an Independent Senator.  I would like to make that absolutely clear.  We accept that the Leader is under pressure to get the Order of Business correct for today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions over the last few months the case of Nicky Kelly has <Col N="316" /> been raised by various Members on this and on the Labour benches.  It is important that the views of Members individually be conveyed to Government in such a way as would allow them to make the necessary approach to the President for a presidential pardon in this case.  This is not a party matter; it is a matter where views are shared on both sides of the House, and I would like to see a decision being arrived at.</P>
    <P>It was with some regret I read in yesterday's papers of how slow we are on social issues in European matters &mdash; and I am not referring to current debates.  We are the only member state not to have signed the convention on discrimination against travellers and gypsies.  This is the kind of thing that brings us into disrepute. I would ask the Leader either to have a Minister come to this House to explain the reason for this or to allow a full debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the request to have a debate on the various matters arising from the Supreme Court decision.  When can we expect legislation to be introduced which will put the framework together for the various referenda which we have been promised?  In particular, may I express my concern that the Maastricht referendum will not turn into a coded form of support or opposition to abortion for various elements in this country?  Can I further hope that the Taoiseach will keep his nerve and resist some of the pressures that we can expect to be exerted on him, and indeed on all politicians, over the coming weeks?</P>
      <P>Would it be possible, as a matter of some urgency, to have the Leader reconsider his attitude to the debate on banking? I think it is an urgent necessity that we should have a debate on banking.  It seems to me as if the major banks have turned and have begun to savage their staffs after a prolonged period of cleaning out their customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first comment on what the Leader of Fine Gael has said in relation to the chairman of Bord na <Col N="317" /> Ghaeilge to the extent that the chairman is an arm of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This individual could be seen as supporting the ballot box on the one hand and the armalite on the other and it is important for this side of the House that we should be seen to condemn such statements.  Would the Leader allow a debate in this House on the common contract as it applies to consultants? I raise this issue in the knowledge that private practice has been processed through a public hospital in Cork city, that payment has been made to consultants operating within that hospital and that those consultants did not see fit to inform the management of that hospital, or indeed the health board.  I know that you, Sir, as a member of the health board must be quite concerned that individuals such as this will not have the self-financing element that is so necessary in public hospitals.  I ask the Leader to consider this particular request favourably.  Could I also, a Chathaoirligh, bring us back to Senator Upton's point on the banks?</P>

      <P>Although we are in the middle of a bank strike, it is opportune and appropriate that we discuss the Irish banking system and how banking groups treated their staff with intimidation leading up to this strike.  I wish the present Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, every success in his negotiations this afternoon and hope in the interests of <Col N="318" /> our economy that we will reach a quick solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader have any more information for me on the ruling on homosexuality?  It is becoming more urgent because I received information that other parties intend to investigate the possibility of seeking action under Article 8 of the Convention.  If that happens I will have to go ahead with reentering the case.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader convey, if possible, to their Majesties of Sweden that this House has on three occasions very positively debated the state of one of their great countrymen, Raoul Wallenberg?</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the North.  Everybody in the House responded positively to what Senator O'Keeffe said about the intervention of Mr. Mac Aonghusa who, writing as Gulliver in one of the Sunday newspapers, engaged in felon setting when he said the peace train was financed by the British Army.  That is regrettable and it is also regrettable that in the week after Glór na Gael received its funding, he managed to smear Irish language enthusiasts in the North as IRA fellow travellers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I will immediately desist.  I would like to ask the Leader if he would consider providing time for a debate on the subject of AIDS. He will recall that the first Oireachtas debate on this subject was held in this House.  This is a growing problem and one on which this House could make an important contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Upton's and Senator O'Keeffe's request for a debate on the banks.  The Leader may or may not indicate to us this afternoon when he proposes to allow this debate to take place.  In situations such as this the rules of the House can prove frustrating even though certain improvements are on their way.  Would the Leader of the House establish information on the current practice of bank managers and officials collecting lodgements from business premises and transporting them to the banks?  There is serious doubt as to security and cover for the transportation of these funds.</P>

      <P>I support those who called for a debate on the banks.  As a small business person I have suffered for many years because of the various changes that have taken place in bank policy. As a former member of the IBOA, I do not think we should engage in bank bashing or simplistic arguments about who is right or wrong.  The IBOA are just as wrong in this dispute as the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to see a report yesterday that the economy is improving, that retail sales in January were up by 5.6 per cent on the same period last year and that in December they were up by .4 per cent on the previous December.  That is an indication that the economy is on the move and VAT returns bear that out over the past months.  However, that report indicated that currently the motor trade is suffering loss of business; although retail sales are up there was a 23 per cent drop in motor vehicle sales in January which has major implications for employment and VAT.</P>

      <P>A question, please, Senator Lanigan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on what has been happening in the motor trade over the past number of years to see if anything can be done by Government to alleviate the problems all of us are being confronted with.  Benefit in kind is an inhibiting factor and motor company representatives are being disadvantaged by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to send a message of congratulations to Yasser Arafat, the President of the Palestinians on surviving a horrific crash.  Coming up to Easter we wish him and the people involved in negotiations over the next few days success in resolving the horrific problems of that area where the three major religions of the world began. Christians, Jews and Muslims in that area need peace&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Maastricht Treaty.  It <Col N="321" /> is clear that there is public misunderstanding about what Maastricht means and it is equally clear from the words of a spokesman for a certain organisation that calls itself pro-life &mdash; we are all pro-life &mdash; that it intends to use the Maastricht referendum as a vote on abortion. Unless we clear the air here and in the other House, one cannot blame the people for being misinformed about the situation.</P>
      <P>Second, I would like to raise an issue which deserves urgent debate.  There is a reported increase in violent sexual crimes against women and children.  It is becoming appallingly evident now that this is happening all too often.  We should discuss the matter and let the people know we are very concerned about what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know talk about the banks is irrelevant but since my colleagues have being doing it let me comment briefly.  Senator Lanigan is perfectly entitled to express whatever opinion he wants about the IBOA and I dissociate myself from any suggestions that that was disgraceful.  Ten years ago I was in favour of nationalising the banks as I still am against all received wisdom.  It was then regarded as an eccentric opinion and I am now more than ever convinced that I was right.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gcaint amaideach a dhein Ceannaire Bhord na Gaeilge i dtaobh polaitíocht iarthar Bhéal Feirste, ní raibh sé ag labhairt thar ceann formhór Gaeilgeoirí na hÉireann.</P>
      <P>With respect to Item No. 45 on the Order Paper which relates to the Nicky Kelly issue, can I ask the Leader to convey to the Government the concern of a number of Senators at the suggestion which seems to have some basis that strong vested interests in Government Departments and elsewhere are delaying justice for Nicky Kelly.  That is a matter of great public concern.  I fail to understand the contrary attitude of Fine Gael to the proposed Joint Committee on Employment.  As that is the gravest crisis facing us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual to interrupt people like that.  I want to point out in the general context that Fine Gael contrariness on this issue is inexplicable. While I do not like seeing the Order of Business changed, and over the years I have strongly objected to this, the gravest national issue should take priority over all other considerations.  I am totally in favour of making this matter number one on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Industry and Commerce our concern about the imminent closure of the Irish Productivity Centre.  I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach had to rule the way he <Col N="323" /> did, but this unique experiment in co-operation between workers, employers and Government should not go out of existence because the Government have savagely reduced funding.  This centre should not be closed without a proper debate because this matter is of great concern to many of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the Fine Gael Party to understand why we are here today with a change on the Order of Business which many Senators have spoken on and which constitutes the main issue of the moment.  This motion was dealt with in the Dáil yesterday, and the Government hope it will be passed here today so that it may be dealt with in the Dáil tomorrow.  I am not suggesting that an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment is going to solve the unemployment problem but at least it is an effort to bring together all those with ideas that might help alleviate unemployment. I ask him to appreciate the position I found myself in yesterday given this development; it is the first time this has happened.  Since my appointment I have endeavoured to ensure that business is well known not just for the week in hand but for weeks ahead.  It is hoped that the motion will be passed here today by 6 p.m., and passed in the Dáil tomorrow as an order so that this committee can be established during the Easter recess and will be up and running afterwards.</P>
      <P>I understand that the White Paper on Maastricht will be with us within the next couple of weeks.  I understand what Senator Raftery said.  It is vitally important that Members of both Houses ensure that the public understand the implications of Maastricht.  I heard an interview on it at lunchtime today.  Each of us has a duty to inform the public of the importance of passing the Maastricht Protocol and I hope this House will play its part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to calls for a debate on Maastricht I can arrange that, whether the topic is the White Paper, the wording of referenda or otherwise; all will be <Col N="324" /> accommodated.  Between now and soon after Easter we can do that; we are sitting next week.  Somebody suggested that the Taoiseach is holding his nerve.  I have no doubt after listening to the Taoiseach today that he has a clear idea how this issue should be handled in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I find it regrettable that statements were made relating to an election in west Belfast.  I have the height of respect for Mr. Joe Hendron and I will say no more than that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned one problem which is not relevant to the Order of Business but which all of us deal with daily; that is, the travellers' problem.  I would welcome a debate in this House on travellers' because no matter who we represent we all deal with travellers' problems.  It is a national problem and maybe this House should afford itself the opportunity to discuss that issue.  I note a report in the newspaper related to Senator O'Tooles organisation, INTO, that is relevant to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>This House has suggested over the last couple of months that we should debate the banking system.  I hope that will happen but I would prefer it to happen after labour relations problems have been resolved.  I take on board several Senators' good wishes to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, in his deliberations with the various outside bodies that will, I hope, bring the two bodies involved in the banks dispute together. It is a dispute this country cannot afford.</P>

    <P>I wrote to the Minister for Justice last week in relation to Senator Norris' question about the EC ruling on the decriminalising of homosexuality and as <Col N="325" /> soon as I have a reply I will forward it to him.  Senator Norris also asked for a debate on AIDS.  The Minister for Health has made several statements and holds fairly strong views on the matter.  This House would be an ideal place to have that debate.</P>
    <P>On the Nicky Kelly case, I mentioned last week that the Attorney General has not yet forwarded his report to Government. That is the latest position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On this issue, Senator Murphy characterised the attitude of my party as contrary; Fine Gael are probably the only group who have not been contrary on this issue.  At the outset, the original idea for what was called a jobs forum came from the Leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton.  That idea was not acceptable to the last Leader of Fianna Fáil who saw no useful purpose in such a forum, but the idea was born out of the enormous concern which all responsible persons feel about the provision of jobs for 300,000 unemployed people on an ever-lengthening list.  It was in the course of looking at ways to provide new jobs that Deputy Bruton made the proposal for a jobs forum and what he proposed went a great deal further than anything which has come from the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Bruton had in mind was something along the same lines as the New Ireland Forum.  I was a privileged member of the New Ireland Forum where various groups were invited to put their point of view and the community was asked to redefine its role as a prelude to action on the question of Northern Ireland.  It was intended that the jobs forum would include members of Government and political party leaders. At the New Ireland Forum leaders of the main parties were present daily; the issue was estimated to be so vital that it was necessary to include leaders of the main parties so that they would have the responsibility of leading, directing and taking decisions.  It may not have worked out that way but that was the intention. After the present Taoiseach was elected he looked favourably in the early stages <Col N="330" /> at the idea of a jobs forum along the lines proposed by Deputy Bruton which enjoyed widespread support from those most directly concerned, the trade unions and the unemployed.  It captured the imagination of many as an approach which certainly would not resolve the problem but which would make a real contribution to its mitigation.</P>
    <P>The Government then put forward proposals for a joint parliamentary committee which would not include the leaders of any political parties, or Ministers but which would merely be a back-bench committee.  That was the first proposal.  At this stage, Fine Gael took the view that this committee would amount to nothing more than another talking shop with no real powers, a committee which, if the precedent set by other Oireachtas committees was observed, would have its reports rarely, if ever, debated by either House.  When did we last debate a report by any of the committees?  We are two and a half years behind on the reports of the European Community committee.  We have never to my knowledge debated any of the reports from the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies or from the other committees which act on our behalf and which comprise Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Committees are not taken seriously in the Houses of the Oireachtas; we do not have a developed committee system.  We, therefore, said, that this committee would not make any difference.  There are 67 or 87 different reports &mdash; the latest being the Culliton report &mdash; on what is wrong with the Irish economy, on the things that need to be done if we are to generate more jobs.  We felt strongly that, unless there was direct ministerial input to the committee, it was unlikely to be more than a worthy talking shop which captured headlines perhaps but which did not have the capacity to exert pressure for the creation of jobs.  Moreover, if jobs are to be created, a number of unpopular decisions must be taken.</P>
    <P>Anybody who reads the Culliton report will see that virtually every major proposal carries a significant downside, a downside which probably no party is <Col N="331" /> prepared to accept on its own.  Our strong feeling was that a prestigious committee could take some of those unpopular decisions.  That committee would be more than a talking shop and we made our point of view known with sincerity. We are not against committees or against an extension of the committee system which we have often said is the way to develop this Parliament.  We contend, however, that this proposed committee is not the way to resolve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Later there was a breach of faith on the part of the Government Whip when he entered into negotiations with the Chief Whip of the Labour Party ignoring Fine Gael and what was then The Workers' Party.  Discussions took place and agreement was reached between the Labour Party &mdash; I will leave them to speak for themselves on this matter &mdash; and Fianna Fáil.  I do not impute the good faith of the Labour Party but the breach of faith on the part of the Government Whip with the Whip of the Fine Gael party was not conducive to creating trust in any further negotiations.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael accepted the changes made there and insisted that there be ministerial involvement in this committee. By this time Fine Gael had backed off on every request or demand save the demand for ministerial involvement.  Our demand was not accepted for spurious reasons; ministerial involvement is not unconstitutional; Ministers were members of other committees in the 1970s and at other times.  It is a matter of Standing Orders which can be changed; there is no constitutional bar as the Taoiseach seemed to suggest in the Dáil recently against this sort of thing.  Fine Gael reiterated that we want voluntary participation of Ministers in this committee and even that was not accepted.</P>
    <P>We are not being contrary, Senator Murphy.  We have backed down from our original proposals which would have produced a proper jobs forum to one demand for voluntary participation by Ministers and even that is not acceptable to the Taoiseach and to the Government. <Col N="332" /> I do not believe that Senator Murphy after listening to the recitation of events here, can say that it is we who are unyielding. We have not been unaccommodating. We have backed down on all our demands to ensure that a committee will come into existence.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with this proposal for a committee which will not make any significant difference.  It will not have political strength.  It will be chaired by a backbencher who will not carry the required weight to chair this committee effectively.  There will be no involvement by party leaders or by Ministers.  The committee will merely report back to the Dáil and Seanad on a couple of occasions each year where the matter will be debated again with no imperative to action.</P>
    <P>That is why Fine Gael cannot support the establishment of this committee.  I hope it does well but I do not believe it will.  The wrong course is being taken. Some accommodation, imagination and a bit of give by the Government at a few crucial stages could have saved use from the impasse in which this side of the House now finds itself.  It is for those reasons we will not be supporting the establishment of this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, to the House.  It is the first opportunity I have had of congratulating him on his appointment and I wish him well in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I second the important motion proposed by Senator Wright.  We all recognise that we are in the throes of the gravest unemployment situation Ireland has ever experienced.  That is not because we have been neglectful or unsuccessful in creating jobs in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has changed drastically over the last number of years on account especially of the huge number of people now becoming available for work.  We have a young population and there has been a virtual elimination of emigration; many immigrants are, in fact, returning. Unemployment is the most serious problem we face at the moment and a radical approach is needed to tackle it.  The <Col N="333" /> Government have been very generous in their approach and has made every effort to incorporate the views of the other parties in setting up this committee.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator Manning on the reasons he gave for Fine Gael's non-participation in this jobs forum; some of which were highly questionable.  There is provision for participation by the social partners in the work of the sub-committees and for all the facilities and financial assistance to undertake research and other related activities.  This is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive study of how the problem of unemployment can be tackled.  It gives representatives of both Houses an opportunity to become directly involved in finding those solutions and offers access of other expert bodies in that area who would have hands-on knowledge of how to deal with unemployment.  In view of the very serious situation and given that this committee will have such important functions, I am extremely disappointed that the Fine Gael Party have decided not to participate.  I cannot understand it, particularly as Fine Gael have long advocated the establishment of such a body.  The fact that Ministers would not appear before the committee is not a valid excuse for non-participation, given that all reports of the committee will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the motion before us states:</P>
    <P>That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make shall, on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith, whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report, together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>That provides an opportunity for ministerial involvement.  Considering we have a jobs crisis, no member of this House would suggest that any report by this Joint Committee would be shelved. Everyone involved in this committee would ensure that when a report of the <Col N="334" /> committee was available it would be debated, in the first instance, in both Houses of the Oireachtas where the relevant Ministers would have to account for their stewardship in their own area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have adopted a dog in the manger approach, and I hope it will be seen as such by the general public.  This is too serious a problem to be playing silly party politics.  I would appeal even now, at this late stage, to the Fine Gael Party to change their minds in the interest of the many unemployed people who are looking to politicians for a solution to their present difficulties.  Ministers are responsible to the Oireachtas when the reports are prepared during the year, the relevant Ministers will have an opportunity to give their side of the argument in relation to any findings of the committee.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's assertion that previous committees included Ministers is just a red herring.  The committees they mentioned were informal and were not set up by resolution of the Oireachtas.  Even if Fine Gael have reservations about this committee, surely they should consider giving it a chance to work on a trial basis. If what they are suggesting proved to be correct, they can make all the fuss they like subsequently.  Surely an effort of this nature is entitled to a trial period.  There is no justification for walking away from this situation.  I am at a loss to understand what they are afraid of.  Could they be worried that this might be a success?  It is difficult for me, and even for Fine Gael, to explain their action otherwise.</P>
    <P>Other agencies are involved in trying to solve the problem of unemployment. There is the task force on unemployment; Senator Manning mentioned the Culliton report, a special ministerial committee has been set up under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach to look at the Culliton report; there are the EC assisted employment and training schemes; the task force on tourism, which puts special emphasis on the creation of employment and there is the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Substantial tax reforms have taken place with the emphasis on establishing an atmosphere in which <Col N="335" /> employment would be created.  We now have this committee involving Members of the Oireachtas which could be extremely beneficial.  Even looking at this committee from its worst aspect, no one can say it could do any damage.</P>
    <P>What are Fine Gael afraid of?  I appeal, in all sincerity, to the Fine Gael to reconsider, to give this committee a trial to see how it operates.  I think it has potential for enormous success.  Everybody even in Fine Gael, recognises the difficulties we have in relation to unemployed.  Fine Gael is the party which advocated such a committee for so long and now that it has been set up, they just walk away from it. I do not know how a party that is serious about the unemployment crisis can walk away from this committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome this committee.  As I said, it has tremendous potential and I look forward to it working with all the interested parties at sub-committee level. I wish the chairperson and the committee every success in their deliberations.  I know it will be a success.  Somewhere down the line, I feel Fine Gael will reconsider their position and will ask to join the committee at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be seen as someone who is simply here to back up Senator McKenna'a arguments. However, as an Independent, I share his sense of mystification about the Fine Gael attitude.  I am glad I stimulated Senator Manning into a spirited defence of their position but it was not convincing for me.  Frankly, I think it is hair splitting. Fine Gael can legitimately be accused of fiddling while Rome burns.  It is interesting that although not agreeing to the Order of Business, they stopped short at pressing their difference to a division. Obviously, they did not want to face the odium that would inevitably be associated with that.  That is highly significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The analogies with the New Ireland Forum are misleading.  The New Ireland Forum was a free-floating body.  It may have been a fairer representative of nationalist opinion, but, in the end, it was not charged with a responsibility to <Col N="336" /> Government.  It may be argued that in a roundabout way, the New Ireland Forum contributed to Anglo-lrish Agreement, but there is no real parallel between the New Ireland Forum and what is proposed here.  The employment question is of a different order entirely.  I would have thought there was sufficient flexibility in the provisions of the motion to accommodate virtually everything they are talking about.  Under sections 2 and 3 of this motion, interests outside this House can be represented.  Section 3 says that &ldquo;persons who are representatives from interested bodies&rdquo; can assist the sub-committee. There is nothing to stop this proposed Joint Committee on Employment from calling on anybody who has any expertise in the matter.</P>
    <P>To persist in demanding ministerial participation is quite perverse because in the nature of things, Ministers are part of the Government, the buck ultimately stops there, they cannot be at once responsible for Executive action and be fully participating in and subordinate to a Joint Committee.  None of those points struck me as convincing.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning said he fears that the Joint Committee will be another talking shop; there is substance in that but the committee he proposes would equally be a talking shop because talking about unemployment will not solve the problem, but rather the strong and unpopular measures that are called for in the Culliton report.  This country has lost control and sovereignty over its economy. The decisions necessary to ensure reasonable employment here no longer rest with this country; they have been alienated to Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty was mentioned here and how important it is that we get other issues out of the way.  The unspoken implication was that we must endorse the Maastricht Treaty, as if this were the absolute commanding orthodoxy.  There is a strong case to be made not to endorse the Maastricht Treaty for many reasons but chief among them is that there is no evidence that the European Community in any way helps our unemployment problem &mdash; in fact the reverse &mdash; and <Col N="337" /> there is every evidence that Maastricht and European Union will continue the concentration of wealth at the centre and the continuing neglect of the periphery. It may be unfashionable to say so, but this country can solve its economic problems only by being in command of this country at economic level.  If that means retaining the dimension of sovereignty we have left, then I advocate that and I will advocate it during the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The motion provides for representation by four Members of Seanad Éireann.  I do not know how this will break down &mdash; perhaps there will be two from the Government side and one and one on this side &mdash; but there should be little problem about the representatives on this side now because as Fine Gael are not interested, I do not think we will have any argument about representation of the remaining Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  It is the first time I have met him in this House since he took office.  I wish him every success in his new job.</P>
      <P>I welcome this forum because unemployment is a national problem and a serious one.  Without employment we have nothing because the few people who are working provide the wherewithal to keep the social services going.  The more people we have in employment the more money will be generated and the happier people will be.  I believe in this Oireachtas Joint Committee.  I am sad that Fine Gael will not take part in it because they would have made a worthwhile contribution which would have been applauded.  However, that is their choice.  I would like to congratulate Labour and the other parties who are prepared to work in the Committee.</P>
      <P>There are opportunities for creating employment.  I have created jobs in my village by encouraging people to get involved.  I do not believe a fairy godmother will appear and create jobs.  We have the brains, ability, technology and know-how but we do not get together to tap that potential that is out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the sub-committees <Col N="338" /> will have power.  That is important.  It is important also that they can have outside expertise to support them.  It may be possible to get people who are successful in business onto the sub-committee and to have the benefit of their expertise and views.  It is also important that we have an opportunity to debate the Joint Committee reports in this House.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is demoralising.  There was terrible unemployment in the fifties but when things started to improve in the sixties, people began to work and there was a new outlook on life.  Many people are unemployable.  Any young person who went to England in the fifties and got a job straightaway made good, but if they adopted the dole mentality, failed to get a job in the first three or four weeks and started drinking, they were lost.  I would like to see our young people coming out of school finding work.</P>
    <P>Last week we opened a new laboratory in Sligo.  It was a pleasure to meet so many graduates of the Sligo regional college and other regional colleges working in that high-tech laboratory.  We must get young people to work before they get hooked on unemployment.  Once they are on the dole they are on the road to disaster.  There is nothing as important in society as young people.  People in my age group can only give advice.  When I tried to get employment for my area the IDA would not listen to me.  I built an advance factory with my own money and today we have 200 people directly employed, and the spin-off effect must provide another 200 jobs.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Leyden, opened a small factory there which now employs four people, with potential to expand.</P>
    <P>I know from experience this can be done; every village and town has the potential to do it.  We are not putting our resources together.  The IDA and other bodies seem to be hamstrung by rules and regulations.  This committee will get to grips with such handicaps.</P>
    <P>We could get more small specialist industries.  There is a huge market on the Continent for products which we could make and sell.  I do not think our selling team are as active or as energetic as they <Col N="339" /> should be, but they are probably doing their best.  For the first time the issue has been taken out of the political arena and we have realised that it is a national problem. If the committee deals with the problem in a sincere and dedicated manner it will be a huge success.  No points will be scored.  People will work for the very highest motives, to tap our resources.  At the moment people leave this country and go to work elsewhere. If we can create employment we can keep them here.</P>
    <P>I know we will get co-operation from the unions.  Some years ago I did not agree with them, but more recently they are being realistic.  We no longer see so many wildcat strikes.  I would appeal to workforces in new industries to be tolerant and not look for everything to be absolutely perfect in the first year of existence. Any new industry starting up will have teething troubles.  They need to be given time to sort those things out.</P>
    <P>I would like those who are employed to be more tolerant also.  Those involved in the present strike are all highly intelligent people.  They should sit around the table and try to resolve the problems.  I congratulate the Minister for Labour on doing his best to resolve it.  I hope commonsense will prevail and that the dispute will be resolved.  If this strike goes on it will create more unemployment as it may bring small businesses down.  No one wants to see that happen in the wake of a strike.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report.  I am delighted that there will be four Senators from this House on the committee.  I give it my blessing and support and I sincerely hope it will solve what is a serious national problem at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new post.  This is the first time I have seen him here. The unemployment problem is the worst ever; it is rapidly approaching 300,000 and we have been assured that it is going to get worse.  The forum, at worst, is an attempt to come to grips with the <Col N="340" /> problem, to analyse it, to assess the various options for employment creation and to analyse the implications of the various options.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the forum will not be a panacea which will provide an instant or an easy solution to unemployment. The problem of unemployment is profound and no instant solution could deal with it.  However, the forum will clarify the issues.  It will make the choices clear and will help us to understand what needs to be done.  It will also help us, perhaps, to move in the direction of doing what needs to be done. There are no easy solutions.  Unemployment is the result of a series of forces and attitudes.  These attitudes and interests will not be easily changed.  In order to change them unpleasant and unpopular decisions will have to be made.  More than that, some very important and powerful people in this country will need to be confronted, and faced down.  Important and powerful people are going to lose out if a solution is provided to the unemployment problem. Such people will not easily give way.  That is why things are the way they are.  They are a result of a whole series of forces. This is the end product.  The confrontation of these forces will be very difficult, awkward and ugly from a political point of view.  Significant short term sacrifices must be made so that we may be able to reap a long term benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of unemployment is primarily a problem for the Government. Inevitably it will make its way back to the Government's door.  In the last analysis it is the Government, who will have to face up to the question of making the unpopular decisions which are necessary. Unless the Government have the capacity to make those unpopular decisions we can expect that the problem of unemployment will continue.  It will worsen, fester and create enormous problems unless we are prepared to face up to the sacrifices which need to be made in the short term.  The forum will define the decisions which need to be taken and provide an outline of the implications of those decisions.  Further, the <i>status quo</i><Col N="341" /> in relation to unemployment is not an option, because in essence it means things get worse.  We cannot allow this problem to deteriorate to any significant further degree because if that happens then we will see very unpleasant and very dangerous political consequences.</P>
    <P>The forum may also help to clarify some minor points, such as questions in relation to the cost of creating a job.  If we are to believe the data which appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> recently, enormous sums of money are necessary to create a job, in direct cost and also in indirect costs.  It is not possible to sustain such a situation.  Important changes will be necessary in some of the key agencies. They will have to alter the way they operate. That in turn will change the power structure in some of these agencies and the manner in which they relate to other agencies, to Government, to the public and so on.  Some of these organisations will resist any moves to change them.</P>
    <P>However, the people are vigorously looking for a solution.  They are turning to politicians.  Any politician who meets the public to any extent knows only too well that unemployment is the main concern. Invariably you are asked what are you going to do about the unemployment problem, what solutions you are proposing. I believe we can no longer afford to ignore this problem.</P>
    <P>This forum is worthy of being given a fair trial.  For that reason the Labour Party will become involved in it in the hope and in the belief that we can clarify the issues and begin to make some movement towards finding a solution to this absolutely dreadful problem.</P>

      <P>Once again I have great pleasure in welcoming Minister Ahern to the House and again I wish him well in his new appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcome the setting up of this committee.  It is quite evident that unemployment is at the top of the Government's agenda, as indeed it is for both sides of the Oireachtas.  I am very disappointed that in spite of the best efforts of the Government to achieve all-party consensus on this committee, the <Col N="342" /> Fine Gael Party alone have not seen fit to co-operate.  I sincerly hope they will reconsider their decision, because in a matter as crucial as this we urgently need to have the collective wisdom of all sides involved.  I am sure there are Fine Gael Deputies and Senators whose contributions would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>As I see it, their objection seems to be that Ministers may not be members.  This is not intended to be a Star Chamber to which Ministers may be called to defend themselves.  The cause of the present job situation is not something which may be laid at the door of any individual Minister, past or present.  What we are engaged in is a sincere effort to come up with at least some answers to some very complex problems, many of them brought about by the development in recent years of a technology in industry which is designed to manufacture goods with the least possible input of human employment.  This is the economic reality which surrounds us and we must obviously look at other avenues to be explored with a view to employing as many people as possible in a wide variety of areas and on a productive and permanent basis.</P>
    <P>I am impressed with the manner in which the committee are to be set up and the way they will operate.  They will have the power to send for and engage the services of persons who have specialised or technical knowledge to assist them on any of their sub-committees.  I sincerely hope that this will not be confined to a group of experts based in Dublin.  There are many unemployment blackspots throughout the country.  Indeed, one of them is my own home town of Tralee. Many of these areas have problems which are peculiar to their particular circumstances. For instance, these could be problems caused by geographical location with, perhaps, poor infrastructure locally and lack of proper transport facilities to the rest of the country, or problems with regard to the location of education or training facilities.  The solution in some areas may be the development of tourism rather than manufacturing industry.  We cannot have <Col N="343" /> a factory at every crossroads, there are many other types of jobs which can be created and we must always pay due attention to ensure that no part of our country is denuded of its population.</P>
    <P>Recent unemployment figures are the highest ever recorded on the live register. At present, one in five of all persons who would like to work, are unable to find a job.  If this trend continues unchecked, the cost to the State in terms of hardship, social exclusion, waste of human potential, drained financial resources and weakened future growth prospects will be unacceptable.  These figures add an increased urgency for us to act together in the interests of increased employment. I appeal to Fine Gael to reconsider their position and to become involved in this committee which I believe has tremendous potential for job creation.  If this Joint Committee on Employment is to be successful there must be all party consensus and for that reason, it is important that Fine Gael be involved.</P>
    <P>With those matters in mind, I hope the people to be consulted who have specialist knowledge will include people from parts of the country which have special needs.  They would be in a position to help the committee formulate their proposals to Government.  In this regard I would mention, in particular, the unemployed who have a great deal of expertise to offer.  They should be consulted because it is only by getting a consensus of opinion that this committee will be successful.  As I have already mentioned, in places such as Kerry further tourism development would create more employment. In Kerry 17½ per cent of the population are directly involved in tourism while the national average is 7½ per cent, and this can be further increased; the same could be said for other parts of the country too.  I hope the experts selected will be in a position to give the information required.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the fact that sub-committees can be set up as a result of this joint venture; I hope that the members will be selected from all <Col N="344" /> parties.  Finally, I again appeal to Fine Gael to reconsider their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minster and wish him good luck in his new role.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the future of democracy here hinges on how we act and, indeed, on how we are perceived to act in relation to unemployment.  There is a cynicism outside this House arising from the fact that we spend the first four of the past six months discussing business scandals, mainly the Sugar Company, and the past two months discussing the minutiae of words and the complex issue of abortion.  The fact that six months of Oireachtas time has passed without any substantive analysis of the unemployment problem is frightening and is giving rise to considerable cynicism among the general public.</P>
      <P>My good colleague, Senator McKenna, seems to be suffering from chronic amnesia manifested mainly by the fact that he is unable to recall that the concept of a jobs forum and a national consensus on unemployment had its origins in a succession of speeches by our party Leader, Deputy John Bruton. There is no doubt that the concept of a jobs forum, consensus on unemployment and national participation in solving the jobs crisis is very much the brain-child of Fine Gael and Deputy John Bruton.  For that reason the amnesia of Senator McKenna and, indeed, the chronic amnesia of many of his colleagues in this area is regretted by people on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Fine Gael's contention from the outset that what should be established was a national jobs forum.  What is at issue here is the establishment of a sub-committee on jobs, effectively, a parliamentary committee rather than a national forum reflecting and capable of creating national consensus on unemployment. That is what bothers us.  We are consistent believers in Oireachtas reform.  We know there is merit in a range of Oireachtas committees and sub-committees, and we would not question the efficacy of those committees, but what we would question is this national <Col N="345" /> emergency which, I submit, challenges democracy in the same way as the Weimar Republic challenged pre-World War II German democracy.  There is need for a radical national solution, but in our view this committee falls far short of what is desirable to deal with the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>We wanted two things to be incorporated into the jobs forum.  We wanted the jobs forum to have accountability, and to achieve accountability Ministers should be answerable to the forum, participate and work in it.  People at the top of all political parties in the Oireachtas should also participate in the Forum.</P>
    <P>It is through that kind of mechanism that you establish accountability.  The second thing we wanted to achieve was participation in the broadest possible way.  We were so committed to the idea that we were prepared to go along with the dilution of the role of the social partners in the forum.  At the outset we wanted an up front, open participatory role for the social partners.  We wanted accountability and participation because in our view, that was the only way you could have action and real results.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the very well intentioned people, and I am sure excellent people from both Houses who will be on this sub-committee, all they will achieve will be the preparation of a couple of reports a year and submitting them to the House where, invariably, they will be taken as read.  They will achieve nothing more.  That is why we are concerned that there might not be adequate action in regard to unemployment. This is regrettable and contrary to what my colleague, Senator Foley, said when he appealed to Fine Gael to participate in the proposed committee. It is possibly not too late yet to change, but this is a lost opportunity if the Government do not take on board such a magnaminous and patriotic gesture from the major Opposition party. We have said we will participate in a jobs forum, put our political future on the line, our whole party's future on the line, get involved, give our best ideas and work within a forum.  That was a great opportunity <Col N="346" /> for Government; it was little short of an offer of national Government, if you like, on such an important issue.</P>
    <P>It is clear that because of the difficult decisions that will arise in solving the unemployment problem we need consensus and participation at the highest levels.  There will have to be significant changes in our taxation structure, fundamentally shifting the burden of taxation from human resources to other physical resources in terms of machinery and so on.  There will have to be radical attempts to develop high-tech industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We offered you the first opportunity of participation on this issue. There will have to be a whole new range of incentives for industry and a tourism development programme.  As recommended in the Culliton report and generally acknowledged, radical change is needed in education to being about an entrepreneurial culture in our schools because of the difficult and invariably unpopular necessary decisions.  This further underscores the need for national consensus.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Fianna Fáil Senators to give this further thought and to again attempt to have ministerial involvement, to have the kind of changes that will enhance the value of any committee and, in reality, turn it into a jobs forum.  I ask Fianna Fáil, even at this 11th hour, to reconsider their position and to grasp the opportunity for consensus and for national participation in a properly constructed jobs forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again I want to put it on the record that we are only opposing this because it falls short of the ideal and because in essence what is involved is a backbench committee of the Oireachtas. We thought it necessary, in view of the grave national crisis, to establish a national forum, not a subcommittee of the Oireachtas.  We do not have a national forum.  It is regrettable, but we are still willing and ready to participate if the Government are willing to change <Col N="347" /> their perception in regard to this matter. It is a tremendous opportunity for them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I congratulate him on his appointment and trust he will have a long tenure.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion to set up an Oireachtas joint committee to examine unemployment.  I am very pleased with the way it will be constituted.  I note it will consist of 19 Members, four of which will be from Seanad Éireann.  I am intrigued, disappointed and surprised at the attitude of Fine Gael to the proposal to set up an Oireachtas joint committee on employment.  The motion states:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Employment) consisting of 15 members of Dáil Éireann and 4 members of Seanad Éireann (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or Minister of State), be appointed</P>
      <P>(a)  to examine and make recommendations on all aspects of economic and social policy which have a bearing on employment creation and which can contribute to alleviating unemployment and</P>
      <P>(b)  to consider and make recommendations on any other issues or subjects which the Joint Committee considers relevant to its task.</P>
      <P>What surprises me is that a similar motion was put forward in Private Members' Time in Dáil Éireann on 19 November 1991.  It was moved on behalf of the Labour Party by Deputy Quinn and stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, alarmed at the projected increase of unemployment to over 300,000 in 1992; conscious of the deteriorating economic situation within Ireland; concerned about the changes which will affect agricultural output as a result of the GATT talks and the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy; determined to act <Col N="348" /> decisively to deal with the wide range of problems in the delivery and extent of our social services, in particular, health, housing and education; resolves to establish on a statutory basis an Oireachtas social and economic committee with not less than 18 members drawn from both Houses.</P>
    <P>Of all the Fine Gael Members in Dáil Éireann, only one contributed &mdash; Deputy Michael Noonan, <i>Limerick East.</i>  I am glad that many more Fine Gael Members in this House are interested in employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning said that they have reservations about this committee because of lack of ministerial involvement. Senator O'Reilly held a similar view and stated that because of lack of ministerial involvement they could not participate in it and he appealed to Fianna Fáil to amend the motion to ensure there would be ministerial involvement.  I have read Deputy Noonan's speech in the other House and he did not once mention ministerial involvement.</P>

      <P>Column 246, volume 413, Tuesday, 19 November 1991, Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East</i> in his contribution said, &ldquo;First, the Fine Gael Party will support the motion of the Labour Party unamended.&rdquo;  Later in his contribution he said, in column 24: &ldquo;Such an arrangement would have to go further than this motion proposes.  The traffic envisaged in the motion is one way.&rdquo;  He said there should be a committee of this House consisting of 18 Members and made no reference to a Minister or ministerial involvement in that committee. Why the sudden change?  Is it that Fine Gael do not want to co-operate, or are they more concerned about political point scoring than job creation?  Job creation is much more serious than political point scoring.  I commend the Minister and the Government for introducing this motion.</P>
      <P>We have had an increased unemployment level.  The recent closures of the UMP factories have created high unemployment.  A Deputy recently highlighted on television the job losses in his own constituency, but he also sought petitions for the closure of a factory because of environmental damage caused by a fire there.  Is that consistency?  I am referring to Deputy Jim Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Such conduct is very inconsistent.  I am informed that after the fire people were concerned about the odour around the town of Ballaghaderreen and that a Deputy, whom I will not name, sought petitions to close the factory, which would add to the unemployment in the area.  The same Deputy is on television night after night <Col N="350" /> talking about the unemployment crisis in the west because of the collapse of the UMP factories.  I know the hardship caused by these closures because I live 11 miles away from one of the factories and I hope the Government will resolve this situation.</P>
      <P>I hope the jobs forum will create employment.  As I said in my contribution on the Appropriation Bill, there is high unemployment, but is it all real?  The Joint Committee on Employment should examine the social welfare system, where some people draw the dole while they are in employment and others abuse the system.  That should also come under their brief.</P>
      <P>The motion also states that the joint committee shall have power to appoint sub-committees, which may consist of Members of the Oireachtas who are not members of the joint committee and may delegate any matter comprehended by paragraph (1) to a sub-committee.  The joint committee shall also have power to nominate persons, representatives from interested bodies, to assist each sub-committee in their deliberations.  This is most welcome.  We need knowledgeable people from interested bodies contributing to this committee to ensure that it operates successfully.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by Fine Gael's attitude. At this late stage they should reconsider their decision and get involved in this committee to ensure its proper working, to help job creation and to contribute in a major way to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues need to be addressed on this debate on a jobs forum.  The ordinary punter is a casual observer of the political sconce.  All I and, I am sure, other Members of the House hear is that the difficulty we experienced over the past two months in getting around the table to discuss this most serious social problem &mdash; and it is the most serious social problem, even though other people might be of a different view &mdash; does not reflect well on us.  That is the point of view being expressed outside this House.  Although I do not share Fine Gael views, I respect them.  I do not cast <Col N="351" /> them aside.  I am very unhappy with the way this committee has been structured. I sympathise with many of the points raised by the main Opposition party here and in the other House and in different debating fora over the past number of weeks.  They have made many valid points, the majority of which I agree with.  However, it behoves us all to take a reasonable line on this issue.  The Government, I always claim, are elected to govern and the Government having taken a decision it must be followed up by the rest of us.  Do we go along with it or do we stand outside and snipe at it? That is the problem we are facing.</P>
      <P>I spoke on the setting up of the jobs forum at the ICTU conference last July. The forum which I proposed at that time would be the type of forum which the Leader of the main Opposition party has been seeking for the past number of weeks and with which I agree.  I regret that we have not set up a committee which goes outside the Oireachtas and that we are not considering a committee which would be drawn from all who have an interest in job creation &mdash; the unemployed, organised workers, employers and other various interests.  I regret that and I would like that to go clearly on record.  I also regret that this is only an advisory committee: they do not have the authority to make decisions, only to make reports.  I am on record as having said this almost a year ago, so it is nothing new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the deed is now done.  The elected Government have take a certain decision and the question for the rest of us is: what do we do?  Do we stay outside or go alone with it?  For many politicians this is a serious issue.  I do not believe anybody has the magic formula to resolve the unemployment problem here.  Therefore there is a major temptation for an Opposition party to stay outside and spend time sniping at the non-effectiveness of the committee.  That might be politically attractive.  I appeal &mdash; and I do not say this in a patronising way &mdash; to the Fine Gael Party to look at their difficulties, to register and record them, and <Col N="352" /> to see if this committee can work.  Let us give it a chance and then let us not be afraid to say, after the first, second or third report, that this is not working, either because we have not got the resources or because the Government are not listening or because they are not putting into effect the recommendations of the committee.</P>
    <P>Outside of the vested interests and the hidden agendas somebody has to take an overall view with one objective in mind &mdash; to create sound, real employment. That is not being done at present.  In the late eighties there was extraordinary growth in the Irish economy but it did not translate into jobs.  That lasted from 1987 to 1991.  There was unprecedented growth in the economy, growth which had never been matched previously in the history of the State, but again our economists let us down.</P>
    <P>They promised in the mid-eighties that if we got the interest rates right, reduced inflation and increased growth to a significant level, the jobs would flow from that.  The jobs did not flow from that and the first question that this committee should examine is what happened to all the wealth created in the late eighties.  It did not create new jobs.  It did not increase the wealth of workers or increase the tax revenue to any significant extent.  We did not have tax growth or jobs.  We did not have wealth creation for workers.  Somebody made a packet during the late eighties, but it did not translate itself into job opportunities. The Minister or the Government should state whether we will give this committee the teeth to examine such matters.</P>
    <P>While we read about gloom and doom in the financial pages of the newspapers and hear from business people that things were never as bad, the figures are different. Exports last year were far beyond what anybody had anticipated; we had very high export levels during the final quarter of 1991; and retail sales during the first part of this year are very high; VAT returns are up again this year &mdash; higher than expected pre-budget; tax revenue is higher than was expected the Minister for Finance said in the Dáil last <Col N="353" /> week and there was an increase in wealth during this period.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the latest figures show that unemployment has gone up again.  Unemployment for this year, which was expected to be 260,000 to 270,000, is now more likely to be 280,000 to 285,000.  There are very few facts about demography, but one is certain and, that is, the birth rate has been established so we know the number of people who are coming onto the jobs market every year. At the moment, we are talking about 25,000 to 30,000 people.  That is fact and is not open for discussion.  The number of jobs we create each year is somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000.  It is significant that the Culliton report &mdash; I disagree with a lot that is in it &mdash; talks about creating 10,000 to 12,000 jobs a year.  With 25,000 people coming onto the workforce per year and 10,000 to 12,000 or maybe 15,000 jobs being created unemployment will increase.  It is a simple sum.  Let us not be surprised when the unemployment figure hits 300,000 by the end of 1993 or early 1994. This inexorable move forward will continue unless we take urgent action.  That is why despite my reservations about the non-representative aspect of the jobs forum the fact that it is not a decisionmaking one and, therefore, cannot insist on the implementation of its recommendations, I would still say to every elected public representative that they have the right to query, criticise and enter reservations about the greatest social problem we face.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the greatest social problem we face despite the fact that many people in the media and around the country have other moral issues which are more important to them.  The impact of unemployment on families, schools and the infrastructure of the State cannot be estimated.  We need to address this problem and public representatives should make every effort to make any facility work in order to create movement in this area.</P>
    <P>I agree with Fine Gael's reservations and with what has been pointed out, but I still say give this a try and see how far <Col N="354" /> we get with it.  If after the first, second report or third report it is not working, we can do a Grattan's Parliament on it and vote it out of office if that is what is required.  We can then point the finger at the Government and say they have failed to deliver and stand indicted.  I would be the first to say that.  They have been elected to govern and have proposed a jobs forum.  Even with all the flaws I see in it, we must attempt to make it work.</P>
    <P>It does not reflect my views or the very strong representations made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Government. It is not what congress or the main Opposition parties were looking for.  I do not believe the Government have all the wisdom but they have been vested with all the authority of the State.  This forum is what they propose and we should give it a chance to work.</P>
    <P>Whatever we do regarding the operation of a jobs forum, we must try to focus all the expertise on job creation. There are many people involved, some of them on the fringes of society, some of them in various political parties and different groups ranging from those dealing with poverty, wealth, the unemployed, the employed, the trade unions and the employers.  We must all pull together and pool our expertise.</P>
    <P>The jobs forum has the power:</P>
    <P>to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it or any of its subcommittees in their consideration of the matters comprehended by paragraph 1.</P>
    <P>I envisage that groups such as the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed would be asked to make a worthwhile contribution to this committee.  I have no doubt that they will have the same reservations about the committee I and Fine Gael expressed.  Nevertheless, I cannot see how any group can just walk away from the forum.</P>
    <P>One will never see the effects of unemployment in Dublin.  The city is too big. I uselessly appealed to this House two weeks ago to try not to sustain the artificial divide which is being created by unscrupulous public representatives <Col N="355" /> between town and city and between east and west.  It is too easy for people who have a genuine problem, whether in Shannon or Ballyhaunis, to say it is the people in Dublin who are responsible for that decision.  I have seen two towns wrecked by unemployment, where teachers have told of children coming to school crying because their parents do not know where the next salary cheque is coming from or how they are going to live.  I saw that happen over the last couple of months in Ballyhaunis.  The same happened in Magherafelt, a tiny market town in the North, where 500 or 600 jobs have been lost in the shirt factory this week.  That town is destroyed and there is no comeback.  No factory in Ballyhaunis or Magherafelt will ever again employ 500 or 600 people.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>That is why we need to address these issues in a non-political way if possible. We must try to make this forum work. We must be clear and deliberate about it.  We must throw away the baggage of generations and look at our position in Europe.  I will not comment on the Maastricht Treaty, but I am conscious of the fact that in the United States, which is the other major trading bloc, people do not think about moving from Dallas to New York for work.  We need to look at the opportunities that will be created inside the European Community with or without the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Last year in Germany 15,000 positions for trainees were not taken up.  Should we look for a share in that activity or do we see it as a diminution of our sovereignty and neutrality if we look for jobs in other parts of the Community?  It is all right to sell to the Community but not to work within the Community?  These are the real issues we must address, despite the fact that every time we say it somebody will say, &ldquo;there is another politician who sees emigration as the answer to our problem&rdquo;.  I am not saying that.  What I am saying is that Air Rianta can run duty free airports in Moscow and various parts of Europe.  In those cases we are selling a service to those countries and we can <Col N="356" /> continue to do that in a way no other country in Europe can because we have one major disadvantage and one major advantage, both tied to each other.  The disadvantage is that we have almost the highest level of unemployment in the European Community and that creates an advantage in that we have a workforce ready to take up employment.  Two other things flow from that.</P>
    <P>We have the population profile which allows us to take advantage of employment opportunities wherever they come from.  Employment is of its nature age specific.  One does not retrain a 45 year old general operative or labourer to be a stockbroker.  One does not take somebody who is burned out in the money market at age 35 and retrain them to work on a building site.  Those are two extreme examples but the point is the same: people do not train to be a teacher at age 50 or 60, they do it between the ages of 19 and 22.  Employment opportunities are age specific.  It is not that people of a particular age are unemployable but there are certain perceptions of the age at which people engage in employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>We have the best population profile in the European Community and we can use that.  We also have a highly educated population.  This brings me to one of the problems I have with the thinking in the Culliton report, which has been overtaken by developments around the world.  It is the view that one moves from education into the training area, that one trains people for jobs and that is the answer to the unemployment problem. The thinking in many of the major trading blocs is changing for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>The best example I could give is in the computer industry.  Somebody aged 60 who began work in the computer industry at age 20, would now be retrained for the fifth time to deal with the fifth generation of computers.  A computer that would have filled this room 40 years ago would now fit into the palm of my hand.  In order to keep up with that level of change, what is needed is not somebody who was trained 40 years ago but somebody who <Col N="357" /> can be trained and retrained.  If our education system is to service the needs of industry and employment, it does not need to product people who are trained to do specific tasks but rather people who are adaptable, flexible and have the potential to be trained and retrained a number of times during their career, at manual, blue collar, white collar, managerial or professional level.  It does not matter whether one is a dentist or a computer operative, things will change.</P>
    <P>There was not even a FAX machine or a word processor in this House six years ago.  A person who was specifically trained in shorthand typing nine years ago and got a job in this House would now be dealing with a level of equipment which was not in existence then.  We need people who are flexible, who can be retrained and are able to deal with changes in society.  The large corporations in America are no longer looking for marketing graduates or business studies graduates because they have learned that if they take somebody with a good general education who is bright and adaptable they can teach them the skills they need in a few months.  Then they can retrain them at a later stage if that becomes necessary.  The people who are offered jobs in the large corporations in the US at the moment have good, solid, old fashioned general degrees.  I am not saying that as an unalterable fact but to indicate that there are changes and that we need to look at how we respond to them and exploit any opportunities they create.</P>
    <P>Our population profile is such as to enable us to have our people at the top of every large corporation, major industry and political movement in Europe within one generation.  It is a matter of taking advantage of that fact and casting aside our insular or parochial views.  We must take advantage of the new Europe, exploit it on behalf of this country and bring wealth from Europe into this country. He must insist that Brussels, does not become a vessel which will retain all the wealth of Europe.  We must look at practical issues and note that any business or professional person going from Ireland <Col N="358" /> to Brussels in the morning will pay an exhorbitant cost for doing so.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and note that by the end of this calendar year we will be the only island state member of the European Community.  We must recognise that when the initial plans for a rapid rail network for Europe was put together it included an under-sea link from Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead.  That does not appear on any maps or plans I have seen recently.  Because of our geographic position and the fact that we will soon be the only island nation in the EC, it costs our citizens much more than our competitors to travel and sell on the European mainland. We need to look at that.</P>
    <P>The question was raised here today in a different context about the need to look at Iarnród Éireann.  A new rapid rail system is being created in Europe that it will now be quicker to go by rail from Paris to Brussels than to fly taking into account the amount of time spent travelling from one airport to another and then into the centre of the city.  We are not getting any of that action.  In the west the rail transport is disgraceful and the only people who are shouting about it are politicians from the west.  That should be the concern of all politicians who want to create opportunities in this country.</P>
    <P>We need to pull together the specialist knowledge available in the employment area.  We need to look at the work of organisations like FÁS and to see how that ties into employment creation.  We need to ensure that the FÁS projects will be useful in terms of job creation.  We must look at the different areas in this country.  There was an old fashioned notion that the only way to create jobs was through manufacturing industry; that is not the case.  I heard Senator Raftery talk on a number of occasions, and indeed be shouted down, about the development of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are some points with which I would agree and some with which I would disagree but I am one of the few people in this House who maintain that the Common Agricultural Policy is costing us jobs and depressing agriculture, and the sooner it is changed the better.  There has <Col N="359" /> been a slight softening in that regard on the Government side of the House because they have been told to do so by their political masters.  I was one of the few people who agreed with Commissioner MacSharry when he said it first. Nobody said anything last year.  People were ready to bury him when he first said it.  It is significant that this week a small meat company in Kilbeggan, Tara Meats, was given the Irish standard ISO&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That company should be brought to the notice of Goodmans and all those other people who never sold a pound of meat.  I would put those people working behind a butcher's counter for a while to learn about selling meat and not selling into intervention or using the system.  The people in Tara Meats, Kilbeggan, are a classic example of people who said: here is a product, Irish meat. It is the best in Europe.  We can sell it and there is a market for it.  I challenge any meat company to give me a refrigerated truck load of meat, properly put together, properly cut and packed and I will sell it in Europe, because I know what it is like to walk into European supermarkets where you cannot buy meat.  The meat which our farmers cannot sell cannot be bought for love or money in Europe.  What is happening along the way?  What is happening is intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I drove out towards Balbriggan, beyond Swords, and I saw a new cold store there.  The amount of meat going into intervention is increasing.  The profit people make who hold meat in intervention means they can afford to build huge cold stores and pay for them before building is finished.  That is a disgrace. I drove past that cold store and then I reached a town in north Donegal. I met a number of people there who were giving out free intervention meat on behalf of the St. Vincent de Paul society, just to get rid of it.  Next week we will hear of it being sold to some other country. What we are doing is daft.  We are <Col N="360" /> trying to create jobs, yet here we are wasting money that could be used for real job creation.  Tara Meats do not sell to intervention nor are they dependent of Common Agricultural Policy.  They put a product together and marketed it.  They had no trouble selling their product.  They are going from strength to strength.  They are increasing profitability and creating employment.  It is the kind of model we need to look for.</P>
    <P>We had better get our act together. Those elected politicians and public representatives who thought that the Tony O'Reillys, the Michael Smurfits and the Larry Goodmans were in some sense employment creators have learnt that they were profit takers and makers and that they employed people if they needed clones or drones to do their work for them.  They walked on people if that was necessary.  I do not speak those words for the first time.  It is a heartfelt view that I hold.  I do not have any difficulty about people making a profit.  That is what industry is about.  I do not have any problems about that, but we should realise that those people do not set out to create employment.  We know that every time they can get rid of workers they will do so.  They set out to make a profit and if they create employment as they go along, well and good.</P>
    <P>The reason I want a jobs forum set up is to examine that kind of activity and ask where is our money going.  What happened to the wealth that was created in this country in the late eighties?  It did not create jobs.  It did not create wealth for workers or tax revenue for the Government.  Where did the money go? Those are the questions that need to be asked.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we see what is happening in the tourism industry.  Tourist figures dropped last year compared to 1990, but they were up significantly on 1989.  The Gulf War in 1991 had an adverse effect on tourism.  In general terms tourism activity in this country is increasing and will continue to increase.  We have a duty and responsibility to see to it that real jobs are created.  If one is in the local lounge bar at the end of August and sees <Col N="361" /> the same 13 year old child who served breakfast that morning in the hotel is now serving drinks at 11.30 at night and falling asleep, one must say that is wrong.  Those are not the kind of jobs we are talking about.  That is not the way employment is to be created.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say that we would not be competitive if we had rules and regulations governing employment. Every other European country can be competitive by having a minimum wage, proper standards and conditions of work and service.  We also need to have those. We must ensure that we create real jobs that allow people to maintain their dignity and a decent quality of life.  That means that there must be proper payment for those jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a black economy working in the tourism industry which needs to be addressed.  I have been in Galway on a number of occasions.  The figures show Galway to be a major employment black spot.  I have been in many employment black spots in this country, but I have great difficulty in seeing Galway as an employment black spot.  I may be completely wrong about this, but the only explanation is that it is a major tourist centre.  I feel that there are a huge number of people involved in the invisible workforce of the black economy.  We need to address those issues.  When one walks down the streets of Galway one does not see a black hole of unemployment. It is not a Darndale or a west Belfast.  It is a place where there is wealth.  Where is the wealth going?  How is it being created?  Why is it not reflected in employment?  The area of job creation and the job forum is one where it is easy to cover many different issues.  I see my colleagues are getting a bit uneasy.</P>

It is an opportunity to get all the interested parties together.  We have a responsibility to try to make is work.

      <P>All I can say to Senator O'Toole is that, given that wide ranging jaunt, he would be a great man to be on this committee; but I would hope he <Col N="363" /> would not keep the other members of the committee waiting as long as he did the few speakers left here today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Science and Technology to the House.  He is a good Corkman, a good friend of mine, and I am delighted with his appointment. I have no doubt that he has the capability to do an extremely good job in that position.  It reminds me that four years ago on research and development we were spending £2 million and to date we have something like £28 million budgeted in that department.  It is an indication of the emphasis that this Government are putting into research and development and growth of indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on setting up the programme for advanced technology, where industry, the universities, the RTCs and Department officials are coming together and working in unison to ensure that in a short period of time they will produce useful and sustainable jobs within the Irish economy and particularly useful in terms of the development of our indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are having an Oireachtas committee set up on the job issue.  All of us are agreed that unemployment is one of the greatest social afflictions facing our society.  Therefore, the 270,000 unemployed out there looking at us politicians arguing about this, that and the other are asking what in the name of goodness is going on in the Oireachtas.  Why can they not get down and debate the issue that is pertinent to each and every one of us, that is pertinent to the country, to the young people and to the future of the country?  This committee is an opportunity for us to get together, to pool our ideas and to come up with something useful to ensure that we will cut the major dole queues.  Fine Gael have quite rightly stated that they have asked for this Oireachtas joint committee. It was a good idea, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We asked for a jobs forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I have to question the sincerity behind that call.  I remind them that this request came when the former Taoiseach was head of the Government.  They were aware that the former Taoiseach was not in favour of that Oireachtas committee, so it was easy for them to call for a jobs forum in the likelihood that that was not going to be granted.  Time moves on.  Fianna Fáil have a new leader and we have a new Taoiseach, who in his wisdom has said that consensus is an absolute necessity to eradicate unemployment.  Therefore, he and the Government agree to an Oireachtas committee on jobs, and suddenly Fine Gael &mdash; those who called for it &mdash; have misgivings.  There was no difficulty, as Senator Kiely said, when Deputy Bruton was asking for it in the other House; there was no difficulty with 18 members of the committee; there was no question about Ministers coming in. But, suddenly, when it was placed before them and when they were asked to stand up and be counted, they were found wanting.</P>
      <P>This Government have been as accommodating as they possibly could have in bringing all parties together on this issue. They have waited for weeks, they have pandered to Fine Gael, they have made changes.  But, suddenly, Fine Gael are saying to the Government: we want to have Ministers, we want to dictate to Ministers, to tell them what do do, we want to govern.  The facts of life are that in the last general election Fine Gael did not get a mandate to govern.  There is a Government in place and it is their duty under legislation to carry out that function. Look at the record to see if Government Ministers have attended committee meetings up to now.  It has not happened. Deputy John Bruton at one stage attended one meeting, but in an advisory capacity.  When Fine Gael and Labour were in Government they as Ministers did not attend any committee meetings because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is sad because the people who are unemployed will not thank that party for not standing up and being counted and not being willing like the other parties to contribute their share to trying to find a solution to this major issue.</P>
      <P>I was amused at Senator O'Reilly when he said &ldquo;We conceived the idea&rdquo;.  I grant him that, but he reminded me of the eunuch in a harem, where the eunuch had the idea but unfortunately was not able to perform.  What Fine Gael want to do is usurp the power of Government, to try to take Ministers into this committee, to try to subject them to harrassment, to try to put the blame on the shoulders of the Government, if the committee fails, rather than putting their shoulders to the wheel and contributing in a meaningful way, which the unemployed, the country and the economy deserve.  I accuse that party of copping out at this stage.  Why not try it?  Changes have been made. They have been facilitated in major ways. The only issue on which they cannot be facilitated is in the ministerial issue. Under the Oireachtas system that cannot be done and Fine Gael know it.</P>

      <P>I am very cynical.  Last week in the House I saluted Senator Raftery for the independent stand he took from his fellow Senators on another issue.  I was hoping today &mdash; well, I was not, because I heard the Senator on radio yesterday and I was disappointed in what <Col N="366" /> he had to say.  I expected something more constructive.  I felt the Senator personally would have a lot to offer if he was made a member of this committee.  I am saddened that he could not see the light on this issue and stand apart from the hoodwinked thinking of his fellow members.</P>
      <P>The Government were accused that the NESC, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were running this country.  As part of the call from the Opposition for a jobs forum, it was pointed out to us that the economists were the people running the country, that they were telling us what to do, when to go and how to improve our situation. Now, all of a sudden, when the opportunity arises it is not taken.</P>
      <P>Take the sad example on the Order of Business today.  Senator Manning, a man for whom I have tremendous respect, stood up at the Order of Business; Senator Raftery and the others on that side of the House have been calling for reform in this Seanad, asking that this Seanad be made more meaningful; the Leader of the House asked today that the Order of Business be changed so that we could facilitate the setting up of a jobs forum, but what did Fine Gael do?  Fine Gael opposed the change in the Order of Business.  This is sad coming from a party that wanted to make this House more meaningful, but when it is being made meaningful, when something is being done here which affects the 270,000 people unemployed it is sad that on the Order of Business they oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee is now being set up and I am glad the Government have taken the initiative.  It is my personal view that they have dithered for too long.  We cannot allow any more time to elapse before taking on board this major social affliction.  Anything that any of us can do to alleviate the problem let us do it.  I am throwing out the olive branch, particularly since Senator Ross has come in, to say that it is not too late, the opportunity is still there.  There is a lot of wisdom on that side of the House and the Government are saying: let us pool that wisdom; <Col N="367" /> let us get our ideas together.  This is not a political issue, this is a national issue in the interests of all our people, and in the interest of the future of our young people.  To be apart from that would be reneging on the future generation and Fine Gael will not be able to say they played a meaningful role.</P>
    <P>Nobody has a magic formula and obviously we are all wondering if this committee will be worthwhile and will produce everything we want it to produce.  But let me put the other scenario. If we do not have this committee is it more likely that we are going to achieve anything?  Here we have an opportunity with this Oireachtas committee and its subcommittees.  We can bring into the subcommittees outside expertise and ask them for their views.  We can collate this with the Culliton report and all the other reports we have on the creation of employment.  At least we can say that, together, we are going to make a sustained effort to ensure that this committee produces something worthwhile for this economy.</P>
    <P>I have heard Senator O'Toole mention the fact that we have a highly educated population.  I have no difficulty with that. We have an exceptionally well educated population.  Despite all the things that have been said about cutbacks in education &mdash; and I know Senator Raftery will agree with me &mdash; our young graduates coming out of the universities and RTCs compare favourably with their counterparts in any other country; in fact, they will be head and shoulders above most of them.  That is why foreign companies are very anxious to employ some of our graduates; you see them knocking on the door at graduation time to ensure they can get the cream of the crop.</P>
    <P>Recent developments would suggest that R and D is being located here much more by foreign companies.  We have a problem.  I remember in 1987, when Deputy Haughey came into Government, he said that public spending was too high, that foreign borrowing was too high, that we had to cut inflation and cut <Col N="368" /> our costs.  The general perception at that time was that if that was done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>What did he say when he was in Opposition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;jobs would follow. We have a particular problem here in Ireland.  That Government and this one have been particularly successful in all they tried to achieve to create a climate for investment.  Investment has been created, but jobs have not followed.  That is a dilemma this Oireachtas committee will have to pursue.  When the climate for investment is right why have the jobs not followed?  I am pleased the Minister for Science and Technology is here, because I think science and technology have a major role to play in the development of our economy and of our indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>Heretofore we placed no emphasis on science and technology and on R and D, but we are dealing with that in a meaningful way by providing £28 million for it this year.  We have two good examples of that.  We have Intel in Kildare and Fort Dodge in Sligo coming in with R and D.  The IDA suddenly got a brainstorm and looked at the multinationals that are here.  They looked at the linkage programme again and said we could create 3,000 jobs through linkage. Everybody in the universities, the RTCs etc., have been saying that this sector is crying out for us to examine and to benefit from.  These companies are sourcing material outside this country that is not being manufactured here.  That is a retrograde step and something must be done about it.  I am glad that, at last, we are looking at science and technology; and not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA may be criticised in many respects &mdash; and when we are talking about the Culliton report tomorrow we will have a lot more to say about that &mdash; but I think it would be remiss of me, as a Government Senator, if I did not mention what the Government have done.  Apart from cutting costs, cutting back on external borrowing and ensuring that we have low inflation and low <Col N="369" /> interest rates, we now have a Government who have set up a task force on employment; we have the Culliton report; we have the EC assisted schemes which will take 25,000 people off the live register and we have a major success in the tourism area, which has greatly enhanced the reputation of this country as somewhere to visit and somewhere to locate.  I cannot stress that enough.  There are major schemes, but we, as an Oireachtas, need to address ourselves to this major issue of unemployment.  I see the jobs committee as the ideal opportunity for us to put our heads together and to call on everybody who has something to offer in terms of ideas and expertise.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would say to Fine Gael that it is not too late.  There is an opportunity for them to be part of the future, they will be thanked by future generations, but if they stand back, they will be the subject of ridicule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by referring to some comments Senator O'Toole made, since he referred to me by name, and Senator O'Keeffe too.  I think Senator O'Toole is under the impression that I was one of the people who opposed the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and that he was the first and only person in Ireland who welcomed Commissioner MacSharry's reform proposals. I would like to put it on the record that I was proposing that the Common Agricultural Policy be reformed while Commissioner MacSharry, as an MEP, was arguing that we should consider our place in Europe if the Common Agricultural Policy were tampered with.  Let me also put it on the record that I am adamantly opposed to the type of reforms which he has brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to place on record for Senator O'Toole that I am not in favour of using &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;, as he seemed to think and, in fact, I predicted five or six years ago in the European Parliament that if we went down the road we were going when we opposed the World Health Organisation's view on the subject, <Col N="370" /> we would get what we got &mdash; the use of illegal and dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>With regard to this proposal for a jobs committee, let me begin by saying that we have the worst unemployment record by a long margin in the entire European Community, and one of the worst in the world.  Had we not the safety valve of emigration, our unemployment would not be 20 per cent, it would probably be about 35 per cent; so the real situation is, in fact, a lot worse than the unemployment register would indicate.</P>
    <P>If I look at my own city of Cork, there are areas in that city, like Mayfield and Knocknaheeny, where there are as many as 80 per cent of the people there unemployed. Indeed, in relation to Senator O'Keeffe and all his talk about sincerity and job creation, I would point out to him that back in 1987 every corner I turned in Cork county I saw billboards with the photograph of a passport on it and the slogan &ldquo;There is a better way, Vote Fianna Fáil&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, implying once we are in power we will solve it.  Let me point out the record.  In 1987, after the closure of Dunlops, Fords and the shipyard, there were 14,000 people unemployed in Cork; today, in 1992, there are over 19,000 people unemployed. That is the record Senator O'Keeffe is so proud of.  That is an increase of over 30 per cent in that short period.</P>
    <P>I agree with all that has been said about unemployment being a social evil.  It is a terrible social evil.  It is for that reason that I feel strongly &mdash; and probably much more strongly than my party in general feels &mdash; that we need something far better than just another backbench committee. Let us face the reality.  We already have 93 reports on unemployment.  What good is another one going to do?  We will not solve this unemployment problem by just political consensus in this House.  The only way we can solve the unemployment problem is to have national consensus with the politicians, the employers, the trade unions, the unemployed and the workers.  The only way that can be achieved is by having what was originally suggested by Deputy John Bruton, a jobs <Col N="371" /> forum where all these people would have an input and where we could arrive possibly at a consensus.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it.  The difficult task of getting rid of our very high levels of unemployment will involve sacrifices, and it will involve consensus.  Unless we have that consensus across society &mdash; as you have, for instance, in Japan &mdash; you will not get the results.  The Government refused the jobs forum and offered an Oireachtas committee.  Fine Gael asked that the Ministers would play a part in this; that was refused.  Fine Gael asked that Ministers could be involved on a voluntary basis; that was refused &mdash; and we are accused of being difficult.  I think this activity of another backbench committee is nothing more than a charade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whitewashing exercise designed to take the blame off the Government for their abject failure to do the job they promised they would do, which was to solve the unemployment problem.  When this was announced first you may remember, or perhaps you have forgotten, the Leader of the Labour Party described it as a cop out.  Then, when it was politically opportune, he said they would go along with it.  I heard him on radio myself describing the Oireachtas committee on jobs as a cop out on the unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>Let me point out again that we have 93 reports already.  I cannot see that a backbench committee will add anything further, anything worthwhile, to this.  All I can see it doing is creating more cynicism among the unemployed.  As I read the situation, there is no commitment on the Government side when they will not allow Ministers to act on the committees, when they will not allow Ministers to be voluntarily present at the committees. That is not commitment to solving the problem, and that is not trying to arrive at consensus with the second largest party in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> It is regrettable that the unemployed are once again being conned by this kind of cynical political exercise.  I, for one, think it is a sad day for the country.  I sincerely hope that, at this late stage, the Taoiseach could agree to having Ministers participate in a voluntary way in these committees.  Otherwise I can only read it as a whitewashing exercise and an attempt to spread the blame for the failure of the Government across all the political parties in the country.</P>

      <P>I am very rarely grateful to the Fianna Fáil Party for anything, but I am grateful to them for one thing this afternoon, that I think it is the first time I have noticed that they have stopped talking about full employment.  There was a time, when the Fianna Fáil Party were in Opposition, when the subject came up day after day they promised full employment.  It now, I suppose, can be put in the same category as their commitment to the restoration of the Irish language and to a United Ireland &mdash; and the draining of the Shannon; I did not realise there was a fourth one.  Full employment has now been dropped as part of Fianna Fáil folklore now that they are in Government.  They talk glibly about improving the employment prospects of our people.  The fact is that they have presided for five years over a disastrous employment situation.  The wonder is that it is being tolerated by the unemployed.</P>
      <P>What never ceases to amaze me &mdash; and it still amazes me today &mdash; is that there are 300,000 unemployed and they are not storming Leinster House by the day.  The problem is enormous and the Government have sat back and tolerated it because there has been nobody to speak for the unemployed.  That has been the reality.  There has not been an enormous lobby group to make them feel the breeze.  The wonder is that they do not form a political grouping that puts Fianna Fáil out of office once and for all, because Fianna Fáil do not care about the unemployed as long as a fair number of them come in and vote for them on election day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> That, unfortunately, is the truth; and I do not think that in the ten years I have been in this House I have heard more cynical contributions than those from the other side of this House today.  This is a debate on an issue which matters; yet the contributions have offered nothing but empty rhetoric and attacks on the Opposition position.  The unemployment crisis is about human beings and the reason Fine Gael have taken this position is undoubtedly a difficult one to explain; and it is difficult because it is slightly more sophisticated than the simplistic Fianna Fáil trap which is being set on this issue.  I would like to take to task one or two&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Senator McKenna echoed &mdash; if that is not an inaccurate word &mdash; those from this side who went before him.  He said that this would be a great committee for examining, studying, analysing and clarifying but this means nothing.  He did not offer a single solution, contribution or constructive suggestion about creating a single job.</P>

      <P>There will be very many other committees which Fianna Fáil will set up before they eventually leave office of ignominy which will do no damage. Let us set that in stone as a criterion for governing this country.  Fianna Fáil will be the &ldquo;no damage&rdquo; Government, all their actions based on that simple criterion.</P>
      <P>I have a memory of committees of this sort.  There is a tradition in this House which is not a noble one and extends to all political parties.  When they have a problem they kick it off to a joint committee of all political parties where it can do no harm and is taken out of the immediate political arena.  It is obvious from the way Fianna Fáil play this particular committee that they decided it was the only way to take this issue on board. It was too hot for Fianna Fáil to handle; they did not want to take the blame for the 300,000 unemployed so they thought they would rope the Opposition into another toothless committee so that they would then share the blame for the 300,000 unemployed.  The Opposition are not going to take that blame because they are not going to allow another toothless committee to sit on such a serious issue and it is cynical of the Government to have taken that position.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party come out of this with no glory either.  I listened to Senator Upton's contribution which was no better or no more constructive than Senator McKenna's.  They were both on a par in cynical reaction to the jobs forum. Senator Upton said the great virtue of the jobs forum would be to analyse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>He also went on to state that the <i>status quo</i> was not an option.  The jobs forum, as far as Senator Upton was concerned, was not going to achieve anything in particular.  The reason it is <Col N="376" /> important that Fine Gael do not participate in this forum is that this committee will be seen for what it is by the people.  Anybody serious about unemployment knows that the problem is not under the control of those who live and work here.  A large number of us admit that unemployment is a consequence of reduced emigration, the world recession and other national problems.  We have a noticeable structural problem in times of growth, times which Senator McKenna may find hard to recall at this stage. Employment does not increase or expand as the economy grows and that is where it would be useful to have a fundamental examination of this country's employment problem.</P>
      <P>An Oireachtas committee is not qualified to come to conclusions or to reach solutions about employment.  There are possibly ways forward by including greater numbers of people with more varied experience than TDs and Senator's; for all the good TDs and Senators do, they do not have enormous expertise in this area.  The subcommittees &mdash; and I would like to thank Senator McKenna through the Chair for that interruption if not for any other &mdash; will be a means of diluting the power and effectiveness of this committee because what the committee needed above all was full membership from the unemployed, from the so called social partners and full ministerial participation and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a Minister had to publicly act on the recommendations of this committee, it might have commanded some sort of public respect.  In its present form the committee will be a dead letter and add to the cynicism of politicians because it is not going to contribute towards the creation of employment in this country. It will be a very useful but toothless little body for Fianna Fáil to refer all its problems to.  It will deflect some of the blame which exists and the opprobrium rightly attached to the Government about employment.  The Fine Gael Party have taken the right, if the more difficult choice, of stating that they will not tolerate a cynical effort to deflect responsibility <Col N="377" /> for the employment problem away from Fianna Fáil.  In the long term we will be proved right; in the short term Fianna Fáil may have gained a cheap victory.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address this motion.  I thank Senators who welcomed me to the House this afternoon.  I am, glad the proposals for a Joint Committee on Employment have received so much support in this debate from all speakers, except members of the Fine Gael Party.  Their contributions remind me of the mother who watched the FCA marching by and said: &ldquo;They are all out of step except my Johnny&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposals deserve our support because the unemployment situation is so grave that any proposals which give a prospect of finding new ways and measures to increase employment should be supported.  We are facing the highest unemployment rate we have ever known and that should encourage us all to cooperate constructively to try to remedy that appalling situation.  The Government have made a generous and sincere effort to accommodate their original proposal to the views of other parties.  The amendments made include fuller participation by the social partners in the work of the committee, a system of subcommittees with specific terms of reference and financial assistance to the participating parties to enable them to undertake necessary research.  These amendments to the original proposals have resulted in a structure unique in terms of such committees and show clearly the desire of the Government to enable the committee to function effectively and efficiently in accordance with views expressed by opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one amendment to the original proposals which, however, the Government could not accept.  Fine Gael proposed that Ministers should attend the committee.  It is clear that the intention behind that proposal is to make Ministers <Col N="378" /> responsible and answerable to the committee for the unemployment situation. Instead of the committee developing its own ideas and proposals for employment, the Fine Gael proposal is to have Ministers up before the committee to account for what they are doing or not doing.</P>
    <P>The answer of the Government to that naive proposal is, first, Ministers are fully responsible to the Oireachtas for what they do or do not do.  There is, therefore, no question of Ministers shirking their responsibilities.  All reports and recommendations of the committee will be fully considered by the Government and the relevant Ministers will respond to the Oireachtas as regards the feasibility and implementation of any such report and recommendations; second, in accordance with the constitutional position, Ministers are answerable to the Oireachtas not to a committee.  I emphasise they will respond fully to the Oireachtas regarding any proposals the committee make; thirdly, this is not only the constitutional position, it is also the practice and the precedent in these matters.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to attendance by Ministers at committees dealing with specific Bills.  That is not relevant since it is a proper function of a Minister sponsoring a Bill to discuss that Bill with a committee formed expressly for that purpose in order to facilitate the work of the Oireachtas.  Reference has been made to committees established in 1967 and 1973 with ministerial membership to consider the Constitution and Northern Ireland respectively.  These were informal committees set up by the political parties and were not committees of the Oireachtas set up by motion of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Failure by Fine Gael to support this motion will be seen by all impartial observers as Fine Gael running away from the concept of a jobs forum which would involve political parties.  The Government regret that Fine Gael could not agree to the proposals now before the Oireachtas and I urge them to accept that the proposed committee cannot but make a worthwhile contribution to solving <Col N="379" /> the grim unemployment situation we face.</P>
    <P>If they do not support this motion one must question their sincerity in putting forward their original proposal last year. One may be forgiven for thinking it was put forward as a cynical party political ploy to be seen to be offering to assist in solving the unemployment problem in expectation that their offer would not be accepted by the Government.  Now that it has been accepted in generous measure by the Government and the other parties they should not be seen to distance themselves from it so as to avoid having to disclose whether they have any worthwhile proposals to make about creating employment.</P>
    <P>Many efforts are being made to solve the employment problem.  The Government have taken the following specific actions directed at creating employment: (a)  the task force on employment combining the views of the social partners, Government Departments and the commercial State companies; (b) the Culliton report is being implemented by a committee of Ministers chaired by the Taoiseach and a task force mainly composed of departmental secretaries to make proposals to the ministerial committee; (c) the new EC assisted employment and training schemes for 25,000 persons on the live register; (d) the task force on tourism which has employment as a primary objective; (e) the 12 area based companies throughout the country under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to deal with long term unemployment in areas of high unemployment; (f) the EC funded study being organised by the NESC into the connection between economic growth and employment.  This study will compare our experience with that of other EC economies where job creation has been greater relative to growth than in Ireland; (g) the macro-economic policy pursued by the Government which has created the conditions of low inflation and cost competitiveness which are the only basis on which our economy and employment can grow; and (h) the dramatic tax reform <Col N="380" /> already far advanced to encourage enterprise which is the motive power which will create greater employment.  Since 1989 the top rate of tax has been brought down from 58 per cent to 48 per cent and a standard rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent with the intention that within the lifetime of the Government it will be reduced to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is lacking in all I have listed is the insight and ideas that Members of the Oireachtas, whether in Opposition or Government parties, could contribute to solving our enormous unemployment problem.  The Government think it most important to give this opportunity to Members of the Oireachtas to contribute their ideas and proposals on how to increase employment.  I can promise that the Government will carefully consider all proposals the committee makes and will fully implement every proposal which is feasible and practicable.  The relevant Ministers will come before the Oireachtas in accordance with the normal practice in relation to reports of committees and will respond on each and every proposal the committee makes.</P>
    <P>I hope that the prolonged negotiations which have taken place in regard to this committee will now bear fruit in all parties agreeing to establish and participate in the committee.  Any other decision will be a great disappointment and discouragement to the unemployed who look to this House, to this Oireachtas, in hope and expectation that we can combine across party divides to identify measures which can alleviate the deprivation the unemployed suffer in our society.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the alarming increase of 8 per cent in the crime rate for last year, Seanad Éireann condemns the <Col N="381" /> abject failure of the Government to halt the continued increase in crime, lawlessness and vandalism; and, in view of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the extreme concerns of the citizens of Dublin and other cities with the level of urban crime,</P>
    <P>(b)  the increase in rural crime by up to 60 per cent in certain areas,</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to immediately allocate adequate resources and manpower to An Garda Síochána and to embark on a programme of law reform to modernise the judicial and custodial agencies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn.</P>
    <P>The levels of crime last year are extremely disturbing.  The figures show the serious upward trend which we all feared and which we indicated in this House to the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke throughout last year. The rate of reported crime levels is now almost back to the 1982 levels when serious drug addiction caused it to shoot up.</P>
    <P>Crime statistics present us with the cold facts but to the people affected, whether they live in major housing areas or in small rural communities, they represent a growing and intolerable interference from criminals.  The statistics present us with the hard facts indicating the failure of the Government to halt the unacceptable increase in crime rates and the failure to protect the ordinary people of Ireland and allow them to feel safe in their homes, on the streets, at their places of entertainment or at work.</P>
    <P>While in 1982, when similar levels were experienced, the heroin epidemic in Dublin was the most easily identifiable reason for the then soaring crime levels, there is no such identifiable reason on this occasion.  The reason on this occasion is the failure of the Government to give proper resources and adequate personnel to the Gardaí.</P>
    <P>Problems arise with the courts.  Our courts may have become punch drunk from the sheer volume of criminal cases <Col N="382" /> coming before them.  We, as a society, are moving too far towards conferring privileges on our deviants while we deny our law abiding citizens their rights.</P>
    <P>Our criminal justice system must be looked at critically and reformed.  Every day the district courts are swamped with persons charged with all types of criminal offences.  Sometimes the sentences handed down to people convicted in the courts fit those crimes, but too often the sentences fall short of what one would expect.  There is no clearly defined sentencing policy.  Our criminal law must be codified and simplified.</P>
    <P>Criminal trials are cluttering up the system which is in chaos because of the bureaucracy surrounding our courts. There are insufficient members of the Judiciary to deal with the level of work. Courts are cluttered up with cases which could more easily and efficiently be dealt with under a different system.  Courts are cluttered dealings with committal orders, instalment orders and so on.  These should take place elsewhere.  The Government should establish a debtors panel or court to relieve that area.  The long called for small claims court should be established without delay.</P>
    <P>More gardaí must be made available to do the job of crime prevention and detection.  There is no justification for keeping gardaí waiting through long trials just to give a few minutes' evidence.  An example of this was in a long murder trial lasting six weeks; a Garda who conveyed the murder weapon, a knife, from the scene to the official examiner was required to give evidence providing the link in the chain of continuity in the investigation process.  He was detained for six weeks in court to give this evidence, some of this time even after he had given the evidence.  Surely with modern methods of communication such a witness could be contacted and given an hour or two notice that he was required to be in the court.  The irony is that a doctor, engineer or other professional who is busy with his/her work is treated sympathetically by the court, and rightly so.  They are released from attendance until due to give evidence.  Gardaí should be similarly <Col N="383" /> treated.  They should be out on the street where they would be more usefully deployed.</P>
    <P>For half a day each week members of the Garda are engaged in accepting unemployment claim forms.  This should be done by a social welfare officer who could rent an office for half a day each week in the town or village concerned. The activities which engage gardaí outside their core responsibilities of preventing and detecting crime should be examined and allocated to those who can as effectively or in some cases more effectively complete those tasks.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice's predecessor, Deputy Ray Burke, throughout last year maintained that the level of crime was under control, that his Department were satisfied with the level of resources to the garda.  We now know that the situation is at crisis level.  The citizens of and visitors to Dublin and other cities are afraid to leave their houses after dark.  O'Connell Street, Dublin, is becoming a &ldquo;no go area&rdquo; after 8 p.m.  People feel intimidated by gangs of rowdy youths walking the streets.  We must ensure that people can walk our streets in safety.  The people are angry with the current situation.  They demand action and the Minister must respond.</P>
    <P>On occasion after finishing work in my office at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.  I have walked through O'Connell Street but I no longer do so.  On occasion I have felt apprehensive for my safety.  The conduct of young people who act in a boisterous and intimidating fashion must be controlled. The current situation is not acceptable. Firm action must be taken against people who engage in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour.</P>
    <P>It should be an offence for a person to be found in a public place in a condition in which, because he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, he is a source of danger to another person or himself.  It should be an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.  It should be an offence for a person having been warned by a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="384" /> to desist, who engage in any shouting, singing or boisterous conduct in circumstances likely to cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection that in 1992 those who mourn their loved ones must ensure the protection of their homes while the funeral ceremonies are taking place. Funeral undertakers, in response to the need of clients, are providing a home protection service against thieves.  It is a sad reflection on society that security firms, sometimes using uniformed personnel, are being hired by undertakers to guard family homes during removals and funerals.  This service is often extended to relatives and neighbours of the bereaved families as they too are being targeted by burglars.  Too often bereaved families come home from the burial to find their homes ransacked and valuables stolen. People are being advised by undertakers not to put cards on the door or to leave the house unattended.  This is a sickening development and no effort should be spared to catch the culprits and stamp out this ghoulish practice.</P>
    <P>Crime incidents in rural areas are increasing at an alarming level.  In the Minister's constituency of Mayo, crime rose by 26 per cent last year.  Cork west Garda division topped the league by recording a whopping 60 per cent increase in crime, followed by Roscommon/ Galway East with 41 per cent and third on the list is Mayo.  It is ironic that these three Garda divisions have traditionally been among the country's most crime-free areas.  The Limerick division, my own area, which is in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, had an increase of 9 per cent; 21 of the 23 Garda divisions had an increase in crime levels last year.  It is important that the Minister should allocate more resources and personnel to rural areas where crime rates are causing extreme concern.</P>
    <P>People living alone, the elderly and vulnerable people in rural Ireland, are living in fear.  It is not unusual when visiting rural areas to see doors locked 24 <Col N="385" /> hours a day with guard dogs for added protection.  This is no way to live.  The quality of life in such circumstances is unacceptable and the Government have a duty to tackle the problem.  People should be able to live in a reasonable way without fear of being robbed, assaulted, raped or even murdered in their homes. It is time to cry halt.  Resources must be given to the Garda Síochána to deal with the criminals who perpetrate such foul acts.  These attacks destroy their victims and make their lives a living hell.  They leave an indelible scar both physically and mentally.  Such attacks too often trigger off a deterioration in health in old people which in too many cases prove fatal within a short period.  This is a sad and a cruel end to a good person's life, a person who, in most cases, has worked hard and contributed handsomely to his/her community and his/her country.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Garda Síochána and citizens involved in the community watch schemes.  These have proved very successful in most areas. However, the success of the system in an area is highly dependent on the coordinator. In some areas where the coordinator loses interest or leaves the area, the scheme becomes dormant.  No analysis has been done of the number of dormant or defunct schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government must, as a matter of urgency, arrange for the necessary referendum to change the bail laws.  The Government must use the opportunity of the forthcoming Maastricht referendum to do this.  It is an excellent opportunity for the Government and should not be missed.</P>
    <P>A new approach to Garda interrogation should be taken on board by the Minister for Justice.  In our society which rightly allows accused persons the best legal advice free of charge, it is only fair that the accused should be made accountable for his or her movements when questioned by the Garda Síochána.  The right to silence in these circumstances is an outdated principle which only serves to protect the guilty and does nothing to further the case of innocent persons.  It is a relic of the last century when individuals <Col N="386" /> had no access to free legal aid and when punishments were much harsher.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as it stands, the right is currently a major obstacle to gardaí in their investigations into organised professional crime.  A suspect can refuse to answer questions or give any explanation about matters which are put to him in the course of his interrogation.  Experienced criminals do this as a matter of course and subversives are adept at doing so.  While the abolition of this right would greatly help Garda investigations, it would also protect suspects in cases of over-zealous police officers who might try to extract confessions.  The abolition of the right to silence would remove the importance of obtaining a self-incriminatory confession in many investigations.</P>
    <P>The right of silence was introduced at a time when the accused was rarely represented in court and could not give evidence, but today the rules only serve to help an increasing number of professional criminals to avoid conviction. Under the new system it would not be an offence to refuse to answer questions or give an explanation but an adverse inference could be drawn from this on particular issues.  Legislation similar to this has been introduced and the right of silence does not protect self-incrimination in a variety of statutory offences, especially offences under the Road Traffic Acts, like drunken driving, where suspects may be required to provide blood or urine samples and where they may later be convicted of the offence.  Likewise the genetic finger-printing Bill obliges the suspect to provide a DNA sample.  If he does not do so the court will be allowed to draw an inference from that.</P>
    <P>In Revenue cases, a person being investigated cannot use the right to silence to mask giving potentially incriminating answers to the tax inspectors.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable and a failure on the part of the Government that due to lack of prison accommodation, hundreds of law breakers are serving their sentences on the streets.  They are allowed to walk free from jails because of the chronic overcrowding.  Hardened criminals are <Col N="387" /> being released, in some cases to make room for TV licence defaulters.  This allows them to commit further offences while they should be behind bars.  Freed prisoners are being sent back to the same jails within days for being caught for crimes often committed just hours after leaving custody.  This must be changed. Our prison system must be reformed. Full sentences must be served by those who commit serious offences and non-custodial sanctions must apply to those who commit minor offences, such as failing to pay small fines or debts.</P>
    <P>Too many professional criminals have now learned to play the system to ensure they are set free as early as possible to resume their criminal rackets.  The system must be changed and the scandalous situation eliminated.</P>
    <P>Given that many crimes are committed by those under 25, there is a lack of detention centres to hold young people convicted of crimes.  The Government have failed, despite repeated promises, to tackle this issue and are still no nearer a solution than when the former Minister for Justice addressed this House on this issue almost 12 months ago.  Even when criminals are put behind bars the great frustration, especially for the victims of crime, is that the burglar or murderer will be out of jail after he has spent only an average of one-third of his term inside. Too often we hear of gardaí who have the experience of escorting people to prison only to find them at home before them when they return to their areas.</P>
    <P>The Government must recognise that poverty, unemployment and education failure are the main causes of youth alienation from society, resulting in a high level of crime.  This situation has a potential to grow and envelop more aspects of our society.  The Minister and the Department of Education have a key role to play in this.  The role of the school in deprived areas must be examined.  Policies must be introduced to strengthen the schools in these areas.  Achievement at school must have more acceptance in status and in the communities in deprived areas where not only family attitudes but <Col N="388" /> the atmosphere in the school influences the young persons view of the education system.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, on any one day, one out of ten pupils is missing through truancy. This amounts to 6,000 truants per day in our capital city.  One in three working-class young people in our housing estates leave school without any qualifications. They either fail their exams or drop out altogether.  Either way, their life opportunities are severely limited.  They start life with a badge of failure.  School must become important and attractive to these young people.  If a person does well in school he/she will do well when it comes to looking for and getting employment.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with young people of school-going age committing offences in these areas.  A young person who has been identified as an offender will frequently be visited by the plethora of professionals. He will probably be first visited by a health board social worker, followed by a school attendance officer, a Garda juvenile liaison officer, a probation officer, a solicitor and maybe a priest and teacher.  The Government task force in 1980 recommended that there should be a child care authority with responsibility for all issues affecting children in these difficulties.  The responsibility for problem juveniles should be handed over to one person who would be responsible to the child care authority. The Minister should take this recommendation on board.</P>
    <P>In urban and rural areas in general we must recognise that crime prevention is a key element in tackling the problem. We must look at tighter regulations in regard to the retailing of alcohol, especially to young people.  Cars should be more secure.  Car manufacturers should be obliged to introduce proper and more sophisticated anti-theft devices.  The Minister must look at the policies on and sanctions of youth crime. New and imaginative non-custodial sanctions must be introduced.  Sufficient places must be available in residential care only where non-custodial sanctions clearly fail.</P>
    <P>Professional help must be available to <Col N="389" /> families in difficulty.  The Child Care Act must be implemented immediately. Health boards must be given adequate resources to assist families in trouble. Child abuse, family violence and alcoholism are often features of a family where youngsters slide into trouble.  Proper support systems should be available to families at risk.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House; I wish him the best of luck.  I hope he will be innovative and will act immediately on many of the suggestions that will be put forward by all sides in this debate.</P>
      <P>I second this motion of condemnation of the Government for their abject failure to halt the acceleration of crime, lawlessness and vandalism.  It is evident that even since our last debate in Private Members' Time in June 1991 neither sufficient resources nor manpower have been made available to the Garda Síochána to deal with crime.  It is essential that we embark, as the motion suggests, on a programme of law reform to modernise the judicial and custodial agencies.</P>
      <P>Listening to radio and watching television over the last 12 months, and even before that, I noticed that our chat shows are predominantly taken up with distressed phone-ins by people who have been subjected to vicious attacks.  This morning I was listening to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne&rdquo; programme on my way here.  The worst case discussed was that of an extremely vicious sexual attack on a woman of over 80 years of age suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  One could not imagine anything more vicious or horrific. This is happening in rural Ireland, not just in down-town New York or Chicago.  We have turned into a nation of criminals.  Viciousness is all around us. It is reflected on our chat shows; it is, unfortunately, a sign of the times.  The assailant in this case was disturbed and was, fortunately, caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many such cases which are not even reported because of the sense of shock, fear and embarrassment felt <Col N="390" /> by older people who might not even be visited by relations.  They are so terror stricken that sometimes they cannot even tell what has happened until they get support and help.  As the Minister saw, and responded favourably to, on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, people who had been victims came across on our television screens as being psychologically, physically and financially affected, although the financial aspect was not emphasised to the same degree.  One particular gentleman's appearance was one of shock and he had been attacked several months earlier.  That was one of the most talked about editions of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and the applause was an indicator of the audience's concern for the plight of the victims and the ex-Garda member who spoke so sincerely and forcefully about the plight of the victims and looked for positive help by way of victim support for them.</P>
    <P>The basic request was not for some weird and wonderful technological improvement but for the presence of more gardaí on the streets.  I live in a suburban area and had two break-ins in succession some years ago.  One occurred on a bright summer morning, despite the fact that I had a dog.  It turned out that neither he nor the fact that it was a bright summer day was a deterrent to the intruder who subsequently returned before I could get a burglar alarm.</P>
    <P>Almost all suburban houses and some in rural areas have burglar alarms.  All precautions are being taken but there are still burglaries because these people are sly, and find skilful ways of gaining access.  They have surveillance down to a fine art.  Their surveillance of a house is of Interpol standard.  They lie in wait and are ready to pounce.  As Senator Neville said, one walks at one's peril through the streets of our towns and cities.  Shop fronts are barred.  Once upon a time as you passed by an electrical shop you sneaked a glance at the main evening news on television or the racing or football results.  This is not possible now.  The streets are desolate, empty and devoid of normal life.  There is danger lurking behind every corner.  The disco devotee's <Col N="391" /> move in crowds; the late night revellers scatter to their homes and there is no loitering.</P>
    <P>Once the garda would have been seen as a figure of authority and whose presence was viewed with a sense of foreboding. The garda is now seen as a supportive figure and, in a sense, as security, but as a result of cutbacks, the number of gardaí on the beat has decreased.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned the familiar sight in rural towns and villages of neighbourhood watch or community alert. They are outward symbols of terror.  The elderly are barricaded in their homes. They should be able to live in peace and security having devoted their lives working for the community.  Again and again we discussed the closures of post offices and creameries but the last straw was the closure of rural barracks.  Communities are living behind triple locked doors and many people keep vicious dogs; it is no longer the friendly sheep dog as politicians see when canvassing.</P>
    <P>In 1985, Garda membership was 11,400 and 1990 it was 10,500.  In rural areas a number of retired gardaí were not replaced; a third of all small rural stations are without a sergeant.  In County Limerick not only little villages or what we would call crossroad settlements are without sergeants.  Towns with sizeable populations are similarly affected.  Kilfinane, Ballymurragh and Athea would like to be considered towns but, correctly speaking, they are large villages.  They are without sergeants.  The result is that the number of attacks on elderly people has increased.  Many elderly people do not have telephones and they are left without aid; it is only a caring neighbour who might detect that an attack has occurred.</P>
    <P>In a debate last year I referred to what is popularly known as the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; and having checked the system I now find that apparently it has not worked.  Public representatives have answering machines which are necessary for our lifestyles but we are exasperated by the number of callers who go off the line because they <Col N="392" /> are not tuned into an answering machine; about ten to one leave messages.  One could argue the urgency of the message but some people just drop the phone.  I say that to show that people are slow to accept new technology.</P>
    <P>I do not see people queueing up to talk to the &ldquo;green man&rdquo;.  People do not like talking through intercoms.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; was a most extraordinary innovation. I am not against innovation but the human dimension is very important when one is talking in terms of crime. Nobody needs a device like that when they are shivering and shaking with fear. They need a human being, the friendly face of a trained garda, not a machine. What research has been carried out on this system?  Has the report been published? I know there was one ready.  Are we spending money on technology that is not used?  My information is that in the Limerick area there would be formal communication with the gardaí at least 20 times a day when gardaí were present but now there are only a few dozen calls over a prolonged period.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; is no substitute for the uniformed garda.  Before introducing technology the community should be asked if they wish to have this device or the real presence of the gardaí.  If that were done I am sure the response would be to get rid of the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; and bring back the gardaí. In times of stress one wants the human dimension.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline the need for proper support for victims.  The smart slick burglar or the person who commits a sexual assault will know every movement of the gardaí and they will know who is vulnerable and when.  During the summer months in the Limerick area, taking a figure of 19 gardaí on duty, approximately five gardaí will go on leave and others are on courses and will not be replaced.  As a result of cutbacks in overtime, during the summer months a skeleton staff try to cope with increasing problems.  On a typical Sunday, of the 19 officers on duty, there were ten on duty <Col N="393" /> between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m.  The gardaí noticed that the number of crimes increased at that time, which shows the Interpol-type of surveillance mounted on the movement of gardaí.  In the Limerick area, the number of cars broken into during that time increased.  It is macabre and sad, but the number of house and car break-ins during funerals while the mourners are in the cemetery has increased.  The mind boggles at the insensitivity of these attackers.</P>
    <P>The fundamental test in deciding whether to allow bail is the likelihood of the applicant to evade justice.  His solicitor will give a guarantee that he will appear when his court hearing comes up. Some people while on bail &mdash; this has been shown statistically &mdash; waiting for their court cases to be heard, commit new crimes because they know they will get concurrent sentences.  We want bail to be refused because evidence shows that offenders continue to offend.  That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are 300,000 people on the dole. What research is being done on the relationship between unemployment and crime?  Youngsters with ambition whose futures are bleak, who are in poor housing and have low self-esteem, graduate from glue sniffing to petty crime, from joy riding and wanton vandalism to robbery and serious crime.  What is needed is early detection, the investment of resources in support systems, and the gardaí seen as figures of security and support by the community.  Children do not set out to behave badly but if they do not get support at an early stage, given all the disadvantages &mdash; the areas they live in and the lack of opportunity &mdash; they end up committing crime.</P>
    <P>We must increase the number of gardaí, get rid of the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; review the policy of policing in rural areas, deal with bail and, most of all, establish a task force involving the Departments of Justice, Health, Education and Social Welfare.  As I said, I hope this Minister <Col N="394" /> will be innovative and I look forward to immediate action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;In&rdquo; and substitute the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;noting public concern about prevailing crime levels in Ireland and accepting that Irish crime levels are extremely low by international comparisons, Seanad Éireann fully supports the Minister for Justice and the criminal justice agencies in their continuing efforts in this area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have sympathy and agree with much of what Senators Neville and Jackman said. Nonetheless it is appropriate to amend the motion.</P>
      <P>I remember many years ago as a youth reading some old copies, of the <i>Bell Magazine.</i>  Sean Ó Faolain, the Lord have mercy on him, was editor.  I remember reading a very moving article by a bank clerk who had committed a crime in the bank and had been sentenced.  It was an account of his days in jail, the effect on his family, his friends and on himself.  I suppose it was an example of what we now call white collar crime.  I felt great sympathy for him and I still feel sympathy for prisoners when I visit prisons.</P>
      <P>I also spent some time in a casualty department treating the people we think of when we talk about violent crime, people with a black eye or something like that, people with far more serious injuries from knife wounds or strangulation and people with various horrific injuries.  There one sees the effect of violent crime on the victim.  Until one has been assaulted or had someone close assaulted, or had one's house robbed, I do not believe one fully appreciates the sheer horror of a vicious criminal attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senators Neville and Jackman said. At the same time, we must have a sense of balance.  They talk of an alarming <Col N="395" /> increase of 8 per cent in the crime rate for last year.  They could have said the crime rate in Dublin was down by 8 per cent in 1989 compared with 1988.  Some of these statistics can be a little misleading but, nonetheless, I and my colleagues on this side would share their concern about crime rates.  Any violent crime or burglary is one too many but let us be clear about it.  We are very lucky in this country when we consider what is happening not only in New York or Florida &mdash; there are more deaths of young men between the ages of 15 and 30 from homicide than from any other single cause &mdash; but in other EC cities when it comes to the level of crime, particularly the relatively low levels of crime with violence.  As I say, every crime must be condemned and we must attempt to reduce the number of crimes committed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the causes of the increase in crime in this city over the last few years has been the incidence of drug taking.  I know of many chemist shops and doctors' surgeries which have been repeatedly raided by individuals hoping to find either drugs or prescription blocks so that they could write illicit prescriptions. A number of violent crimes committed in order to obtain a few pounds are carried out by drug addicts attempting to satisfy their addiction. However, there is genuine cause for concern and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, of which I am a member, has pointed to its concern, and rightly so. They carried out a survey among chamber members and the findings were very disturbing.  They had some comments and criticism to make of the criminal justice system, some of which were justified.</P>
    <P>We must look at what we mean by crime.  There are many ways to define crime.  It varies from country to country and from year to year, which is another reason statistics can be used to prove or disprove almost anything.  Most of us think of crimes with violence &mdash; a tourist <Col N="396" /> being assaulted, mugged or robbed while walking along the street or, alternatively, somebody's house being burgled and the contents strewn all over the house.  That is what we have in mind when we think of crime.</P>
    <P>There are other sorts of crime, for example white collar crime.  Computer crime is growing but I do not think that is what we have in mind when we talk about crime.  It is not something we are personally concerned and upset about as we would be if somebody was attacked, assaulted or beaten, or a house or car was robbed.</P>
    <P>Let us think about the causes of crime and face the fact that, unfortunately, crime has been with us through the ages and, human nature being what it is, it is likely to go long after we have departed the scene.  It has been shown many times that in the structure of the population when certain age groups are fairly dominant, they are more likely to be involved in some form of crime.  We have some bad social conditions in this country, though we do not have the same appalling social conditions that exist in, for example, Central or South America, where it may be a crime to steal to feed your family, but it certainly is not a sin to do so.  There are different definitions of what may be technically or really a crime.  What can we do about it?</P>
    <P>I join with Senators Neville and Jackman in their tribute to the Garda.  We hear criticisms of them at times but, by and large, they do a very good job.  I would rather approach a garda than a policeman in any other country.  They do a good job.  They are very fair.  There is no corruption and they are a magnificent force of men.  They have their difficulties and frustrations.  Probably they are most frustrated by the courts system; they know criminals with records may be released on bail and back on the streets within hours of the court hearing, or, they may be released on a technicality, failure of evidence, etc.</P>
    <P>Again we must have balance here.  We <Col N="397" /> are trying to run a fair criminal justice system and we must be very careful not to overload it too much in one direction. There is a feeling that sometimes we concentrate too much on the criminal ensuring he is not unfairly convicted and not on the victims, the frustration suffered by the gardaí and the feeling that they know who are the rascals, who is, has been and is likely to continue to be but because of the legal situation they are unable to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Neville that people should serve their full sentence for a serious crime, but again we must have balance here.  The whole object of reducing the length of time which criminals spend in jail is to encourage them to behave better in jail and, hopefully, to turn from crime when they come out.  If we say that, irrespective of their behaviour, they will serve a full sentence &mdash; particularly if it is a ten, 12 or 15 year sentence &mdash; they will have no incentive to be model prisoners to change their behaviour later.  We have problems there.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has visited Mountjoy &mdash; I am sure Senator Neville and other Senators have been there &mdash; know it is very depressing to see people in jail and to think why they are there.  We must look at the overall picture and decide who really should be there, without any ifs and buts, and kept there.  Then we must decide who should be in a custodial centre.  It is not always best to send a young person to jail.  Certain young people should be there and kept out of the way because they are evil and commit horrendous crimes; but there are others for whom sending them to jail is like sending them to a criminal academy because they come out worse than they went in.  It is very difficult to strike a balance but we must endeavour to do so.</P>
    <P>We must try to deal with the causes of crime and then try to stop them being committed; we must tackle the problem of hardened criminals who should be serving a custodial sentence; we should <Col N="398" /> encourage those who can be helped to stay out of prison and last but by no means least, we should think more about the unfortunate victims.</P>

      <P>Although I am a matter of weeks in the job of Minister for Justice I very much welcome this early opportunity to discuss the crime situation and the Government's response to it.  While I accept that the Government and the law enforcement agencies have a major role to play, I maintain that the situation also requires a response from society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Major social, economic and demographic changes are being wrought in our country.  Many of these changes have implications for tonight's debate.  In a matter of a generation, in my own lifetime, many of our institutions have undergone fundamental change.  The institutions which traditionally supported ethical conduct in young people &mdash; the family, schools, churches and the institutions of the State &mdash; no longer seem to exercise the same influence.  In a society where traditional values are undergoing challenge and change one would expect a rise in anti-social conduct and crimes against property.  This is, indeed, reflected to some extent in our situation.</P>
      <P>Demography is also central to any discussion of crime because over 70 per cent of all crime internationally is perpetrated by people under 21 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> We can draw considerable solace from the facts about the prevalence of crime in Ireland especially when we contrast our experience with that of other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>First, the crime rate here is very low compared with that prevailing among our European neighbours.  We have roughly 25 crimes recorded per 1,000 people per annum.  The comparable figures are 74 per 1,000 for England and Wales and 71 per 1,000, for Germany.  The number of indictable crimes committed in Ireland in 1990 was 87,658; the number committed in Scotland, which has a population of less than twice ours, for that year was 535,864.  Indeed, crime increased in Scotland in 1990 by 42,497 crimes, nearly half the total number of crimes in Ireland in that year.</P>
    <P>Crimes against the person constituted less than 2 per cent of all recorded crime in Ireland in 1990 which is a very low figure.  Forty per cent of all crime was against property, mostly burglaries which comprised 32 per cent of total crime. Fifty-seven per cent of all crime was in respect of larcenies; larcenies from vehicles comprised 20 per cent of total crime.</P>
    <P>I mention these figures to show that, although the indications are that the level of crime increased last year, and that in itself is of course a disappointment, it is important to consider the detailed statistics to gain a proper overview of the actual law and order situation.  Most crime is property related and property can be protected with the active participation of society supporting the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is extremely important when looking at crime figures to examine not just the movements that take place from year to year but also to look at the pattern over longer time spans.  For instance, armed raids which peaked at 685 in 1986 were down by 33 per cent by 1990 to 459.  In the same period attacks on the elderly fell by 90 per cent; <Col N="400" /> unauthorised taking of cars fell by over 40 per cent.  These are merely examples of successes which can be overlooked in the absence of detailed examination of crime statistics.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to these considerations only in the interest of balance and certainly not to give the impression that last year's crime increase is something that can be looked upon with complacency. As to figures for 1991, they are not yet finalised.  Official figures will not be available until later this year when the commissioner's annual report on crime will be published.  I can say, however, that present indications are that the final figures will show an overall increase of the order of 7 to 8 per cent.  The absence of official 1991 figures do not, however, invalidate the comparisons I am making.</P>
    <P>As soon as it became apparent last year that an upward crime trend was emerging, immediate steps were taken by the Garda authorities to address the situation. These steps include a highly targeted use of resources to deal with crime problems in different areas.  This involves the stepping up of Garda activity on the streets, the use of uniformed and plain clothes patrols on foot and in marked and unmarked cars, covert surveillance of known criminals and areas of high criminal activity, etc.  No effort is being spared in reviewing, assessing and improving these Garda anti-crime strategies.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned examples of Garda successes in recent years in the fight against crime, in tackling, for instance, attacks on the elderly and the scourge of joyriding.  However, my purpose this evening is not to play with statistics.  They are cold comfort, indeed, to the unfortunate victim of crime.  We all know, and I do not intend to labour the fact, that our gardaí are effective by any standard in dealing with crime.  I do not want law enforcement to be seen as the only response to the problem of crime but let me assure this House that I intend the gardaí to have the resources to do an even better job.  With the proper deployment <Col N="401" /> of Garda resources and the support of the wider community I know we will get the optimum result from the law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>In that regard I note that the past decade has seen the gardaí reach out to involve the public in the fight against crime through a number of very successful community-based initiatives. Community policing schemes put our gardaí in better touch with the communities they serve, working with the people and at hand when they are needed.  Neighbourhood Watch schemes have been developed throughout the country to assist the gardaí in protecting homes and property.  Community Alert members keep a watchful eye on elderly people at risk in rural areas and work with the gardaí to ensure that maximum protection is provided.</P>
    <P>A small number of urban areas are particularly hard hit at present with problems of youth vandalism and there is genuine concern among law abiding residents about public order in their neighbourhoods. This is a major issue as far as I am concerned.  The subject, however, requires and deserves a response from many agencies and Departments not just the gardaí and the criminal justice system.  That is why an interdepartmental working group is involved in preparing a special report on the topic for me.  I look forward to receiving this report within the next six weeks or so and acting upon it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on the crime problem must inevitably raise the issue of drug abuse.  Drug or substance abuse is a complex and difficult social problem, one which calls for a concerted effort from parents, teachers, voluntary and community workers, health officials and the law enforcement agencies.  Last year the Government launched a comprehensive strategy to prevent drug abuse and set realistic and achievable objectives for reduction both in the supply of, and the demand for, drugs.</P>
    <P>I applaud the excellent work of the <Col N="402" /> gardaí in targeting drug traffickers and compiling up-to-date intelligence on their activities.  I am pushing ahead with the legislation to hit these criminals where it hurts &mdash; their pockets.  Work is at an advanced stage in my Department on the Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crime and the prevention of money laundering generally.</P>
    <P>Tackling the international dimension to the drug trade, Ireland is joining with the other member states of the Community in the establishment of a Europol Drugs Unit to act as a co-ordination unit for drug related information between member states.  This unit will come into existence by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland has one of the highest police population ratios in western Europe. We have one garda for every 323 people, which compares more than favourably with, for instance, one police officer for every 400 people in England and Wales and one per 367 people in the Netherlands; it is one per a higher figure than other countries we are closely associated with.  Unlike most comparable jurisdictions, however, we have very low figures in terms of civilian staff backing up the police and relieving them of those duties and responsibilities which are not central to their policing function.  For example, we have one civilian support worker for every 20 gardaí as compared to one to every three in England and Wales.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner and his colleagues and my own staff are critically reviewing this situation now with a view to bringing the staff ratios in the Garda into line with other modern professional police forces.  This is also a matter that is receiving the attention of the Dáil Committee on Crime.  While some progress has been made to date &mdash; there are 550 civilians working in the Garda Síochána and 150 more civilians will be recruited this year &mdash; we need to do more and we are tackling that as a matter of urgency. <Col N="403" /> I have already appraised Garda management and the Garda representative bodies of my firm intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Civilianising the clerical function in the Garda is a necessary step in the effective deployment of the membership of the Force but I have no intention of putting the crime problem on hold until we achieve our civilianisation targets.  Far from it.  Side by side with long term objectives, we need, and, as I have already indicated, we are making, an immediate and determined law enforcement response to the current situation.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the outset about the huge social changes we are confronting as a society and the need for a positive response by our national institutions.  The Garda Síochána are not just changing their tactics and the technology they employ in the fight against crime.  The whole process of recruitment to and training in the Force has been drastically updated.  Young men and women with a high standard of education and intelligence are now competing on equal terms to enter a career in policing.  They go through a two year induction/training course &mdash; it used to be only six months &mdash; which is a far cry from the old drill and rote learning which characterised the Garda training approach in the past.</P>
    <P>A knowledge of principles of sociology, clinical psychology and modern communications as well as standard forensic skills, are all encouraged and fostered in today's trainee garda.  We are making real progress in producing modern police officers to face the modern policing challenge.  Up the line in the Force management training involving lectures from IMI staff and commercial practitioners is now being provided for all Garda chief superintendents and superintendents.</P>
    <P>The criminal law in Ireland is used every day to bring criminals to justice. Very rarely does the system let down the law abiding citizen or the victim of crime. <Col N="404" /> Although our criminal law is substantially an inheritance from our colonial past, Governments have considerably updated this inheritance, particularly over the past 2 years.  Moreover, several further major initiatives are in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>Indeed, significant progress has been made in this regard since the present Government took office.  Specifically, in the area of crime we have enacted the Larceny Act, 1990 which strengthens the law considerably in relation to a whole range of offences connected with the theft of goods; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 which bans stun guns and controls the availability and possession of crossbows, knives and other dangerous objects; the Criminal Law, (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, which criminalises marital rape, improves substantially the legal protection for victims of rape and other sexual assaults and puts in place procedures to reduce the distress that can be suffered during trials by those victims; the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which gives the Gardaí the power to take bodily samples from persons suspected of serious offences for subsequent forensic testing.  This includes the test of DNA or genetic fingerprinting. The Criminal Damage Act, 1991, simplifies and modernises the law of criminal damage to property.  It also facilitates the courts in requiring offenders to pay compensation to owners of damaged property.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, now before the other House, will reform the law of evidence in several respects.  It will make it easier for children and persons with mental handicap to give evidence in cases of physical or sexual abuse.  It sets out clearly the circumstances in which the spouse or a former spouse of an accused person is to be competent or compellable to give evidence.  It makes business records, including computerised records, admissible in evidence and it will help <Col N="405" /> to bring to justice persons who commit crimes against tourists.</P>
    <P>As far as thuggery and intimidation on the street is concerned &mdash; a matter of considerable concern to me at present &mdash; I am giving top priority to the early production of a Bill to modernise the law in this regard as recommended some years back by the Law Reform Commission. The new provisions contained in this Bill will apply to adults as well as to persons under 18.  They will include the creation of offences relating to (a) persons being found drunk, or under the influence of drugs, in such circumstances that they are a danger to themselves or others; (b) the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place; and (c) disorderly conduct as, for instance, shouting, singing or boisterous conduct between the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. in circumstances which cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>The gardaí will be given powers of arrest in relation to these new offences. Offenders will be liable to substantial fines and, if drink is involved, I intend that the gardaí will have the power to confiscate it on the spot.</P>

      <P>I also have proposals on hands to amend the criminal law in relation to extradition, juvenile justice, criminal insanity and miscarriage of justice, among other areas.</P>
      <P>The prison system plays a vital role in protecting the community against the actions of criminal elements in our society.  It contains in custody some 2,200 prisoners at any one time and copes with an annual throughput of something approaching 8,000 prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new institution, which accommodates 320 persons recently came into full operation at Wheatfield.  Work is currently in progress on the provision of a new unit at Mountjoy, the refurbishment <Col N="406" /> of St. Patrick's Institution and the renovation of the detention centre at the Curragh. When completed, these units will provide accommodation for 180 more offenders.  Since 1985 there has been a total investment in excess of £76 million in the prison building programme.  This is a clear indication of the Government's commitment in this regard.  The question of whether further accommodation needs to be provided in the prison system is a matter that is kept under continual review, having regard also, of course, to the need to refurbish on a phased basis much of the existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The long term public interest is best served when prisons are used only as a last resort and when a comprehensive range of effective alternatives, including community service orders, are fully employed.  At present, there are over 3,200 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the strict supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. That is about one-and-a-half times the number of persons who are in custody. Of these, over 700 persons are on community service orders.  The total number of community service orders made by the courts in the period from 1985, when the scheme began, to the end of November 1991, is 7,332.</P>
    <P>In addition a new scheme of intensive supervision which provides for the close monitoring and supervision of offenders in the community by the Probation and Welfare Service commenced in recent weeks.  This scheme when fully operational will accommodate up to 200 offenders who would otherwise have to be held in custody.  My Department are constantly reviewing the scope for extending the use of community service orders and at present are considering, in particular, the feasibility of extending them to fine defaulters.</P>
    <P>Accusations that a &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; system operates in our prison system are without foundation.  Those who allege that prisoners are released in some haphazard way do not understand how our <Col N="407" /> system of conditional temporary release works.  I ask that Senators pay some attention to this matter because some recent reporting in newspapers has given the wrong impression and is both misleading and mischievous.  Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, the Minister for Justice may authorise releases in particular cases.  Offenders are granted temporary release for varying reasons for short periods &mdash; for example, three days a week &mdash; under certain conditions.  All these releases have standard conditions which include the obligation to keep the peace, be of good behaviour and of sober habits.  Other conditions are added, as appropriate, such as a requirement to report daily to the Garda Síochána, to be supervised by the Probation and Welfare Service or to reside at prescribed hostels. Any person breaching any of these conditions is liable to rearrest and immediate return to prison to serve the remainder of the sentence.</P>
    <P>The criteria by which individual cases are assessed include the nature of the offence, the offender's previous criminal history, attitude while in custody, length of sentence served and a Garda assessment of the risk, if any, which may be posed to the community by a particular release.  The overriding concern when assessing cases for release is the protection of the public.</P>
    <P>Our conditional temporary release scheme is our system of parole and, as is well known, parole systems are a feature of all civilised societies the world over. Indeed, the flexibility of our system and the substantial measure of control which it affords over the behaviour of offenders while in the community is widely admired by penological experts in other countries, who constantly refer to the success of our parole system.  It is inaccurate to refer constantly to a &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; system. That is not true and it should be resisted by Members of this House because it is inaccurate and misleading.</P>
    <P>While it cannot be denied that pressure <Col N="408" /> on accommodation is a factor in some early releases, it should be understood it is only one factor in a decision to release an individual prisoner and all releases are judged in the light of the above criteria. In administering sentences for serious offences, shortage of accommodation is not a consideration.  It is important that that point gets across to those who engage in serious crime.  For them there is not nor will there be any early release.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of punishment, the law provides maximum sentences that may be imposed and these are very severe for serious crime.  For example, the maximum penalty for rape, aggravated sexual assault and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for larceny is ten years, and for handling stolen property 14 years.</P>
    <P>The penalty to be imposed in any case is a matter for the judge in the light of all the circumstances and any mitigating factors.  Since the circumstances of cases will be different actual sentences imposed will be different &mdash; that is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that as is sometimes said the courts generally are too lenient. For example, in January 1988, the latest date for which figures have been published, there were 23 rapists serving sentences of ten years or more and 22 serving between five and ten years.  Many fines fixed years ago are now out of date.  I am preparing legislation to provide for a system of indexing fines so that their value will not be eroded with time.</P>
    <P>The general question of sentencing policy is being considered by the Law Reform Commission and I will act on their report when I have received it.</P>
    <P>Despite what I have said, cases may occur where the actual sentence imposed by the court may appear to be too lenient having regard to the offence.  That raises the question of whether the prosecution should be able to appeal against lenient sentences.  That is a matter on which I expect the Law Reform Commission to make recommendations in their report <Col N="409" /> on sentencing policy.  I would like to have that aspect cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to close my contribution, a Chathaoirligh, on a note of absolute candour.  Ministers for Justice on their own can no more prevent crime than ministers of religion can prevent sin.  We can only seek to provide a positive influence in both cases.  The people who commit crime are people who have parents, who belong to families.  They are people with friends and neighbours many of whom know exactly what they are up to.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have an influence over others &mdash; parents, community leaders, teachers and so on &mdash; all have an important leadership role to play in preventing juvenile delinquency.  And let no one forget that juvenile delinquency is the main source of crime in our country. When a juvenile does offend a swift decisive response by the community is essential. If we had more decisiveness with regard to juvenile offenders, we might see a large decrease in the level of crime.</P>
    <P>The message must go out to everyone from this debate: alert the gardaí if you know something.  They can and will act. They are well resourced to do so.  Furthermore, the range of interventions for young offenders is widening and becoming more effective all the time.  There is concern in Government as in this House about the level of crime and the fear of crime.  Action is being taken to address the situation.  The emphasis now and in the future will be on tackling the problem in and within the community or neighbourhood where it occurs.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators I have heard so far.  While I will not get an opportunity to hear all the contributions I would like to refer to Senator Neville's remark about special courts for special arrangements. There is a small claims court operating in three different locations in Ireland at this time and it will be extended in due course.  I hope the Senator will welcome this innovation and we like to think it will be a success.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> Senator Jackman mentioned in passing the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; as if the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; was connected to an answering machine. That is not the case.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; is activated by a live man on the other end. There is no answering machine doing the &ldquo;green man's&rdquo; talking.  A little more understanding of how the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; works might facilitate a grasp of the purpose of the system.  I look forward to further remarks in the debate.</P>

      <P>I was delighted with the Minister's promotion; as a fellow teacher I was more than pleased.  He is a member of the INTO and has given solid service to the teachers' union.</P>
      <P>There is one point I would like to refer to immediately and I speak without any party affiliation.  The Minister made a comment with which I agree in the course of his presentation; many mischievous comments are made by people at senior levels; that did not begin this year or last year.  I recall a member of the present Government as a front bench spokesperson on Justice calling for the resignation of the then Minister for Justice following a suicide in Mountjoy.  I am sick of hearing toffee nosed politicians pronounce here every time there is a suicide in some penal institution.  I wonder when it is going to stop?</P>
      <P>Suicides do not take place only in jail. They take place in schools, homes and at football pitches.  What are we going to do?  Are we going to start blaming the school principals or the parents?  Every time there is a suicide a programmed response, like pressing a button, where spokesperson after spokesperson calls for somebody's head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that he is not here because I have had this speech in my head for a long time.  It is unfair that <Col N="411" /> we blame people in charge of institutions. Closing rural Garda stations is a similar case; that is being made a political football as well.  I know something of the closing down of small schools myself; it arouses the same emotive response. Sometimes it is the wrong course of action to take and sometimes it is right. We must consider not only the loss of a Garda station but whether the Force and service are improved.  I speak as the son of a Garda who knows something about that way of life.</P>
      <P>The points the Minister made regarding the need for reasoned responsible comment from those in political positions are valid.  I invite the Minister to read the report from the latest meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The most extraordinary points were made at that committee about crime and lawlessness in the course of an investigation of the Secretary of the Department of Education. On the question of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime there was a long discussion on the secure unit centres for juvenile delinquents in various parts of the country.  The point made was that the efficiency and effectiveness of these institutions and the effectiveness of Government and State Departments in dealing with juvenile delinquency could be determined by the level of bed occupancy of these units.  That goes against all available evidence.  The question of filling our institutions has never been seen as a solution to crime.  It is far too facile a response and I ask the Minister to take an early opportunity of hammering that one on the head.  Law must be enforced and I go along completely with the points the Minister and Senator Conroy made.  Some people deserve to have their liberty taken from them for a period because they are a danger and a threat to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not help when elected public representatives of the Minister's party in the Dáil call for something as animalistic as the reintroduction of whipping for <Col N="412" /> young offenders.  That is worse than mischievous. It is exploitation by the hang them and flog them brigade in order to get cheap tabloid publicity to gain a few votes from people who do not know any better.  It is pub talk given an importance far beyond its merit by having it enshrined in the proceedings of a senior Oireachtas committee.  The Minister will have made his position on that quite clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution twice mentioned the need for vigilance, support and development from teachers in the community. In my remaining ten minutes next week I intend to develop that point.  We should welcome the Minister's commitment to children and the mentally handicapped being able to give evidence.  This is a serious issue which needed to be addressed.  Two examples of that occurred in serious sexual abuse cases in the last week.  Despite the Minister's assurances I do not believe he will bring in the legislation he promised on the seizure of goods in order to prevent the laundering of the proceeds of crime. So far, I have heard four Ministers promise that, and it always goes back to our Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject I would like to bring to the <Col N="413" /> Minister's attention this evening is the care for elderly people in the Western Health Board region, and particularly people living in Connemara.</P>
    <P>The problem arises because of organisational resources within the health board.  At present elderly people needing full-time care and attention are all channelled through St. Brendan's Hospital in Loughrea.  Subsequently, if they are lucky, they can be transferred to other homes within the county.  To highlight the serious problem we face in this regard, I put it to the Minister that if I or he suggested that people in Dublin had to be sent to Ballinasloe for an extended period before a place could be found for them in a Dublin home for the elderly, there would be social outcry.  St. Brendan's, Loughrea, is 25 miles from Galway city and many places in Connemara are 50 to 55 miles on the other side of Galway city.  This means many old people are cared for in homes 80 miles from the residence of the relatives; that entails a return trip of 160 miles to visit them.  At the very conservative costing of 20p per mile the cost to visit a relative from Carna, Cleggan, Ballyconneely or Clifden would be around £32.  Since a large number of the people in this area are unemployed, the obvious burden placed on them is intolerable.</P>
    <P>This also involves social dislocation. Taking people out of their natural environment and putting them into a totally different environment is unsatisfactory.  I know St. Brendan's in Loughrea is an excellent home, I accept that.  Nobody who has any contact with the services would deny that.  I am not implying any criticism of the care or the standard of nursing in St. Brendan's.  There would, however, appear to be a lack of resources or a lack of organisation which is causing all the people to be channelled through one hospital.</P>
    <P>A further problem arises in this area in that St. Brendan's is in the Galltacht and therefore is particularly unsuited to deal with patients from Gaeltacht areas. <Col N="414" /> These patients often become disorientated when taken from the normal linguistic surroundings and when they have to deal with nurses and doctors, etc., through the medium of English. Most of these old people have a certain amount of English but I know from my extensive experience dealing with people in that area, their first language is Irish, and particularly in times of stress they revert to the Irish language.  Therefore, the extension of the provision of care and services through the medium of the Irish language to these patients is also a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will accept this point and understand it because of his experiences as a medical practitioner.  It tends to be underestimated as a human problem, particularly when dealing with old people.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to ensure first, that all elderly patients needing care will be directed towards the home geographically nearest to them and that whatever further resources are needed will be made available to help in this organisation.  I also hope that further facilities could be made available in Merlin Park Hospital, if facilities cannot be provided in Connemara, because Galway city tends to be a convenient location for many people in the greater Connemara area.  Galway city is the shopping and business centre.  It is the town to which most people gravitate when they want to do business.  To add another round trip of 50 miles imposes terrible strains on people.  I would like an investigation to be carried out to ensure that further facilities will be provided in the existing homes in Clifden and Carraroe.</P>
    <P>Ar an gCeathrú Rua tá cúram anmhaith á thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina dteanga féin.  Tá comhluadar a bpobail féin acu agus tuiscint acu dá chéile agus tá na daoine ansin sona sásta. Chuirfeadh sé go mór leis na seirbhísí dá bhféadfaí díriú ar an ionad áirithe sin. Bítear i gcónaí ag caint ar an nGaeilge agus ar thábhacht na teanga ach bímse in <Col N="415" /> amhras go minic faoi bhealaí in a gcaitear airgead ar an nGaeilge.  Dá gcuirfí na cúraimí seo ar fáil i dteanga an phobail bheadh dea-thoradh ar an gcaiteachas airgid, ó thaobh leas an phobail de agus a sláinte, agus ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the Western Health Board area there is a rigid adherence to county boundaries.  County committees ensure that elderly people must be admitted to a home within their own county.  In the Cong area, a ludicrous situation arises.  Cong village is in County Mayo, but 100 yards out of the village you are in County Galway.  If you live on the Galway side of the border, rather than being placed in Castlebar you have no option but to go to Loughrea.  This seems ludicrous.  Castlebar is 25 miles from Cong; Loughrea is 50 miles away. That an imaginary line in a health board area could cause this type of dislocation and inconvenience is bureaucracy gone mad.  We are always talking about trying to put a human face on our services. The resources needed to reorganise this service would not be very great.  It is about time the Western Health Board instead of looking at people from the point of administrative convenience directed their attention to addressing the human realities.  The old deserve better; their relations deserve better.  In any other part of the country this would not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The people in the rural areas tend to be very patient.  While they consistently beg us in clinics and wherever they meet us to address this problem, they have waited very patiently for a response.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to end what I consider a scandal which would not be tolerated in any city; nor would it be tolerated if many of the people involved had the social clout to ensure that their voices were heard. These people are not looking for much but they deserve to be treated with dignity in their old age.  They want care of <Col N="416" /> the elderly to be an extension of the community; they feel that people should not be uprooted and moved to areas that are distant from their families.  I know the Minister, with his very human approach, would agree with that.  I ask him to consider seriously what I have said here this evening.  The benefit of reorganising this service to the social fabric of life in the west would be tremendous.  The resources spend would give a thousand-fold return in terms of human thanks and respect.</P>
    <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch den Aire as ucht teacht agus éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá agam.  Is ceist bhunúsach í seo do mhuintir Chonamara.

      <P>The report of the working party on services for the elderly <i>The Years Ahead</i> provides a blueprint for the development of services for the elderly.  The recommendations of the report have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  As part of the Government's commitment to improving health services for the elderly as recommended in this document substantial additional funds were made available to the Western Health Board in 1990 and 1991.  These funds amount to £954,972.  In 1990 the board used the funds to enhance community services for the elderly in line with the Minister's priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly in the west have benefited from increased levels of home help, home nursing, day care and the rate of remuneration to persons providing the boarding-out scheme for elderly people was increased.  Last year, the board used this money to carry out improvements to day care centres at Carraroe, County <Col N="417" /> Galway and Claremorris, County Mayo. It is hoped to provide day care services in Clifden, County Galway this year.  This investment in services for the elderly had led to a substantial improvement in services for the elderly which I hope will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The number of long stay beds recommended in <i>The Years Ahead</i> is ten beds per 1,000 elderly.  This figure is dependent on having 2.5 assessment beds per 1,000 elderly in specialist departments of geriatric medicine in general hospitals and three beds per 1,000 elderly for rehabilitation in general or community hospitals.  At present, there are 1,312 long stay places available for the elderly in the Western Health Board area.  The total number of people in the Western Health Board area aged 65 and over is 48,893 as per the 1991 census.  This gives a ratio of 37 beds per 1,000 elderly in the region.</P>
    <P>In addition to the health board homes, there are 679 places in private nursing homes of which 178 are subvented by the health board.  The Senator will be interested to know that my Department are at an advanced stage with preparations to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The Act provides for a new relationship between health boards and nursing homes.  The health boards will register nursing homes, both private and voluntary, and keep an eye on standards by six monthly inspections. The Act will also enable a health board to pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home for a person whom it has assessed as needing nursing care and who cannot afford to pay for such care.  The Act will provide the health board with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly, locally and flexibly.  It is my intention to commence the Act as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the increase in the grant payable to householders providing boarding-out places for elderly people. Boarding-out is a very desirable solution for the problems of certain elderly people <Col N="418" />&mdash; for those who are no longer fit enough to live alone but who do not need hospital care; for those living in social isolation and for hospital patients who are not able to return to living alone.</P>
    <P>At present the Western Health Board operate a boarding-out scheme in each of its three counties.  Sixty-nine elderly people are in the scheme at present.  The public health nurse visits the household regularly and a senior public health nurse visits approximately every six months. The board pay a grant of £25 per week per patient to the carer.  In addition it is recommended by the health board that the person being boarded out pays the carer half the old age pension per week. Regulations are currently being drafted to cover boarding-out arrangements under section 10 (2) of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The board inform me that they are happy with the scheme and plan to expand it.</P>
    <P>I recognise that much remains to be done to improve services for the elderly in the Western Health Board area.  The board's community care catchment areas are vast.</P>
    <P>I have been given a note.  The location of existing homes in the Galway community care is such that considerable travelling distances are involved for relatives of the residents when visiting.  This is not surprising as this health board as is the largest in the State.  I was not aware of that until I received that message from Mr. Eamon Hannan.</P>
    <P>I recognise now what remains to be done to improve services for the elderly in the Western Health Board area.  I fully appreciate that many of the relatives visiting residents in homes have to travel considerable distances.  My Department have received applications from the board for the provision of homes for the aged at Ballinasloe, County Galway, Roscommon town, Ballinrobe, County Mayo and Portumna, County Galway, and these will be considered in line with other competing projects.  I would ask the Senator to accept the commitment of <Col N="419" /> this Government to the development of services for the elderly in the west as shown by the generous additional funding for services for the elderly in the last few years.</P>
    <P>I have paid particular attention to the points raised by the Senator in relation to Merlin Park, to the question of patients being directed to the home nearest to them and the Western Health Board's rigid adherence to county boundaries which I will discuss with them immediately. <Col N="420" /> I would like to assure the Senator that a human face will be put on the services and that matters will not be arranged simply to suit administrative convenience.  I accept that it is very serious for a person to be placed in an alien environment.  I agree with everything the Senator said in regard to this and I hope to make the changes as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 April 1992.</P>
