      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that people employed on a part-time basis, on one, two or three days per week, receive a reasonable level of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Haughey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Energy to report further on the operation of the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant following a further leak in September 1992 causing the temporary closure of the plant; and following an application by BNFL to obtain appropriate radioactive and chemical effluent discharge authorisations for THORP.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Reilly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to reconsider the appointment of a teacher to St. Michael's junior school, Cootehill, County Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> I also received notice from Senator D. Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to investigate the manner in which music users are disadvantaged by copyright organisations.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that participation by unemployed people in the vocational training and opportunities scheme remains entirely voluntary.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The delay in starting work on the reconstruction of the Central Model School, Marlborough Street, and the need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the work begins in 1992.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville, Haughey, O'Reilly, Kiely, Ryan and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Neville's and Haughey's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators O'Reilly, Kiely, Ryan and Costello may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 &mdash; the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, Second Stage. I suspect that we will need more time, because I understand from the interest in the Bill that the debate may take another day.  We will also take item 16, motion 47.</P>
      <P>Item 1 will be taken from now until 6 p.m. and item No. 16 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, would the Leader of the House, either today or tomorrow &mdash; and we will be prepared to sit longer tomorrow &mdash;<Col N="323" /> make time available for an emergency debate on the crisis in Aer Lingus?  I know this question is of interest to him, as it is to many Members.  It would be extremely useful if we could have time today or tomorrow to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>Second, the Leader of the House supplied me with a programme of proposed legislation which may be coming here this session.  Either today or tomorrow, perhaps he could give some indication of the Bills which he believes will be coming before this House this session.</P>
      <P>Third, as a follow up to the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion last week on the Press Council, would the Leader be prepared to make time available to debate the Law Reform Commission's proposal on the laws of libel and defamation? This is a matter in which many Members might have an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader of the House to give us some indication today of the programme for next week when we are to debate the three referenda Bills.  I hope he will indicate clearly that there will be at least three full days of discussion in this House as there has been in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House if he can give us an indication of the nature of the technical problem which is preventing or delaying the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill being taken a stage further.  I support the call from Senator Manning for an emergency debate on the crisis in Aer Lingus. Indeed, I express my dismay that these matters seem to come like a bolt out of the blue and, in many ways, I would have hoped that such matters would be dealt with in a more orderly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first express concern about the ordering of business, and in particular what occurred last week when we had two very important debates &mdash; one on employment and one on the economy &mdash; together?  A very large number of people who wanted to speak, and who waited in an orderly manner, did not get <Col N="324" /> in to speak, partly because no time limit was imposed and Senators spoke for an hour or three-quarters of an hour.  Many speakers, both from the Government side and from this side, wished to speak. Obviously, I am not going to attempt to subvert the procedure of the House by making a speech on this issue, but I think it appropriate, a Chathaoirligh, and I am sure you agree, that we should make an attempt to tidy this up because we are trying to accede to the new orders in the House.  This does relate to the fact that unemployment is a continuing problem and I strongly endorse what&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making a speech now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have moved on to another issue, which is to support strongly what Senator Manning and Upton said about the situation in regard to Aer Lingus.  I will put one phrase on the record and it is this.  We have seen the crisis in Great Britain with 30,000 jobs to go in the mining industry.  This is proportionately as significant as that catastrophe is for the English.</P>
      <P>May I formally move an amendment to the Order of Business?  I propose that we should take item 16, motion 35, in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan, Senator John A. Murphy and myself, about the response of the Government to the European Court case.  In so doing, may I point out to the House that this is not an attempt to open up a discussion of the substantive issue &mdash; to use the phrase current at the moment &mdash; of homosexuality. That issue has been dealt with by the European Court.  What we are dealing with is the Govenment's abrogation of their responsibilities towards fundamental human rights.  It is a matter I feel very strongly about &mdash; not homosexuality but fundamental rights and the response of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on national airline policy and on the crisis in Aer Lingus.  It now looks as if job losses are inevitable and the very survival of the airline is at risk.  An urgent <Col N="325" /> debate on the matter is needed and I call on the Leader to give that serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the suggestion made by Senator O'Toole that we get some direction in relation to the Order of Business for next week, hopefully tomorrow.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matter raised about initiating major legislation in this House, I would like to hear from the Leader whether legislation is to be initiated in this session and whether major issues will be discussed.  I did suggest that the White Paper on the divorce referendum would be an appropriate matter for the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the comments made by Senator Norris in relation to the debate last week &mdash; that there was not sufficient time allowed because there was no time limit on speeches &mdash; it would be appropriate that a time limit would be imposed on the statements on the Green Paper on Education tomorrow so that everybody gets the chance to contribute as we have been waiting for this opportunity for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>I would like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we take Motion No. 46 in the name of the Labour Party:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to draw up an Air Transport Policy for Ireland incorporating SIPTU's proposals for Govenment Equity Funding for Aer Lingus; and outlining further proposals for European Structural Funding for our national Airline which plays a critical role in our island's transport infrastructure in trading with our European colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in line with the suggestions from all sides of the House that we have an urgent debate on Aer Lingus because of the enormous implications for jobs. There are proposals for a loss of 1,000 jobs, and a threat to 2,000 and the Minister is attending a board meeting of Aer Lingus tomorrow.  It would be appropriate that we have a debate on his <Col N="326" /> matter, especially since it concerns the constituency of the Leader of the House, and no doubt he will have a personal interest in it.  In the past we have been unable to respond quickly to urgent serious matters.  Since this motion is on the Order Paper, and in view of the desire to have a debate on Aer Lingus and the importance of the issues arising from it, I suggest that we take it as the first item on the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator Norris's proposed amendment to the Order of Business and say that he has put it as succinctly as anybody could.  It is no longer a question of homosexuality; it is a question of whether this country takes its international obligations seriously.  We do not define human rights at home any more; we have surrendered that right to the European Court of Human Rights.  If we choose to ignore then when they say we are in breach of human rights, we are saying, essentially, that we do not take our international obligations seriously.  We have a Minister for Foreign Affairs doing a good job of improving our image in these areas.  This is precisely the way to turn things backwards. It is extremely important that our Government sort themselves out and stop running away from a hard issue just because they do not think it is important.</P>
      <P>Second, I associate myself very strongly with Senator O'Toole's request for adequate and sufficient time to debate the three referenda proposals we will be receiving from the other House next week.  I do not know why but we never had the promised debate on the outcome to the X case.  It would be a salutary insult to this House if we were not given enough time.</P>
      <P>On the question of Aer Lingus, let me say to the Members opposite that a backbench rebellion was extremely effective in saving the jobs of British miners; similar action here might be as affective in saving the jobs of Aer Lingus workers in the next week or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request for a discussion on the Law <Col N="327" /> Reform report on defamation.  I would also like to ask the Leader if he would grant time next week for a debate on motion No. 41 &mdash; the report of the Sixth Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which deals with Bord na gCon.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if he would take on board motion No. 48:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in view of the High Court decision on the Stamp case, calls on the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that adopted children have equal rights with children born within marriage.</P>
      <P>I would consider this to be a very simple legislative requirement and could be introduced to this House with very little difficulty and all-party agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader to indicate to the House what progress has been made in relation to the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill and he promised me a written reply.  I would like to jog his memory.  I know it is only one week later, but I await earnestly his words of wisdom on the state of that Bill.  Perhaps he could indicate this afternoon to the House what has happened. We will be supporting the amendment to the Order of Business today on the basis that this Government have reneged on their international obligations and their obligations in the human rights areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion by Senator Costello to have the Order of Business amended to take motion No. 46 first.  There is a very serious situation obtaining in Aer Lingus.  One of the biggest employers in the country is in a state of emergency.  Aer Lingus workers have put forward many proposals which have not yet received a public hearing.  They have also made a major contribution to the well being of Aer Lingus.  It is of the utmost necessity that we hear the full story of the contribution of both employers and employees in order to put this problem into perspective.  I appeal to <Col N="328" /> the Leader of the House today to give this issue the urgency it deserves.  We are talking about the loss of a substantial number of jobs in an already high unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if it is possible to arrange for an early debate on the air transport industry, which was referred to here many times in recent months, with particular reference on this occasion to Aer Lingus, and to embody in that the position <i>vis-a-vis</i> Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been mentioned, I am acutely aware of the situation in Aer Lingus.  I share the concerns expressed on all sides of the House and agree with Senator Manning, Senator Haughey and others who are asking for a debate.  It is known that the Minister will meet with the board of Aer Lingus tomorrow.  Following that meeting I am sure we can arrange an opportunity to debate the problems there.  It is not a local issue; our national airline is part of our national economy.  I suggest we await the outcome of tomorrow's meeting before we have a debate on it.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about Bills that would be taken this session.  We circulated what we could to the Party Leaders and Whips &mdash; the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, 1989, the one we are debating at the moment; the Roads Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, the Criminal Justice Bill, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, the Appropriation Bill and the Unfair Dismissals Bill.  They are the Bills I know at this stage that we will be taking, but as we go along I will keep the House informed of other Bills we will be dealing with.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, 1991, which was mentioned by several Senators today, I have written to the Department and am awaiting a reply in regard to the technical reasons we are not dealing with the Bill at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Law Reform Commission <Col N="329" /> report on libel and defamation, that is something we can deal with in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and others asked about next week's business.  We will definitely be sitting three days next week; more than likely those days will be Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  The situation is fluid in the other House at present.  It is changing with each Order of Business and I await the outcome of the week.  My understanding is that we will certainly be sitting Wednesday, Thursday and Friday next week, with the possibility of a Saturday sitting as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris and others mentioned last week's debate on the economy and jobs.  I have always maintained that that is an ongoing situation and I see several more opportunities for us to come back on it.  I understand the Senators concern that, because speeches had not a time limit on them, there was not sufficient time for everyone to contribute.  From now on we will put time limits on speeches to ensure that as many people as possible may contribute on whatever item is being discussed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> We will have the Green Paper on Education tomorrow.  The Minister will open the debate at 10.30 a.m.  I will be suggesting 15 minutes for the main spokespersons and ten minutes for speakers with the Minister coming back to this House after Question Time in the Dáil. The Minister hopes to be here between 4 p.m. and 4.15 p.m. and we will sit until 5 p.m.  That is a suggestion.  If the House feels that we need longer, that is open for consideration.  I would like to see as many people as possible contributing to that debate because there is a lot of interest in it.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform Senator Neville that Motion No. 41 will be taken in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the winding-up of the Land Commission and the transfer of its residual functions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to go into the history of the Land Commission.  We all acknowledge that it is an ancient institution that has been closely associated with the land situation in this country for over 100 years.  The Land Commission was originally set up in 1881 as a rent fixing body under the Land Law (Ireland) Act of that year.  It subsequently developed by law into a tenant-purchase agency and <Col N="333" /> as such was the body responsible for the dismantling of the landlord system and the conversion of tenants into proprietors. Ultimately, it embarked on a countrywide programme of land structural reform and became a great purchaser and distributor of land.  Its prime objective at this stage was to relieve congestion. This objective was to be attained through the enlargement and rearrangement of small holdings and through migration.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that the Land Commission was effective in pursuing its aims. The figures speak for themselves.  Since 1923 over 108,000 tenants were assisted in purchasing almost three million acres and over two million acres were distributed among uneconomic small-holders, migrants and others.  In addition, the Land Commission carried out extensive improvement works.  It built houses and outoffices, it carried out drainage, reclamation and fencing and it provided roads and water supplies.</P>
    <P>By the end of the 1970s, however, the traditional activity of the Land Commission &mdash; that of acquiring and redistributing land &mdash; was running into difficulties.  In the first place there were by this time very few large estates available for acquisition.  The Land Commission could, of course, have continued to acquire smaller unused farms but such acquisitions had very little impact on structural improvement.  Indeed, it was becoming increasingly obvious that the effort and costs involved in acquiring these smaller properties could not be justified in terms of results.  In the second place land prices had risen at an unprecedented rate during the seventies and were by this time far in excess of what the Land Commission could recover on allotment.  The level of subsidy involved in resale was putting an increasing and unacceptable burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee set up to examine the land question concluded that the policy of acquisition and redistribution executed by the Land Commission had outlived its usefulness and should be abandoned.  Acquisition ceased in 1983 and the Bill before the <Col N="334" /> House is designed to give statutory effect to this position.</P>
    <P>Briefly the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Land Commission, i.e., the abolition of the offices of the judicial commissioner and the lay commissioners; the revocation of the power of the State to compulsorily take over land, except by exchange, for land settlement purposes, the transfer to the President of the High Court of the jurisdictions vested in the office of the judicial commissioner and in the appeal tribunal, the transfer to the Minister for Agriculture and Food of certain functions of the commission and the three lay commissioners, the transfer to the Minister of all land and other property vested in the Commission, with the exception of fishing rights and fisheries which will be transferred to the Central Fisheries Board and the payment of compensation to the lay commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to make clear at this stage that the dissolution of the Land Commission does not mean the end of all services in relation to land settlement. Apart from the acquisition and division of land all the other services will continue. These include the disposal of the small area of land remaining on hands the revesting in the names of the new owners of land already allotted/and of land yet to be allotted the exercise of statutory control over the subdivision of farms and over the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, mainly companies and non-EC nationals, the promotion of group purchase and leasing of land as well as provision of assistance for schemes for rearrangement and commonage division, and miscellaneous statutory and other obligations, such as the collection of annuities, custody of title documents, the management of lands awaiting disposal and responsibilities of the offices of Examiner of Title and the Public Trustee. These services will be discharged by a special unit of the Department under the aegis of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about two of these services in particular, the division of commonages and leasing.  A considerable area of land is held in common particularly in the west of <Col N="335" /> Ireland.  We all know that such land is generally neglected with the result that productivity is low.  There also is a greater risk of animal disease where herds are inter-mixing freely.  It is desirable from the point of view of better land use and the control of disease that these commonages be divided between the various shareholders involved and the new plots incorporated into the shareholders' existing holdings.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Department mounted a campaign to encourage farmers in this direction.  The response has been highly gratifying.  Over the past ten years the total number of commonages divided was 389 among 2,074 shareholders and involving an area of 14,697 hectares.  As there is still a considerable area to be divided, the Department will continue to give advice and assistance in relation to commonage division.</P>
    <P>Owner-occupiership has been the dominant form of land tenure in this country for over 80 years.  While ownership has advantages it also has a downside in the sense that it prevents movement in land.  In an effort to liberalise the system the Government set about popularising the concept of medium and long term leasing some years ago.  To this end legislation was introduced removing any disabilities which a lessor might suffer through leasing.  Following the enactment of this legislation, there was an upsurge in the amount of land being leased.  Of late, however, the movement has slowed down.  Recent measures by the Government should help to revive interest in it.</P>
    <P>Under the young farmers installation aid scheme a young farmer is entitled to a premium of £5,600 on taking over a farm for the first time.  Up to now this farm would have had to be owned.  Under new relaxations which have been introduced the farm may now be leased.</P>
    <P>The pre-retirement scheme for farmers which was approved by the EC earlier this year, provides a generous pension for farmers over 55 years of age who sell or lease their farms to suitable applicants. It is considered that these two measures <Col N="336" /> should give a major boost to leasing and farmer mobility.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, widely acknowledged that the Land Commission played a very positive role in maximising the number of families on the land in economic security. Unfortunately, the size of holding necessary to provide economic security where traditional farming enterprises are involved has increased significantly over the years and we must accept that to cling to a policy of land acquisition and redistribution would seriously undermine our own stated social policy in this area and would ultimately serve to reduce the number of family farms.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was going through the Dáil Deputies on both sides of the House were concerned that there was no proposal for a new land policy to replace the traditional one.  The main concern was to ensure that land coming on the market was channelled into the hands of young progressive farmers.  This is an objective to which we all subscribe.  Unfortunately, it is simpler in theory than implementation. For some time now the whole question of such a land policy has been under examination in the Department. In the course of this examination several options were put forward but it was felt that the exercising of any of them could create more problems than it would solve.</P>
    <P>The basic fact is that any attempt to control the movement of land implies an interference with the right to free sale. As this right is written into the Constitution and is one that is highly valued by the farming community, any curtailment of it would not generally be acceptable.</P>
    <P>In the end it was decided that the way to maintain family farms is to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from our membership of the European Community. The situation is, of course, being kept under review and if it emerges at some time in the future that too much land is being accumulated in two few hands remedial action will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>On a broad front I think the whole question of land must be seen in the <Col N="337" /> context of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Despite its recent reform, or indeed perhaps because of this reform with its attendant production quotas and compensatory payments, I believe that now, more than ever, the way to preserve the family farm is not through the acquisition of additional land but by availing, to the maximum extent possible of EC backed schemes.  In recent years a whole. range of structural measures have been put in place.  These are aimed at improving the income situation of farmers.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough that I think it would be in the best interests of farmers, and particularly the smaller ones, to avail of these measures to the full rather than be striving to acquire additional land.</P>
    <P>Rural development is a new concept that has entered the agricultural vocabulary. I think this is a progressive concept that holds out great promise for the future.  Farmers should no longer be seen as a group isolated from the other classes in society.  Rather they are part of the broader community that makes up the rural scene.  There are now a number of schemes aimed at improving the standard of living of this community.  One of the most exciting of these schemes is the one that encourages investment in agritourism facilities.  This scheme was launched last year and the response was so high that the funds allocated for it were committed inside a few months.  As a result, a large number of applications had to be put on hold.  I am hoping to get additional funding for this scheme shortly.  This will enable many of the applications on hand to be processed so that work can begin under this scheme again.</P>
    <P>Another scheme that attracted a good response was the alternative enterprise scheme.  This provided generous grants for such enterprises as horses, deer, goats, rabbits and others.  These are but some of the measures in operation aimed at improving conditions in rural Ireland. There are others.  The effect of all these measures is to provide an opportunity to farmers and others living in the country to improve their standard of living.  I am <Col N="338" /> satisfied that this is the route that offers the greatest opportunities for our future.</P>
    <P>The question of a land authority was raised in the course of the debate in the Dáil.  I confess that I personally favour a body which would monitor the overall developments as regards land use in the country, with particular attention to agricultural and rural development aspects, and which could formulate ideas on the subject to convey to Ministers and to the Department.  Indeed, I have asked that this idea be examined by the expert review group which is currently working on the new development programme for the agriculture sector in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I expect this group, which includes representatives of my Department and of the farming organisations participating in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to report within the next few months and I have no doubt that they will have given careful consideration to the point which I have asked them to examine.</P>
    <P>I expect that in the light of all developments Senators will agree that the Land Commission is somewhat of an anachronism in today's world.  That does not mean that it did not play its part in laying the foundation of a sound agricultural structure.  Given all the constraints under which it had to operate its contribution to land settlement could only be described as monumental.  I am sure that I am speaking on behalf of every Member of this House in acknowledging the great work and in paying tribute to the men and women who, down the years, gave themselves to this work with such zeal and dedication.  The country owes them a deep debt of gratitude.  As this &ldquo;ancient institution&rdquo; is being consigned to history I think an appropriate epitaph would be <i>sic transit gloria mundi.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to speak to us in the House. It is the first time he has spoken here in my presence and I welcome him and thank him for his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister when he said we owe a debt of gratitude <Col N="339" /> to the people in the Land Commission who worked very hard and with great enthusiasm over a long number of years.  While mistakes were made, by and large, their contribution was very positive and helped not only the farming community but the economy.  It is too bad that, in their zeal in the earliest years, they set the target for an economic holding at 45 acres.</P>
    <P>In relation to winding up the business of the Land Commission, I am informed that Land Registry records have been locked in strong boxes for the past two months and will be there for another month.  That is not only holding up the completion of Land Commission business, it is also an enormous burden on people who want to complete sales as they are paying an extremely high interest rate for bridging loans.  Surely in this day of modern technology and microfiches, etc., it should not happen that the records of estates would be locked, sealed and unavailable for three months if not more.</P>
    <P>My main worry about dissolving the Land Commission is that we have nothing to put in its place.  The farming organisation asked for a land authority; the Minister had in mind a land advisory body.  Whatever we call it, we need a body to decide on the usage of land and recommend the kind of land that should be planted with forestry, used for amenity purposes classified as environmentally sensitive and so on.  At present we do not have such an authority nor do we have the data on optimum soil usage.  I know part of the country was surveyed by the former Agricultural Institute but it was not done on a farm to farm basis for the bulk of the country.  We could have got that kind of information from the excellent people who were transferred from the Land Commission by the Coalition Government in the mid-eighties to carry out a survey for land tax purposes.  There were, I understand more than 100 people involved and they did a very fine job.  It was a pity the job was not completed because it would have provided us with a lot of useful information which could <Col N="340" /> have been used, for instance, in classifying areas as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>There are people doing an excellent job of farming on very bad land and because they have a high stocking rate and a high income, they are not classified as disadvantaged.  I also know farmers who have better land but because there is poor farming in the area and they have a poor stocking rate and a poor income they are classified as disadvantaged. What I am saying is that people who work hard have been penalised.  That is wrong and we could have sorted that out if the survey which was carried out for land tax purposes had been allowed to conclude its business.</P>
    <P>One other point which worries me in relation to land sales is who can buy.  It would appear that it will be left totally to market forces and who has a cheque book.  Will it be an Irish citizen, a Community citizen or a non-Community citizen? We have very little scope for doing anything about Community citizens purchasing land in Ireland but we probably have scope for doing something about non-Community people purchasing land in Ireland.  Many countries in Europe have strict regulations in relation to who can purchase land in terms of proving their capability to farm it.  The French have a clause that one must live within a certain number of kilometres of the land purchased.  Restrictions like that could be very helpful in ensuring that land does not fall into wrong hands and, at the same time, we would not be breaking any Community laws.  I do not suggest that we should ignore the laws of the Community which has been good for our economy and generous to us in many ways.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we have a real problem with regard to land mobility.  It is also clear, given the price of land today and the cost of money, that it will be virtually impossible for most young people to go into farming.  They will have to inherit money, win the Lotto or inherit a farm before they can go into farming today.  It is just not possible to raise money, service a loan and make a living out of farming. In these circumstances, I agree with the <Col N="341" /> Minister that long term leasing is the answer.</P>
    <P>The steps taken by the Government to eliminate some of the obstacles to long term leasing are very welcome.  The step taken to allow a person who is leasing land to get a grant of £5,600 is also welcome but it is not a very generous grant for anybody trying to start up a capital intensive business like farming.</P>
    <P>We need to do more to encourage farmers to retire.  Here we have a real problem.  In rural Ireland today &mdash; much as it was 20 or 50 years ago &mdash; a person without property is a person without any status in society.  Since these farmers are not going to sell, we must promote long term leasing and encourage farmers to sell.</P>
    <P>In Holland, for example, in order to get a farmer to give up his property for restructuring and sale the Dutch Government will give a grant of £60,000 plus a generous retirement grant.  We must do more to encourage the older generation to give up the land to younger people, who have more energy so that we can restructure and make smaller farms more viable and allow younger people to come into farming.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that during the year the Government reached an accommodation with those who had problems with land annuities.  As members are aware, the price of land began to rocket in the late seventies, particularly from 1978 onwards, with the result that people who got land after that time found themselves in considerable difficulty paying the land annuities.  In this regard, I support what Deputy Enright said in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>To alleviate the problems of farmers who face great annuity repayments I propose that the Minister consider a scheme such as the 1988 tenant purchase scheme operated by local authorities under the Department of the Environment.  Under that scheme the local authorities calculated the price of a house and gave a 40 per cent discount to all tenants with a 10 per cent discount for pre-1960 houses and £2,000 in new house grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> Many farmers would favour that kind of approach.  While some arrangement was made with farmers in May this year there are still farmers with many problems.  I know of one individual who has a health problem and is £5,000 in arrears.  If the system that prevails in relation to housing was introduced, could this man be accommodated and have his £5,000 arrears restructured in order to solve his problem? I ask the Minister to see what can be done in hardship cases where people are unable to make their annuity payments.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the points made by the Minister.  We had little option but to phase out the Land Commission.  I emphasise again that it is a source of worry not only to me but to a number of people, that we do not have a land policy, that we will have very little say over who purchases land from now on, that the cheque book will dominate the marketplace and that despite the Government's best efforts there is little mobility or long term leasing of land.  A greater effort will have to be made by the Government or we will end up with an elderly farming population who will not have the courage or enterprise associated with young people.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Raftery in welcoming the Minister to the House.  It is the first time I have been here when he was present.  I wish him every success in the very difficult job he has undertaken.  I am sure that, coming from a rural background and constituency, there is no person better qualified to take on the role of junior Minister for Agriculture and Food than Deputy Hyland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has been closely associated with the Land Commission and its workings during my political life, I cannot say truthfully that I welcome this legislation which, in effect, abolishes the Land Commission. Since its inception over 100 years ago the Irish Land Commission restored to the Irish farmer the land and legal rights taken from him by a succession <Col N="343" /> of penal enactments.  The reform brought about by the congested district boards, and later by the Land Commission which succeeded it, changed completely the face of rural Ireland when one considers that 316,000 holdings covering 11 million acres were purchased by or for tenants for £100 million.  In addition, 750 acres of untenanted land was divided among 35,000 allottees either by way of enlargement of uneconomic holdings or by the creation of new holdings.</P>
    <P>Since 1923 almost 110,000 tenants had their holdings vested in them by the Land Commission for advances totalling almost £18 million.  This was work of great national importance.  It improved the lot of countless families who, without the work of the Land Commission, would not have been able to purchase those few extra acres from their own resources which means an improvement in the standard of living for those families.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has the work of the Land Commission been more evident than in the west where acute congestion prevailed. Trojan work has been done to relieve congestion and to rearrange fragmented holdings where agreement could be reached between the affected farmers. It was not always easy to get agreement from farmers because they usually felt that the land they were asked to exchange was far superior to what they were getting. That was the old problem in rural Ireland, especially in Galway.  I remember coming across this several times.</P>
    <P>A transaction like this could take years to implement and involved much negotiation by the Land Commission inspectors who were usually very tolerant and had a great understanding of rural families and the human problems that confronted them on a daily basis.  In particular, they showed great humanity in dealing with migrants and their policy of moving groups of neighbouring smallholders to new farms in the same locality was very much appreciated by the families involved.  That policy, which had a human touch, gave families courage to undertake what was to them the <Col N="344" /> biggest decision of a lifetime.  They were going to new pastures among strange people and it was important that they had the companionship and support of their old neighbours.  There were many such migrants particularly from Galway, Roscommon and Clare who moved to the midlands and made their mark in their adopted counties.  The land they gave up was divided among the smallholders and helped to improve the size of their holdings and eliminate fragmentation.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have heard many debates on what constitutes an economic holding.  From time to time the Land Commission reviewed, the concept of what a viable holding should be.  This has been increased from about 20 acres to its current level of 45 acres of good land.  In arriving at this acreage, the Land Commission considered that the family farm should be capable of affording a standard of living comparable to that available to those engaged in non-agricultural employment and also, of course, of maintaining the farm family in comfort under conditions of intensified competition in the future.</P>
    <P>Those ideas were noble but our entry into the EC and the events which followed have changed all that.  There are still between 70,000 and 80,000 family holdings below the current standard of 40 to 45 adjusted acres.  Now that the Land Commission is being dissolved I see very little hope of those families increasing their acreage unless they can compete in the open market with larger farmers and the business and professional people who have been moving into farming in recent times.  Many of those people I would deem unqualified for farming. They come into farming for the wrong reasons.  If the Land Commission were still functioning, they would keep such people out of farming.  Now that we do not have a regulatory body in place, we will undo much of the good work the Land Commission so painstakingly carried out.  I would hate to see the land of Ireland become the preserve of ranchers and millionaires to the total exclusion of our farming families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> As legislators, we have a duty to protect family farms and ensure that the ideals of the Land Commission are upheld, that is, that those families should have a standard of living comparable to that available to those engaged in non-agricultural employment.  For that reason, I believe that there should be a statutory body &mdash; I know this has been mentioned by almost every speaker on this side of the House and in the Dáil &mdash; to regulate the sale of land and ensure that some people do not accumulate too much land.</P>
    <P>A report by an interdepartmental committee in 1978 recommended, among other things, that future land policy should be based predominantly on measures which would promote the efficient use of land for agricultural development and that a new land agency should be established in place of the Land Commission to implement future land policy.  Vendors should have to notify the agency of proposed sales and advertise the sales in the prescribed manner.  The agency would be empowered to operate a system of control in land market transactions and maintain a register of priority entitlements of land applicants to whom the agency would endeavour to channel land coming on the market, and no purchaser would be allowed to acquire agricultural land which would bring his total holding in excess of a certain level.  There would be no limit on the amount of land acquired through a direct inheritance or intra-farming transfers.  Those were the main proposals made by the committee and I am sure they had given a lot of thought to the problems at the time but, unfortunately, that report was not acted upon.</P>
    <P>During my tenure in the Department of Agriculture in December 1980 a White Paper was published setting out land policy proposals.  The main recommendations of that White Paper were to deal with the possibility of smaller and more progressive farmers being able to acquire additional land and improve their holdings and also to promote the more efficient use of land so that agriculture <Col N="346" /> could make the greatest possible contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Other proposals were that the disposal of all agricultural land exceeding a certain level would require the consent of the Land Commission or the land authority; purchasers of agricultural land would attract a surcharge ranging from 15 per cent to 50 per cent of the purchase price in the case of farmers depending on the size of the final holding and 60 per cent in other cases; there would be no surcharge where farmers' final holdings did not exceed a certain level; a smallholder whose existing holding did not exceed a certain level could qualify for a premium in respect of such additional land purchased to bring his final holding up to a viable level; a new farmers' retirement scheme was to be prepared and earlier succession was to be promoted; leasing was to be encouraged and facilitated; commonage division was to be stepped up, etc.  The report also proposed that local lists of suitable farmers should be drawn up and that they would have priority access to land coming on the market.  Those are the main proposals in that White Paper.  One could say that they were radical but nothing was done about the White Paper.</P>
    <P>We are now abolishing the Land Commission. It is a pity those proposals were not tried out.  Both the interdepartmental committee report and the White Paper had the interests of small farmers at heart and were prepared to put forward proposals to assist them in acquiring additional land and bringing their farms up to a viable level.  They also proposed penalties for those whose purchases brought the size of the final holding above a certain level.  I believe the imposition of those kinds of restrictions would be justified today and that small farmers should be assisted to enlarge their holdings when land comes on the market. Otherwise, as far as I can see, the small farmer will never have a chance to improve his lot.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Land Commission, particularly in the west, did a tremendous job in relation to the division of commonages. We all know the problems <Col N="347" /> those commonages could cause between farmers because of the spread of disease, the fact that they could not be fertilised or drained and very often they did not produce as much as they should.  The Land Commission tackled that problem and did a tremendous job dividing and fencing those commonages.  Where there was agreement they got the farmers to do it themselves.  I was glad to hear the Minister say today that that type of policy will be continued.  I hope it will, because a great job was done particularly in Galway and Mayo, the areas with which I am most familiar.</P>
    <P>Another issue I believe should be tackled is stamp duty on the transfer of farms from father to son, uncle to nephew or whatever.  The stamp duty at present is very high and prevents people transferring their farms.  It is a pity that should be so.  We would like to see more mobility of land.  We would like people who have reached retiring age to be encouraged to transfer their farms to their families but while the stamp duty remains at its present level, there will be little improvement in that situation.</P>
    <P>In 1986 there were only 14,400 farmers aged between 25 and 34 out of a total of almost 121,000 full-time farmers.  There were 23,000 farmers aged between 35 and 44 while 50 per cent of all farms were held by people aged 50 or over.  The figures have probably worsened since 1986, the latest year for which I have figures.  From those figures it is clear that quite a number of old people are holding on to their land.  If we were to do something about the stamp duty, we could see a great improvement in those figures over a short time.</P>
    <P>The number of people entering agricultural training and education has been declining in recent years.  Since agriculture is our main industry this should be looked at urgently.  Some years ago I compared the amount of money spent on FÁS training courses for industrial workers with that spent on training our young farmers.  There was a large gap. Very little money was being spent on <Col N="348" /> agricultural training and research.  I would like to see some improvement there.  If agriculture is our main industry, it deserves an injection of cash to ensure that our young farmers, who are taking up farming, have the best education and training available.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Land Commission inspectors throughout the country, the divisional inspectors and the people on the ground.  They were great people and did a tremendous amount of work for the farmers.  I feel sad that we are now witnessing the end of a period of great change.  When we look at the type of farms that existed 100 years ago when the Land Commission was set up, and the progressive farming we have in Ireland today, we see a great change.  The Land Commission has been involved in these changes in every village in Ireland. They did the best they could but it was a difficult job.</P>
    <P>Land is special to the Irish people and when an official went to a farmer and asked him to exchange a field or two, the response was very often unfavourable. Those officials who were trained to deal with such problems went about their business and by coaxing and cajoling they eventually succeeded in eliminating much of the fragmentation that existed particularly in the west.</P>
    <P>A great deal of useful information has been built up by the Land Commission over the years.  I hope the records of bogs, land rights, rights of way, etc., which are so important to the rural people, will not be lost now that the Land Commission is being abolished.  I hope the Minister will ensure that those records will be available, that somebody will be responsible for them and that they will be passed to the people when they need them.</P>
    <P>I am sad to see the Land Commission go but times are changing and we must move on.  I hope a statutory regulatory body will be set up which will be responsible for the acquisition and sale of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I also welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on a number <Col N="349" /> of matters mentioned in his very interesting speech.  May I say also, in passing, how interested I was in Senator Hussey's passionate review of the important role played by the Land Commission in the development of this country.</P>
    <P>Early in his speech, the Minister put some facts and figures on the record. He referred to the purchase by 108,000 tenants of three million acres and the distribution of two million acres &mdash; five million acres altogether.  It is a very substantial bank of land.  Perhaps it is not possible to do it today but I would be interested in seeing this expressed as a fraction of available agricultural land because it must be quite a high percentage.</P>
    <P>What we are witnessing here, through the Land Commission, is a very remarkable social change; it is one in which we go against the trend in some of our neighbouring countries.  I visit Great Britain from time to time.  Like many Irish people I had at least until recently, some emigrant Irish relations.  I have an uncle who, in a curious sub-tradition of Irish behaviour, became a British military chaplain and retired to live in the country in England.  I have witnessed with horror the increasing concentration of land resources in the hands of a smaller and smaller number of people and the turning of what were very pleasant country areas with little laneways and hedgerows and ecosystems into enormous potato ranches in which fewer and fewer people were employed, the delicate balance of the countryside was reduced, and even the aesthetic appearance was affected adversely.</P>
    <P>I come from a background that did not always regard the Land Commission and its operations with unmixed admiration; I can think of family and friends who regarded it with a certain horror, like some rapacious wolf lying in wait until the proprietor became so feeble that they could be gobbled up but I have how come to the enlightened position where I regard it as a useful historical instrument in giving to people of no property, the men of no property, whom the great figures of the 19th century strove to represent, <Col N="350" /> some degree of investment in their own country.  This is a good and noble thing and something Senator Hussey paid tribute to.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a few very direct practical questions.  Reference is made to the lay commissioners and compensation to be paid to them.  I would like to ask two questions about that.  First, how many of them are there?  Second, how much are they getting?  I hope this is not too ungentlemanly a duet of questions, but I would be interested in having this information. It is not that I begrudge money for people who will be put into retirement by this Bill, but I would like to know what is involved.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the holdings of the Land Commission and the way in which the remaining holdings will be treated.  One point that was not referred to by anybody as far as I can recollect, is the fact that, traditionally, the Land Commission has possessed itself not only of land but also of buildings.  I have a particular interest in this because I think the buildings were acquired very often incidentally and almost accidentally and, unfortunately and regrettably, they were not always treated with the degree of sensitivity with which we would now wish to treat them.  This has to be seen in historical perspective.  For example, I think Coole Park in County Galway was taken over by the Land Commission, but I could be wrong.  The land was divided and the house demolished.  It is such a pity that happened.  I am not sure whether it was the Court of Chancery or the Land Commission that was involved in the very regrettable treatment of the Gore-Booth estate in Lisadell, County Sligo.  I regret that in those, perhaps unrepresentative, instances a spirit of generosity and chivalry was not shown to something that nowadays we are coming to see more and more, as important.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to agri-tourism but there is also cultural tourism.  Many people can be drawn to this country to see the great houses even though they may have been shorn of the supporting estates.  In the light of the reality that this has happened, it is more than ever <Col N="351" /> necessary that the State should give some degree of support to places like Lisadell, Westport House, etc.  A Bill has been laid before the Seanad dealing with Westport House where the present owner is anxious to break a trust fund in order to redevelop, for the purposes of tourism, the remaining section of the estate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to concentrate too much on this aspect.  I think it is important, it is not entirely marginal, but it is not the principal function of the Land Commission. I would say that mistakes were made because the acquisition of these properties was incidental.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask one remaining question about the Land Commission buildings themselves.  I believe the buildings in Merrion Street have been sold.  Some of the houses have already been redeveloped, others remain to be redeveloped. I wonder about the planning. Two or three of the houses have been turned into apartments, offices or a hotel but the principal offices of the Land Commission contain some of the finest 18th century ceilings in Dublin, marvellous fireplaces, and so on.  I would like an undertaking from the Minister that these features which constitute an important part of our heritage, will be retained. Friends, relations and business colleagues, who went into the Land Commission to search through dusty documents, even where the highlights of the plasterwork were not picked out, often said to me, &ldquo;David, there are the most wonderful ceilings and fireplaces there&rdquo;.  They went in looking for documents and came out talking about ceilings and fireplaces.  I would hope that we would be sensitive to this in the redevelopment.</P>
    <P>The real importance of the Land Commission lies in assisting people to acquire their own property.  I do have good Gaelic Irish blood in me.  My grandfather was a farmer, not a very large farmer. He might have liked to think of himself as a gentleman farmer.  He was dispossessed of some of his inheritance not, I have to say, by the Land Commission but by a very similar operation &mdash; the <Col N="352" /> operation of his own family.  When his father died he was quite young and the rest of the family got together and split up as much of the land as they could and left him with two, not very wonderful farms.</P>
    <P>I do know the feeling for land.  I had it myself.  In 1957 my aunt sold the last bit of land with which my family had been associated over many hundreds of years. I remember, as a 13 year old boy, pleading with her to hang on to whatever tiny scrap was left, just out of a kind of filial atavistic piety.  I still visit the midlands almost in a sense of homage because I know that this is the turf and bog out of which my people sprang.</P>

      <P>The passion for land is something that is ingrained in the Irish people.  You have only got to look at John B. Keane's play <i>The Field</i> and the tremendously strong primitive passions that are aroused in most of us, even those of us who are now very much urbanised. I have mentioned Patrick Kavanagh, I <Col N="353" /> could also speak of Padraic Colum, I could go on with endless lists of these people.  This hunger for the land is reflected in our literature, combined with what, since the 1920s at least, has been a flight from the land.  I remember leafing through <i>Dublin Opinion</i> and seeing the series of cartoons about the flight from the land.  This is a great tragedy, socially speaking, for our country.  There has been a destruction of the social infrastructure in the country as a result of the depopulation of many rural areas.</P>
      <P>I notice the Minister relies heavily on the supposition that considerable assistance will come from the European Community, particularly the Structural Fund. I welcome any money that can be brought in, but I am little concerned that there is so heavy a reliance on this mechanism. A farming community that develops organically, through its own resources, is healthier than one that depends on continual intervention from Structural Funds.  I would want to be a little careful about that.</P>
      <P>Although the initial intention was serious and honourable, family circumstances can sometimes intervene. Where a large estate is broken up and land transferred, quite appropriately, to smaller peasant farmers, there was, sometimes down the line, a generational fracturing of that inheritance as the farms were inherited.  There may be some kind of social dynamic involved in this.  People want to be able to leave a farm and they do not always find it possible to leave it intact to one inheritor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are a lot of buzz words, and I am not entirely literate in buzz words; Agri-tourism is one of them. I do not know whether this means visiting fish farms or sponsoring a donkey for a weekend.  I consulted my colleague Senator Upton.  He reminded me of farmhouse holidays; I presume this is one element of it.  It is easy to be flippant about sponsoring a donkey but as somebody who has visited and taken part in farmhouse holidays, I have to say they are marvellous.  They are about the best value you can get.  I have a lot of visitors coming from abroad and they complain, <Col N="354" /> sometimes, about the enormous cost of hotel accommodation in Ireland but they are lyrical about the experiences of spending time on a farm with the normally excellent standards of food both as basic raw material and also the cuisine which, perhaps due to the influence of people like Myrtle Alien, has become excellent.  If money is made available for the development of farmhouse holidays it will be money very well spent.  Perhaps there is something more to agri-tourism, but I am not quite sure what it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to alternative enterprise schemes as providing generous grants to such enterprises as horses, deer, goats, rabbits and others.  I am sure that is true.  People eat rabbits and venison is becoming popular but horticulture has been missed out.  Perhaps we should bear this in mind.  In terms of our demography and climate we have the capacity to intensify horticulture &mdash; the growing of bulbs and so on.  I am disappointed that an initiative which came from the Israeli Government who were prepared to be extremely helpful in developing this area, experimentally in conjunction with the Irish Government, was spurned.  I think we could learn a lot from the intensive horticultural methods of the Israelis and start to compete with people like the Dutch.  Our climate is not so different and our soil structures are much better than the Dutch.  There is no real reason we should not start small intensive production units of flowers, bulbs and vegetables.</P>
    <P>I will not go into a waffle about vegetables but every day I hear people asking why we are eating South American potatoes, Cypriot tomatoes and so on. With the help of grants, training programmes, FÁS schemes and by the proper grading of vegetables farmers could produce more standardised commodities. This is the way some of the money not spent on the pensions of the lay commissioners could be used.  Since we have lay commissioners, do we have any clerical commissioners?  No?</P>

George Fitzmaurice lodged in the Land Commission for about 50 years.  He was out sick for two years without his absence being noticed.  During that time he wrote plays such as <i>The Dandy Dolls, The Magic Glasses</i> and <i>The Pie Dish</i> which delighted audiences both in London and Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was slightly exaggerating when he said: &ldquo;As this ancient institution is being consigned to history he thinks an appropriate epitaph would be <i>sic transit gloria mundi</i>.&rdquo;  I am not sure he could have found a more inappropriate ending than &ldquo;thus passes the glory of the world.&rdquo; Was the Irish Land Commission entitled to that hyperbolic phrase &ldquo;the glory of the world&rdquo;?  Did the United Nations stand in silence, in mourning for the passing of the Land Commission?  I doubt it. I cannot remember exactly where the phrase comes from, maybe it was Horace.  It was certainly one of the Latin poets, and I think they were talking about the passing of an emperor, whereas the <Col N="356" /> Land Commission was devoted to the dismantling of the imperial system.  The dismantling of the imperial system had to be welcomed in the interests of democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a thumbnail sketch, taking us back to 1881, of the congested district boards, the Wyndham Land Acts, the land annuities, the economic war and all this background.  It was very significant historically, despite the hurt it inflicted on people who owned property and had it taken from them.  It is never easy to be part of this kind of social transition.  It was important.</P>
    <P>If we look to Latin America we can find direct parallels within the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, for example, where, at the core of that democratic revolution, there was the consistent transfer of land away from the great capitalist structures and the small proportion of land owners into the interests of the people who worked with the sweat of their brow and produced from the land. I have to honour the intentions and, in many instances, the operation of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dispersal of the Land Commission &mdash; if I may come back to the vulgar subject of money &mdash; I read in the newspapers and heard on the wireless sums such as £1.5 million mentioned; it was certainly over the £1 million mark, and suggestions that people had not worked productively for about five years. They were being paid for not working. This may be a malign rumour but I am offering the Minister the opportunity to scotch that if it is inaccurate.  I understand that the redeployment of people who have a special expertise may be complicated. For example, people who have been trained legally in the area of land boundaries, land tenure and investigating all the ancient Land Acts might not find it easy to get appropriate employment in another Department.  If we had a tabloid press here &mdash; which, thank God, we do not &mdash; I could imagine the headlines &ldquo;£1.5 million for no work in the Land Commission while consultants are let go at X, Y or Z hospital around the country&rdquo;. <Col N="357" /> It is important for the Minister to deal with this.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Land Commission was very much in the tradition of Gavan Duffy's three Fs &mdash; fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale &mdash; and for that we have to honour them.  We have moved into a different world, perhaps unfortunately. We are talking about land possession and land use.  We are now in a situation where we have this extraordinary confection inflicted on us from Europe, the set-aside scheme.  It think this is much worse than paying land commissioners to do nothing.  They at least have ceilings they can admire and can improve their souls in the Land Commission offices' but the idea of setting aside good productive land and paying people not to work it seems, to my unsophisticated mind, to be a scandal, when we have so many people starving. That is another argument and I am sure we will have an opportunity to discuss it. It is very sophisticated.  The transfer of food products from Europe to the impoverished sections of the globe requires all kinds of sophisticated machinery, treatments, storage and transport, but I cannot help this naive feeling that things like the set aside scheme are directly against the ethos of those people who conceived the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>My final point is in support of what Senator Hussey said about the FÁS schemes.  That might be looked at.  The FÁS operation is a mixed blessing.  Some of the work it does is extremely good.  I have been involved as an outside catalyst in one scheme that employed up to 15 people at one stage, but there are some absurd areas.  Some people are being taught how to telephone for interviews holding a banana in one hand and dialling on an orange.  I understand this is true. What Senator Hussey said about using the FÁS scheme properly in the area of retraining and making more advanced techniques available to young farmers is very good.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis jokingly asked if I would go off on a farm.  I would not particularly, but I note that the head of the IFA, Alan Gillis, came from a suburban <Col N="358" /> background, in Drimnagh, Dublin &mdash; I do not know whether you would call it a suburb because these days it is almost the inner city.  It would be regarded as a working class Dublin area.  Yet, he was able to make himself an extremely efficient farmer.  This, perhaps, says something about the lack of prejudice that can sometimes exist in the agricultural community that they did not deny him the most senior position in the farmers union on the basis that he was a Dubliner.  In line with that example, I do not apologise or feel diffident about having contributed to a debate where some people might not have expected me to have anything to say.  We all have an interest in agriculture and in the holding of land which has always been a great passion of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed Senator Norris's trip into nostalgia and his lyricism.  Perhaps it might be abated if one were thinking about feeding ewes on the side of the hill in the middle of winter or milking cows on a frosty morning.  The practice is not quite as lyrical as the Senator suggests. He quoted Horace.  As a result of my limited classical background I have carried very few phrases from school, but one was: <i>dulce est decipere in loco</i>, which I think would describe Senator Norris's contribution.  Perhaps I should translate it.  In its most extreme form it says that &ldquo;it is sweet to play the fool on occasion&rdquo;. I would not describe Senator Norris in such a way, but perhaps he was being a little bit lyrical.</P>
      <P>I agree with what he said about a passion for the land.  There is a very deep ingrained passion for the land in the country but I do not think this is confined to the rural society.  It is a very common phenomenon because most people are only a generation or two removed from the land and the land is very central to what we are, as a people, and long may it remain so.  It gives us a certain perspective and certain values which are important to us as a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the history of the Land Commission.  One of the great achievements was the Land Acts of <Col N="359" /> the last century which transferred the land from a tenantry to owner-occupiers at very modest cost.  Some of us were still paying annuities up to quite recently on land that was transferred to our ownership back in the last century.  That was a remarkable achievement given the social conditions of the time and the fact that the Government at that time might not have been very sympathetic to small holders and would have been under enormous political pressure from very large vested interests in the landlord classes.  It was a remarkable achievement that the land was transferred into the hands of the tenantry who then became owner-occupiers. The Minister has mentioned some of the deficiencies of owner-occupiers and I share his view.  I would also agree that it is very insensitive to interfere with this matter of free sale, but I will come back to that later.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are numerous stories about the activities of the Land Commission, many of them apocryphal no doubt.  My late father used to tell us stories of his experience with the Land Commission and they were not particularly good experiences.  He always felt that it had more to do with politics than with land ownership, but I do not know enough about the conditions at the time to say whether that was the case or not.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, the Land Commission did the country an enormous service. It freed people who otherwise would have no opportunity of maintaining a livelihood on the land.  It gave them an opportunity to acquire a holding. It gave them an opportunity to have a start and, in fact, I think it invigorated the whole of agriculture at a certain period in the history of the State, because those people brought an energy and an ability to the land they were given which was unusual and remarkable.  It certainly benefited the country enormously.</P>
    <P>New blood is extremely important to the future of the industry.  I am sure I am speaking to the converted when I say to the Minister that it is extremely important that we allow young farmers gain access to the land of Ireland.  My view is <Col N="360" /> that at the moment we are putting barriers in the way of these young people which is preventing them from becoming the farmers of tomorrow and from bringing the energy and dynamism to bear which will drive the industry into the next century.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to this question of an economic holding.  Of course, it was deficient, but by the lights of the time I think it was probably right.  At the time a 45 acre holding, or even a 30 acre holding, was viable; and at the time that was the right decision to make &mdash; to give people that size of holding.  I do not think it would have been politically tolerated for people to be given 100 and 150 acres; it just would not have been possible by the lights of the time.  We have the advantage of 20-20 vision and hindsight when we look at some of these things which we now regard as anachronistic but which at the time were quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>In one of my previous incarnations I was adviser to the County Committee of Agriculture in Kildare.  A number of the people I used to advise were Land Commission farmers.  As a group they were very open and they were good farmers, but one of the unfortunate aspects of what has happened in the intervening years is that many of them have fallen out of farming and properties which were divided into four, five and six holdings have now reverted into two or three holdings. That is an economic reality.  It is a sign of the times.  I do not think there is anything sinister in it; it is just that so many people have dropped out of the business &mdash; not just on Land Commission holdings but throughout farming &mdash; over the last 20 years.  Even in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy reform and compensation being made permanent, it is questionable whether that trend, which has been there for so long, can be arrested or halted.  It is my sincere hope that it can be because the implications for our society as a whole and not just for rural society are very serious indeed.  But I am less than convinced that we can stem the tide; we may arrest it, but whether we can actually stem it is another matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Land Bonds were a very sensitive issue.  For a period I was in receipt of a princely cheque for 13 pence which I received religiously every year.  The stamp on the letter cost more.  I would hate to think what the administrative costs were.  It certainly did not make economic sense.  I had a neighbour who, when farming taxation was introduced, felt that it was appropriate for him to present himself at the offices of the Revenue Commissioners and present them with his land bonds because, if they could tax him, he did not see why he could not bring what was the State's money to pay his tax.  I suppose there was a certain logic in that.</P>
    <P>The question of annuities was raised in the Dáil.  I commend the Minister and his Department on the steps they have taken to alleviate some of the hardship which was undoubtedly created for farmers through purchasing land under the land annuity system at very high rates, then being the victims of very high interest rates, and some of them got into very serious difficulties.  The measures which have been taken are commendable and I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris went on about the Israelis and vegetables.  He said he was very attached to this plot of turf somewhere in the midlands, but I had visions of oranges and lemons growing on this plot if the Israeli technology was brought to bear.  But he did make a reasonable point in respect of the enterprises which can contribute to farming income.  The Minister mentioned the initiatives on rural development.  Again, he is to be applauded for the work he has done in that area, but we must not lose sight of the fact that it is impossible for these initiatives to replace the income which derives from production agriculture.  We must remember that production agriculture will continue to drive the industry; it will continue to put the milk into the plants; it will continue to put the beef into the factories.  It is very important that we do not lose sight of that side of the equation when we consider the merits of the other side of the equation.  That is not to say that deer farming and alternative <Col N="362" /> enterprises cannot contribute additional income on the farm, but it is additional income; it is not replacement income.  That is an important point to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that ownership had been the dominant form of land tenure for 80 years and that, while it had its advantages, it also had disadvantages in the sense that it ossifies the movement of land.  I agree with that statement.  We must maintain the right to free sale.  But one of the problems I see at the moment is that, if one takes the introduction of quotas, that institutionalises a system and makes it extremely difficult for entrants into the industry to acquire not just the land but also the enterprise associated with the land.  It is almost creating a closed shop, and from that point of view, quota is deficient.  I accept the reality that something had to be done to control the surpluses which were developing in the Community and that quota is a very efficient way of achieving that objective but there are downsides to quota.  Perhaps in an Irish context it may not be very much to our national advantage that we cannot exploit the advantages we have for grass based production; and of course we would be worried about the fact that cheaper cereals are being used within the Community to subsidise livestock farming and that that puts our grass based production at a disadvantage.  However, that is a different issue.</P>
    <P>In respect of free sale, if it is correct to facilitate free sale it is also correct to facilitate the transfer of land from one generation to the next.  Where people wish their heirs to farm the land which they have farmed, everything possible must be done to facilitate that wish.  One of the big blocks in that respect is capital acquisitions tax.  Macra na Feirme, as the Minister will be aware, are active in this area.  Reference was made earlier to stamp duty and the problem that that creates.  It has got to the point where a modest agricultural holding, intensively stocked, with no borrowings, is subject to capital taxes.</P>
    <P>In my view it was never the intention of the legislation that family farmers should <Col N="363" /> have to worry about and have to pay the taxes.  Certain movement has been made in the budgets of the past two years in terms of indexation and raising the threshold, but we have a long way to go.  It must be in the national interest to facilitate to the maximum extent possible the transfer of land from one generation to the next.</P>
    <P>Macra na Feirme produced some figures, which I assume to be correct.  They say that on average 6.6 per cent of farmers in the EC are over the age of 65; in Ireland the figure is 15.7 per cent. Obviously there are population aspects to that as well as land tenure aspects.  It cannot be healthy for an industry to have an age profile like that.  It must be the objective to allow farmers to retire at a certain age and to allow their successors to take over.  That is the way forward for the industry, so that people have the energy and the drive to success and to ensure that the processing and marketing side are up to scratch.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of land suitability and I share some of the views expressed by Senator Raftery.  A very good job was done by the old Agricultural Institute in mapping the soils in some counties.  This was very useful information. There is disquiet &mdash; I am sure the Minister is well aware of this from his own constituency &mdash; about the spread of the trees, what land is suitable for trees and what areas are suitable for trees.  If we look back 20 years, land that we would then have thought totally unsuitable for trees is now suitable because of the income that it cannot generate.</P>
    <P>I would commend to the Minister to look at the environmentally sensitive areas.  There is one in his own constituency. He should look at areas of scientific interest to try to establish priorities for the use of land.  It is a sensitive and difficult task, but it would be well worth doing.  I believe that a land authority is the way forward and I hope it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>There would be an argument which says that the State should not intervene in matters of this nature, but of course it <Col N="364" /> does intervene.  If there are enormous national assets of international importance, it is appropriate for the State to intervene.  In the last session we debated the Foreshore Act, when we talked about taking sand off the foreshore and imposing restrictions to stop this happening. It is correct that the foreshore should be protected.  It is a very unique ecosystem which should be protected by legislation.  In environmentally sensitive areas and areas of scientific importance it is appropriate for the State to intervene.</P>
    <P>As we head towards a situation where farmers become the custodians of the environment &mdash; and it is important that they should be custodians of the environment &mdash; we are rapidly reaching the point where they have to be compensated for maintaining this environment in the lyrical and nostalgic state to which Senator Norris referred earlier.  I realise that in the case of environmentally sensitive areas certain steps have been taken which allow support for measures which are environmentally friendly.  That is to be applauded, but I believe that we are getting nearer to a point where farmers have to be paid to be the custodians of a certain type of rural landscape.</P>
    <P>From a tourism point of view there are concerns in parts of the west about sheep on the hills.  There are also concerns about depopulation and what that is doing to the field fabric &mdash; the hedgerows, small fields and stone walls.  There are concerns that if the land falls into the hands of one or two people, all these hedges and stone walls will be bulldozed and a totally different landscape will emerge.  It is important to remember that the landscape we have, which we cherish, is the product of commercial farming.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to facilitate the transfer of land from one generation to the next. Obviously, representatives of all parties believe that young people should be facilitated to farm.  It is not consistent on the one hand to insist that they must have qualifications to inherit land, that there are certain concessions available to them if they have studied for the green certificate or whatever, and on the other <Col N="365" /> hand to say that, having done all that, we will not make it easy for them to succeed to their own farms.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>There are statutory controls in relation to subdivision.  That is correct; those controls should remain, but capital taxes are forcing people into subdividing land.  If a person wants to avoid capital taxes they divide the land between a number of children.  That is going back to what was done before the Famine.  That does not make sense.  It is not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill where fishing rights will be vested in the Central Fisheries Board.  That is very good.  I am the chairman of the local angling club in Newbridge, which fishes a stretch of the River Liffey.  For many years we have had very cheap access to certain waters which the Land Commission controlled.  I hope that under the succeeding arrangements, that will continue; I am sure it will.  I had the pleasure of fishing the River Erris this year.  The Central Fisheries Board have done a remarkable job on that river in terms of access and of the way it is managed.  They are to be appluaded on that.  The fisheries are in good hands.</P>
    <P>There was some publicity about the Land Commission staff, where they had gone to and whether there were people sitting in offices and getting paid to do nothing but look at the Georgian ceilings about which Senator Norris spoke earlier. What is the present position in relation to staff?  I know some of them have gone to the Health and Safety Executive.  Where have they been relocated? Have they all been relocated?  The staff had every right to have their employment protected; that is not the issue. The issue is whether they were gainfully employed on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has fulfilled its usefulness.  It was very useful at a particular time but its time has passed.  What sort of vision have we of the future of rural Ireland?  Are we going to have corporate farmers?  Are we going to have large industrial factory farming operations to the exclusion of the family farm? <Col N="366" /> I hope that will not be the case.  I am sure the Minister would be as determined as I am to ensure that that would not happen.  It will take active intervention to ensure that that terrible vision of rural Ireland is not the vision which emerges. The rural development initiative is a very important element in ensuring that the fabric of rural society, which is so important to what we are as a people, is maintained but, as I said, rural development is an adjunct and not a replacement for production agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is one other contentious issue and that is the question of foreigners buying Irish land; and under EC membership we have to facilitate nationals of the other member states, provided they are suitably qualified.  I must say I am ambivalent about this matter of foreign access to Irish land because I know that in the constituency I come from, Kildare, the investment by the Arabs in the stud farms has led to enormous levels of employment and that land is sustaining more families than it would have in the hands of farm owners.  While on the one hand I can see that, because land is so central to our whole ethos, we wish to exercise certain controls on who might come in and buy it, nevertheless I believe there are people at present deriving a reasonable income from land in County Kildare in bloodstock farming who otherwise would not have the income they have.  That is something we need to take account of.</P>
    <P>We also have the question of how we manage the land and the role of Teagasc. We have to ensure that Teagasc are given the resources to allow the people on the land to exploit that land to their own and to national advantage.  I believe we have not given Teagasc the support they deserve to fulfil their remit in terms of bringing the technology which is required to allow people to continue to farm the land.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris went on about the Minister's statement about <i>sic transit gloria mundi.</i>  We are getting back to the classics again.  I am very reluctant to enter into this area because I do not have the expertise in the classics which some of <Col N="367" /> my colleagues have, but I think the more correct term the Minister might have used was <i>sic transit gloria terrae,</i> which would be the land rather than the world. I thank the Minister for his contribution and I look forward to supporting the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome the Minister.  It is good to see him here again.  I have to confess a certain inadequacy, as the Minister seems to have started a trend of quoting from the classics. Senator Dardis and Senator Norris have taken it up and, despite the fact that I did study both Latin and Greek in one of my earlier existences, I am sorry to say that I am not able to make any contribution to the list of Latin quotations. Perhaps a day or two in the library might get me out of that difficulty.</P>
      <P>Like many other speakers, I would like to acknowledge the contribution which the people who worked in the Land Commission made to the development of Irish agriculture over the years.  I join with Senator Dardis in his expression of concern in regard to those people who are still working in the Land Commission, that they should be appropriately relocated and that that should be done to their satisfaction and in a manner which gives them worth-while, fulfilling employment, which contributes to the economy and is appropriate to their qualifications.</P>
      <P>I also express a certain personal interest in this to the extent that many of the people who worked in the Land Commission were colleagues and good friends of mine and at an earlier stage, when I contested a certain type of election, they were very good supporters of mine.  In that sense I do not mind acknowledging that many of them are friends and in many ways I owe them one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another knock-on effect of the closure of the Land Commission offices in small western towns, particularly places like Castlerea, etc.  That, in turn, had a fairly significant effect on local employment. I suppose that is inevitable, but nonetheless there is a certain significance <Col N="368" /> attached to it.  I am not trying to argue that people should be kept in jobs which are of no value, I am not doing that.  But I am acknowledging the fact that because these jobs have moved elsewhere, that in turn creates its own problems in trying to maintain the economy in these small rural towns.</P>
    <P>We have been told over the years that land was our greatest national resource and that we should do everything possible to maximise the efficiency with which the land was used so as to benefit the national interest to help develop the economy. Despite the fact that we have had that aspiration over the years, we have totally failed to develop any land use policy. There is a great void in relation to the development of any land use policy at present.  There have been many attempts made to establish such a policy and in my view they have all failed &mdash; and they have failed for a variety of reasons.  They have failed because of the influences of history dating back to the last century, dating back to the land wars, dating back to the many people who fought vigorously to liberate the land and make it available to smallholders.  Indeed, when that happened some of those people turned on those they had supported, those who had generated the ideas in relation to the use of land, etc., and they rapidly moved to the notion that what you have you hold, and that is still very much a reality.</P>
    <P>We have a fairly sharp contrast with the Dutch.  The Dutch have a land size which is about a third the land area of this country.  The typical farm size there is about 30 acres, but in this country it is about 50 acres.  The Dutch employ about 100,000 more people in the food processing industry than we are able to do and they employ many more in farming. That is, to a large extent, related to the fact that the Dutch have a very clear and coherent set of policies on these matters and they have the capacity to implement those policies.</P>
    <P>There are continuing structural problems in Irish agriculture.  Senator Hussey made a very interesting and worth while contribution when he spoke about those problems.  There are few people in this <Col N="369" /> House who would have the direct, hands on acquaintance with those problems that Senator Hussey has.  There have been a series of suggestions made to deal with those problems.  There was talk about people entering farming being required to have certain qualifications.  There was also talk about people who did not have a background in farming or knowledge of farming being surcharged when they moved into farming.  There has been a series of other proposals, none of which ever became a practical runner in terms of having a chance to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The present reality is that to enter farming you need no qualifications other than that you have bags of money and are prepared to pay money to an uneconomic level to attain land, because the fact is that in terms of economic return money invested in land is money rather badly invested.  The return on money invested in farming compares unfavourably with returns on investment in many other walks of life.  But the reality is that as far as many farmers are concerned that is the only option available to them, that is the only business they know.  When they have accumulated money, then in many ways that is all they are able to do with it, because they only know the business of farming.  They are not in a position to get involved in wholesaling or other types of business which would be available.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been a radical change in the policies of the present Government over a ten or 15 year period.  Senator Hussey spoke about the time he was in the Department of Agriculture and he spoke about the 1977/1988 period.  During that period we did have the interdepartmental review which dealt with land use and so on.  As part of that review people spoke in terms of the acquisition of land if it was not being properly used.  They spoke in terms of legislation at an early date to give effect to these new measures.  If my research is right, that statement was made around 1980.  It is still only 1992, 12 years on. How the world has changed.  The policies being spoken of at that stage in an interdepartmental report received the stamp <Col N="370" /> of approval of the Government of the day, a Fianna Fáil Government led by Jack Lynch.  It may be worth taking some brief quotations from that report.</P>
    <P>To abandon the compulsory machinery of the Land Commission would be to accept if not to encourage bad husbandry.</P>
    <P>Gracious me.  Has this concern about bad husbandry disappeared or are many of the factors which gave rise to concern still with us?  My view is that they are.  The report spoke also of the west, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In the western area there are additionally structural and demographic reasons for the continuance of a programme of land acquisition and division in the forseeable future.</P>
    <P>That was said in the late seventies and we have now moved away from those concepts and abandoned any notion that we might restructure land policy or effect change other than by the influence of money which will undoubtedly lead to further consolidation.  I do not dispute that further consolidation is inevitable but letting the market rip and letting money speak will accelerate the rate of consolidation.  As somebody said earlier, it will accelerate the rate at which we move back towards the notion of ranches. I accept that many influences are at work in this area and that EC influences are important.</P>
    <P>The introduction of quotas carrying many limitations has also been a significant cause of the downgrading of the Land Commission.  People now seek to buy quotas rather than land; in many ways one would be better off owning a quota at present.  A quota has a definite economic value and in many ways is not as cumbersome or as difficult to buy or to resell as a farm of land.  It is a simpler process and leaves one with land which gives one some stake in the country, an overwhelming anxiety of many people.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to denigrate the drive to own land or to underestimate the factors which give rise to it.  For many people who held on to land in the past it was <Col N="371" /> their only hope of security and even when it was but a few impoverished acres it had value and was a means of self-sustenance. Without a smallholding many felt totally abandoned.  In many cases smallholdings did not sustain the people dependent on it.  A significant number of people in rural Ireland still believe in the value of smallholdings.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis quoted figures from Macra na Feirme indicating that 15 per cent of farmers in Ireland are over 65 years compared with 5 per cent or 6 per cent in Europe generally.  Farmers are reluctant to retire for historic reasons in many cases.  Many would be better off if they sold the land, invested their money and availed of welfare assistance.  This would make land available for use by younger more progressive farmers. Unfortunately, many do not see it like this and I can understand their reasons and reluctance.</P>
    <P>Fragmentation of farms is another problem.  Many farmers have small parcels of land here, there and everywhere but if it could be put together it would be viable.  It is almost impossible to get people to transfer land into one consolidated unit by way of land exchange plus money payments.  The Land Commission did great work to encourage that over the years.  It was fine where it succeeded but the commission was up against high insurmountable historical barriers.'</P>
    <P>It marks a significant change in the policy of the present Government and in Fianna Fáil tradition as represented by Senator Hussey, that we are moving away from the reallocation of land which held out some hope that small farmers could, in a modest way, increase the size of their farms.  That is a significant change in the space of ten or 15 years.  We are moving instead towards letting money rather than land policy determine events.  Land use policy was always difficult to implement.  It may be that realities on the ground are being accepted; in rural Ireland it is almost impossible to implement a land use policy with teeth and to survive politically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> The Minister spoke of the desirability of getting young progressive farmers into farming and remarked wisely that this is much simpler in theory than in practice. I know of the difficulties involved and have alluded to them already.  I wish him well in his efforts and I will be the first to shake his hands if he makes significant progress.</P>
    <P>Many young progressive farmers became victims of circumstances in the boom times of 1977-80 or slightly earlier. Young farmers were encouraged then by the wise birds of Irish farming and agribusiness to borrow, borrow, borrow, in order to develop.  Things would be hunky-dory then, they would live happily ever after and their only difficulty would be getting all the money they would make to the bank.  The only problem was to convince the bank to give them bags of money.  Some of the more enthusiastic banks did that and lived to learn the error of their ways and many farmers finished up in terribly difficult circumstances as a result.  There are clear lessons to be learned there.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of caution in relation to the image conjured up by &ldquo;progressive farmer&rdquo;.  Progressive farmers often progress towards destruction by expanding too fast, by not sizing up markets and opportunities and by anticipating difficult periods as well as boom times.  Many farmers were bankrupted and had to sell off land at poor prices following this expansion period.  They were encouraged to go too far too fast by people who set the pace.</P>
    <P>I remember colleagues in the ACC and in banks telling me at that time that the purpose of being in banking was to lend money; that was where the action was and how all the profit was to be made. Some are a good deal poorer and wiser now.  Progress is measured over long periods rather than in spectular lunges towards quick money.  I have great reservations about this trend in any walk of life; short term profits can often disappear long term.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to areas of scientific interest and to environmentally sensitive areas.  There is much potential in both <Col N="373" /> of those areas.  There are considerable opportunities for scientific people from outside the country to carry out research and to generate increased scientific expertise for this country and, of course, an important source of revenue.  There is a certain amount of difficulty in having areas declared as areas of scientific interest because of the knock-on effect on farming and it is for this reason that at times I am pleased that I do not have to deal with a rural constituency, even if I began life in one.</P>
    <P>The same holds for environmentally sensitive areas; some of those are not only environmentally but politically sensitive and can be difficult to deal with. The Land Commission might have played a part in developing those worthwhile concepts and there is scope for their development as part of a land use policy.</P>
    <P>Times have changed.  The tone of the documents of the late 1970s differs from present realities.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of the Land Commission. It was slow, tedious and often thankless but nonetheless worthwhile.  I am sure that quite a number of Irish farming families have benefited from the slow, non-spectacular humdrum work of the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill and I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Hyland.  He has an enormous contribution to make and will do so.  I was at a presentation of certificates and degrees in Newcastle West lately where the Minister of State excelled in his speech, as was recognised by all present.  It is appropriate that he should have been excellent on that occasion because the green certificate has to do with the transfer of land and is apposite to our subject here.</P>
      <P>I have known Deputy Hyland for a long time.  We came into the Seanad in the same year and he has graduated to greater things.  I know from his performance in Newcastlewest, that his appointment as Minister of State is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to part of the <Col N="374" /> Minister's speech when he said that no one can deny that the Land Commission was effective in pursuing its aims.  He said that the figures speak for themselves; since 1923 over 108,000 tenants were assisted in purchasing about three million acres and over two million acres were distributed among uneconomic small-holders, migrants and others.  In addition, the Land Commission carried out extensive improvement works, built houses and outoffices, carried out drainage, reclamation and fencing and provided roads and water supplies.  In talking about the demise of the Land Commission some of us have mixed feelings. They did good work, but also some bad work regarding land distribution and improvements over the years.  We all know of cases where the commission did not seem to do the proper thing and where land was not given to those who seemed entitled to it, perhaps for the commission's own reasons.</P>
    <P>In my area when land was given to people who were not in a position to farm it properly, it went for sale later and probably fell into the hands other than those of the more deserving in the area. When neighbours of mine sold a small farm, the Land Commission did not interfere. The farm was fragmented and amounted to about 19 acres dividing two farms.  One part of it divided a farm consisting of 70 and 80 acres and the other part divided another farm.  A nearby farmer with little land was also interested.  The three farmers interested in acquiring this land did the sensible thing; they did a Land Commission job on it.  One farmer bought it and sold half to the second farmer to ensure that his farm would comprise one holding; prior to that it had been in two parts.  The second farmer was in the same position and got his farm into one parcel also.  The third farmer who was anxious to increase his farm size made an exchange with one of the farmers who would benefit from the sale and everyone was happy.  They did a better job than the Land Commission would have done.</P>
    <P>In the Land Commission the common experience of farmers was taken into consideration; <Col N="375" /> bureaucracy does not have the answer all the time.  The same can be said of our policy in regard to cattle breeding; some cattle may be imported while others may not.  Bureaucracy is playing a big part here to the detriment of better cattle breeding.  The views of experienced farmers should be taken into account by elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission was established over 100 years ago to deal with the problem of land rents and when it was finally dissolved, it was probably seen as the worst landlord of all.  The rents sought for land sub-divided by the Commission were beyond the means of those to whom the land had been given.  As Senator Upton stated, the price of land became inflated when the banks gave money to people to bid against one another.  When the Land Commission bought such land, they had to charge a high rent for it.  I am pleased to note that recently the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, has introduced measures to alleviate the hardships of those paying back rents and I congratulate him on this necessary step.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission was involved in taking over many large estates in Kerry and in other counties.  As a result, as many as ten families were allocated land in one estate.  The size of those small farms, including houses and outoffices, was usually about 45 acres.  At that time 45 acres seemed an economic holding, but now in the EC a farm of 45 acres is not economic.  Some farms of 45 acres can have a quota of 30,000 gallons of milk, which might have been economic at that time, but not now when one needs a quota of at least 40,000 gallons to make dairying economic.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton said that quotas were more desirable than land and if one sold a quota, one made a profit.  I cannot understand his thinking because one cannot have quotas without land.  If one rents land, the quota remains with the land and makes it more valuable.</P>
    <P>Ownership of land is cherished in Ireland.  The inheritance of farms by sons was aspired to.  A bachelor would pass on his land to a close relative or to an in-law <Col N="376" /> interested in developing the farm. When the Land Commission became owners of large sections of land division became a difficult task.  It was difficult to get farmers to give up a patch of land in order to gain another patch closer to their own homes so that the unit could be intact.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the transfer of land from one generation to the next and to consequent problems of tax, stamp duty, etc.  Farmers qualify for the educational programme I referred to.  The Minister presented certificates of farming to young farmers which would qualify them to farm.  I ask the Minister to make the transfer of lands easier for such farmers. Inheritance tax imposed on farmers affects land transferred from father to son.  As mentioned by previous Senators, farms are divided in order to pay inheritance tax; a young farmer may have to sell some of his inheritance to another farmer.  This practice is making farms less viable and it would be better for the country to ensure farm viability.</P>
    <P>Senators and other Members of the Oireachtas have asked for a land authority to be set up to monitor overall national land use paying particular attention to rural development and which could formulate ideas on the subject to convey to Ministers and to the Department. I note from the Minister's speech that he intends the proposal to be examined by an expert group currently working on the new development programme for the agricultural sector in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The Minister said that he expects this group, which includes representatives of his Department and of the farming organisations participating in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to report within the next few months and I have no doubt that he will give careful consideration to the points he has asked them to examine.  This is a very important development on which I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Land Commission on their social concern in distributing land. In my own area when a GAA club sought land to develop as a playing pitch the <Col N="377" /> Land Commission facilitated the GAA club so that they could promote national games.  Overall, the Land Commission, despite disappointment with the way land was allocated, did a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This is a wide ranging Bill.  One could talk at great length about all its implications or take another approach by welcoming the Bill and discussing a possible substitute for the commission.  I will endeavour to adopt a middle course.  We are not talking about introducing legislation as such this evening but about a Bill designed to give statutory effect to the dissolution of an institution that has existed in this country for land apportionment since 1881.</P>
      <P>The Irish Land Commission performed a valuable function for Irish farmers for 111 years, since it was formed in 1881. There has been criticism of Land Commission personnel for not doing certain things in different ways.  This country would have been worse off without the Land Commission, however.  The years of the commission encompassed periods of Irish national Government and a long period prior to that of British rule. However, since 1881 and the instigation of the Land Commission by Davitt, Parnell, Davis, Duffy, etc., there has been significant progress.  The issues of primary concern then were free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent.  During British rule and under Irish rule up to the thirties, something like 4,000 holdings and 14 million acres were processed by the commission.  This was a very substantial movement of land and effectively landlordism was terminated with this massive land takeover by Irish farmers up to the thirties.  The job was not finished however, and the Land Commission had a long road ahead of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of holdings were acquired from people that should not have been acquired.  One holding that comes to mind very clearly is the Gore-Booth family home in Lisadell which was referred to earlier this evening, the home of Countess Marckievicz.  I think that estate or others of its type were not dealt <Col N="378" /> with correctly.  However, that is now history. Apart from these large estates there were also, particularly in the 1930s fairly substantial holdings taken from people who had families and had a need for land. That should not have happened.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commissioner existed approximately 50 per cent plus of our people were directly engaged in farming. If one were to take those indirectly involved it would be a substantially higher figure.  Farming is important today and 17 per cent of the population are directly involved in it while a similar percentage are indirectly engaged in it.  It is very important now but it was even more important at that stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton spoke about progressive farmers.  I concur with what has been said.  What appears to have been progress effectively has not been progress.  Many people in the mid-to late seventies and early eighties borrowed money, established massive farmyard layouts and bought land and to this day they are in trouble.  I am aware in a professional capacity of many of these cases where people acted on the advice of &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Land Commission's biggest achievement in recent years was in relation to their policy of moving farmers from the west of Ireland, from Donegal down to Connaught, to Kerry, west Cork and indeed west Limerick, Clare and the whole western seaboard to Meath, Kildare and the greater Dublin area, and doing so to their great advantage.  Farm sizes were perhaps small, of the order of 33 acres to 40 acres or 45 acres.  In addition farmers with fragmented holdings perhaps of 50 to 60 acre lots in two or three different divides in the west, had the land taken from them which helped to case congestion in these areas and those farmers were given perhaps 150 acres in the eastern part of our country.  Both these developments were very good.</P>
    <P>Many people are deeply indebted to the Land Commission for what they did for them.  I do not mean indebted in the sense of financial indebtedness but indebted otherwise.  I know that many farmers find it difficult to meet the rent <Col N="379" /> they have to pay.  This is a problem that faced the Land Commission when they bought land in the late seventies and the eighties and to base their rent on that particular price.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, has recently introduced proposals to deal with this.  One proposal as far as I can recall, is if a farmer can pay off the arrears that exist now he will get the land at half price.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  The second is that there would be a restructuring of the loan period over a longer time.  I compliment the Minister on those two far-seeing steps which will help people in a difficult situation.  They are paying for land at an artifically high level which is not based on 1992 but on 1975/1980 levels.</P>
    <P>Land mobility has always been and will continue to be an extremely important factor because there are many fragmented farms in Ireland.  I suppport the dissolution of the Land Commission but it is essential that we have a land authority in its place.  The land agency to which reference was made as far as I can recollect, in the Minister's speech, will not have any financial responsibility.  I do not agree with that.  If we are to make progress in eliminating fragmentation and dividing farms in the way in which they ought to be divided the agency will need finance.  It would be impossible for the owners of land in one area to equate it with the land they would receive in another area.  A sum of money will always be needed to make up the difference.  We can adjust acres and do all sorts of things but a farmer in Ireland will never put exactly the same value on one acre of land that he would put on another acre in a different area.</P>
    <P>In the eighties inspectors from the Land Commission were involved in adjusting acres for the purpose of taxation, etc.  Many other surveys were done and so on and other adjustments were made and I understand a lot of that data has been set aside.  That is a great pity.</P>
    <P>I know that those people either moved back to the Land Commission or were employed in some other Government <Col N="380" /> Department and this was done on a voluntary basis.  I also know from talking to Land Commission personnel that there are at present about 20 people at inspectorate level elmployed by the Land Commission. There are engineers, agricultural science graduates and estate agents.  I understand a number of those will take early retirement but some will be gainfully employed in other Departments. It is important that the staff are treated properly I have faith in the Minister and his Department to do this.  Up to the mid-eighties there were about 150 inspectors in the Land Commission now there are 20 people engaged in a tidying up operation.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission own 2,500 hectares. This land was not acquired in recent times but there are 2,500 hectares to be disposed of.  The land agency will require financial assistance.  We have about 400 hectares of peatland which must be distributed in the best way possible. I do not go along with the view that afforestation is the enemy of Irish agriculture.  Afforestation has a lot to offer.  It used to be a long term project but now people can get a return on their investment after four or five years particularly if they plant Christmas trees.  In other cases they can expect a return from forestry after ten, 12 or 15 years.  Forestry is not a big bad giant to be feared and got rid of at all costs.  A lot of land cannot produce good crops or good grass; it is not good agricultural land.  I agree that it is not appropriate to put good farm land under afforestation when there is dire necessity for worldwide food.</P>
    <P>We have food mountains in Europe. The Common Agricultural Policy suggests we should have set aside programmes but I do not believe we should not go down that road given the starving millions in Somalia and elsewhere.  We should look positively at this to see how we can get Irish and other produce to Third World countries that cannot afford to pay the transport costs let alone the goods themselves.  I appreciate that this is a political area as well as being a question of economics but we must not build a wall around the EC or GATT countries <Col N="381" /> nor can we forget the Third World countries.</P>
    <P>I am against the set aside programme being introduced under the Common Agricultural Policy.  For instance, there is a programme where for a five year period one will get £82 an acre for not growing cereals and leaving the land fallow or, in the case of grassland, one will get £42 an acre to lightly stock land to the extent of one beast per hectare, which is 2½ acres.  Neither policy is good for this country.  Given those two policies it is contradictory that we have land reclamation policies.  It does not make sense to pay a man in Kildare £82 an acre not to grow wheat or barley on 100 acres and then give a grant to somebody in West Limerick or Clare to reclaim what might at best be described as marginal land. There are many anomalies which must be looked at.  We have a responsibility to set up an organisation to examine all these issues.</P>
    <P>I referred to the land which the Land Commission has in its possession &mdash; or, more correctly, which the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food have in their possession, because the Land Commission will cease to exist when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke about farming in a very romantic fashion.  We love the land but let us be realistic.  It is very difficult for a family to make a living from the land.  With the exception of milk or sugar beet production it is difficult, if not impossible, for a family to make a living from the land.  The size of a farm is no longer the basis for making a judgment in that regard.  A person with 200 acres producing beef could be losing money whereas a man with a milk quota of 30,000 or 40,000 gallons could be doing all right.  I am not saying that dairy farmers are making fortunes but they and beet farmers are the only group who can hope to survive.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of EC headage payments which farmers need if they are to survive.  However, I believe they introduce an element of artificiality.  The set-aside programmes have resulted in a great deal of uncertainty.  Having regard <Col N="382" /> to the social structure of society and the number of bachelors and older people who do not have family members working on the land, the present trend would suggest that in the next ten years we could have a dramatic reduction in the number of farms to perhaps 30,000 or 35,000, which would be primarily dairy farms with some beef production on the side. The remainder of the farmers will be working part-time and using their land for beef production or whatever.  These people will need jobs &mdash; provided there are jobs available &mdash; as they will no longer be able to derive a living from the land.  I believe there are many people in farming who are surviving from day-to-day on what they saved in the past, and in many cases, on borrowings.  No responsible Government can allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>GATT is extremely important.  There are 105 countries involved in GATT and approximately 3 per cent of the population of those countries are involved in farming.  There is little hope of our getting a good deal from GATT.  I know we are part of Europe and have the Common Agricultural Policy but there is ongoing pressure from America for world prices to obtain.  They will not agree to other trading if they do not get their way on world prices.  If we had world prices in this country we would have no hope of surviving at all.  The GATT countries, led mainly by America, the CAIRNS group of countries, South America and other countries in Europe are laying down the rules and dictating what EC policies should be in the future.</P>
    <P>Any responsible person must acknowledge that the Irish Government do not have responsibility for many of the decisions taken these days.  These decisions are taken in Brussels, and in some cases further afield.  For that reason it behoves all of us to support the Government in their efforts to get the best deal from Europe and the best deal on the world stage.  We have nothing to be apologetic about in the context of our location which is strategic.  We should demand special attention.  We are a small island off the mainland of Europe.  If we are expected to sell goods to Europe and <Col N="383" /> to the world we must be compensated for that.  That is not to say we must not do our bit and endeavour to produce to market requirements.</P>
    <P>I recently stated in this House that we have an obligation, as people involved in the land, to ensure that Irish housewives get what they require by way of food and similarly with housewives in Bonn, Paris or elsewhere.  We must do market research and determine what is required in the marketplace and then produce such commodities.  If we do not operate in that way we will have massive production, as we did previously, which we will not be able to sell.  There have been many examples where we have not been successful in disposing of products.  For that reason market research is vital and something we must devote a lot more time to in the future.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the land authority.  This authority could work closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food. It must have a special responsibility to eliminate or reduce fragmentation of farms; in other words, it must introduce an element of rationalisation into our farming pattern, the size of farms, the lay-out of farms and so on.  In addition, I believe it has a major function to perform by way of what farmers do or do not do.  I appreciate Teagasc provides an advisory service but many farmers need something more innovative at this point. With the departure of the Land Commission we have a perfect opportunity to introduce this agency in order to do something meaningful and positive to ensure that Irish farmers can move ahead in the future.</P>
    <P>What has been said is rather gloomy, and that is understandable.  I would like to think that we will tackle this matter more ambitiously and make sure we become more efficient in terms of production. There are many people who could be producing more efficiently. There are many people using antiquated systems and so on.  I believe there is a vast potential to be exploited not alone at primary production level but at processing and indeed marketing levels.  I <Col N="384" /> have already dwelt on the marketing level and I would now like to dwell on the processing level.  Unless we diversify our production we will not succeed.  Up to now we have tended to produce beef.</P>

    <Title>Housing Policy: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government in relation to its housing policy; and its failure to provide adequate finance to meet the growing, housing lists in each county in the country.</P>
      <P>This motion was tabled because of the huge social implications for many families throughout the length and breadth of this country.  The Government have totally reneged on their responsibility to provide housing for the many families in need of housing.  I have tried to establish, as best I can, the numbers of people on the waiting lists for local authority housing.  I reckon there are up to 50,000 families on those waiting lists.</P>
      <P>This Government and the previous Government have done absolutely nothing in the past five years to tackle this major social problem.  In fact, since John Boland was Minister for the Environment, the allocation for local authority housing has dropped from over £80 million to £40 million and much of the responsibility for that must lie on the shoulders of the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, who seemed to take the callous view that those on the housing list did not count.</P>
      <P>I am now calling on the Government, and on the Government Senators, to support this motion.  I hope it will reawaken the social spirit of this Government &mdash; if they have a social spirit &mdash; to make money available to the local authorities to provide housing for families on the waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's housing policy is an absoulte disgrace.  They were responsible for the abolition of the SDA loans, the <Col N="385" /> mechanism used by many lower income families to provide housing for themselves. Those loans were abolished by this Government or the Government in office from 1987 to 1989.  In 1987 the house improvement grants were discontinued. These grants enabled many people to bring old houses up to an adequate standard.  The grants which in earlier years had helped to provide water, sewerage and sanitary services were also abolished.  As a result, we now have an enormous housing list.</P>
    <P>We all know we are going through very difficult financial times.  Unless they are in secure employment, people cannot go to a building society and seek finance to build a house for themselves.  We are all aware of the huge numbers of repossession orders being taken daily by county councils and by building societies. I came across some figures recently for three towns in the midlands.  In Nenagh 16 houses were up for repossession at one court; in Portlaoise there were 15 and in Tullamore, 13.  The same situation exists in Roscommon.  Unfortunately, people are not longer able to meet the huge loan repayments arising from the rise in interest rates and the abolition of full mortgage relief, by the Government over the past two years.  I am now calling on the Minister to restore full mortgage relief immediately.</P>
    <P>Many other issues have contributed to the huge housing lists, all of them due to mismanagement by the Government. They seemed to feel the local authorities were not providing a good service.  They now seem to think their brainwave with regard to social housing and voluntary housing will meet the needs of the people today.  That is not the case.  The Minister and his officials know that the shared ownership scheme is not working.  It is a failure and the sooner that is recognised the better.  It is a sham.  Nobody is going to buy half a house and then, ten, 15 or 20 years later, buy the other half, having regard to the increase in the value of the house.  If the second half could be bought out later at the original cost, then the scheme might work but despite advice from many Members in this House and <Col N="386" /> in the other House, the Government decided against that.</P>
    <P>Voluntary housing schemes might be fine in some areas where there is good, close community spirit, where, for example, there is a sizeable population. It will not work in most of rural Ireland because the structure necessary to put up the capital to get the project off the ground does not exist.  As the Minister and his officials know, the scheme is not working.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister.  He is quite new to the Department of the Environment.  His predecessors in the Department have failed to provide the necessary funding to the local authorities to provide housing for many families who are living in dire circumstances.  These are families living in mobile homes and in condemned accommodation, which is damp and unfit for human habitation. Nevertheless, this Government seem relaxed about it and are allowing that situation to continue.  They have obviously failed to grasp the major problems facing communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I will mention some figures to illustrate my point.  In County Louth last year only 23 houses were built although there are 1,000 on the waiting list.  In Westmeath, where there is a waiting list of 340, 16 houses were built.  In Roscommon, which has a waiting list of 180, 13 houses were built.  This is callous in the extreme.  It is unbelievable that any Government can preside over a situation like that and not be ashamed.  They are making no effort to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>Voluntary housing is not the answer, shared ownership is not the answer. Many families who are on a housing list now in many counties, including my own, may have to wait up to 15 years to be rehoused.  This is an absoulte scandal.</P>
    <P>The funding for local authority house building has been reduced from £80 million to approximately £40 million in five years, causing unemployment in the building industry, social hardship for families and the emigration of skilled tradesmen when one realises this is all because of the reckless decision taken by <Col N="387" /> the Government to reduce the funding to local authority housing, one cannot but be shocked.  I am calling on every Member to support this motion because if they do, the Government will make the necessary funding available to alleviate the hardship suffered by so many families.  If that additional funding is provided, we will see a major pick up in the building industry and in the related service industries.  If the Government are serious about tackling unemployment, this is one way they can bring up to 20,000 workers back into the building and related service industries.  At the same time, this would provide the necessary housing for many families who are on waiting lists for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The increase in mortgage interest rates has caused great difficulties and as a result of that and repossession orders further large numbers of people will be on the local authority housing list making a desperate situation worse.  There are anything up to a dozen repossession orders in the courts each month and many of those people, unfortunately, will lose their homes.  This is because of the Government's failure to tackle the huge increase in interest rates and by their deliberate decision to reduce mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to seek the necessary additional funding to allow local authorities to get on with their housing programme, as they were doing in the mid-eighties.  In 1987, as a result of a decision by the 1983-87 Government over 3,000 local authority houses were completed. In 1989, that figure had dropped to 768, because of lack of funding &mdash; these figures were provided by the Department.  It is a desperate indictment of this Government that they have allowed that situation to continue.  If it were not for the huge emigration from the west, those figures would be even worse.  The emigration in the late eighties and early nineties helped to save the Government from an even more embarrassing situation.</P>
    <P>This motion is very timely because the Government are now preparing their <Col N="388" /> Estimates for the coming year.  Now is the time to take action to give the local authorities the necessary finance.  They have the engineering staff, in many cases they have the sites, and they have the expertise to get on with a building programme. All they need from the Minister is money which is vital to create employment in rural areas, to reduce the huge housing lists and to reduce the desperate suffering on many families who, if they go on the housing list now, will not be rehoused for up to ten or 15 years.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me pleasure to second this motion.  We are coming to the end of the year and next year's Estimates are being drawn up.  In recent weeks evidence has been emerging that many houses will be repossessed.  Some of these houses are in private ownership but because of repossessions these people will be back on the housing lists.  In other cases due to economic circumstances, people have been unable to keep up the repayments on local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The housing lists in each county are getting out of control over the last four or five years.  Much of what I am saying is not directed personally at the Minister but it is directed at his party, his predecessor and his Department.  We now need to look at where we are going and how much money we need.  The amounts provided over the last six years, according to the Department's figures were, in 1987, £77 million, in 1988 £35 million, in 1989 £21 million, in 1990 nearly £34 million, in 1991 £43 million and this year, £41 million.  I have rounded the figures up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each area, and particularly in the Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown area, our housing lists are growing weekly.  The Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown authority, which takes in Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Rathdown area had a report recently which showed a total of 1,300 local authority housing applicants, between both areas &mdash; 700 in the Rathdown area and almost 600 in the borough. What have we been doing?  How many <Col N="389" /> houses have been built?  The figure of completed houses in 1991 for the whole of Dublin was 72.  Senator Foley has been batting well because last year his area was top of the list.  This year Dún Laoghaire Corporation have built 14 houses, three houses in one area and another 11 in Rockford Park.  So surprised and thrilled were we with our three houses that, at one of the council meetings, one councillor was wondering if we should have an official opening.  That goes to show how serious the situation is.</P>
    <P>As I said, the housing lists in every area have been growing.  Because of the lack of funding, more and more people are being confined to expensive bedsitters or damp and squalid conditions, and in terms of family units in a house, more people are having to double up and treble up.  This leads to serious social problems, and friction within families.  People come down to my clinic weekly wondering when they can get out of their present hell.  What can we say?</P>
    <P>In Dublin we have submitted various schemes and we get a report every month.  For example, some documents are with the Department since 1988 awaiting sanction or tender.  At every step the Department delay some of these applications, they put applications etc. on hold.  This is keeping men, women and children in over-crowded, squalid conditions, in unhealthy situations where boys, girls and adolescents are all crowded into one room where people are trying to put children to bed in what is meant to be the livingroom while, at the same time, other people in the same room are trying to watch television or study.  I am asking the Minister to get his act together.  He is presiding over a crisis that is growing in every county in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My colleague has given some of the figures.  In each year in the mid-seventies 25,000 houses were completed.  At times that Government was derided for it. What should we be doing to a Government whose historic figures for house completions are as follows: 1,450 in 1988, 768 in 1989, 1,003 in 1990, and 1,180 in 1991.  The figure for the waiting list for Dún Laoghaire at the moment is 1,300 <Col N="390" /> and rising.  This is how much this Government care about the people who are in damp, squalid and overcrowded conditions. I ask the Minister to start providing a realistic sum of money.  I have already given the figures which show the total lack of commitment in relation to the provision of realistic funds for housing construction and refurbishment.</P>
    <P>In this city, in other areas and probably in the Minister's constituency in Cork, there are Victorian houses which lack the basic facilities, with no bathroom or toilet.  There are damp houses which, with any sense of decency, should be rubble tomorrow, except where would we put the people?  Senator Neville will paint a similar picture in relation to his own county.  I am sure Senator Foley will agree with what I say, despite a good performance in Kerry in 1990.  We can congratulate him in that.  At least he is doing his job in that they were top of the class with 80 houses.</P>
    <P>This situation cannot continue.  We cannot continue to tell the people who are in severe financial difficulty that they must stay in damp and squalid bedsitters, in flats, paying exorbitant rents, in houses where there is overcrowding leading to the break-up of recently married couples, causing internal friction between families where there are 12 or 14 people in a house which was basically designed for a mother, father and one or two children. This situation exists throughout this country but there has not been any real attempt by the Government to address the situation, to come forward with any real response.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Senators on the opposite side tonight can support their Mickey Mouse amendment.  I ask them tonight to show the Government they agree with our motion, to show them that in each of their constituencies they are getting the same message I am getting. We are heading into the home straight and, come the next election, the people will deliver their message to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad <Col N="391" /> Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>notes the substantial increase in the number of new house completions in 1992 todate and, in the context of the changing pattern of social housing needs, welcomes the more diverse and innovative response to these needs provided for in <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>The plan for social housing which was announced just over a year ago is the most important policy statement affecting housing for many years.  It set out to change a situation where there was only one answer to every housing problem. That answer has always been to build more and more local authority houses.  It was a simple solution that suited simpler times but nowadays we recognise that large-scale, one class housing on a green-field site just does not work from the social or economic viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Some people have criticised the social housing plan.  It is very easy to be critical but none of the critics has come up with any answers.  I find it ironic that the very people who are loudest in calling for local housing building to be resumed on a grand scale also have a high profile in criticising the serious problems of the same estates they hold up as the only way forward for the future.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see a new approach to social housing, one that will give people a real choice, give them the chance to get the sort of home they want and lift them out of the hopeless situation of having no option except the waiting list.  At the same time I am glad to know that the more appropriate scale local authority housing programme will still be there to look after those who cannot be housed under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The fact that there will be more completions of local authority houses this year than in the past four years is proof positive, if that were needed, that the Government are fully committed to get everyone into decent housing.  The new strategy is good.  People who, with a certain <Col N="392" /> amount of help, can house themselves will get that help.  Voluntary bodies looking after disadvantaged groups will also be encouraged.  Those who have to rely on publicly funded housing can be assured that there is also a clear commitment to look after them.</P>
    <P>One of the most worthwhile measures in the plan is the shared ownership system.  There is a great desire in most Irish people to own their own houses and this is shown in our high home ownership rate of over 80 per cent.  The response to tenant purchase schemes from people wanting to buy out their rented houses is further proof of this desire.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that those who could not afford to purchase a house with a conventional mortagage will now also have a chance of achieving their goal through the shared ownership system. Under the mortgage system the repayments remain fairly constant throughout the loan period.  The repayments are much the same after 20 years as at the beginning.  However, as a proportion of income, they are usually much greater at the start.  The fact that the repayment burden is at its heaviest compared to income in the early years, coupled with all the other expenses of buying a house, simply puts home ownership out of the reach of many people in lower incomes.</P>
    <P>Shared ownership offers a mechanism which increases the capacity of people on lower incomes to afford to buy a house. It does not necessarily reduce the cost of becoming a home owner.  Instead, its spreads the burden in a more affordable way.  Independent commentators have welcomed the system and have shown that in the early years shared ownership keeps outgoings at a much lower level than under the ordinary mortgage.  The shared ownership system caters for many people who would otherwise need to be housed in local authority accommodation.</P>
    <P>I accept that many local authorities have housing problems.  Senator Cosgrave referred to my own local authority, the Kerry County Council, which has problems in relation to housing.  As a local authority, we have a very serious <Col N="393" /> financial problem with regard to the essential repair scheme and disabled persons' grant scheme.  Both schemes have been grounded in Kerry County Council. An appeal has already been made to the Minister, during his recent visit to Kerry, to make the extra essential funding available forthwith.  The discontinuation of both schemes is an undesirable development which will save very little money. Both schemes played a major role in retaining the fabric of houses in a very good condition and allowed an aged or disabled person to remain in the family home.</P>
    <P>We have a housing problem in Kerry County Council.  At present there are 590 applicants listed for rehousing of which approximately 360 are acute.  Some 40 applicants are listed for demountable units.  Our building programme consists of 70 houses brought forward from 1991 with approximately 56 starts in the current year.  We have already made an appeal to the Minister for a further 100 starts before the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council have 2,098 rented houses plus 1,527 on a tenant purchase scheme.  The average rent is £10 per week and many are on the minimum rent.  The plan for social housing is reasonably successful in Kerry.  Shared ownership schemes and the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies for units for elderly persons have also proved very attractive.</P>
    <P>The officials of Kerry County Council find that the £10,000 house improvement loan scheme is proving difficult to sell. One of the problems is the technical conditions which must apply when the job is completed.  Following a recent meeting of Kerry County Council it was decided to make a submission to the Minister with regard to the reintroduction of the House reconstruction grants scheme but with very definite controls regarding qualifications. I hope the Minister will respond in a very short time.  Many local authority tenants are looking forward to the reintroduction of the tenant purchase scheme.  Many tenants over the past few years have responded to appeals from the local authority by carrying out their own <Col N="394" /> repairs.  For this reason it is essential that the new purchase scheme be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of months I have been fed up listening to what the Opposition parties would do to provide houses for everyone if only they were in power. It is very easy for some of them, they never have or never will have to face up to their promises.  Those who have been in Government did not do well in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A seven year decline in housing output in the mid-1980s has been turned around and we are now back to building 20,000 houses a year compared with only 15,900 in 1988.  The plan for social housing is without doubt the biggest step forward we have ever seen and has given everyone a real chance to have a decent home.  The plan is a dramatic move away from the previous situation where there were only two options: you could either buy a house or apply to the local authority and wait until they fixed you up with whatever become available. These narrow limits are not acceptable any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan for social housing is full of new thinking.  It contains radical new schemes that will open access to good quality housing for everyone.  These new schemes include a system of shared ownership to which I have referred. Housing co-operatives, where a group of householders get together to provide their own houses, will be encouraged. They will now be able to get block loans <Col N="395" /> to buy sites and pay builders.  The local authority will also be able to provide sites and technical back-up for them at minimal costs.  Local authority tenants wishing to acquire a private house will also be given special help whereby their mortgages will be reduced for the first five years through the mortgage allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Many of us as local authority members will know of voluntary housing groups who have built houses for the elderly. This sector will provide 550 housing units this year with the assistance of generous grants from the Department of the Environment. The voluntary housing concept is now being extended to family-type accomodation with special new grants and subsidies that will cover up the 100 per cent of the cost of building the houses.</P>
    <P>The elderly, needless to say, have not been forgotten and they, with the homeless, will continue to be a special focus of Government policy.  Overall the new measures brought in by the Government will make signficant progress in meeting housing needs over a wide range of options and not just the old discredited large scale local authority housing schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take charge of procedures, Sir, but I thought the amendment would need a seconder. Can I begin by lamenting the transformation of the Fianna Fáil Party from a party which believed in public housing. However limited their record might have been &mdash; and it could always have been better &mdash; I was brought up to believe that some of the reasons my family always supported Fianna Fáil were, among other things, their commitment to public housing and their belief that the role of the State was to redistribute resources towards those who could not afford to do various things for themselves, a belief which brought the party in conflict with many people in the thirties when, it is difficult to believe now, a lot of academics described Fianna Fáil as a Bolshevik party. Many of them, incidentally, would be <Col N="396" /> from Senator Neville's party.  They thought Fianna Fáil was a Bolshevik party.  They would have no problems now sorting out where Fianna Fáil fit on the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most cynical action of the 1987-89 minority Fianna Fáil Government was their abandonment of public housing.  They probably could foresee some but perhaps not the scale of the objections to the health cutbacks.  They knew, as any politican knows, that cutbacks in expenditure on housing take a few years to reach down because funds have to be committed essentially a few years in advance.  Before I continue, can I ask the Chair's permission to share my time with Senator Norris?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with this motion is that it is so obviously true that it is impossible to defend or produce a logical case against it.  You cannot provide housing without money.  Do I have to argue that case with my friends in Government or in Fianna Fáil?  If they wish they can produce numerous arguments as to why we do not have the money.  I would deal with those quite happily and will deal with them in a moment anyway, just so that I am not accused of not saying where the money will come from.  If there are people on the opposite side or in Government who are going to try to persuade us that you can build houses without money, then there are many people in Irish society who will be delighted to hear how to do it because then they can build their own houses without money.  The reality is that if you take money out of housing you reduce the number of houses that are built and I defy anybody to stand up here and say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, both in their single party manifestation in Government during 1987-89 and their coalition manifestation since, have taken out of the housing market, by comparison with the first half of the eighties, the best part of £1 billion and the consequence is that houses are <Col N="397" /> not built.  This is so obvious and so self-evident that it is impossible to believe we can have a serious debate and serious politicians who actually believe the Government have a housing record they can boast about.</P>
    <P>The Government have a record of remarkable creativity in the use of very limited funds to give the impression that they are doing a whole lot.  That is what the programme for social housing is about.  It is about a lot of things that should have been done when we had a great deal of money.  They are now being used to cover the nakedness of the Government's housing policy with a lot of creative, imaginative things that, had they been done with resources, would be wonderful additions to the way we look after our public housing, but they are nothing more than cover-ups for the reality that they have effectively come close to stopping putting public money into housing.  The scale of funding is the critical issue and nobody in those two Governments has ever addressed it.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, it seems that the present senior Minister for the Environment, with his increasing public commitment to the rigidities of Thatcherite economics, is not even going to struggle at the Cabinet table for increasing funding.  Because the junior Minister present is a long standing acquaintance &mdash; I would venture to say a friend &mdash; I cannot turn the sarcasm I am capable of on him with the same enthusiasm, However, I warn him that even our long-lasting friendship will not be a guarantee in the future if the Government continue to try to defend the indefensible.  If he comes into this House and says &ldquo;We do not have the money&rdquo;, I can accept that as a logical if, totally incorrect position.  However, to tell the Irish people, or to tell the people on the rapidly expanding housing lists, that we have a serious housing programme which may at some time or other meet their needs is a nonsense.  The money is not there.  The resources are not there and, increasingly, the commitment is not there.</P>
    <P>I have to say that I get a distinct impression that the political leadership <Col N="398" /> of the Department of the Environment is probably relieved to have a lot of this funding out of the way, that it was becoming more of a nuisance then anything else, and that the idea and the principle of public housing would be out of the way.  The attitude is, do not let us get diverted into new ways of managing local authority stock through shared ownership and so on.  They are all great ideas, but the bottom line is hard cash.  Nice imaginative ways to provide a few million pounds for subsidised housing of one kind or another for one or other group in urgent need and in public visibility is very easy, because if you have knocked £150 million or so off the total budget it is easy to produce £5 million or £6 million out of that to deal with the extreme and publicly visible cases.</P>
    <P>I am aware of all that has been done in the past in many areas of extreme need.  If we had anything like the previous commitment, this Government would deserve enormous praise for the things that have happened on the margins of the housing market where there are areas of extreme need.  What we have got here again is a further classic example of a policy that is being pursued by the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of the Environment for the past five years &mdash; a redistribution from the moderately poor to the very poor.  That is what has happened here.  Local authority house building has largely come to a halt.  In its place we have got imaginative schemes to deal with high profile groups of extreme deprivation, which keeps the heat off in the short term, which gives the impression of enormous benevolence in the short term but which, combined with the lack of serious funding, must be seen as essentially an exercise in cynicism.  It is a cynical way to protect people from the consequences of their own decisions.</P>
    <P>Before I let in my colleague, Senator Norris, may I make the following comment. Having constructed financial rectitude on the backs of the poor, which is what was done in the whole area of housing, this Government if they have any social conscience left, which I am <Col N="399" /> beginning to doubt, must begin to build houses again.  The usual question I will be asked is: how?  I will tell you how. They should borrow the money to do so.</P>

      <P>I will stop this instant and say they should borrow the money to build houses, because housing is a worthwhile, productive, useful investment. It is not wasted money.  It is not money down the drain.  It adds to the stock and the assets of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Ryan, for giving me some time.  Previous to this 1,500 houses a year were built in the Dublin area.  We are now down to 50.  There are 50 houses being built at the moment and there are also some developments in Sheriff Street. Across the road from me there is, Avondale House, Cumberland House, Liberty House, St. Joseph's Mansions and Lourdes Mansions &mdash; all in desperate need of refurbishment.  In the north inner city in the past three years only one refurbishment programme has been undertaken, at St. Mary's Mansions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation's maintenance officer drafted a report four years ago on a programme as a result of delegations in the area visiting him and targeted specific work that needed to be done to prevent future deterioration to a critical point in these flats.  One example, was window replacement, where PVC windows were installed.  That means they do not need to be painted, they are also energy efficient, so further down the line it actually saves money.  Yet this was not done.  It also improves the health of families. The conditions of damp and squalor are not only dangerous physically but they are also dangerous to the health of people, and it is noticeable that once <Col N="400" /> again there is a rise in TB in the inner city.</P>
    <P>This is not confined to just the north inner city.</P>
    <P>I have here &mdash; I have not time to place it on the record &mdash; a document from the Marrowbone Lane Residents' Association who demand that their flats be refurbished.  Their flats are 53 years old. They are living in uninhabitable conditions from 45 years of neglect &mdash; windows falling out, raw sewage on the pavements, inadequate water supply, downdraughts in chimneys, dampness in bedrooms and bad drains.  As a civilised society we cannot be happy or satisfied about such conditions.</P>
    <P>The housing list, we are told, is not a real problem, that there are very few people on it.  In fact, there are 4,500 people on the housing list in Dublin and that does not even reflect the real scale of the problem, because in addition to that 4,500 there is the transfer list, and the transfer list deals mainly with large families living in one bedroom flats. Some 7,000 families are on this list, 7,000 families in substandard accommodation. Some 90 per cent of these families are on social welfare, so the only opportunity they get for some kind of decent accommodation is to be housed by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time-worn tradition of Opposition motions the Fine Gael motion now before this House condemns the Government and looks for more money.  This kind of cliché approach is not likely to impress anyone as a constructive or fruitful way of addressing the complex issue of housing in a modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bland and blanket condemnation of housing policy is attempted in spite of the fact that this year is showing a highly satisfactory level of new housing production. <Col N="401" /> The fact is new house completions in the first eight months of this year totalled about 14,300, which is up 15 per cent on the same period last year. Indeed, the total number of new houses built in the period January to August this year was the highest level for any equivalent period in the past six years.</P>
    <P>Total housing completions have been increasing in recent years.  This does not happen by accident.  We have only to look at the period in the mid 1980s when the proposers of this motion were in office.  For the full period of that Government from 1983 to 1987 total housing completions fell consistently year after year.  In fact, this serious decline was so deeply established that it took two years after their leaving office in 1987 for the downward trend to be reversed.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>You are on that side of the House and you will be staying there for a very long time because of the policies you pursued at that time.</P>
      <P>Since 1989 I am happy to say that, in marked contrast to the experience in Government of the proposers of this motion, annual housing completions have increased steadily year after year.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons, if not the main reason, housing output has been increasing in recent years is the widespread belief that the economic fundamentals in this country are sound.  If people have confidence in the running of the economy they will have confidence to undertake the long term commitment involved in borrowing for house purchase. We all know that house purchase is the most significant investment decision taken by most individuals and families in their lifetimes.  People need confidence to undertake a mortgage loan with repayments stretching well into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent increase in interest rates undoubtedly represents a setback for housing but the sound economic fundamentals give us every reason to believe that this will be a passing phase.  Indeed, trends in the financial markets this week <Col N="402" /> lend considerable support to this belief.  I wish to take this opportunity to commend the lending institutions right across the spectrum for their co-operation and goodwill in ensuring that hard hit households are cushioned from the immediate impact of the rise in interest rates.</P>
    <P>The motion is also unreal in its implication that it is only by providing more money for local authority house building that social housing needs can be met.  No one has informed us how much money or where it is to come from.  In today's climate calls from Opposition speakers for more public spending on particular services, however deserving they may be, have no credibility unless the expenditure is quantified and its budgetary implications spelled out.  Is the party proposing this motion suggesting that we increase taxes, or perhaps resort to borrowing?  If so, are they prepared to face up to the consequences of fiscal laxity in terms, for example, of the effect on interest rates and employment?</P>
    <P>There is little credibility in calls for building thousands of extra local authority houses without saying how they are to be financed, because the building and maintenance of local authority housing is an expensive business.  The cost of each new local authority house to the taxpayer now stands at about £85 per week.  What other services are going to be cut back to provide the estimated £90,000 which the average new local authority house is going to cost the taxpayer over the next 20 years?</P>
    <P>All that is not to say that the Government are in any way complacent about housing problems.  Within the overall housing system there are, of course, considerable problems to which solutions must be found.  These include the provision of accommodation for households on low incomes, the accommodation of the homeless and travellers and the upgrading and replacement of substandard accommodation.</P>
    <P>However, if we do not learn from the mistakes of the past we are condemned to repeat them.  We must learn from the past and we must also learn from the present.  In recent years the very nature <Col N="403" /> of social housing needs has changed completely. The traditional family unit is now in a minority on many local authority waiting lists.  These lists have now come to be dominated by one parent families and single person households.  The current wide range of social housing needs &mdash; from traditional family units to one parent families, single unemployed young people, the homeless and the elderly &mdash; require a diverse range of measures to appropriately address them. This is what the Government have put in place through the Plan for Social Housing followed up by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>Households on modest incomes now have an opportunity to become home owners through the new system of shared ownership.  We have a new rental subsidy scheme to make available rented housing to low income families at affordable rents.  Local authorities can carry out improvements or extensions to an existing dwelling as an alternative to rehousing. Local authorities are enabled to provide cheap housing sites.  These are but some of the new ways of addressing housing needs.</P>
    <P>All the new schemes were introduced on a developed basis, with full responsibility for implementation on the ground being given to local authorities rather than being administered by the Department. This is in line with the Government's policy of maximising devolution and also recognising that local authorities are in the best position to operate the various measures in an integrated way that will maximise their impact on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>However, the success of the many new schemes in the plan requires greater energy, flexibility and creativity on the part of the local authority members as well as staff compared to the relatively straighforward and familiar solution of local authority housebuilding.  It is for this reason that sustained efforts have been underaken by the Minister, by myself and by the Department to inform and assist local authorities in the implementation of the plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> In addition, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, which came into force on 1 September 1992, provides the legislative framework for many of the new measures contained in the plan.  The provision of full legal backing for these schemes should assist authorities in stepping up activity to make the best use of resources available to meet the housing needs of their areas.</P>
    <P>While some local authorities have recorded good progress in the implementation of the new measures, nevertheless, in other local authority areas the progress has been disappointing.  My Department are arranging individual meetings with the management of these authorities to encourage and assist them to respond effectively to the measures in the plan and to help identify and overcome any difficulties they may be experiencing.</P>
    <P>I would like to indicate briefly the progress which has been achieved by local authorities in the implementation of the new measures.  Up to 30 June last local authorities had received over 2,300 applications for shared ownership, nearly 900 were approved in principle and 181 transactions were completed.  There was in fact a considerable increase in activity under the scheme during the second quarter of 1992.  The capital allocation for this scheme is £35 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>Under the £3,300 mortgage allowance scheme, over 350 applications had been received with over 190 approved.  Under the improvement works scheme 22 houses had been improved under the scheme while work was ongoing to 18 houses at end June last.  This scheme was widely welcomed as a good response to circumstances where the improvement of the existing accommodation would provide a quicker and more cost effective solution to a housing need.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, contains provisions designed to help to remove difficulties or delays relating to non-registration of ownership of houses being improved under this scheme.</P>
    <P>At the end of June 1992, 154 sites had been sold under the sale of sites scheme and local authorities had a further 126 sites approved for sale.  Again, as in the <Col N="405" /> other schemes, progress has been uneven with some local authorities able to use the scheme to much better effect than others.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing rental subsidy scheme is now showing very good progress &mdash; one project in Waterford by Respond, involving nine units of accommodation, has been completed, four projects involving 65 units are under construction and 25 projects throughout the country containing nearly 420 units are proposed or in planning.</P>
    <P>As well as promoting and funding the new measures, this Government are committed to maintaining the traditional local authority housing programme at a level that has regard to needs and to the resources available.  An additional 1,500 dwellings will be provided by local authorities this year, including houses built and acquired, compared with 1,180 last year.  Some 3,400 local authority dwellings will be vacated during 1992 allowing about 4,900 new lettings in all to be made by local authorities.  Taking local authority housing, including vacancies, voluntary housing, shared ownership and the other measures in the Plan for Social Housing together, we should be catering for over 6,200 additional households in 1992 compared to around 5,400 in 1991.</P>
    <P>The House should be aware that the original overall capital provision for housing in 1992, including both Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, amounted to some £158 million &mdash; up 30 per cent on the outturn figure for 1991.  The substantial increase this year was due primarily to the increased take up of the various new measures introduced in the Plan for Social Housing. Specifically the total capital provision for the local authority and voluntary housing programmes amounted to £78 million, an increase of over 3 per cent on the 1991 outturn.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate housing for our people has always been a top priority for Fianna Fáil and that is why we, as a nation, are better housed than many richer countries.  I can assure the House that the present Government have the same concern to secure decent housing <Col N="406" /> for every family regardless of their means.  To this end we have shown a readiness to try new approaches as well as the traditional ones.  Sadly, the drafters of this motion have not shown that they have learned anything from the past or have much to contribute now.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of John Boland's house improvement grant which was introduced in 1985.  When it was discontinued in 1987, over £200 million was owing which had to be provided by the Exchequer.  We are all aware of the letter sent out just before an election advising everybody that they were entitled to a grant.  That is on record.  When the scheme was discontinued we were paying £5 million per week and up to very recently applications were still coming in. That is the kind of legacy we were left. That is why I say: you are on that side of the House and that is where you are going to stay.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about the eighties.  Everybody knows that the country was bankrupt in the eighties, and Fianna Fáil were not responsible for it; everybody knows Fine Gael and Labour were.  You cannot run away from realities.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten alleges that the SDA loans scheme has been abolished. This is simply not true.  Let us get the facts if you want to come in here and make wild statements.  When you are not making the decisions you have all the answers; but when they were making the decisions they did not make very good ones.  I will give some facts.  It is not true that the SDA loans scheme has been abolished.  They are available from local authorities when people cannot get loans from other institutions.  We should at least be accurate in what we are saying here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister did not say is that before you can get an SDA loan you have to prove yourself literally unworthy of a loan from any other institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

      <P>The Senator must make up his mind.  He is saying that the <Col N="407" /> resources of the State have to be used for those most in need.  The fault with the 1985 scheme was that everybody, a millionaire or a pauper, could apply for a grant to build an extension to a residence or a guesthouse.  We could have built many houses with £200 million.</P>
      <P>We have a major housing problem and let us put our heads together and work on it.  There is a limit to our resources.  We should use them as best we can as we are doing in the Plan for Social Housing. I commend amendment No. 1 to the House.</P>

It continues: &ldquo;and the tenants enjoy decent, hygienic and healthy living conditions.&rdquo;  I fully support the motion from the Fine Gael Party. My intention was that the Labour Party amendment would cover not only the finance required for the housing policy but also deal with maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take the Minister up on his misleading and inaccurate speech.  He said that for the full period of the Government from 1983 to 1987 total housing completions fell consistently year after year and that this serious decline was so deeply established that it took two years <Col N="408" /> after their leaving office in 1987 for the downward trend to be reversed.  That is rubbish and I will quote figures from Dublin Corporation's record for that time.</P>
    <P>In 1983, £70 million was spent on building 1,753 houses.  In 1986 before Fianna Fáil came into office £41.6 million was spent on 1,014 houses.  That is as much as Fianna Fáil built in all of last year. That was by one local authority and does not include Dublin county area.  In 1987, the figure of £41.6 million was reduced to £18.7 million because Fianna Fáil did not give the rates support grant to Dublin Corporation.  Some 446 houses were built in 1987 compared with 1,014 in 1986; that is less than 50 per cent.  In 1988, the £18.7 million was reduced to a £2.75 million capital allocation when 148 units of accommodation were built and in 1989 no unit of accommodation was built nor was funding provided.  Last year 74 units of accommodation were built.  This year we expect to have 100 units, 50 of which will be new and 50 which will replace existing stock being de-tenanted in Sheriff Street.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the serious decline was so deeply established it took two years for the downward trend to be reversed.  What does he mean by &ldquo;reversed&rdquo;?  The Minister does not know what direction he is going in if that is the manner in which he describes it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>My direction is very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for a slight reduction between 1983 and 1987 was because the quantity of housing supplied exceeded demand.  In the mid-eighties there was an enormous housing shortage which began in the sixties, continued through the seventies but by the mid-eighties the Government who came to power in 1983 had provided sufficient housing so that demand was less than the supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has now been reversed and we are in a new crisis.  There was no housing crisis in the mid-eighties but there is a crisis now in the early nineties <Col N="409" /> which will take a Government other than this to address.  At present there are 23,000 applicants for houses and the Minister puts the maximum figure of houses that can be provided by all schemes in 1992 at 6,260.  In the Dublin area one house is being built for every ten people in need of housing.  I ask the Minister, how he can say the schemes being proposed will cater for the people who are traditionally the recipients of local authority housing?  How can a private form of housing manage to house the 80 to 90 per cent of people dependent on social welfare?  How can these people pay a mortgage or contribute to the shared ownership scheme?  It is not enough for the Minister to say it is a wonderful scheme.  It may be a wonderful scheme but it is of no use to persons without an income.  How can a recipient of social welfare avail of these schemes?</P>
    <P>The bottom line as members of local authorities know is that public housing must cater for people who are unable financially to obtain accommodation for themselves.  It is no use saying that people should have money to pay for some semiprivate scheme.  They do not and the situation will get worse as the unemployment queues lengthen.</P>
    <P>Tremendous work has been done by voluntary housing schemes already in existence.  I have no problem with the shared ownership scheme or with the mortgage assistance scheme but they are not sufficient on their own.  They do not cater for those on the bottom rung.</P>
    <P>We had an excess of accommodation in 1987 and now we have a considerable housing shortage.  Some 4,377 people in the Dublin Corporation area are in need of housing at present.  The maximum number of vacancies this year is 1,400. There is leeway to be made up here before any talk of transfers.  A few months ago the transfer list numbered 6,000 people.  Now 7,000 people in inadequate accommodation are seeking to transfer to better or more hygienic accommodation.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the position with regard to hostels.  The annual report from Focus Point revealed that hostels for the <Col N="410" /> homeless are 97 to 99 per cent full at all times.  That reflects the inability of local authorities to house the homeless.  Bed and breakfast accommodation is increasing at a scandalous rate.  Last year £40,000 was spent on bed and breakfast accommodation by Dublin Corporation; this year it will be in the region of £250,000 to £300,000.  Families are being put into bed and breakfast establishments because there is no other accommodation for them.  The Minister tells us that the matter is being dealt with adequately.  We cannot accept that.</P>
    <P>There is a housing crisis now which did not exist five or six years ago and the crisis is worsening in every local authority area.  The measures the Minister mentioned in his speech are not adequate to cope with that crisis and the Government must face up to its obligations to accommodate people unable to accommodate themselves.  A person with, say, a 25 per cent mortgage obtaining mortgage relief over a 25 year period, will receive £25,000 in subsidy from the State; effectively, a private home purchaser will receive a subsidy from the State equal to the value of the mortgage.  Yet the Government will not consider funding housing accommodation for those unable to fund it themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of speakers and to the Minister. We are all responsible to a certain extent for the current housing problem.  No Government, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, has ever pushed the voluntary housing sector sufficiently.  I am surprised that some of the Independent Members, like Senator B. Ryan, who often gives examples of social conditions in countries such as Sweden and Holland &mdash; where voluntary housing is a success &mdash; did not mention this.  One of the reasons for our present crisis is our past failure to push voluntary housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion refers to two areas.  We must look at the Government's housing record and at new measures being introduced, many of which are working well.  The problem is that local authorities do not promote them.  On the <Col N="411" /> point raised by Senator Costello, 17 houses were recently completed in Ringsend. Approximately ten local authority tenants will give up flats to take up those houses; most of them on the shared ownership scheme.  That is great; it is not enough but it is definitely a start.  We are beginning to change people's perception of how they might get housing.  That is an example of ten flats becoming available because people are moving into three-bedroomed houses on the shared ownership scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  What we must do is what they have done in other countries. They have removed people who can afford houses from their housing list. There are many people on our housing list who, with the incentives available in the Government's programme, would be able to leave the list, allowing local authorities to spend the allocation on the people Senator Costello is talking about, the people who really need housing and who do not have money.  That is where the emphasis should be placed.  People who can afford to use one of these schemes should be encouraged to do so and the Government's policy allows for that.</P>
      <P>This is a new beginning which will help everybody regardless of what party is in power.  We cannot go back to the old way of spending huge amounts of money on greenfield sites.  Social problems were caused by the old schemes and Fine Gael and Labour are responsible for the building of these houses also.  We must adopt a different approach to housing, and full recognition should be given to the Government's housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 in one area 150 dwellings were built by voluntary housing and in 1991 600 dwellings were built; I gather that in 1992 the number will be even greater. We are not paying sufficient attention to these sources of housing.  At planning committee meetings in my own local authority there are one or two planning <Col N="412" /> applications received per month for some kind of voluntary housing.  I welcome that.  It would be easy for us to argue about it here but that would do nothing for people in need of housing.</P>
    <P>The country needs to look again at how it has built its houses and at its housing policy.  The Government's programme is doing that.  I have no doubt that if we were removed from power tomorrow other parties would continue with our policy with minor changes perhaps.  We have made a long overdue new start.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to Dublin County Council in 1985, one of its problems was the boarding up of houses that had been wrecked because too many had been built.  We need to keep a closer eye on how we build and we must ensure that local authorities push housing schemes.  I do not believe that Dublin Corporation is pushing the flat sales scheme.  Not one flat has been sold recently.  Deputy Ruairí Quinn said last week that the tenants of Ringsend and Pearse Street are tired of being told that they will be sold their flats; four and five years later they have not been sold.</P>
    <P>A new attitude must be adopted and it is up to us, as members of local authorities, to put pressure on the local authorities to enact many of these schemes. We all know of the in-built opposition to voluntary housing in Dublin Corporation. They have said publicly that they do not favour it.  The former Assistant City Manager said that they had a few bad experiences with it and have been stuck with them.  If we are to tackle this housing problem and encourage people to buy their own houses we must push this new plan for voluntary housing.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion refers to refurbishment and I agree that some of the conditions in which tenants live are unacceptable.  This was the case when the Senator's party was in power also and nobody did anything about it then.  I am not being party political about this because I deal with this issue every day. I would love to see more money spent on the refurbishment of some inner city dwellings.  I have no doubt that bad housing conditions exist all over the country, <Col N="413" /> with people in accommodation without indoor toilet and proper washing facilities. The Government have started to tackle that problem in some of the worst schemes in Dublin's south and north inner city.  We have identified the worst cases and I would like to see this done more quickly.</P>
    <P>I can understand the frustration of people living in flat complexes where there is a good community spirit and where responsibility is taken for some maintenance when flats that have been allowed to run down get refurbished first. I have spoken to the Minister on a number of occasions about the possibility of a plan under which people who look after their flat complexes would be rewarded.  A stitch in time saves nine. Windows should be put in for people who will then keep their flats in good condition.  The flat complexes in worst condition are being done &mdash; they should be done &mdash; but the flats that are well kept are not being refurbished or at best, very slowly.</P>
    <P>We need a new attitude towards public housing and the Government's programme is a start in that direction.  The Minister for the Environment would love to announce the spending of hundreds of millions of pounds on building new houses.  All politicians like to announce good news but, unfortunately, the money is not there.  We are trying with limited resources to be as effective as we can.</P>
    <P>A new attitude to housing is required in the long term.  It will benefit everybody when people who want and who can afford to buy into a housing co-operative or a shared ownership scheme come off the housing list.  Then we can identify the deprived and those who cannot afford other schemes and we will be able to house them properly.  I agree that the housing waiting list is very long but there are people who, with a little incentive, would leave the list enabling us to tackle the problem of those who really need public housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and agree that the Government have reneged on their housing policy and that we are <Col N="414" /> facing a crisis.  Everybody involved in local government, in a county or urban council, knows that this is a growing problem.  I am amazed that the Minister does not recognise the extent of the problem. Senator Foley did not admit that there was a problem.  Senator Eoin Ryan was more open and honest in his contribution. We must immediately embark on a plan to correct the situation.  There are too many people in inadequate housing as I notice every day, and do other councillors.  People live in caravans and in over-crowded conditions.  I know of one family with plastic bags covering their caravan to keep the water out.  I know of another family of four sharing a three bedroomed house with 15 people. This is totally unacceptable.  In a recent letting adjacent to me, one house became available.  In excess of 40 families applied for that house, an indication of the gravity of the situation.  We cannot and should not tolerate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Limerick there are 320 families on the present waiting list.  Last year, according to official figures there were 19 completions.  At that rate of completions it would take almost 20 years to satisfy the present demand.  In Cork, the Minister's county, in excess of 600 families are on the waiting list and 200 of those are in chronic acommodation.  Waterford has a housing list of 650 families, in effect, 1,300 people there are without a home. The Minister, Deputy Smith, was made aware of this last week.  In Galway there are 440 on the city and 380 on the county waiting lists, yet the Minister says it is not a crisis.  In Clare, 1,000 are on the waiting list; in Kildare and Louth the figure is also 1,000, yet the Minister says there is no crisis.  Donegal has 1,500 people on a waiting list.  Something must be done about this problem.  In Dún Laoghaire, there are 1,300 on the waiting list.  If something is not done about this problem we will have a social crisis.  As councillors of all parties we should promote a proper housing policy.  In Dublin there are in excess of 2,020 on the waiting lists.  The housing list figure for all of Dublin, county and city, is 4,500.  In south Dublin not one family on the housing list <Col N="415" /> has been housed since last February.  If that is not a crisis, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The situation has disimproved for many reasons, one of which is the high level of unemployment.  Many people are not in a position to buy houses or to get a mortgage.  They do not have the required income to pay off a mortgage nor are they in a position to apply for council or other loans.  They are caught in a trap where the local authority cannot afford to house them and they are not in a position to obtain a loan because they are unemployed.  That is the worst situation for any family to be in.  Part of the response to the present crisis in employment should be the recognition that it creates a crisis in housing.  We should tackle both problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the shared housing scheme and noted that 22 houses had been improved under the scheme and work was ongoing in 18 at the end of June last.  On a national basis that scheme is not working.  It was a good concept and I spoke to the Minister about it in the debate on the Housing Bill and asked him to look at the difficulties arising there.  Most houses concerned in this scheme are in very poor condition.  They may need the addition of a bathroom, kitchen and bedroom but £10,000 is insufficient often, to bring them to the standard laid down by the Department of the Environment for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Houses in need of improvement are not always eligible.  A new house requiring an extra room would be eligible but most houses in need of repair are in a condition where £10,000 will not bring them to the level required by the Department. I ask the Minister to look at that. In the Limerick area many old cottages have been passed down from family to family and consist of two rooms and a kitchen.  Occupiers frequently try to add a bedroom and a bathroom but because £10,000 of an investment will not bring an old cottage up to the standard of a new house, the scheme cannot be availed of.  The Minister's statement that 22 houses only have been improved since <Col N="416" /> the inception of the scheme proves that point.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision of proper accommodation for travellers. We must have a national plan for the provision of halting sites for travellers. At present each county tries to pass on the problem to the next county and each town tries to pass it on to the next town. Travellers are being moved from one area to another.  It is naive to expect each county to devise a programme to provide an adequate number of camp sites.</P>

      <P>If the Senator wants me to talk about what Limerick is doing for travellers I can talk about what Rathkeale is doing where half the population are travellers.  There are in excess of 750 travellers living there.  Nobody can tell me how to deal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>There are poor and wealthy among travellers.  Social problems abound in the traveller community. Senator Honan has activated my mind now and I ask the Minister to look at the special plan for Rathkeale designed to improve the area identified as needy by the council, by the Departments of the Environment, Health, Education and others and ensure that adequate funding is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed recently to learn that a proposed training centre for travellers in Rathkeale was turned down because there is one in Newcastlewest and one in Abbeyfeale, both of which are targeted for rationalisation.  Rathkeale, where half the population are travellers and many of them very young travellers who are anxious to obtain training, were told by FÁS that it was almost certain we will not get it.  I could not believe what was said.  We are trying to improve the environment for the settled community and <Col N="417" /> for the travellers but we will not get a training centre.</P>
    <P>In Limerick in 1986, 137 houses were built; last year 19 houses were built. Surely that is an indication of a change in policy over that period.  In 1987, in excess of £77 million was spent nationally on housing; in 1991, in excess of £43 million was spent.  That is an indication of the absence of a housing policy and I am surprised Senator Foley did not recognise it as such.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm labhairt ar leasú an Rialtais ar an cheist seo mar is mór an t-iontas gur chuir an Freasúra síos rún ar an ábhar seo.  Maidir leis an polasaí a pléadh anseo nuair a cuireadh an Bille leasaithe faoi bhráid an tSeanaid díreach roimh an tsaoire, cuireadh beartais úr nua, réabhlóideach i bhfeidhm ar dearadh títhíochta sa tír seo do na blianta atá ag teacht.  Go bunúsach bhí coincheap nua leis an rud a bhí an Rialtas á dhéanamh.  Tuigeann siad go bhfuil éagsulacht i measc na daoine atá ag tóraíocht tithe agus dheineadar iarracht freastal ar an éagsúlacht sin.  Mar sin, cuireann sé an-áthas orm tacú leis an méid atá ráite sa leasú ata curtha ar aghaidh ag Fianna Fáil maidir leis an ábhar seo.</P>
      <P>I was surprised after we had a debate on the Bill for social housing just before the recess that this subject came on the agenda of the Seanad so swiftly.  The matter was thrashed out then and it was proved that the policy decisions made in the Plan for Social Housing were radical and would fundamentally change the structure of social housing in this country for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be an obsession in some quarters with the building of county council local authority houses.  We all know that there are major drawbacks to such a simplistic approach to the complicated individual circumstances of different people.  In the first place, we know that the cost of providing houses in that system is exhorbitant.  The second issue that arises from such a procedure is that we tended to build estates, particularly large estates, where one social class predominated.  There was also the problem <Col N="418" /> that when people bought their own houses they tended to move out of those estates and as a result there were huge social problems.  It did nothing for the people in the middle who could not afford to take a mortgage but could make a reasonable contribution towards funding their own houses.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership option has opened up great opportunities for these people and our job as politicians is to sell the scheme to the people.  Since the shared ownership option became available in Galway there has been a reasonable take up in both city and county.  I understand that in the city it has been so good that they are now seeking further allocations from the Department.  In rural areas couples with young families and those who are getting married but have low paid jobs, under the shared ownership option scheme, can build their own house to their own design and not be saddled with an impossible debt.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased last week when somebody, who one year ago had despaired of getting a house in the short term because they had reasonably good accommodation in a mobile home, achieved through the shared ownership option the dream of a lifetime and had their house built as far as the roof.  That was worth more to them than the county council providing them with a new house. The cost to the State was only a fraction of what would have been involved if the county council had provided the same house.  What are we doing by being innovative? We are providing houses for people who could not otherwise afford them at a cost that leaves more resources for the council or corporation to provide houses to those whose means are so low that they could not be expected to provide their own housing.</P>
    <P>Another innovation has been the development of social housing.  As politicians we must encourage communities to avail of the grants and schemes and ensure that they are taken up particularly in areas where we have problems regarding, for example, demountable dwellings and old people living on their own some distance from services, doctors and <Col N="419" /> shops.  In my area the social housing scheme has been developed to its potential. It solved a minor problem we had when old people were living in very bad conditions in an isolated area.  When we build six or ten small houses together we do not have the problem of centralised bureaucracy in maintaining them.  There is local control and we can ensure the continuity of tenancy.</P>
    <P>It is very important to limit the amount of bureaucracy involved in getting such a scheme off the ground.  Well organised and developed communities are availing of this scheme, but these schemes need to be started in less developed communities. Resources should be made available to local authorities to advise groups about how to get these schemes off the ground.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland we have often spoken about the policy of taking people out of very poor housing and putting them into demountable dwellings.  This happened because there was no adequate scheme to provide them with a reasonable sum of money to develop their existing house. Many of these houses lacked electricity, sanitary facilities, insulation, etc.  Under the repairs in lieu of social housing scheme, an opportunity has been provided to ensure that inadequate substandard housing can be brought up to standard, and the only quibble I have with that scheme is that £10,000 is too little and at a future date the Minister might consider raising that ceiling.  I accept that this amount is considerably lower than the cost of a new house but £10,000 is proving to be a little restrictive for the type of work some of these dwellings need.</P>
    <P>Overall, there has been a move towards inventiveness towards looking for value for money and, more importantly, towards continuing what was traditionally a Fianna Fáil ideal &mdash; that as many people as possible would own their own home which would be built to their specification.  In an absolute way, very few people own their house because the building societies own our houses but we all accept the concept of ownership: it is something one designs and has control <Col N="420" /> over.  The Government have made that available to a huge section of the population who would not have enjoyed that privilege if it had not been for the radical changes in the social housing plan.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, cuireann sé an-áthas orm an leasú atá curtha síos ag an Rialtas a mholadh agus tréaslaím leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit, atá i láthair anseo, as an obair iontach atá déanta acu ar an ábhar seo.</P>

Níl le déanamh acu ach dul siar go Conamara agus feicfidh siad lena súile féin cé chomh dona is atá ceist na tithíochta faoin tuath.  Go deimhin, tá an scéal go dona, agus, dá chomhartha sin, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na tithe &mdash; más féidir liom tithe a thabhairt orthu &mdash; a dtugtar demountable homes orthu.  Tá 120 díobh ann, tithe ar féidir iad a bhaint óna chéile, agus tá seandaoine ina gcónaí sna tithe sin, idir fhir is mhná, ach is daoine iad a caitheadh isteach sna rudaí seo a chuir an Rialtas seo agus an Rialtas a bhí ann rompu ar fáil.  Is í an bhliain seo chugainn bliain na sean, bliain na n-aostach, agus tá súil le Dia agam go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas seo, nó cibé Rialtas a bheidh ann, aird ar an chaoi a bhfuiltear ag caitheamh le seanmhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus le seandaoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Ní raibh Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe sásta a admháil go raibh an scéal chomh dona sin go raibh ar chuid againn cailín a raibh dioplóma i réimse sóisialta aici a fhostú le fiosruithe a dhéanamh ar thithe ó cheantar Chois Fharraige siar go Carna, agus níl anseo ach sampla de chuid den tír.

Thugamar an t-eolas sin don chomhairle contae, ach bhí an <Col N="421" /> t-eolas seo faighte acu cheana féin ó Bhord Sláinte an Iarthair.  Bhí an scéal chomh dona sin gur thug mé móid an t-am sin go raibh mé ag dul a chinntiú go gcuirfí tine faoi, go loscfaí gach demountable home a bheadh fágtha i gConamara, go mbeadh tithíocht cheart ag na seandaoine ansin, nach mbeadh siad caite i dtraipisí ag an Rialtas, is cuma cén Rialtas atá ann.  Tá an scéal seo ag dul siar rófhada; tá na seandaoine fágtha sa riocht seo i bhfad rófhada.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an scéim a dtugtar tithíocht shóisialta air, nó an social housing programme, cuirim an-fháilte roimhe seo mar feictear dom go gcabhróidh sé sa chás áirithe seo le rud dearfach, cinnte a dhéanamh ar son na seandaoine seo, agus daoine eile a bhfuil ganntanas tithíochta ag cur as dóibh.  Braitheann sé orainn uilig dlús a chur leis an obair seo lena chinntiú go n-éireoidh leis an scéim thithíochta seo.  Ní leor bheith ag caint faoi, caithfear gníomhú agus beart éigin a dhéanamh.  Ba chóir dúinne agus don Rialtas ár seacht ndícheall a dhéanamh chun a chinntiú go dtiocfaidh grúpaí deonacha le chéile le feidhm a bhaint as na deiseanna agus an chóras oibre atá ann chun go dtógfaí tithe do na seandaoine seo.  Tá géarchéim thithíochta ann agus níl aon mhaith don Rialtas ná don Aire é sin a shéanadh.</P>
    <P>Tá bealach oibre ann anois, dar liomsa, agus má tá fonn ar dhaoine teacht le chéile ina bparóistí féin agus comhoibriú leis an chomhairle contae agus an rialtas áitiúil, éireoidh linn.  Tá an deis tugtha dúinn anois chun cuidiú leis na seandaoine seo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate even though I may not necessarily agree with all of their statements.  My colleagues and I put this motion before the House because we are extremely concerned at the major social problems caused by lack of adequate housing and the huge number of families who are on the housing waiting lists.  That is the reason this motion is before the House tonight and I ask all Members of the House to support it.</P>
      <P>If this motion is adopted, it will create an awareness in Government of the need for additional funding for local authority housing.  As I stated already, the social housing scheme is not operating throughout Ireland and neither is shared ownership. I listened very carefully to the Minister's figures and at one time he mentioned 21 houses in one of the new schemes.  That would be equivalent to a housing list for a small town.  The Minister knows and I know that the scheme is not working.  It has failed.  Part of the problem with that scheme &mdash; I pointed this out when the Housing Bill, 1992 came before this House &mdash; is the question of title.  If the Minister remembers, at the end of Second Stage, he said that he was looking into that matter.  However, that is only one part of the huge problem facing the people at present.</P>
      <P>We have a major housing problem. It is a scandal in this country when one considers the huge numbers of people seeking local authority housing.  The Government have turned their back on the people who are on the housing lists, huge numbers in every county in Ireland. The Minister said we had a major problem and I am glad at least that he realises that.  I am asking him and the Minister for the Environment to procure adequate moneys to put into operation a proper local authority housing programme for the coming three to four years which will allow us to tackle with confidence the huge housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the <Col N="423" /> number of housing applicants throughout the country.  As I said earlier, I believe that figure is in excess of 30,000 families.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the house improvement scheme which was introduced by the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland. When I referred to the then Deputy Boland, I referred to the huge amount of moneys he was pumping into local authority housing and to the fact that in his last year, 1987, he gave upwards of £80 million to the local authority housing programme.  Last year this Government gave £43 million.  These are departmental figures.  They indicate a halving of the finance given over the past five years to the local authority housing programme, hence the huge waiting lists.  The Cathaoirleach and I know that in our own counties we built 70 and 80 houses in the mid-eighties in Westmeath and in Roscommon but now the number is down to 15 and 16.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the question of SDA loans being non-existent.  Last year Roscommon County Council gave out three SDA loans when normally they would handle anything up to 100 and 120 loans, simply because people must prove themselves financially unworthy both to the banks and the building societies before <Col N="424" /> they can be considered by the local authority. That is the bottom line.  That was one method by which many families used to house themselves and if those loans were still in place I believe we would not be faced with the huge housing lists we have today.</P>
    <P>The removal of the new house grant in the past five years has caused major problems for many families and young people wishing to build their own houses. All they were getting back was the VAT they paid on the materials.  It is a disgrace the scheme has not been reintroduced right across the board.  There should be no need whatever to get a contractor to build a house in order to qualify for the £2,000 new house grant.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Foighil referred to the number of demountable houses that are scattered not just throughout Connemara but, indeed, right throughout the west. It is a scandal to see many of these houses in very bad condition.  The old people should be adequately housed in accommodation for the elderly in towns and villages.  Unfortunately, we have no money to do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that for the first eight months this year there was a 15 per cent increase in the number of houses built.  It is very easy to increase from a nil base.  As I pointed out earlier, in 1987 we built 3,074 houses, this year we are building 1,500 houses but the startling figure for 1989 was 768.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the local authority house building programme <Col N="425" /> and that is the way the figures have gone.  That is why we have huge housing lists today.  I appeal to Members to support this reasonable motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the increase in house building over the past couple of years.  That is not so.  It is not a reality and no Member of this House will believe his statement.  What has happened is that the local authority house building programme which was the engine of the housing industry throughout much of rural Ireland has collapsed totally bringing with it much unemployment and leaving people in very poor housing conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if people have confidence in the economy they will have confidence in undertaking the long term commitment involved in borrowing for house purchase.  The Minister knows that in this climate nobody could have confidence in the economy.  Factories close down day in, day out.</P>
      <P>Even Aer Lingus are under tremendous pressure and they were reckoned to be a secure employer.  Several factories who depend on exports to Britain are now in great difficulty.  We see even in the Government the huge difficulties between the two partners in Government where they cannot agree on the wording for a referendum.</P>

      <P>It was a different attitude to that of the Government when in 1987 the former Deputy MacSharry <Col N="426" /> reduced mortgage interest relief to 90 per cent.  The following year he reduced it to 80 per cent.  I appeal to the Minister, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to immediately restore full mortgage interest relief.  At least it would stimulate confidence in the building industry.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Members to support this motion to try to get the necessary finance to eliminate the huge housing lists which are causing major social problems.  It would stimulate the whole building industry if we were able to get the local authority housing programme into operation.

I would point out to the Minister that this would be an investment in the future and in our young people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Social Welfare to the House and thank him for taking this matter which relates to the means testing of unemployment assistance where people obtain casual insurable employment.  This has been an issue since 29 June when a regulation was brought in as a result of which many people found themselves with drastically reduced unemployment assistance. I accept that many of them had worked from April to June but they did not anticipate that this regulation would be introduced and they had not budgeted for the change.  They found themselves with a very reduced income and were unable to live on it.  The casual dockers at the Foynes Harbour were affected by this.  While I accept that a small minority of them are earning high income, the majority are not and they had not budgeted for this.  Because of their circumstances, the health board had to intervene and pay them supplementary welfare to ensure they could feed their families and survive on the reduced levels of income.  In Foynes at present 22 people have lost all unemployment assistance and 23 have had a reduction.  I ask the Minister to review the situation.</P>
      <P>The changes have accentuated the poverty trap in that now, the only incentive for somebody on unemployment assistance to go to work for a week is an increase of £10.  People who got employment occasionally now find they cannot accept this work because if they earn £10 per week more than the assistance level it is counted as means and set against their social welfare entitlement.</P>
      <P>This will also affect people working two-or three-day weeks.  It has been a feature of the meat and dairy industries to place people on a three-day or a two-day week.  We have experience of this in Rathkeale, Charleville and in Deel Vale in Ardagh.  These people will now have a substantial decrease in income when they are put on a two-day or three-day week.  It will not be to their advantage to work.  They will go on unemployment assistance, which will cost the State because they will be paid for the periods they would have worked.  I am referring to people who work short term in places like meat factories during September, October and November &mdash; generally for ten to 12 weeks.  What they earn in that period will now be means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also happened in Coillte when people were made redundant and taken back on a sole trader basis to do contract work.  The Minister stated that contract work should be means tested.  The outcome was that people went back to their old jobs on contract and all the money they earned was deducted from their <Col N="431" /> social welfare; they suffered a net loss. Coillte, like many private industries, is contracting out of its obligations to short term and, sometimes longer term, workers by employing them on a sole trader basis.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister comment on the fact that the present calculation of means tests in County Limerick is based on the period from April to July of this year? My understanding was that the calculation was based on the previous year. I raise this matter because the harbour area in Foynes was exceptionally busy for the months of April, May, June and July and this is being used as the calculating period.  I would question the legality or the practice of this because the usual way was to calculate on the basis of the P.60 for the previous year.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of one of my constituents.  From April to July this family man earned £1,300 and his unemployment assistance was reduced by £28. That money was spent meeting school requirements.  We was unaware that this money would be means tested.  In this case the health board intervened and assisted him because they saw the need for it.</P>
    <P>I understand that most of the people affected have appealed to the Department of Social Welfare but I would like the Minister to review the situation.  If he cannot see his way to change the law, would he look at ways of improving the incentive to work beyond the present level.  If he does not, these people will not do this seasonal work.  People who are self-employed or the sons of the self-employed will work in these organisations while the people who need it will not.  This will cost the State more because they will be drawing unemployment assistance when they could have been working.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Neville for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is for the dockers attached to the Port of Fenit situated seven miles outside Tralee.  Under the new method <Col N="432" /> of calculating unemployment assistance for casual earners, these dockers will be unfairly treated.  They would be lucky to have one ship per month coming into Fenit.  Many of these cargoes consist of crane parts for Liebherr in Killarney, coals for McCowen's in Tralee and fuel oil for Kerry Petroleum.  In all there would be approximately 32 dockers to share this work.  The number of dockers required on vessels at Fenit varies.  For instance, two dockers work on a fuel oil vessel and 12 dockers work on all crane vessels.  Work is casual given the low level fo activity in Fenit.</P>
    <P>Recently under the review body set up to look at commercial harbours operating in this country, it has been recommended that Fenit harbour be handed over to Kerry County Council because of its low volume of traffic.  This report was based on tonnage rates between 1989 and 1990 and the situation at Fenit has not changed.  Incidentally, Kerry County Council rejected this suggestion last Monday.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote the new method used for the calculation of unemployment assistance for casual earners, under which pre-tax earnings from casual employment will now be included.  The new method for calculating unemployment assistance is as follows: start with the pay one is currently receiving, divide it by the number of days to get a daily rate, multiply the daily rate by the number of days worked in the week, add £10 to this total, deduct this figure from total part-time earnings for that week, take that figure from the weekly payout of social welfare, divide that by the number of days in the week to get the daily rate and multiply the daily rate by the number of day's unemployment assistance one is eligible to receive to reach the amount one is entitled to.</P>
    <P>For example, a married man with three children earning £90 over three days &mdash; this applies to Fenit &mdash; would qualify for £129 unemployment assistance.  That sum divided by six days gives approximately £21.50 per day; £21.50 by three days is equal to £64.50; £64.50 plus £10 is equal to £74.50; £90 minus £74.50 leaves <Col N="433" /> £15.50; £129 minus £15.50 equals £113.50; £113.50 divided by six days equals £18.92 per day and £18.92 by three days equals £56.76.  The total unemployment assistance for that family will be £56.76, so this man's gain for three days work would be £90 plus £56.76 which equals £146.76, minus £129 that he would receive on unemployment assistance if he did not take up employment. That gives him a net gain of £17.76 for his three days.</P>
    <P>Further reductions in social welfare entitlements for these people will create severe hardship.  Fenit is a rural community with no manufacturing industry and people are dependent on casual work in Fenit docks to supplement their very low income from social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Neville and Foley for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The motion put down by Senator Neville relates to the need for the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that people employed on a part-time basis for one, two or three days per week receive a reasonable level of unemployment assistance.  Both he and Senator Foley raised the question of casual dockers. This matter has been brought to my attention in the past couple of weeks and I have answered questions in the Dáil regarding same.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the unemployment assistance scheme, which is a means-tested social assistance scheme, is to assist people who are out of work by ensuring that they have an income which is in line with their needs as determined by legislation.  Being a social welfare scheme, it is designed to be applied in an equitable manner to the various categories of claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation establishing the scheme provided that persons could have their means assessed while still employed so as to avoid any delay in authorising claims if they suffered a loss of work.  By excluding income from current employment, the assessment reflected the situation that would exist when they became unemployed. That was a necessary provision, <Col N="434" /> at the time, in circumstances where entitlement to unemployment benefit was very restricted.</P>
    <P>The unemployment assistance legislation was not updated in line with changing work practices over the years.  In particular, the growth in part-time working meant that many people could work for a number of days and claim unemployment assistance for the remaining days of the week, regardless of the amount of their earnings for the days worked.  In this way for certain categories of workers the scheme became simply a top-up for already substantial earnings from part-time working.</P>
    <P>At the same time, a growing number of self-employed people began to claim unemployment assistance where their income from self-employment decreased.  In their case, the legislation required that their income be assessed in full and deducted from the basic unemployment assistance in determining their entitlement.  Furthermore, the scope of unemployment benefit has been greatly expanded since the assistance scheme was introduced, most recently with the extension of insurance cover to employees earning over £25 per week.</P>
    <P>To reflect these changing circumstances, the Social Welfare Act, 1992 provided for the assessment as means for unemployment assistance purposes of earnings from insurable employment. The effect of this provision is that, with effect from 29 July last, persons claiming unemployment assistance and working on a part-time basis have their earnings from employment assessed as means.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the change is to ensure equity of treatment as between employees and self-employed persons claiming unemployment assistance who, as I have said, have always had their self-employed earnings assessed as means. The consistent approach I am adopting in this matter is in line with my overall objective of reducing the anomalies and the complexity of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In implementing the new arrangements, I have maintained a degree of financial incentive for unemployed <Col N="435" /> people to take up occasional employment where the opportunity arises.  This has been done through certain disregard of earnings in assessing a claimant's means. The amount disregarded each week is the equivalent of the person's appropriate daily rate of unemployment assistance for each day worked plus an additional amount of £10.  For example, a married man with three children working a three day week will have £74.50 of his weekly earnings disregarded.  The balance of earnings will then be assessed as means in determining the rate of unemployment assistance payable for days of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements for disregarding a certain level of earnings will ensure a reasonable level of unemployment assistance for those employed on a part-time basis having regard to their earnings and the number of days worked.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I accept the need to ensure that the social welfare system does not discourage people from taking up work.  Indeed, one of my main objectives as Minister for Social Welfare is to ensure that people are encouraged to take up employment where possible, thus reducing their dependence on the social welfare system.  I believe the arrangements we have made for part-time workers in this regard are essentially equitable and achieve consistency and simplification.</P>
    <P>The question regarding casual dockers at Foynes and at Fenit, which the Senators have brought to my attention, has been examined by me in recent weeks.  I cannot tell Senator Foley what are the earnings of the Fenit dockers but some dockers employed in Foynes earn very substantial incomes and I gave details in the Dáil some days ago.</P>
    <P>I will review the method of calculation etc. in order not to create any disincentive for people to take up some form of employment.  If I make a special concession for dockers I will be asked to make a special concession for a myriad of other categories of workers also.  Any review will have to be done in the national context.  To give advantage <Col N="436" /> to any group would be illegal and inequitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking this matter this evening.</P>
      <P>When I raised the issue of Sellafield in the Seanad earlier this year I suggested that the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant at Cumbria was the single biggest threat posed to the future of the Irish people and our natural environment. Nothing has changed since then.  In fact, there have been a number of further developments and I am anxious that the Irish Government now clarify their position on these matters.</P>
      <P>Reports appeared in June of this year suggesting that the Irish Government agreed in April 1990 to EC funding of the nuclear industry and signed a commitment by EC Finance Ministers to increase low cost loans to the industry. On 2 June 1992 UK Nirex announced that it was postponing for 12 months the submission of a planning application for the proposed repository at Cumbria.  In June 1992 we also had a return to good old rock and roll protest with a massive demonstration concert at Sellafield by the rock group, U2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil discussed this matter on 1 July 1992 and there were indications in the press at that time that the Government were moving closer to the view that a legal action could be taken against the operation of Sellafield.  On 8 September 1992 another spillage of radioactive plutonium at the plant caused its temporary closure.  Finally we had a decision by BNFL to start up the operation of Sellafield (2), THORP, in December <Col N="437" /> 1992 and confirmation that they applied to gain the appropriate radioactive and chemical effluent discharge authorizations.</P>
    <P>Given the history of the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant, the Irish people, and particularly the people living on the east coast, have every right to demand the closure of Sellafield.  We should also be very concerned about the transport of radioactive material to and from the expanded plant.  I know the Government share these fears and have conveyed them repeatedly to the UK Government.  In addition, I know that the Minister has raised this matter several times at EC level and that Ireland is to the forefront in calling for the establishment of a Community inspection force for nuclear reprocessing plants.  The establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute was a major advance as regards environmental legislation.  I hope the institute will continue to be vigilant in monitoring the harmful effects of the plant as far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>Reports appeared in June of this year to the effect that the Irish Government presided over increased funding by the EC for the nuclear industry.  I understand that loans were set aside specifically for reprocessing of nuclear waste.  This is significant given that there are only two reprocessing plants in the European Community.  Clarification of this matter is needed if the Irish Government's case is not to be weakened.  Ireland must take a firm stand in the EC against expansion of the nuclear reprocessing industry.</P>
    <P>Fears have also been raised in relation to the proposed repository at Sellafield.  It has been suggested that the site is totally unsuitable from a geological point of view.  I understand now that a planning application for permission to build the underground repository is not now expected to be made by Nirex before the second half of this decade.  This news is to be welcomed and I would suggest that Ireland should continue to express its total opposition to the construction of this repository at every available opportunity.</P>
    <P>Young people in particular have led <Col N="438" /> the way as regards the need for environmental protection.  Rock and roll protests returned to the political agenda earlier this year when U2 in association with Greenpeace held a massive demonstration concert at Sellafield.  U2 are to be congratulated on this initiative.  The protest was a most welcome development and, in fact, was probably more effective than endless speeches by parliamentarians in Parliaments throughout Europe on the issue.</P>
    <P>I know that the Government are committed to legal action against Sellfield if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist.  However, they believe they cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence.  Newspaper reports following the Dáil debates of 1 July 1992 on this issue suggested that the Government were now seriously considering taking a legal action.  I would ask the Minister to keep this option open at all times and to consistently examine all the facts and, if the opportunity arises, serious consideration should be given to taking a legal action.</P>
    <P>After many assurances from the BNFL in relation to safety at Sellafield and following further assurances that a new open style approach had been adopted by BNFL the impossible happened again last month.  On 8 September a spillage of radioactive material at the plant caused its temporary closure.  This incident demonstrates yet again that the Sellafield plant is fundamentally unsafe.  I congratulate the Minister on his quick response to this accident at the time, particularly by involving the Radiological Protection Institute.</P>
    <P>The decision by BNFL to start up the operation of Sellafield (2), THORP, in December 1992 should be a matter of grave concern to everybody living adjacent to the plant.  It must surely be the case that emissions and discharges from the plant will now increase.  I understand that BNFL has now made an application to the regulatory authorities in the UK &mdash; the Inspectorate of Pollution and Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food &mdash; for new authorisation at the Sellafield site to take into account discharges from <Col N="439" /> THORP.  Draft documentation should now be issued by the regulatory authorities in the UK in the near future for formal consultation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should do everything possible to ensure that the local authorities in Dublin and on the east coast are treated as statutory consultees in this process.  Every Irish citizen can play a role in this process.  I understand that any EC citizen can request that this license not be granted.  In this situation Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution would then be obliged to hold a public inquiry.  I would appeal to every local authority, community organisation and individual to become fully involved in this process and contact Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution making known their objections to the THORP plant.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is a menance and its closure is the only solution.  I congratulate the Government on their efforts to date in this regard and call on them again to pursue through every organisation and every forum possible the closure of Sellafield on behalf of all the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I thank Senator Haughey for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to put the Government's position in relation to the current state of affairs at Sellafield on the record of this House.  The House will be aware that I have continuously expressed the Government's concern to the United Kingdom authorities about the Sellafield plant and its discharges, about the new THORP plant and also the transport of radioactive material to and from the plant associated with Sellafield's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I spoke in the Seanad on Sellafield followed the discovery of radioactive seaweed on the beaches near Sellafield.  Fortunately, as it turned out, there was no radiological hazard to this country from the contaminated items discovered on the Cumbrian beaches.  The occurrence of yet another incident there recently relating to a spillage in the plutonium evaporator in the reprocessing plant has added to the long litany of <Col N="440" /> incidents of concern about Sellafield's operations.  I raised this matter with the UK Minister for Energy, Tim Eggar, and I have received a full reply from him.</P>
    <P>The leak occurred in one of the top sections of the evaporator where the plutonium nitrate is in vapour form.  The vapour escapes through a small hole and condenses into liquid which drips down the side of the vessel and then solidifies into a crystalline material on the outside of the evaporator and onto the floor of the cell in which the evaporator is completely enclosed.  In all, between 600 and 800 grammes of plutonium spilled into the surrounding cell but there was no leakage of radioactivity into the environment. The consequence of that occurrence is the closure of the reprocessing operation until the end of the month when the necessary clean-up and repair operations will have been completed.</P>
    <P>This incident did not result in an escape of radioactivity into the environment or plant working areas as the loss of liquid was limited to a containment cell.  The UK authorities have told me that safety is paramount in the way repair work is planned and carried out.  However, as I said earlier, this incident represented a serious plant malfunction at Sellafield and is a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>All plant failures at Sellafield can only increase anxiety on this side of the Irish Sea, that some future failure may occur when safety systems may not work so effectively.  It also heightens my concern about the hazards of reprocessing itself. I would like to recall that in the Dáil before the summer recess a resolution was unanimously passed reiterating its previous condemnation of the operation of British Nuclear Fuels and in particular the proposal to extend and develop reprocessing.  Since then there has been no let up in the representations I have made at every opportunity and in every possible forum to secure the closure of Sellafield.  I am particularly concerned about the intentions of British Nuclear Fuels to commission soon the THORP reprocessing plant, about the resultant increased levels of radioactive waste on site, the liquid and gaseous discharges <Col N="441" /> that will result and the increase in nuclear material being transported to and from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The THORP plant will reprocess spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors, extracting uranium and plutonium for reuse in power generation.  Approval was given for THORP by the UK Government in 1978 following a protracted public inquiry and parliamentary debates.  I understand that agreements have been signed for reprocessing of spent fuel and other UK nuclear utilities and with Japanese, German and other foreign customers. The likely liquid and gaseous discharges from THORP were the subject of an examination recently by the European Community Commission which consulted a committee of experts drawn from all member states.  The Commission's conclusion was that the plan for discharges from the THORP plant is not liable either in normal operation or in accident conditions to result in contamination significant from the point of view of health, water, soil or air space of another member state.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this opinion the Government consider that all discharges into the marine and aerial environment from Sellafield should be prevented and eliminated by the use of the best available technology and environmental practices. This was the Government's position adopted at the recent ministerial meeting in Paris of the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic.  Subsequent to the Commission's opinion, British Nuclear Fuels made an application to the United Kingdom regulatory authorities, the UK's inspectorate of pollution, for new authorisation at the Sellafield site to take into account discharges from THORP.  I have asked the UK authorities for documentation in relation to authorisations for increased discharges applied for by British Nuclear Fuels.  I understand that consultations on draft authorisations will start soon and, when received, I will make appropriate views known to the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute will continue to closely monitor radiation <Col N="442" /> levels in the Irish Sea.  While the Institute's view is that there is no significant hazard, nevertheless I regard any radioactive discharges as a problem.  In recent months I have written to the UK authorities expressing the strong opposition of the Irish Government to the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield and also concerning a proposed waste repository.  I have also taken up the matter with the new EC Commissioner of the Environment, Karel Van Miert and I have also expressed my fears to the United Kingdom and Japanese authorities about the movement of radioactive materials to and from Sellafield. My Department will continue to raise these matters at all appropriate opportunities with the British authorities and in EC and international fora.</P>
    <P>I have also been in contact with the British authorities to express my concern at the proposed shipment of plutonium and high level wastes in the Irish Sea as a direct consequence of international contracts for increased reprocessing at the THORP plant.  In addition, I have asked the Japanese to arrange for the cessation of any such shipments between Japan and Sellafield.  I have been told by the United Kingdom authorities that a shipment of plutonium from the United Kingdom to Japan is not scheduled for a few years.  It is the United Kingdom's practice to process and return plutonium only if the recipient country adheres to the non-proliferation treaty and has an appropriate internationally recognised safeguards regime in force to prevent any diversion of material for non-peaceful uses.</P>
    <P>I have been assured that all shipments will meet or exceed all relevant international standards.  These include the use of containers designed to provide an extremely high degree of protection against fire, against impact and other dangers.  These international standards are kept under constant review and regularly updated to take account of experience and keep pace with technical developments.  The most recent revision was published in 1990.  Actions open to the Government about such shipments <Col N="443" /> are being considered.  These actions involve seeking clarification of the proposed shipment routes in relation to Irish territorial waters and confirmation that internationally accepted practices on the safe shipment of radioactive materials are being observed.  This involves liaison with my colleague, the Minister for the Marine who has responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the underground waste repository which Senator Haughey spoke of in this House in May, the latest information I have is that Nirex is unlikely now to make a planning application before the second half of the decade.  The company's investigations so far have met with complex geology and waterflows beneath Sellafield which need further research. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Geological Survey Office will monitor these developments and, of course, I will continue to express concerns about its location.  The UK authorities have told me that an environmental impact assessment and a public inquiry will be an intrinsic part of any planning exercise.</P>
    <P>All possible avenues for legal action against British Nuclear Fuels have been thoroughly investigated and no case has been identified so far.  All those looked at have been confronted by the same obstacle, lack of sufficient evidence <Col N="444" /> which would support a successful outcome. Although a legal case does not appear to be an option at the present time my officials will maintain a watching brief on any issues which might support calls for closure of the Sellafield plant. One such issue is a court case to be heard this month against British Nuclear Fuels by two former employees.  The outcome of this case and the implications, if any, for the Irish public will be closely examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>Finally, it continues to be the view of the Government that a European Community inspection force should be established which would ensure that uniform high standards are applied at nuclear installations throughout the Community and that any installations found to be unsafe are closed down.  This applies to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey raised an issue which is not in the question that was addressed to me.  I think it refers to a possible decision made in relation to business undertaken by the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, and the matter raised would be the responsibility of another Minister.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 October 1992.</P>
