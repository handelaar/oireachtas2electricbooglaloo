      <P>I have notice from Senator Hederman that, on the motion for the Adjourment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make the necessary regulations to provide traffic signs for cycling facilities as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Naughten of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take immediate steps to reverse the very serious decline in the income of Irish sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to issue guidelines to local authorities regarding the adoption and rescinding of resolutions regarding the licensing of amusement halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hederman, Naughten and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senators Hederman and Naughten's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. <Col N="738" /> Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader about the possibility of having a debate on two separate issues in the light of recent developments, one, on the Middle East in the light of the extraordinarily good news in the Israeli election where there is a possibility of progress being made, and second, on South Africa in the light of the appalling turn of events that has taken place there?  Many of my colleagues &mdash; some of them on these benches &mdash; showed extraordinary naivety in recent years about South Africa.  The real nature of the South African regime has been exposed again and we ought to re-assert the views of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on the rights of the people of South Africa to majority rule based on democracy and peace.  I ask the Leader to allow time for an urgent debate on South Africa to re-assert our support for the rights of the majority of the people there.</P>

Having said that, may I join in the call for a discussion on the general situation in the Middle East?  I believe there is a genuine possibility of advancing peace in the area and bringing basic rights to the Palestinian people, which is something we would all like to see.</P>

A couple of months ago there was an all-party delegation to Palestine and their experience would be useful in the context of the stated policy in terms of peace of the likely new Government in Israel.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader say when we may have the Green Paper on Education and have a debate on it because it is getting more elusive by the day?  Finally, have we guidelines in relation to dress in the House because the House has been brought into disrepute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would welcome debates on the Middle East and South Africa but as I outlined in the last couple of weeks our legislative programme is such that we will have at least ten Bills to deal with between now and the summer recess.  I will ask the Leaders and Whips to agree to suspend topical debates for the next couple of weeks on the basis that we have always maintained the legislative programme would take priority.  I would welcome such debates but there are seven Bills on the Order Paper at the moment and at least another three or four will be with us before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I draw the attention of the House to a misprint in the list of amendments, page 8 should be page 7 and page 7 should be page 8.  I will remind the House again of this when we reach section 19, amendment No. 43.  Furthermore, amendment No. 32 is to section 8, not section 7.  I would also like to inform the House that amendments Nos. 3, 26 and 51 are ruled out of order as not being relevant to the provisions of the Bill and amendment No. 42 is ruled out of order as it imposes a charge upon the people.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Council Directive' means Council Directive of 27th June, 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (85/337/EEC);&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo; is referred to on a number of occasions &mdash; sections 8 (3) and 18 (2) (b) &mdash; but it is not clear that we are speaking specifically of the 1985 Council Directive.  I suggest that, for the purpose of clarification, we should include this as one of the interpretations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator Costello is trying to achieve but I hope to convince the Seanad that the amendment is unnecessary and that the Bill, in effect, already contains a definition of Council Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 (4) states that &ldquo;This Act and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1991, shall be construed together as one Act.&rdquo;  This means that definitions in any one family of the legislation automatically carry through to the other.  For this reason, <Col N="742" /> terms such as &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;board&rdquo; will appear but they are not defined here because they are defined in earlier planning legislation.  The same applies to the term &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo;. The term has already been inserted in the 1963 Act by the European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989, in terms similar to that proposed by the Senators.  The Senator will appreciate that it is already enshrined in the body of legislation and is unnecessary.  I ask him to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says in relation to section 24 (4).  However, there is a reference to the Council Directive in section 8 (3), page 10, of the Bill &ldquo;arising from consultation in accordance with Council Directive in relation to the effects on the environment of the development to which the appeal relates&rdquo;.  There could be more than one Council Directive referring to environmental matters.  It is not clear that it refers to that specific 1985 Council Directive which was very important.</P>
      <P>If we look at the other interpretations &ldquo;&lsquo;the Act of 1976&rsquo; means the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.&rdquo;  One could say that this is clearer than the Council Directive. In order to be logical in our definitions the Council Directive should be defined to make it clear what we are referring to. It would also make it clear to anybody who might peruse the Bill that we go back to 1985 for this very important Council Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to substantiate the case I have already made.  It is clear that the definitions in any one family of the legislation on planning automatically carries through to the other.  The term &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo; has been inserted in the 1963 Act by the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989.  As I said earlier, I appreciate the Senator's view. We had a fairly long debate on this matter in the Dáil and, in the final analysis, there was agreement on all sides that the <Col N="743" /> provisions as drafted were more suitable and that this would involve unnecessary duplication.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;publication&rsquo; means a notice published in a newspaper which has general circulation in the area of the proposed development.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am sure we will have a very constructive debate on this important Bill which is of great interest to me.</P>
      <P>My first amendment relates to the publication in a newspaper of planning applications. This is an issue which has caused great problems down the years.  Applicants sometimes make it as difficult as possible for the public to become aware of a notice that development is going to take place.  It has been known for them to insert such notice in Irish on Christmas Eve and use similar tactics in an effort to make it as difficult as possible for the notices to be seen.  I expected to see some changes in this Bill because I know of the input of the Minister's partners in Government.  I am also aware that the Progressive Democrats manifesto for the local elections in 1991 stated: &ldquo;The publication in papers of planning applications should be altered so that all planning applications would have to appear in a designated paper on a particular day of each week&rdquo;.  I thought that an extremely good and constructive suggestion.  I ask the Minister if it is intended to proceed in that manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of publication proposed in this amendment appears to be necessary only in relation to the alternative appeals procedure proposed in amendment No. 20 in the name of the Senator.  I do not believe, however, that it is appropriate to relate the start-up <Col N="744" /> periods in the appeals process to the publication of notice of a planning authority's decision on an application.  I consider, therefore, that this amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>I do, however, take the point Senator Hederman made in relation to transparency and the question of how we can ensure the best possible transparency in relation to the planning process will be developed in the future.  The Senator will appreciate that is more a matter for the planning regulations.  As I indicated in the debate on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil, we are in the process of updating the planning regulations at present.  I will take account of that consideration and others that have been made to me in a way which will make it absolutely certain that people will have the best possible facility with regard to publication.</P>
      <P>As regards cost, the Senator will appreciate that in certain areas the demands on local authorities in that connection would be quite extraordinary.  It may well be necessary to combine it will other ways of informing the public.  I will consider that also.  I assure Senators that it is not necessary to include it in this legislation but it will be covered by the regulations ultimately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hederman that this is an important matter.  I appreciate the response from the Minister that he is considering updating the planning regulations and that it is the intention to incorporate the principle enshrined in this amendment.  The Labour Party have a similar amendment, amendment No. 26, where it is stated that &ldquo;such public notice shall include advertising the application in a newspaper circulating in the area concerned and on the site concerned&rdquo;, so it would be subject to the two provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we might disagree slightly with the Minister in relation to the regulations. The biggest bone of contention in relation to any planning application is the inadequacy of the notice that is given in terms of its insertion in newspapers. This gives rise to constant complaints <Col N="745" /> from would-be objectors.  It is sufficiently important to include in the principal legislation a standard set of procedures which all local authorities and applicants must follow.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his statement in relation to the planning regulations and incorporate in this Bill the provision that an appropriate form of advertisement be used so that we do not have variations from area to area.  We are not certain what the regulations are likely to be later.  It would be best if this could be done at this stage in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  I am pleased to hear that the regulations are being updated and that this will be covered.  I would like to comment on one point the Minister made.  He said it would be very costly for local authorities.  It was not my intention in this or any previous representations I made on this matter that the local authority would have to sustain the cost of the advertisement.  At present it is the applicant who has to sustain the cost and I see no reason that situation could not continue and the applicant would pay the cost.  On one day in the week all the notices would be inserted in an appropriate newspaper but the cost would not be borne by the local authority.  I am satisfied with the Minister's response and look forward to the early publication of the new planning regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied with the Minister's response.  The ingenuity of people trying to get planning permission on the quiet is so great that there will always be a certain degree of difficulty in trying to ensure that the public are made fully aware of what is happening. I suggest that the Minister or the Department meet with newspaper editors with a view to arranging that planning applications are listed in papers perhaps on one given day per week and in a readily identifiable and recognisable part of the paper.  That would be a help.  For example, on a Saturday one would simply turn to the second last page of a newspaper to see the planning applications. <Col N="746" /> We are all a bit careless about these things.  The problem in many ways is that it is part of the way people behave.  If one were to become preoccupied with planning one would do nothing else except peruse the newspapers every day for planning applications in Irish and English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirements with regard to publication have always been dealt with by way of regulation for the simple reason that it is more flexible and it can respond more quickly to changing circumstances.  Senator Upton made that point indirectly in terms of the challenges that are there and that may well have to be met.  To try to deal with it in the main body of the legislation would not be correct.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that when one says one does not want the costs to be borne by the local authorities, there are two sides to this question.  The local authority will make a decision and who will be responsible for publishing the council's decision?  That may well be the basis on which somebody will decide to appeal or not.  There is no way we can get away from, if Senators insist on a provision like this, of local authorities having to bear costs in relation to decisions which they make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to bear in mind the number of people who have no access to newspapers.  There are statistics to prove that.  After consultation, I will have to try to combine the best possible regime which will allow for the kind of transparency which Senators are anxious about, one which is flexible and can be changed to meet changing requirements and does not require me or someone who will be in my position at another time to come to the Dáil and Seanad to change the legislation.  When we bear all these considerations in mind, Senators will agree that the amendment is unnecessary. I am anxious to have the widest possible consultative process in the preparation of these regulations which I hope to have ready by the end of the year to ensure that we incorporate the characteristics which are best for efficient planning <Col N="747" /> and fair and equitable decisions affecting the public in the future.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 41, after &ldquo;be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that while we are moving in an urgent and expeditious manner, we do not forget to give careful consideration to the environment and ensuring that the board carry out their duty without prejudice to proper planning.  This must be the paramount duty.  The Labout Party suggest that the insertion of that clause would be a reminder to the board that with the new tightening up procedures and timescale, their paramount duty would be to ensure that no stone is left unturned to get the environmental and planning sides right and that the work would be done as expeditiously as possible in conjunction with these other important issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is identical to that of the Labour Party. I concur with the comments made by Senator Costello.  I stressed on a number of occasions in the city council how essential it is for the board to expedite decisions and not to cause unnecessary or undue delays which could hamper development in an area.  While I am anxious that third parties and environmental groups be considered and that the Bill will provide for their concerns, I have <Col N="748" /> a copy of motions passed at the city council &mdash; some of them at my instigation &mdash; appealing to the Minister to ensure that the board would expedite their decisions because this has been a real problem.  I have some cases here, which I mentioned on a previous occasion, about references made to the board and the most incredible delays, which is very hard to understand, in relatively simple, straightforward matters.  In some planning applications complex issues can arise but in the cases I have mentioned the board has not made a decision.</P>
      <P>As far as I can gather from the documents I consulted, most appeals by the board are decided within a six month period.  There has been a very big increase in the number of appeals but the number of staff in An Bord Pleanála has been reduced.  I have not been able to get the latest figures because I do not have an up-to-date annual report &mdash; the one I have is out of date.  On Second Stage I asked the date of the latest annual report of An Bord Pleanála.  One question we will come back to is the number of staff available to the board, what expertise they have and whether they have sufficient staff to implement some of the very good provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, we must not lose sight of the fact that we do not want quantity taking precedence over quality.  We want to be assured that the decisions of the board are in the interests of the country.  If there is undue pressure it will be very difficult for the board to make the right decisions in complex cases and to consult all the documents.  The Minister will probably say this amendment is unnecessary but if it were written into the Bill it would be a statement that we are concerned about proper planning and environmental considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised continuously in the other House and I failed to use the English language in a way which could be understood.  I reiterate that resources in terms of personnel available to an Bord Pleanála have not been reduced.  I emphasise that.  This was said in the other House and again here this <Col N="749" /> morning.  I do not want to delay the House but the numbers have increased. There has always been a sympathetic understanding of their position when any application was made to increase their resources, and that will continue to be the position.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Senators concern to include &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo; in the Bill, I ask them to think more deeply about it.  In the planning Acts, and specifically section 26 of the 1963 Act, An Bord Pleanála has an express legal obligation to deal with any appeal by reference to consideration of proper planning and development.  I assure Senators that any new obligations which are imposed under section 2 (1) will not prejudice the ability of the board to decide cases fundamentally in that way.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Bill restates the board's existing duty under section 4 of the 1983 Planning Act and this has not interfered in any way with their ability to deal with cases in a proper manner.  What would be the purpose of a planning Act and what would be the purpose of An Bord Pleanála if it were not to decide cases on the basis of sound planning, environmental and other considerations? The legal obligation is there.  Nobody could consider an approach to planning which did not embody these considerations. For that reason, the amendment is unnecessary.  It seeks to restate what is already in the 1963 Act.  Since nobody could approach the question of planning in a different way, it is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said is correct.  In the 1963 Act there were no constraints on the board to decide appeals within a given period.  They may have been asked to give their decisions as expeditiously as possible, but there was no pressure on them and, until this <Col N="750" /> Bill is passed, there will be no pressure on them.  Under this Bill the board are obliged to decide appeals within a four months period but I hope it will be longer.  Anybody reading this Bill in conjunction with the Acts will clearly see that there is now a greater obligation on the board to make decisions more quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister's point is that the purpose of the planning Acts is to ensure that proper planning and environmental considerations are taken into account but in 1963 environmental considerations were not given the same importance they have today.  There was no such thing as environmental impact assessments or environmental impact studies.  There was a much simpler and less complex mechanism. Perhaps the Minister would consider this.  I do not want to irritate him but the Minister said he had difficulty getting the message across in the Dáil.  I do not want to keep harping back to certain things but I will be obliged to do so unless I can satisfy myself that things are as the Minister says, and not as I see them.  The Minister said resources have not been reduced.  Where can I get confirmation of this?  I am at a disadvantage in that I am working from 1988 and 1989 annual reports which state that in 1989 the staff of An Bord Pleanála was 58 compared to 73 in 1988.  If the figures are wrong I would appreciate being told where I can get the correct figures.  In plain English, a reduction in staff numbers from 73 in 1988 to 58 in 1989 shows a downward trend.  The Minister may say that trend is increasing again, and if that is the case I am very happy.  However, I cannot accept that there have not been staff reductions.</P>

If I remember correctly, a document produced by An Taisce suggested radical reductions in the number of planning inspectors employed by the board for the years mentioned by Senator Hederman &mdash; I think it was 1988 and 1989 and 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy <Col N="751" /> with the Minister's experience of the limitations of the English language in getting across certain truths.  This is a problem that all of us in the political world have experienced from time to time.  Of course, as the Minister is only too well aware, there are two reasons for it: one may be the inadequacy of the politician trying to get the message across and the other is a certain degree of resistance on the part of those to whom the message is being given.  Things change radically as well when politicians move from one side of the House to the other.</P>

      <P>The report of An Bord Pleanála states that in 1990 62 people were employed; in 1988, 55 were employed and in 1989, 59 were employed.  The problem may arise because individuals are taking establishment figures as distinct from actual numbers into account.  I hope during the discussion here to lay that issue to rest once and for all.</P>
      <P>In relation to the inspectorate the number increased from 13 to 18 during that period.  One will appreciate that the workload of technical staff has increased. To deal with the real issue, I will read from section 4 of the 1983 Act:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the board to ensure that appeals, references and other matters with which it is concerned are disposed of as expeditiously as may be and, for that purpose, to take all such steps as are open to it to ensure that, in so far as is practicable, there are no avoidable delays at any stage in the consideration of such appeals, references and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House by <Col N="752" /> restating what I am providing here but essentially it is what is already enshrined in the 1983 Act.  We are not going back to 1963 in that context, although the words used in 1963, when there was not the same public understanding and concern for the environment, were &ldquo;proper planning and development&rdquo;.  I would not like to be the person who would try to prove in court that those words do not cover what we are dealing with now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not being selective.  I have the 1983 Act and have read that section.  Section 2 (2) of this Bill clearly states that it shall be the objective of the board to ensure that every appeal or other matter is determined within a period of four months.  If the Minister says there is anything like that in the previous Acts, I would be happy to look at it.  As far as I can ascertain in none of these Acts is there any specific period mentioned in which the board has to decide an appeal.</P>
      <P>There is creeping into this Bill &mdash; I do not object to the principle &mdash; a specific timeframe within which the board must decide and there must be very good reasons for not complying with it.  For that reason it would be helpful to insert a reminder that, no matter what the pressures were, the matter must be dealt with expeditiously and it should be subject to proper planning and environmental considerations.  What would be the downside of putting it in given that it would satisfy these who are concerned that there may be undue pressure on the board?  Would it upset the apple cart or would it make things too lax?  Was the Minister concerned that they could use it to annul the four month period?</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said about staff numbers.  The latest report I was able to get was for 1989.  I should like to get the 1990 report.  The Minister gave figures of 55 employees in 1988, 59 in 1989 and 62 in 1990.  That conflicts with my figures.  We are obviously working from different data but I accept that the Minister can get more up to date figures than I.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that again my best efforts have failed to put this matter to rest.  I hope Senators will not take it as a reflection on them if I do not deal with the matter any more.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with the difference between proper planning in 1963, dealing with planning applications as expeditiously as possible in the 1983 Act, and largely replacing that with a new section embodying the same considerations now, taking Senator Hederman's argument on board, completely different now because of the statutory requirement on the board to deal with cases within a specified period.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to reform the procedures which are applicable to planning appeals and to enable them to be made more expeditiously.  In order for that to happen, not only the notice of the appeal but the full appeal must be made and the person must decide to make an application for an oral hearing at the beginning.  The local authority have two weeks in which to make the papers available to the board.  If one takes into account the procedures which have now been put in place to enable the board to have longer periods to consider the applications than is at present, the requirement which the Senator suggests is restrictive in many ways and could be interpreted the opposite way.  If a person can apply for an oral hearing at any time &mdash; even at a late stage in the examination of the appeal &mdash; that restricts the board's capacity to make decisions within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record, my considered view that time has never been an absolute factor in determining if things are done well.  Efficiency, understanding the subject and dealing with it in an expeditious and equitable way does not require the kind of timescale some people seem to ascribe to it.  I believe that when we combine the reforms and the new procedures, Senators will understand that the board will be in a position from a staffing viewpoint to make these decisions within the timescale we have outlined.  I do not accept that later decisions are better or that earlier decisions are inferior.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I missed some of the debate.  I want to refer to a matter which may not have been adverted to.  When we were discussing the Environmental Protection Agency Bill the Minister promised that a similar duty to expedite matters would be inserted in the Bill.  That has not been done.  There was a promise made that we would have a similar statement to ensure that appeals on other matters are disposed of as expeditiously as possible.  The fact that no such duty is incumbent on the Environmental Protection Agency means that a certain delay could take place and we would need a parallel duty expressed to expedite the matter properly. Will the Minister refer to that in his reply?</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the matters the Minister referred to &mdash; the timescale and the numbers involved &mdash; if we impose a duty of dealing with matters urgently and expeditiously it is also important that we impose a duty ensuring that planning and environment matters are attended to and considered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In the case of appeals lodged in relation to domestic extensions, single dwellings or similarly small developments the Board should make every reasonable endeavour to have the matters decided within two months.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will take it on board. This amendment refers to house repairs, reconstructions, extensions or single dwellings.  I do not see why An Bord Pleanála need four months to adjudicate on a simple application like that.  I hope the Minister will take this amendment on board, because it will speed up the process for the applicant who seeks to build or extend a house or carry out improvements but there may be a crank objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the sentiments expressed in this section that planning applications will have to be dealt with within four months.  For too long, we have tolerated a situation where even the simplest of appeals dragged on for eight and nine <Col N="756" /> months.  That was criminal and I have no doubt we lost jobs and industry as a result.  I am glad to note the resources of An Bord Pleanála were not reduced.  The view I heard expressed was that the delays were the result of inadequate staffing. I am glad that the Minister put that to rest today.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. I believe it to be a reasonable amendment and one that will provide the right balance in this Bill.  It should speed up the process for an individual applicant. I would hate to think that because four months is put in here applications will not be decided on for three months and three weeks.  That is why I ask the Minister to take this point on board.</P>

      <P>The case is exactly as Senator Naughten has described.  In his address to the House a few minutes ago, the Minister stated that good decisions do not always take a long time.  Often good decisions can be made in a short time.  All elected persons in local government and in the Houses here have had the experience of delays and I am sure the Minister remembers similar representations. It should not take two months or more to make a decision on a single dwelling or on small numbers of houses.  Senator Naughten and I consider this amendment to be sensible.  There have been complaints about the delays. When talking about a house or a few houses, it is difficult to explain to people why a decision should take many months. I agree with the case put forward by Senator Naughten.</P>

He said there is nothing wrong with quick decisions as against decisions which drag on for a long time.  It is a good amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment also.  I do not see why a decision should not emanate from An Bord Pleanála within a two month period.  The type of development that Senator Naughten has in mind here is a single dwelling for a private individual, or similar small-scale developments of that nature.  It is obvious that the local authority will have considered the application. The file will be completed and I am not of the view that there is any further additional documentation that can be added to the file in such cases.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the An Bord Pleanála inspector is being asked to take a second look at the merits of the decision arrived at on the basis of the documentation that is already on the file.  There is nothing further that can be added in these cases from the time of the presentation and decision of the planning application by the local authority to the point where the appeal is concluded by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>The next amendment we will be dealing with is, perhaps, a more appropriate point at which to outline the circumstances of a certain matter.  In fact, it would have relevance to this amendment, but I do not want to take up the time of the House twice.  What I am really saying, is that when the file is already completed by the local authority and the local planning officer has given an adjudication on it, all the inspector in An Bord Pleanála is being asked to do, in an appeal of that nature regarding a development, is to take another look at the facts on which the local planning officer decided the case, and either confirm the decision or alter it if in his opinion an alteration is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an important time factor. This certainly applies throughout rural Ireland in the case of people who are building or arranging to build their own homes.  There is a building period where these people are concerned and there is a non-building period.  Most people are anxious to get the construction under way in springtime and to avail of the long evenings and the summer to get through the job.  A person who is arranging to build his own house never starts in the <Col N="758" /> months of October, November or December.  A slow decision can have the effect of delaying the building of a house for a year, with considerable difficulties for the people involved.  There is a time constraint and a time factor.</P>
    <P>There is much merit in what Senator Naughten has proposed here and Senator Honan, Senator Upton and I are supporting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Liam Naughten.  In fairness to the Minister, he indicated in his Second Stage speech that he was making every effort to speed up decisions.  He made particular reference to An Bord Pleanála and specified a period of two months and I hope he will endorse that here today.  There is no doubt that substantial delays have created a considerable number of problems, especially in regard to large developments, and even with regard to housing developments.  For that reason I support the sentiments expressed here by Senator Naughten.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Senator Naughten.  May of the objections to extensions and small developments need never go to An Bord Pleanála.  At local level, there is a little problem.  We are not dealing with a local authority Bill here but, at the same time, I feel this has a bearing on it.  A person may make an objection initially to a local county council.  The council may have refused point blank to give a copy of that objection to a small developer.  In the case of an extension or a single house, if the developer knew what the objection was about, often the matter could be settled at council level by making minor changes in the initial planning.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to ensure, perhaps in another Bill, that all objections made to local planning authorities should also be furnished to the developer.  That would cut out many appeals to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

We are talking here about Senator Naughten's suggestion of two months for decisions on plans for domestic dwellings.  In that connection I have considerable sympathy for the amendment.  It is true, as Senator Fitzgerald said, that if objections were not kept secret &mdash; which seems totally against the idea of openness, democracy and against the whole planning process &mdash; many of our other problems would be greatly eased in relation to time.</P>

      <P>May I intervene in relation to the point made by Senator Fitzgerald about the documents to which Senator Conroy has referred?  Perhaps the Minister in his reply might confirm what I am about to say.  My understanding is that according to the provisions of legislation at the end of the last century a planning file is a public document.  Therefore, a council is not acting within the law in restricting access by any member of the public to the contents of a file, such as Senator Fitzgerald has referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">

      <P>I was in Rio when the Second Stage debate was completed in the Seanad.  It was remiss of me not to compliment the Seanad, for their very positive response to the Bill which has been characterised by the debate this morning, particularly on this amendment.</P>
      <P>While I am not able to agree to the amendment, the sentiments expressed in it are very good.  Reading through the Bill, I have power in certain circumstances, and after consideration to designate certain classes of appeals as being ones which I say could be decided in a period considerably less than four months.  In fact, that can happen at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point immediately to some little technical difficulties.  We will deal <Col N="760" /> first with the questions that have been raised with regard to the local authority and more openness which is very important. If it requires further legislation in main planning Acts to do something like that right across the board, I would be very happy to do it.  Once a decision is taken by the local authority it is made public and if there is an appeal subsequently, negotiations then take place between the developer and the objectors. Often in these cases the problem is then resolved and there is no further appeal. The same point is relevant if that could be achieved earlier.</P>
    <P>One aspect to the planning process which people who are concerned seem to miss is that it is equally important to refuse a planning application in the developer's interest as it is to uphold it.  That means we can decide that is not going ahead, and can plan something else.  Very often, the opposite view is taken that all these developments have to be stopped and the longer it goes on the more frustrating it is.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience where, as Minister for Forestry, I spent two years trying to get a specific project going.  It involved the use of pine timber for an added value process.  I do not need to indicate to this House what has been happening to our lovely pine forests for years.  I succeeded in getting a project, planning permission was granted but there was one objection.  After ten months a decision was taken by An Bord Pleanála.  Ireland lost the project; Ireland's forests lost, the taxpayers lost. An Bord Pleanála upheld the county council decision, with minor adjustments. I mention that as one example of what can happen, and has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the technical aspects, the County Council makes its decision and is obliged to submit its papers to An Bord Pleanála.  Other parties have a month to prepare their case &mdash; it can slip into a month or five weeks in the initial process.  When you specify <Col N="761" /> two months there may be a three week period for the examination of an appeal. This is adequate in routine cases but we need more experience of the four month requirement.  While I am not objecting to the principle of the amendment, one would have to be more specific than just &ldquo;routine cases&rdquo;.  People's understanding of what are routine cases can vary enormously. A small development may have major repercussions, and a large development may have minor repercussions.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am not objecting to the sentiments expressed.  I already have the power, when we have more experience of the four month requirement, to designate certain classes as falling into a category where decisions should be taken within a much earlier period.  I hope Senator Naughten will appreciate that I am going as far as I can both in the existing legislation and in the new provisions to decide what action would be taken subsequently.</P>

      <P>It is the wish of every Member of this House that the Minister would convey to An Bord Pleanála that we do not want every application, however small, being held up for four months and that decisions would be taken as soon as possible on the type of case mentioned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Howard pointed out, all the documentation is prepared by the county council and is available.  The grounds for granting permission or refusal are clearly specified.  It should not be a big task for An Bord Pleanála to make a decision on an individual case.  It is different if you are dealing with a large housing estate or commercial development but I am talking about the individual applicant.  Perhaps the Minister would tell An Bord Pleanála that we expect those decisions to be dealt with speedily.  As Senator Honan pointed out, some projects are started at specific times <Col N="762" /> of the year and if the planning permission is delayed, it could mean the project cannot be started for another 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I listened carefully to what the Minister said.  At the moment, there is a constraint on local authorities.  Dublin Corporation will not grant permission until a certain period has passed.  In other words, even if you put in an application that is practically identical with a previous application, it will not be passed immediately.  I do not know if that is a custom to which they feel obliged to adhere, or whether if legislation inhibits them.</P>
      <P>This is a problem.  There are cases where a developer keeps coming back with similar applications.  I had a case recently where that happened.  I asked the planning department to deal with it as quickly as possible so that the enforcement section could take action.  They said they could not make the decision within six weeks.  If the local authority grant a planning application, I appreciate that a certain amount of time may be needed to allow third parties to send in their objections.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to have said that he has the power to tell the board to speed up their decision-making process. If so, has that power ever been used? Under existing legislation has the Minister the power, to impose greater time constraints?  Will anything inhibit the board from making a decision along the lines Senator Naughten wants?  If a very simple appeal is submitted and all the documentation has been received, is there any reason they have to wait the four months?  Does the fact that four months is mentioned in the Bill mean that an outsider, a third party appellant or the applicant can say, &ldquo;We understood you were not going to give a decision for four months&rdquo;.  Would he, therefore, be justified in complaining if the board gave the decision within two months?  May I have clarification on those points?</P>

      <P>Section 22 (b) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> Such other period as the Minister may prescribe, either generally or in respect of a particular class or classes of appeals or other matters.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the legal power to decide in certain classes of cases on a shorter period is open to the Minister in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>I want to deal very briefly with one or two points that Senator Hederman has made in relation to the obligation on local authorities.  There is a statutory obligation on local authorities to make a decision within two months and I regret very much, in terms of my personal understanding of that situation across the country, that it is not being adhered to. There is a huge percentage of cases now which are taking longer than two months to be dealt with at local authority level. This, of course, is achieved where the local authority have not had an opportunity to fully consider the application. They then inform the applicant, and there is agreement on another specified period.  I am extremely anxious that this practice should not continue.</P>
    <P>I realise there are very many new types of applications for planning permission. There are requirements which necessitate the local authority considering matters from the point of view of roads, fire safety, health and from the point of view of general planning and other considerations and it is not possible to synchronise all those in a way which will allow for the two months statutory requirement to be met on all occasions. Statistics available to me indicate there is departure from what I would consider to be a fairly absolute requirement on the part of the local authority to deal more expeditiously with planning applications. I will be considering any means which are open to me in order to ensure that there is greater efficiency and that we get decisions consistent with what has been the practice and, indeed, expectation of the public with regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on a local authority to wait for the full two months if all the considerations necessary for taking a <Col N="764" /> full and fair decision have been dealt with prior to that time.  They may well decide on a much shorter timescale in the type of cases referred to in Senator Naughten's amendment.</P>
    <P>A point was made earlier &mdash; which I did not deal with &mdash; concerning vexatious appeals.  There is provision in the Bill for the board to throw those out.  Another point which I did not deal with adequately referred to the question of the objectors' comments being available. The 1977 regulations make provision for these comments to be made available but, carrying through to the point made by Senator Conroy, they are not applied consistently because the regulations do not specifically require such provision. There is the question of availability.  The planning regulations, as I indicated earlier are up for review currently, and I hope to have them finalised by the end of this year in order to take account of that case.  They will require making these documents available so that the system throughout the country and its application by local authorities will be much more harmonious and open.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2) (a), line 3, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with the basic issue which we have already touched on, that is, the pressure which the board will be under in order to deal adequately with all the issues particularly in a complex case.  In amendments Nos. 7 and 9, we raise the matter of an application or appeal where we are involved in an environmental impact statement.  I would like to reiterate what I said at an earlier stage because I do not think the Minister really accepted this from the tenor of his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been closely involved in the <Col N="765" /> planning process for about 20 years, if not more.  I am old enough to remember when the 1963 Act came in, although I would not have been as familiar with it then as I am now.  What I am trying to stress is that the whole area of planning has become very complex and that is borne out by the fact that various organisations, such as An Taisce, planning institutions and ENFO bring out a series of documentation to assist people.  I must congratulate ENFO in this regard.  A layman or woman who has no experience would still find it requires quite an amount of study and application to get the gist and the general tenor of what is involved if one is embroiled in a planning appeal as a third party, or something like that.</P>
    <P>Many of the Members here will remember the long and tortuous debates we had with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  I required all one's skill attention and application to follow what was involved and most Senators who were interested and who followed it would accept that.  There will be instances of applications at the other end of the spectrum to Senator Naughten's description of domestic extensions which are probably very simple and straightforward. We have had some of them already involving various industrial applications. Sandoz was a good example and there are others.  Is there a possibility of the board being able to deal with these in the same timeframe as they would be able to deal with the average application?</P>
    <P>I accept that the average application should be dealt with expeditiously.  We have been over that ground in relation to the last amendment and I am not going to go over it again.  On the other hand, we must look at the other end of the spectrum which is complicated.  There are many difficult issues and much documentation is required on all sides by the local authority, the appeals board and by third party appellants.  I know that the Minister has had a bad experience in this regard.  A number of people had mentioned the forestry project.  It is <Col N="766" /> understandable that having had a disappointment, where something went so wrong so unnecessarily because of delays and everything else that, even at a personal level, the Minister would feel all the more anxious to expedite things. However, where there is an environmental impact statement, there should be a general extension of the time.</P>
    <P>In the amendment I suggested five months rather than four because I noted an amendment put down in the Dáil asked for six months, to which the Minister did not agree.  I am hoping he may agree to five months.  I am not happy with the situation where, if there is a complicated case under section 3 (a), the board can have a longer time.  The Minister said in relation to the local authorities that there is a binding obligation on them to decide within two months, but that a huge percentage of the local authority cases are taking longer.  He said he is not happy with that and does not want this practice to continue.  I am afraid the same thing is going to happen.  The Minister's successor, or the departmental officials, are going to feel the same way if the board is constantly saying that it cannot stick to the timeframe.  I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the possibility of, say, five months.  If that cannot be done, I would ask him to take on board the sentiments expressed in amendments Nos. 7 and 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The three amendments are related and I will comment on the first one.  If I understood the Minister correctly when he responded a short time ago to the matter of the status of the documents in the file, he said he intends, by way of regulation, to clarify the matter.  I am satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the four months period the Minister is proposing but I ask him how realistic is that period in the light of the experience of a number of us?  In the vast majority of cases, I am satisfied that four months is adequate.  What An Bord Pleanála do in an appeal is to review a file that has already been compiled by the local authority.  The donkey work has <Col N="767" /> been done by the local authority.  They are permitted only two months in which to do it.  There are time constraints on the local authorities.  A public notice must appear, and there are 28 days allowed after the public notice appearing.</P>
    <P>Referring to a comment by Senator Upton earlier, there is very little difficulty in getting circulation of public notices in the rural areas and the local papers.  They are seen by everybody.  There is a period of 28 days required after the publication of the public notice before the local authority can proceed.  Yet, they are required to give their decision within two months. In the vast majority of cases, the donkey work is done already and the review by An Bord Pleanála is a review, basically, of the documents that are in the file. Therefore, if we say there is a statutory obligation on the local authorities to do their investigation in a period of two months, it is reasonable to say to the board that they should be well able to review the decision of the local authority and give their considered judgment in double that timeframe.  While I say it is reasonable, I do not know whether it is realisable.  That is the point I want to make to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This morning I had occasion to visit the offices of An Bord Pleanála.  I did it for the purpose of establishing information and of finding out something. That something was simple enough: when were the board likely to give a decision on a planning application against one condition?  When were they likely to give a decision, even though that appeal had been with them for six months?  I want to make it absolutely clear that I was not seeking to influence in any way the content of the decision.  It was simply an inquiry as to the stage of the process of that particular application.  I am referring to a case of an appeal on one condition out of seven.  The information I received was that it was about to go to the board and that perhaps a decision would emerge in about a month's time. That is a total of seven months.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister expect that six months from now matters like that will <Col N="768" /> be disposed of in four months?  I do not know if that is realisable.  I am not accusing the board of discourtesy in this matter, but it is important.  The reason I had to go there this morning was that this inquiry was the fifth attempt to get the information.  Previous attempts were made by a phone call, a letter, a fax and a visit by a solicitor representing the appellant but all of these methods got no response.  I say to the Minister he may have difficulty with four months.</P>
    <P>There should be a provision in the Bill whereby information would be made available to appellants.  I was met with the utmost courtesy from the people in the office of An Bord Pleanála this morning. I said to them there must be an understanding of the frustrations on the other side of the case.  As the people in the middle, we should move to take care of that and I suggest to the Minister that should be done.  If a simple inquiry regarding an application is directed to the board, whether by letter, fax, telephone or otherwise, there should be some response.  Even an acknowledgment that the application has been received would be a help.  The absence of such acknowledgment takes us, as public representatives, into the situation where an hour in the morning has to be devoted to these matters.  However, I think that four months is adequate in the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that the number of inspectors in An Bord Pleanála had been increased from 15 to 18. I could be open to contradiction on this. We have 27 local authority areas.  We expect a planning officer in each one to make his decisions, to compile the files and to go through all the information in two months.  It is not unreasonable to expect these 18 inspectors, whose sole job is to review the files assembled in 26 or 27 local authority areas, will do so in a reasonable time.  I do not believe that the four months objective will be achieved without considerable difficulty. While I admire the Minister's enthusiasm, he will be subjected to the same frustration as the client on whose behalf I made inquiries this morning.</P>

      <P>It is one of the major advances in this Bill that objectives are being set.  At the moment, that is all it is. It says, &ldquo;it shall be the objective of the Board to ensure...&rdquo; and &ldquo;such other period as the Minister may prescribe either generally...&rdquo;.  At the moment four months is an objective we hope will be achieved.  I sympathise with what Senator Howard is saying in relation to this matter.  In practice, it may be very difficult in a number of circumstances to achieve that objective, but at least it sets an objective and An Bord Pleanála, or whoever, has to explain why it is not achieved.  Four months is about the right time.  That allows a month to collect data and three months to examine it and come to a decision.  In certain circumstances, it may be rather tight and in other circumstances, as we discussed previously, a lesser period of two months may be sufficient.  At least at this end of the planning process, we are beginning to see some progress.</P>
      <P>It concerns me because I, and I am sure all other Senators, have had personal experience both in my role as a Senator and in other capacities.  I do not wish to refer to matters in which one has a personal interest.  I have learned a great deal about the very severe problems facing us in this country in relation to planning and developments which are justifiable and which are environmentally fully up to the highest international standards. We had a lengthy environmental Bill in the Seanad some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the highest environmental impact statement standards in the entire world.  There is one other country which equals us and that is The Netherlands and there is one other state in the USA, namely, the state of California.  Nowhere else in the world are such stringent standards applied.  Admittedly, there are specific reasons why the Dutch, with the extreme damage already caused to their environment, have set some of their standards but it is right that we should have high standards and that we should maintain them.  However, it means that an industrialist coming to this country has <Col N="770" /> to consider whether the development in question is viable.  To take one simple aspect, if you are looking for a site or an area &mdash; and by definition under the EIS you must also examine alternative sites &mdash; that process may take 12 or 18 months. It is very optimistic to have reached the stage of having chosen a site within 12 to 18 months.  You then have to prepare an environmental impact statement and that will take at least 12 months.  However, the likelihood is that it could take somewhere between 18 months and two years. Having got the environmental impact statement, one then proceeds to submit a planning application, of which the EIS is an essential, associated part under the statute.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a period of two months.  That is the minimum period but we all know, as members of county councils, that getting a decision within two months is unusual.  I cannot think of any case where that was so and I am working on two very efficient county councils.  It is not a minimum of two months, because at the end of two months what happens with virtually any significant application is that the council comes back with a request for further information and that request is likely to be a substantial one that could require another six months work.  Let us say it only requires a couple of months work, that two months have gone by and now another period of two months starts all over again, so where have we got to?</P>
    <P>We have had 18 months to two years doing an EIS and other work.  We then submit our application on the assumption that it can be submitted the moment the EIS is finished.  There could be a request for further information which would take at least two months to deal with and if there are any further delays we could be talking in terms of years.</P>
    <P>However, it does not stop at that. Some councils may not reveal objections and people have to wait around to ascertain what objections have been submitted. I am delighted the Minister is going to do something about that.  In addition, under the environmental impact statement a council can now <Col N="771" /> refuse even to consider an application until it is satisfied with the EIS as submitted. It is right and proper that those powers should exist, but it would not be right or proper if that is also going to be subject to a time delay so that you have not even started your first two months of consideration for a planning application. Developers will be conscious that objections submitted to An Bord Pleanála can take a very long time to be considered. Now at least we are getting the target date of four months.  It is only at the end of the process, but one can begin to see why on a basis of time alone many people may decide not even to proceed in the first instance with a project.  In many instances we are possibly not aware of it because they do not come here and discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>Our environmental regulations already are subject to the most stringent requirements in the world and I would be concerned if in amendments Nos. 7 and 9 we impose yet another open-ended indefinite delay.  The planning authority already has the power not to consider a planning application until it is satisfied with the EIS.  We want this country kept in the best possible environmental state and greatly improved.  We must have the very strict legislation which we have unanimously approved for our environmental regulations and, equally we need to consider what is our economic policy as regards developments.  The word gets around after a while that it is pointless even considering this country for good, worthwhile environmentally acceptable projects of the highest level.  I must ask that this series of amendments be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened closely to the remarks of Senators Conroy, Howard and Hederman and I do not disagree with any of their remarks.  We have a principle that we are trying to assert here, namely, that we deal with appeals as expeditiously as possible, and that we want to tighten procedures whereby appeals are dealt with by An Bord Pleanála and that a time-scale should be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Most people have welcomed the Bill in general terms as it is attempting to expedite matters.  At the same time we have to ensure that the rights of third parties, in particular the citizens who will be affected by the results of the development, are acknowledged and adverted to and that the legislation does not discriminate against them.  We are trying to get the balance right.  Senator Hederman's amendment, the Labour Party amendment and amendment No. 5 have an equal bearing on the matter.</P>
    <P>We need greater flexibility.  We acknowledge everything that is in the legislation.  If all the planning appeals are lumped together there will be an almighty mess and the Minister will have to intervene, as is prescribed here.  The Minister may prescribe &ldquo;such other period&rdquo;.  He will be swamped with planning applications that are not an extension to a domestic premises but might be for, say, the Eastern bypass; God forbid that we should have a project for a nuclear power station.  There are distinctions to be made.  There are minor applications and there are major applications.</P>
    <P>Under the European Directive of 1985 a major application requires that we have an environmental assessment study carried out.  Where an environmental assessment statement has to be prepared and there are environmental implications we should ensure that the provisions in the directive of 1985 are covered in this legislation rather than blandly referring to the four month period and then another period as may be prescribed by the Minister. Because this has been left out of this legislation our time scale cannot be adhered to.  The four months is for standard applications that do not require an environmental impact assessment.  We will be proved right if this becomes law without any of these amendments being introduced, or an appropriate amendment the Minister may wish to put down.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to what the Minister said earlier about the Environmental Protection Agency carrying out their responsibilities expeditiously.  That commitment has not yet been transferred into amending legislation or regulation. <Col N="773" /> Therefore, we may find we have a rigid timescale for An Bord Pleanála, the third party and the developer but not under the EC Directive, because this provision is not in the directive.  In fact, it may be a breach of the directive to have it imposed in this fashion.  If we have to conduct an environmental impact assessment, there is no way we can keep within the four month timescale laid down there.  It would be better if, at this stage, we divided planning applications into those which would require that procedure and those which would not.  That would indicate the serious nature of the appeals process.</P>
    <P>We agree with the underlying principle to expedite the appeals process but we cannot expect the procedures to be adequately followed.  However, proper planning and environmental considerations can be dealt with in terms of a major planning application that requires an environmental impact statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senators' concerns.  In this Bill the Minister is trying to tidy up the procedure of An Bord Pleanála.  If he proposed a five month period, people would be looking for six months.  If he came with a six month period, they would be looking for seven months.  The four month period is adequate.  It sets in train an effort to try to tidy the appeals procedure.  Every public representative has had representations to do something about applications that have been with An Bord Pleanála for 12 months, two years or longer.  People who knew there was nothing wrong with an application that would be granted by a local authority would appeal to An Bord Pleanála, knowing the decision would be delayed for 12 months or two years.  As a result, the development might be substantially reduced or the developer might decide not to go ahead.  It was an indirect way of stopping people proceeding with legitimate developments.  The four month period would not involve the environmental impact study because it would already have been submitted with the <Col N="774" /> application for planning permission in the first instance.  In my view the four month period is adequate and everyone should welcome the Minister's decision.</P>

      <P>The example I gave of my experience in trying to establish an industry which was lost because of delay in the planning process, was not my reason for introducing this legislation.  I gave that as an example of what can happen.  I will be dealing early next year with other legislation relating to local authorities.</P>
      <P>We have a young population and tremendous unemployment problems and the least we can expect from those of us who are employed &mdash; I do not mind where we work &mdash; is greater efficiency, understanding and support for systems which help this country to grow.  The planning process fits into the economic, social and cultural fabric but it is only one part of how this country wants to grow and how we perceive that planning as an integral part of everything we do. It is beneficial to the developer to be told that he will not get planning permission. One TD told me that he very often told people to delay putting in their full appeal and to look for an oral hearing later.  He told me he welcomed the changes even though he had been party to facilitating the delaying processes.  I thought it a very honest assessment.  This Bill is trying to strike a balance; it is trying to be fair and to meet real situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come to the question whether the time limit should be four months or five months.  We have succeeded in laying down an objective of four months.  In all but the most extreme cases I would expect An Bord Pleanála to be able to decide applications within that time.  We should bear in mind that the average time it takes a local authority to decide a planning application, is ten weeks; it should be less than eight.  When you add <Col N="775" /> four months to that you are talking about seven months to process an application. That is about the time that it takes countries to draw up treaties on complex issues involving historical, cultural and economic differences.  Is it asking too much that technical and administrative people should deal with planning applications in less time than it takes countries to negotiate and sign treaties?</P>
    <P>We are not talking about rush decisions, we are talking about fair and reasonable considerations.  Notwithstanding that objective, section 2 (3) provides that where the board deems it necessary, that is in very extreme cases, they may take further time.  In relation to environmental assessment statements section 2 (2) (b) provides for the Minister to select classes of appeals which may prove too difficult to decide within the four month objective time.  Let us be logical.  We must allow the board to decide certain categories of appeals in four or five months, but I am coming down hard on the side of what I see to be a realistic situation.  The majority of cases can be dealt with within the time laid down but in specific cases the board might deem it necessary to take more time; now the power is there to do it.  If an environmental impact assessment or statement is required, there is also provision, to take a longer period.  I am not looking forward to hearing from An Bord Pleanála or anybody else that this should happen in any but very extreme cases.</P>
    <P>Of all the problems we face in this country, the biggest is unemployment, the social fall-out and everything that involves.  Is it not an indictment of all of us that, while we have that problem, there are hundreds and millions of pounds worth of planning applications at different stages of assessment with local authorities and by An Bord Pleanála?  I accept that some of the more difficult cases get to An Bord Pleanála but I want to indicate all we want to achieve.  In this Bill, we have fairness and a balanced approach, everybody is given an opportunity to have their say and we are prescribing <Col N="776" /> an objective time within which we want good and fair decisions.</P>
    <P>As soon as this Bill is passed it is my intention to look carefully at all aspects of the planning system and how it can be improved.  I am alarmed that many local authorities are taking longer than necessary to make decisions on planning applications. With regard to the publication aspect, in the consolidation of planning regulations later in the year I will be taking account of Senators' views on the creation of the greatest transparency.  I take the point Senator Hederman made in relation to greater transparency and simplicity.  We have all managed to make life very complex.  I think it is essential that the wider public understand the planning process, how it affects them, where it is taking the country compared with other countries and how we want to manage our own environment.</P>
    <P>We want to blend that with the need for development.  There are those who consider that no development should take place, that the landscape should not change.  The landscape has changed over the centuries and some of our beauty spots would not exist if the landscape had not changed.  I am anxious to simplify the system as much as I can.  The ENFO leaflet is part of that process, but only part of it.  In the autumn I will be looking at other ways to remove some existing doubts to help people to be more informed and to create a planning system that is businesslike; fair, transparent and doing the job we need at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Conroy made a very good case for implementing amendments, Nos. 7 and 9.  He pointed out how extremely complicated and complex the whole system was, especially when an EIS is involved.  He even spoke about the time it took to get an EIS.  He said that if there was a request for further information it might require up to six months work.  The general thrust of his comments underlines the problems and the complications for the Planning Appeals Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest figures I have are from the 1989 Bord Pleanála report according to <Col N="777" /> which only 15 per cent of cases took more than six months; the majority of cases are dealt with expeditiously and satisfactorily. Only a small number, presumably the more complicated, take longer.  Environmental impact studies are relatively new.  The board's annual report says that many appeals are probably cases that have raised difficult issues at local level arising from the implementation of the provisions of the development plan, the protection of amenities and the need to reconcile proposals with the proper planning and development of the area. A number raise contentious third party issues.  These cases by their nature require more time for processing and careful consideration, a factor which is sometimes overlooked in criticisms of the system.  I think that is something we must bear in mind.</P>
    <P>When an application is made to the local authority, one applicant makes that application to those who have power to grant it or refuse it.  Third parties are rarely involved at that stage because they are probably satisfied that the local authority is either going to grant or refuse the application, as the case may be.  They only come in when they are dissatisfied with the decision given by the local authority. The Planning Appeals Board has to deal with the local authority, the applicant and possibly a third party appellant. The whole operation is extremely complex and sometimes it is further complicated by the fact that planners make changes in the application between the time it goes to the local authority and the time it goes to the Planning Appeals Board.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate outsider &mdash; and the third party is really an outsider &mdash; has great difficulty in finding out exactly what is the nature of those changes and what is the nature of the application that is going to be considered by the Appeals Board.  That even happens on occasions when you go into an oral hearing.  I have had the experience of going into an oral hearing and finding the carpet almost completely pulled from under me because the developer had submitted a <Col N="778" /> substantially different set of plans from those which went to the local authority.</P>
    <P>I am making these remarks in response to Senator Howard.  I do not want to be seen as somebody who is making a case for the Appeals Board because nobody has pushed as hard as I have for the Planning Appeals Board to get its act together and get the decisions out in reasonable time.  I would like to see the board become efficient and speed things up while being able to take time, trouble and care over the important decisions. As the Minister has so rightly said, those decisions are very important for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to the Culliton report which addressed the issue of a more efficient infrastructure. The report said that &ldquo;concern for the environment should be addressed by the Government in a positive proactive rather than a negative reactive way.&rdquo;  That is really all we are trying to do on this side of the House.  We are trying to be positive and address these issues so that in the long run there should be more consultation and consensus at an early stage between the developer and the planning authority to avoid the necessity to have appeals at all.  That should be our aim but that is not, unfortunately, helped by the confrontational nature of our political system which thrives on confrontation and which seems to abhor consensus.  We had an extraordinary situation last week, which was interesting to see, when the four parties got together.  Perhaps that is a sign of things to come but I must not deviate.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report also says:</P>
    <P>Sites for particular types of industry with unique physical planning requirements should be selected in advance, on a national basis as necessary, and the infrastructure required planned in advance to meet the environmental requirements of both the industries concerned and the local planning authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand what is meant by that is that these will not require planning permission. Coupled with what I heard from <Col N="779" /> Senator Conroy, that makes me extremely anxious and apprehensive about the road on which we are going.  If you tend to alienate, exclude and make things difficult for those who have a genuine concern for and an authentic interest in the environment, architectural heritage or whatever, what happens is that they put on the boxing gloves and get into a confrontation.  That should be avoided.  I would be interested to know if the Minister agrees.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a TD who said he waited until the last moment to put in his appeal and waited until the last moment to ask for an oral hearing.  I have no doubt there are some isolated incidents of that.  However, I have dealt for 20 years with residents' associations and other community bodies and I have found them to behave in an extremely responsible manner.  The Minister and the Government have no special understanding of the problems of unemployment and the social consequences.  I can tell the Minister that in my electoral area those concerns are extremely high. If a residents' association or some other community group make the hard decision to lodge an appeal which may prevent certain jobs from coming to their area, they do not do it lightly.  They certainly do not want the development to go by default.  They want the process to be speeded up.  We should not presume that everybody has a &ldquo;not in my back garden&rdquo; attitude.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the board has the facility to deal with vexatious or frivolous appeals and to deal with them expeditiously.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of those remarks that I would like the Minister to consider these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue in these amendments is that we are looking at all the projects that may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála in exactly the same manner.  They are all numbered together as though they were to be dealt with subject to the same criteria and the same timescale irrespective of the complexity of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> We should signal our concern for the environment.  Senator Conroy referred to the fact that we are now one of the countries foremost in projecting concern for the environment internationally.  That has happened largely because of the European directive in relation to the environment in this country.  Our record has not been good in the past and once there is an environmental impact statement, irrespective of the fact that that statement will have been made at the initial stage, it does flag the complexity of the issues involved.  It is in a different class from the run-of-the-mill planning application which relates to a narrow environment.  When an environmental impact statement is required, a large area may be affected, a development plan may be involved.  Certainly, a complexity of issues is involved which would not be found in the normal, minor type of planning application.</P>
    <P>Rather than limiting An Bord Pleanála to four months on all planning applications, with the proviso that anything else would go to the Minister, we should insert a category of &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo; appeals.  The determining profile for a major application and a major appeal here would be an EIS because of the complexity of issues related to it.  A signal of our concern for the environment and the larger issues involved now is that we produce an EIS in accordance with the EC directive.  That is really at the nub of it, whether it should go to the Minister or should belong to a separate category coming before An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I think it should not go to the Minister. I do not think any decision in relation to exceptional circumstances in this area should be simply and solely the concern of the Minister.  The Minister will find himself being asked again and again to make a decision in relation to an appeal arising from an environmental impact study and statement.  It might be better for us to put it into the legislation rather than just leaving it to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators, and particularly Senator Costello, are saying, because so much work has been done, <Col N="781" /> because, quite rightly, a very detailed environmental impact statement has been prepared, because that has already gone through very detailed consideration by the various experts involved at council and planning level, that when it comes to An Bord Pleanála, there must be yet a further delay over and above the four months.  The Minister has the power to allow that and on major projects one would not see a great difficulty if one could be assured, for example, that An Bord Pleanála would take a maximum period of six months.</P>
      <P>I consider four months should be adequate.  Indeed, four months is more than adequate for minor appeals about an extension to someone's garage or whatever.  Senators are proposing to multiply the process.  They are saying that because it is being done so thoroughly and so well, even longer consideration should be given to it at the other end.  If the initial procedure were not so openended there might be something to be said for that, a definite time limit, perhaps even longer than four months could be set and the Minister has the power to do that.</P>
      <P>It has been said that in the past perhaps we did not have sufficient concern for the environment.  Here I would certainly pay tribute to Senator Hederman, her colleagues, the people in An Taisce and many others who, at a time when it was not popular, brought these matters to our attention and encouraged us to bring in the sort of legislation we have.  It is not simply now that we have implemented European Community legislation.  We have had a degree of choice at the level at which we implement directives and, quite rightly, we have set higher levels than those actually required by the European Community.  That was our decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello makes the point again that the EIS cases take longer.  We will just go through the process. An Bord Pleanála receive the appeal and it is accompanied by the EIS which would normally be part of the planning application stage.  An Bord Pleanála then publish a notice of the EIS in the newspapers and invite comments within <Col N="782" /> one month.  At the same time they invite comments from other parties and they have one month to respond.  It is very hard to argue, in those circumstances, with all of the preparatory work which has been delivered, that the board should now be required by statute, to take longer to make their decision on these matters. That is not logical.  If the board in particular cases, not necessarily an EIS case, consider or deem it appropriate to require more time, they have absolute power to do that.</P>
      <P>I reject out of hand Senator Hederman's point about confrontational attitudes. I have served in this House, I have been here before introducing legislation. Confrontation never formed part of the way I approach my work.  It is not part of my business.  In each case, while I could not accept the changes that were proposed, I have indicated what I was planning to do in the consolidation of the regulations, on publication, on transparency and on getting the more routine cases dealt with more expeditiously.  On every front I have sought to be as accommodating as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not see a Bill like this as tipping the balance, either in favour of development or in favour of people who deem it appropriate for them to object to certain types of development.  Can Senators look at the legislation right across Europe and bring me a case, give me an example, of where a better job is being done at the moment, an example of more open planning systems?  It will not be too easy to produce cases of where other Governments and other countries have more open flexible systems than Ireland or give the right to so many people, if they deem it appropriate, to object to development. What we are trying to achieve here, as I emphasised at the beginning, is balance and a requirement to be efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has never been proved to my satisfaction that the fact that you take longer to do a job means you are more effective and more efficient or do a better job. In fact, every signpost in the industrial, commercial and even sporting world, apart perhaps, from the case of the slow build-up of the German soccer team, <Col N="783" /> proves that efficiency puts you on top of the job and, as a result, you move on to next business.  That is what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I reject Senator Hederman's suggestion that this Bill is a confrontational Bill, one that politicians thrive on or one where we set out as politicians to try to tip the balance in favour of one side or another.  I hope to prove here and at any stage in the future, in any public debate or in any private conversation that the elements enshrined in this Bill are good, they do not lean in a particular direction, and that they are fair and equitable.  What I want to deliver to the country and what I want to achieve will not be on the basis of trying to be confrontational.  In fact, I will do everything I can to have a more transparent, open, fairer and balanced system.</P>

      <P>Before deciding whether to press it or not I wish to say to the Minister that it was not my intention to suggest that he, personally, was being confrontational.  We would all be unanimous in agreeing that his approach this morning is anything but confrontational. The point I was trying to make was that we have a sad history of a confrontational approach to matters and for that reason perhaps the downside of being confrontational is not obvious.  What I was anxious to stress to the Minister was that, unwittingly, the results of this Bill may well be to bring about that sort of sad confrontational approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any contribution which I and other Senators here make is made with the same objective.  Our objective is to see the smooth and efficient streamlining of the planning process.  We all know that it is not in our interest or in anybody's interest to have these hold-ups.  Members have given examples of delays that have occurred.  I have also stressed that I have made overtures to the Department &mdash; the Minister can check them out &mdash; asking that the Planning Appeals Board would <Col N="784" /> have a time restriction put on it.  I agree with the Minister.  What we are looking for is to get the right balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>We were concluding the debate on amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 9.  As I said earlier, I did not expect the Minister was going to take amendment No. 6 on board and other speakers have put forward good points as to why less time is adequate; but with regard to amendments Nos. 7 and 9 a good case still holds.  My comments about not being confrontational were intended to the extent that local communities and groups are concerned about the areas in which they live and their genuine and deep felt <Col N="785" /> frustration that they are not in a position to influence the changes they see, many of which can be major and bewildering because the pace of change is so intense. I reiterate these points so that we can consider the Bill in the context of these criteria.</P>
      <P>We must give people the opportunity to know what is going on.  That is why I put down the amendment about the newspaper circulating in the area where all the applications could be listed together.  If people know what is going on, have an opportunity to make their views known and if they feel their views are taken on board &mdash; even if they do not always get the decision they want &mdash; they can be satisfied.  At all costs we must endeavour to ensure that people do not get to the appeals stage.  People should be involved at the early stages when matters can be sorted out.  I am heartened to hear the Minister saying this is his intention.  I hope it will mean the whole area of local democracy will be considered because it is fundamental to what we are talking about here.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (2) (b), line 5, to delete &ldquo;other&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;longer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The same arguments apply to this amendment. Subsection (2) (b) says that the Minister may prescribe such other period either in respect of a particular class or classes of appeals or other matters.  I am concerned that the Minister might reduce the time.  I do not know whether the time factor or the classes is involved here.  The way I read it initially was that it was the length of time.  I would be happy if the Minister wanted to lengthen the period but not that he should shorten it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hederman will recall that the Fine Gael proposal which sought to require me in the case of routime <Col N="786" /> and minor cases to specify a period shorter than four months, specified two months.  I indicated at that time that that was not feasible.  It may be that An Bord Pleanála would be in a position to make decisions within that time constraint or shortly thereafter, but I was not of a mind to specify that.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator Hederman's amendment &mdash; she supported the Fine Gael amendment earlier &mdash; would be to preclude me from specifying a shorter period in routine cases.  The provision in the Bill leaves the flexibility and the power to specify longer periods if that were necessary and to specify a shorter period if that proved to be necessary for the more routine cases.  You will appreciate that broader flexibility is much more desirable in the context of not only what we want to achieve but of what the Senators have said.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said, but unfortunately he did not take on board the Fine Gael amendment, which would have dealt with the classes mentioned by Senator Naughten &mdash; domestic extensions, etc.  What I want to ensure here is that this would be done by regulation; it would not be a matter of legislation.  These things have a habit of slipping through and the Minister might shorten the period for dealing with them.  It might not necessarily relate to the class or classes the Seanad dealt with earlier.  That is my concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hederman can rely on it that the Minister for the Environment does not have any hidden agenda.  The fact is that, in relation to the Fine Gael amendment, I indicated that I already had the power.  I was not proposing to use that power until we had greater experience of the new procedures. I want to stop Senator Hederman from preventing me from either going for longer or shorter periods in prescribed classes.  That is all.</P>

I would be concerned that other Ministers might not be as sympathetic as he to the environment in which planning is considered.  It was for that reason I put down this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 8 to 24, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Will a lot of the time of An Bord Pleanála be taken up with staff writing out explanations and replying to queries as to why in a particular case they feel they need more time?  Will this deflect them from their real work, which is the consideration of planning applications.  I feel that if they had limited resources it would be unfortunate if they were to divert these resources to functions which do not appear to me to be central to their role of deciding on planning appeals.  In view of section 2 (1), I wonder is this subsection necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should at this stage say a brief word on how all of this developed.  We had consultations with members of An Bord Pleanála for a number of years with regard to the possibility of streamlining the system.  During that period there was a very considerable improvement in the time it took the board to decide an appeal.  Following exhaustion of all of the possibilities within the existing legal system, it emerged that there were still other areas which could only be addressed by legal mechanisms if we were to further improve that system.  I am delighted to tell the Seanad that, even in the lead-up to the introduction of this legislation and in the expectation that this would be enacted before the summer, there has been a considerable improvement.  There is now a diminishing number of applications on <Col N="788" /> appeals which are taking longer than the four months now being prescribed.  This is an indication already of the capacity of the board and of their willingness to meet as far as possible the requirements of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because it would involve removing section 2 (3) from the Bill.  That is essential because it lays down the procedures which the board must follow in particular cases and the procedures it must follow if it is not possible or appropriate for it to meet the time objective for the determination of cases set for it in section 2 (2).  If we were to delete that subsection, the procedure in circumstances where the board is unable for quite legitimate reasons to give its decision within four months would be unacceptable and uncertain.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 raises the possibility that the board might serve a series of notices indicating dates by which it intends to determine a particular case. To provide for a succession of notices indicating different target dates would, in effect, give the board a blank cheque in terms of time and be completely at odds with the whole purpose of the Bill. I cannot accept that amendment either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support both amendments. Amendment No. 11 is the Labour Party amendment.  It seems to me that section 2 (3) (a) is in the wrong position. I would have thought that where there is a proposal that the board would be asked to intervene where it considers either the four months inappropriate or the period determined by the Minister, then it could come in with another period if it felt that it was not appropriate to be dealt with within the expiration of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the board would deal with an appeal in the given standard period of four months and, secondly, should that period not be sufficient, as we have outlined in the amendments previously in relation to environmental impact studies, the board would then go on to extend that period and only then would the Minister get involved &mdash; in other words, the Minister would be a person of last resort <Col N="789" /> to determine the appropriate period.  In those circumstances we would be improving the legislation and getting to a stage where the Minister would not be faced with the need to consider extending the four month period.  That would deal with the issue of the extra complexity involved in the context of an environmental appeal which requires an environmental impact study.  Perhaps the Minister could look at that again.  I am not so sure I would go quite so far as to delete it.  Certainly, in regard to its position and the manner in which it is done, I think both logic and reason would suggest that the principle could be dealt with at an earlier stage after subsection (2) (a).</P>
    <P>In relation to our own amendment, we are proposing that, at the end of subsection (3) (b), which says:</P>
    <P>Where a notice has been served under paragraph (a), the board shall take all such steps as are open to it to ensure that the appeal or other matter is determined before the date specified in the notice</P>
    <P>to add the words: &ldquo;If this is not possible the Board may from time to time by notice extend the period concerned.&rdquo;  It is given a degree of flexibility to the board to extend the time when it is not possible to deal with the matter in the time allowed.  Something of that nature could arise when there are legal proceedings in relation to an application.  I recall the procedure in relation to the Clifden Airport application not so long ago in Roundstone.  The Office of Public Works had designated it as an area of heritage which was to be preserved.  Then there was a successful High Court action followed by a Supreme Court action which was taken by the Office of Public Works. Obviously a procedure of that nature would require an extension because the board simply could not deal with it within the timeframe we have specified.  We need to make provision for those exceptional circumstances where it is not possible for the board to complete its deliberations within the timeframe and something of the nature of the amendment <Col N="790" /> we are suggesting here would cover that eventuality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not understand Senator Costello.  He would appear to be supporting both amendments Nos. 10 and 11 and they are mutually exclusive. If you delete section 2 (3) (a), you deny the board the right to go outside the four months period.  On the other hand, if you accept amendment No. 11 you are giving an unlimited right to the board to keep extending that period.  I do not understand the Senator's reference to me as Minister, because I do not have an involvement in individual cases.  We are here discussing the prescription &mdash; hopefully in law &mdash; which will enable the board to take its decisions and having the objective of doing so within a four month time period.</P>
      <P>The Seanad have now accepted the four months objective.  If you delete this paragraph the right will be taken away from the board in certain specific circumstances to seek a longer period.  That seems to be the case that Senator Costello is making to me &mdash; to make sure that is there.  It is there and we are keeping it there.  On the other hand, the amendment affords the prospect of extending the right to the board to have an unlimited period and that would be totally against the whole reason for introducing this legislation in the first instance.</P>

He mentioned the consultation there had been with An Bord Pleanála over a number of years streamling the process and that as a result there had been a big improvement but that it had exhausted all those improvements.  In that context I am aware that there were two investigations carried out &mdash; one by Frank Benson and a team and the other an internal investigation by civil servants.

      <P>We are dealing with the amount of time the board might require or request to make their decision; and it is in that context that I was trying to expedite matters.  I was trying to find out what information was available to me as a Senator and I was anxious to know if that internal report &mdash; not the Benson report &mdash; was available.  The Minister said it was not.  You have to forgive me if, because of a lack of information and a lack of knowledge, I have to ask questions which I would not otherwise ask if the information was available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to ask the Minister what bodies and groups were consulted when this legislation was being considered and when it was drafted.  With regard to the question whether the board will be able to make their decisions within the specified <Col N="792" /> period of four months, I mentioned the Culliton report, which says that they think the statutory time limit of four months for processing planning appeals &ldquo;would be very difficult to achieve because of the generally poor record of the local authorities in submitting fully documented files to An Bord Pleanála&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that I am convinced that the Minister wants to improve the lot of the local authorities and to assist them in carrying out their democratic functions, would he not consider that it would be more appropriate to give the local authorities the expertise they require or make it easier for them to afford to take on whatever staff they required to comply with the requests they will get to send documentation to An Bord Pleanála?  In many ways it seems &mdash; and the Minister appears to have confirmed this this morning &mdash; that, to a large extent, it is the local authorities who have been gumming up the works because they have not been sending in the documentation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was aware that in a great number of cases the local authorities were holding up the whole procedure, that they were taking longer than the two months to make their decision and that they were not getting the information to the Appeals Board within the time required.  Would that not be the source of the problem &mdash; the inability of the local authorities to comply with these requests for information?  Would the Minister think of directing his activities for efficiency in that direction, rather than taking the heavy handed approach?</P>

      <P>The point I made was that section 2 (3) (a) was in the wrong place; it should come after section 2 (2) (a), in other words there would be more extensive powers given directly to the board before the Minister would intervene <Col N="793" /> and the Minister's powers would be prescribed at the end of this section.  In this way we would allow An Bord Pleanála greater flexibility after the standard four month period.</P>
      <P>The second amendment is along the same lines.  I pointed out that you could have a series of convoluted and extended court cases which would clearly require an extension of time.  Therefore it should be specified that it would be possible for the board from time to time by notice to extend the period.  Subsection (3) (a). says: &ldquo;... shall specify the date before which the Board intends that the appeal or other matter shall be determined&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, it seems to refer to a single specified date.  Because of the complexity of issues that may arise and the complicated legal processes which may follow an appeal, or be part of an appeals procedure, extended powers given should be given to the board to cover that eventuality.  That is what I am trying to do in the second amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this amendment is very wide and I want to come back to what my feelings were on reading both the amendment and the subsection. Good arguments have been advanced, particularly the point made by Senator Costello about Clifden Airport and the difficulties that can arise in circumstances like that but these, of course, are the exceptions.  In dealing with the majority of cases, if you were to remove the teeth in this subsection I think it would be pointless to have this legislation. That is my feeling.  I agree with the Minister when he said that the effect of accepting one of the amendments would be to give An Bord Pleanála unlimited time to reach their conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the point Senator Hederman made about the problems caused by local authorities being slow to submit documentation. All the documentation involved must be in the file from the first day.  I referred to the experience I had with a particular case and I asked the Minister to consider the value of giving legal effect to a system of information <Col N="794" /> from the board to people who are involved with planning applications.  He did not respond, but I feel that this section is moving towards what I had in mind.  If the board believe they cannot reach a conclusion within four months, then at least they are obliged to inform the parties that they are extending the time.  They are obliged to specify a date by which they have to reach a conclusion. I support that because of experience in dealing with the board.</P>
    <P>The situation at present is wholly unsatisfactory.  Even when the period of three of four months has elapsed, when one would imagine that the collection of all documentation should have been achieved at that stage there is no means of establishing when a decision will be reached in a specific case.  That is unsatisfactory and in so far as the section is attempting to tidy it up it is an advance. To take from that section whatever few teeth are in it would be a worthless exercise to engage in because the whole purpose is to have a timescale and to get the board to adhere to it.</P>
    <P>The discussion is very wide and I accept that there will be exceptional cases as outlined by Senator Costello.  I am sure the Minister will indicate if there is a mechanism to deal with these circumstances. So far I find that section is essential for the success of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to Senator Hederman's earlier point with regard to resources for local authorities. There is a misconception that the only way you can achieve efficiency and improve procedures is by additional staff. If you want to make comparisons between local authorities and output and then make those comparisons with staff again you will find fairly extraordinary results just as we all do in our everyday lives.  It has got to do with capacity, performance, dedication, commitment and, for the greater part, we can find that in all local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context the local authority are being required to submit documentation to An Bord Pleanála within two weeks. That is an improvement.  As far as consultation <Col N="795" /> is concerned, it goes on all the time.  We have eight Bills before the two Houses at the moment relating to the Department of the Environment so the consultative process goes on all of the time with all of the interests involved.</P>
    <P>I had a very successful meeting with An Taisce in relation to the elements in this Bill where I was able to allay their fears.  Senator Hederman would be wise not to inform An Taisce that she is proposing to delete subsection (3), which gives to An Taisce and other bodies the realisation that if there are the type of cases which Senator Howard and Senator Costello referred to which prove too difficult to be dealt with within the specified time, there is an absolute provision for the board, in examining and determining that case, to take a longer period.  It would be very unwise to remove that subsection.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Costello on legal proceedings, in the normal way these would take place after the final process and very rarely during the examination by An Bord Pleanála. Clearly we could not try to take account of all of those individual possibilities beyond saying that it would be very wrong to give the broad blank cheque to make decisions about a large number of applications without having regard to the timescale and the framework into which we have tried to lead the new legislation with regard to planning.  The Bill adds certainty to the process.  They must decide on almost all of the applications within four months and only in the most exceptional cases would a longer time be warranted.  In those circumstances I ask both Senators to reconsider their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify for me in relation to amendment No. 11 how this legislation would operate in relation to the example I gave?  I know we try not to deal with hypothetical situations but this is not quite a hypothetical situation.  This is a situation where planning permission was refused by Galway County Council because the Office of <Col N="796" /> Public Works had designated the area as a heritage centre.  An application was taken to the High Court which was successful and the Office of Public Works then appealed that to the Supreme Court. Obviously it is an ongoing situation that requires an enormous amount of time.  I would like to know is that covered in the provision here?  It seems to me it is not. If it was simply a hypothetical situation I would not press it any further.  It is a situation that can occur more frequently. I imagine there will be more court cases in relation to applications on appeal where there are environmental implications as there are in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not possible to proceed for any reason the Bill makes the following provision in section 2 (2) (a) and (3) (b) where a notice has been served under paragraph (a) &ldquo;the board shall take all such steps as is open to it to ensure that the appeal or other matter is determined before the date specified in the notice&rdquo;.  It can only take the steps that are open to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Does there not seem to be the opportunity in that provision to prescribe for an extension of notice that may be required depending on whether there is an application to the High Court or the Supreme Court which would require a variation in terms of the period.  All it says in section 2 (3) (b) is where notice has been served the board shall take all such steps as are open to ensure that the appeal or other matter is determined.  While the board may take every step they can take within their power, nevertheless the law may very well take it out of their hands.  What is the situation?  We are saying that if you add the amendment it makes provision for the intervention of circumstances that will now come increasingly to bear on planning applications and planning appeals, namely, environmental considerations that will lead to litigation.</P>

      <P>I am very amused at the Minister's comments about An Taisce because when An Taisce sent me their <Col N="797" /> submissions they said in connection with section 2 (3) (a), &ldquo;this particular duty to be imposed on the board is not necessary in view of the provisions of section 2 (1)&rdquo; etc.  They say in relation to section 2 (3) (a) and (3) (b), &ldquo;for the board to implement such provisions means it must divert limited resources to functions which are not central to its role on deciding planning appeals and these should be deleted in view of the duty imposed in section 2 (1)&rdquo;.  I have written beside it, &ldquo;do not understand&rdquo;.  I did not intend to put down this amendment but I looked over it again and looked at some other documentation they sent me and I decided I had better table the amendment. Perhaps it is An Taisce who have made a mistake.  I will certainly be quite upfront in telling them what I have done. I am doing it at their behest and they can have no gripe with me.  I thank the Minister for assisting me in that way.</P>

      <P>The intention of these amendments is to give more scope to An Bord Pleanála to clear their books before the implementation of the strict provisions of this legislation. We want to delete &ldquo;six&rdquo; months and substitute &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; so that we might provide a lead up period of time to enable An Bord Pleanála to get rid of the back log.  I am glad to hear the Minister say there seems to be fewer arrears of appeals than there used to be.  Nevertheless, we are making strict provision for the handling of appeals and imposing a very strict timescale.  Taking into account all the considerations in terms of staff and the existing workload we should give the Appeals Board every opportunity to deal with new appeals under the provisions of this legislation.  It seems to be a reasonable proposal that we substitute &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; for the &ldquo;six months&rdquo; in the legislation.</P>

      <P>In the earlier part of the debate &mdash; I do not know if Senator Honan heard it &mdash; it appeared that everybody was anxious to speed up the procedure. It is a question of how we achieve that.  Some people might be of the opinion that the way to do that would be to put the squeeze on third party appellants, to make things more difficult for <Col N="799" /> them in the hope that that would result in a speeding up of the process.  Other people take a different attitude, people like myself who feel that a more consensual approach would be more appropriate with less of an impression given that we are trying to shut out those who have a legitimate interest.</P>
      <P>If we go that route what will happen? Sadly, there has been a lack of confidence in the planning system.  Industries have not located here because the public were not confident that the authorities would look after their interests.  In the long run, what happens is disastrous for the country. We want to speed up the procedure but we want to ensure that it is done at a fundamental level and that we do not end up with a worse situation.</P>

      <P>In relation to these amendments, Nos. 13 and 14, Senator Costello has said much of what has to be said.  Here again I felt the Minister would probably not agree to 12 months; I thought nine months would be a compromise. It is really a question of when this system will come into operation and how much time is needed.  In view of the fact that the Minister told us the Appeals Board have speeded up the appeals process, perhaps they will be able to cope, and I will not press my amendment.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the extension to 12 months.  In all his answers today, the Minister has been above board; he explained everything to us and, as he rightly pointed out that treaties have been negotiated in four months. Major historical events, such as the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Iraqi War, took place in a shorter period than the Appeals Board take to deal with planning applications.  We are again trying to extend a time limit here with which I disagree.  I would hate to see planning being pushed through; I believe a six month period is adequate.  I ask the <Col N="800" /> movers to withdraw this amendment so that we could move to the other amendments.</P>

      <P>The backlog of applications before An Bord Pleanála two years ago was 1,700; it is now slightly over 1,000. There has been phenomenal improvement and the board have adopted a new and more business like approach.  The question of extending from six to 12 or from six to nine months the time period necessary for the board to give up their operations after the passage of this legislation is what is at issue here.  While, there was support for the principle of the Bill, a number of amendments seem to have the effect of cutting across this principle, trying to establish new procedures and speeding up the operations of the board.  The board have responded magnificently and will continue to do so.  That is the way I want to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject Senator Hederman's comment about squeezing out and shutting up groups who have a legitimate right to make an appeal against a development. I have looked at planning systems throughout Europe and I am proud to say there is not a better or more flexible system in respect of third party appeals than that in this country.  I refute the notion that we are always against something. I have considerable contact with organisations throughout this country and I think the majority of people are positive in their approach rather than negative.  It may very well be that there is need for discussion, consensus and for transparency in the consolidation of the planning regulations and an making objections public from the beginning.  In all of these areas we are improving the position and Senator Hederman is not correct in saying that those who have a legitimate right to appeal against a development are being squeezed out.  In fact, their position in a number of ways <Col N="801" /> is being enhanced.  I am very anxious to have a more transparent system, one with which the public can feel more at ease. That is not inconsistent with trying to do our business more quickly and properly.</P>
    <P>All of the indications I have from An Bord Pleanála show that they are prepared to take this legislation on board because this was published last year.  In the normal way, if we had been able to pass this legislation last January the six months would be practically up now but we hope to have reached that stage in 1993.  In the meantime the board have geared up their operations and I am delighted to tell Senators that the statistics are showing a strong improvement all the time.  That is without neglecting or diminishing the rights of anybody to exercise what they consider to be their rights with regard to planning laws.</P>
    <P>I ask the Senators if we are in favour of the principle of doing this or are not. If we are not then we will put all the obstacles into the way of enabling the board to do what we want them to achieve.  I regard extension of time as unnecessary.  All of the indications I have had, which I have spelled out here, indicate to me that nobody in An Bord Pleanála, in terms of their existing arrangements, considers it necessary to have an extension of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all question the Minister's bona fides on this matter but his attack on Senator Hederman was a little unfair because there has been quite a long campaign in certain sections of the construction and the house building industry and they thoroughly welcomed the provisions of this Bill.  The nub of the campaign has that planning appeals are far too long and there is need for streamlined legislation to get rid of the arrears and the delay.  The reason for this legislation, in the first place, was because of the delay in processing appeals.  Now we are virtually being told by the Minister that there is no delay, that it was really a question of gearing up An Bord Pleanála to deal with the appeals, that the number of planning <Col N="802" /> appeals is down and that the arrears are virtually eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly gave us totals in relation to applications from 1,700 down to 1,000.  He did not give us figures in relation to the backlog of appeals that have not been dealt with, which matter we would be interested in and about which I asked a moment ago. If the reason for the legislation is that there has been an undue delay in processing appeals then we can accept that reason still remains and that there is still a backlog.  If that is the case we need some time to get that out of the way before we get these new streamlined provisions. If the Minister is quite satisfied there is no need for a period, at least no more than six months, I will accept that.</P>
      <P>Section 2 states that the duty of the board is to ensure that appeals are made expeditiously, but the more haste, the less speed.  If we are introducing very tight and quite rigid procedures, a time-scale for all applications of four months, major and minor, then we want to make sure the board are operating from the word go without any backlog causing trouble once they start.  The intention of these amendments is not to breach the objective of streamlining and expediting the procedures but to ensure that when the legislation comes onstream there is no obstacle to it operating effectively.</P>

I still wonder why the reference, which was made to them last January twelve months by my residents' association, is still waiting to be decided, but that is obviously a detail which I do not expect the Minister to answer here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my amendments, in view of the situation in An Bord Pleanála, and particularly in view of what the explanation and financial memorandum clearly says that &ldquo;The Bill will not entail additional staffing or financial <Col N="803" /> requirements for An Bord Pleanála&rdquo;, any delays experienced in relation to appeals with An Bord Pleanála are primarily related to lack of staff and resources.  The Minister has told us otherwise.  He said that they have speeded up their procedures and that they are now in a position that they will be able to implement this legislation in the near future.

      <P>I may be able to cool the atmosphere.  I might have inadvertently misinformed the House in terms of the numbers of planning appeals.  The backlog in September 1990 was 1,700 and in April 1992 it was 1,000.</P>
      <P>To come back to the internal report, it has always been Government policy to manage developments of this kind in that way.  A large number of improvements in An Bord Pleanála resulted before the legislative change, and there was quite a number of improvements on foot of the legislative change.  There is also an expectation of further improvements when we implement the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The only part of this Bill which must wait six months after the enactment of the legislation is the four month objective; everything else is put on stream immediately, and that includes the obligation on local authorities to submit the documentation, the requirement on planning applicants to have a further map to facilitate the local authority, etc.  All these provisions are immediately put in place and this will enable the board to continue with the progress that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the staff figures I gave this morning, if Senator Hederman cannot trust them, I would ask her to take on board the manner in which An Bord Pleanála have been able to bring down the backlog from 1,700 two years ago to 1,000.  If she is arguing that they achieved that with a reduction of staff, I have to tell her that it was achieved by a more <Col N="805" /> efficient operation and increased staffing, particularly the technical inspectorate to whom the Senator referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the backlog has been reduced in a two year period from 1,700 to 1,000, there will be still a backlog of 1,000 when the legislation comes into force.  Do An Bord Pleanála have a time scale for dealing with those cases?  Are they satisfied they can be dealt with within the six months under the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not advise the Senator not to go for an economics degree.  The Senator will appreciate that planning appeals are being submitted all the time.  There would be no reason to have An Bord Pleanála if there were no appeals.  Each month the board receive 250 or 300 appeals; in a four month period there would be over 1,000 appeals.  Therefore there will always be a backlog.  If there was no backlog, I would have to reduce staff numbers drastically because they would not have any work to do.  We could not reach the stage of not implementing the legislative provisions until the backlog was removed.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello's point relates to the net figure of appeals on hand.  I cannot say what that is &mdash; it is probably 700 or 800; I would not like to be too specific but it is less than 1,000.  I do not know how much lower it could or should be. Clearly those appeals would be dealt with by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) Where An Bord Pleanála <Col N="806" /> causes an inspector's report to be produced in relation to an application for planning permission, such report shall be published and copies shall be made available at the offices of the local authority in whose functional area the site which is the subject of the application is situated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is relatively simple and straightforward and is in line with what the Minister said about transparency and the question of making documentation available.  It has been a source of considerable dissatisfaction that reports by inspectors of the Planning Appeals Board have not always been made available to the public.  That would be an important step forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. What is being sought here is openness in the system.  If an inspector's report is sought by the board in relation to an appeal, I see no reason that report should be clouded in mystique and secrecy.  I cannot visualise a situation in which it would be inappropriate to publish that report.  The amendment has much to recommend it.  All documents on a planning file, at either local authority level or at the level of An Bord Pleanála, are, in my view, public documents.  Certain doubts were cast on this this morning but the Minister has indicated that he will rectify any shortcomings there by regulation. The amendment is worth while and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this amendment. As Senator Hederman said, it tends towards the transparency in the system to which the Minister has referred.  All the information that is available should not simply be left in a semi-confidential setting in An Bord Pleanála's files.  It should be available at the offices of the local authority and accessible to anyone who has an interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to make it clear that my determination to have as open and equitable a system as possible does not conflict with my not accepting <Col N="807" /> an amendment that provides that the inspector's report should be made public. The first thing that has to be said is that the board makes its decision based on a number of considerations, including the inspector's report; so the report could be made available only after the board has taken its decision by which time it will be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  We are not now in a position to change the decision.  I have tried to be open in cases that are at the stage where reports produced could influence the outcome at local authority level or subsequently.  It could only be helpful to produce this report if it was going to affect the decision.  However, the decision has been taken.</P>
      <P>Under section 23 of the 1976 planning Act, a person is appointed by An Bord Pleanála to carry out a report, an inspection or have an oral hearing on behalf of the board and then make a recommendation to the board.  The board are obliged to consider that report but are not bound by it.  They may base their decision on the report but take into account wider considerations.  The report is a very positive and important input into the board's decision.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate to publish it.  We all know of cases where the board took an entirely different decision to that recommended by the inspector.  In my judgment the board were right.  In those circumstances the production of a report would cause more problems than it would solve.  Fundamentally it is not a report that can influence the position because it could only be produced when the board had made its final decision.  For that reason, Senators will realise it is quite realistic for me not to favour its production.</P>

      <P>I listened to what the Minister had to say and I do not see that he has any case against what we are proposing.  Is there any good reason why material that was commissioned by An Bord Pleanála, should not be made available publicly, whether or not it had a bearing on their decision?  Unless there is a reason for keeping something confidential <Col N="808" /> it should be made public.  The Minister has not given a reason it should not be available.  It would be of interest to all the people involved in the planning application.  Why should it be kept in the files and put away in An Bord Pleanála's office?  It would not have been commissioned unless An Bord Pleanála had a reason to do so and it would be relevant to have it publicly available and accessible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello.  The Minister has not put forward a convincing reason in this case.  Up to now the contrary has been the case; the Minister has put forward very cogent reasons &mdash; not that I agree with them all as I take a fundamentally opposite attitude to that taken by him.  Nevertheless, without being in anyway condescending, I would like to compliment the Minister on the consideration he has given to the amendments and the interest he has taken.  I do not think the Minister has, as yet, taken anything on board but at least he has listened to us.</P>
      <P>With regard to this amendment &mdash; I am sorry to repeat myself but the Minister forces me to do so &mdash; it is very disappointing that although he speaks very eloquently about transparency and openness and making documents available when it comes to us looking for something we are told the opposite; we are told &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I am not going to go back on what the Chair said was not relevant with regard to the possibility of making a report available.  Of course it is relevant because if we knew what was in it we could save a lot of time.  We were not allowed to have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Chair said it was not relevant because we were dealing with the two amendments at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it was relevant to those two amendments because if that report spoke about speeding up the procedures that was relevant in the context of whether the board would be able to cope with the matter within six <Col N="809" /> months, nine months or 12 months.  I want to emphasise the point to the Minister that here once again the transparency which was so laudable and about which we are delighted apparently is not going to be implemented here.  I do not really think the fact that the decision has been made means the report would be irrelevant.</P>
      <P>If I am not misinterpreting the Minister, he said he knew of a case where the board had taken a different view to the inspector and in his humble opinion the board were right.  Let me put it to the Minister that might very well be the attitude which An Taisce, a residents' association or the public might take and that concealing these matters from them is what drives people mad.  That is what people hate.  I find it difficult to understand why it is that once people get into positions of power where they have information available to them they suddenly forget what it was like when they were in the humble position of trying to look after a constituent who is taking an appeal or a planning application and the frustration felt when one cannot get access to information and reports.  It is the frustration of not being given information up front, of knowing that there is an inspector's report which is hidden away which some people can see but we cannot, that drives people into taking a third party appeal.</P>
      <P>Somebody like the Minister, Deputy Smith, can look at a report and say that he agrees with it.  However, we are deemed less reasonable and it is assumed that if we were to see it we would not agree with it.  That is the fundamental flaw in much of the planning legislation. There is the continual assessment of the public as in some way unable to take a responsible position.  That is what is causing so many of the planning application appeals to go wrong; people are being forced by circumstances to make appeals because they are concerned that there may be a hidden agenda.  Perhaps the Minister does not have a hidden agenda but they feel other people have. Because the Minister will not let them see the report, they wonder what can be in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The one report I have asked the Minister for is the one I cannot have.  I believe in that report there is information that might be relevant to my case and the fact that I cannot have the report fuel my certainty that there is something in it that the Minister does not want me to see.  If the Minister had given me the report and I had had time to look at it overnight I would probably have discovered there was nothing in it and I would have come in here in very good humour and we might all be home by now with these amendments agreed or disagreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to differ.  In regard to people feeling frustrated, I will be here a long time before the Senator can convince me that it is always the absence of information that causes this frustration.  Often it is an interpretation of new information and other aspects that equally frustrates people.  I have said from the beginning that compared to any other European country one could not find a more open, fair and more balanced system than ours.  On the production of the reports at local authority and all relevant levels up to the point of the decision being taken, I am prepared to have a totally new approach and all sides of the House welcome that.  However, in regard to the inspector's report I have told the House that the only time it can be produced is when a decision is taken.  In all other cases all of the information is available up to and until a decision is taken.  Once the decision is taken the report clearly does not have the same relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps Senator Hederman is trying to tie the Irish legislation to the UK legislation where the inspector's report is published. In the UK it is the inspector who decides.  In our case the board have statutory authority to make an independent decision, taking into consideration the inspector's report and all the other things they must take into account.  However, they make their own decision.  The inspector's report is not the decision.  I consider that the production of that report in circumstances where the board is not bound by it would cause as much conflict <Col N="811" /> and frustration as its absence seems to create for Senator Hederman.  We will have other legislation in this area in the future when there may be a different view taken.  That is my view at this time.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House the benefit of my experience.  When inspectors are dealing with these very often difficult situations it may be better if they can stand back from these applications and make an independent assessment in the knowledge that will not be pressurised into deciding on a future application because of something they said in relation to an earlier one.  Many a public servant has set out honestly to deal with a planning application and make an assessment only to find himself faced with something that was published on the basis of what was decided in, say, Drogheda; and there may be a different report for Cork because there were different circumstances. It is not that we are hiding anything.</P>
    <P>I want to refute again the line that we have a hidden agenda in relation to this planning Bill.  As far as the report in my Department is concerned, this is it.  The board had a backlog of 1,700 on 13 September 1990 and 1,000 on 30 April 1992. That is solid progress and the legislation will improve that position.  The fact that there were no votes called on this legislation, which has been supported on all sides of both Houses of the Oireachtas, is an indication of the consolidated position being taken up by the majority of elected representatives.  I have great regard for Senator Hederman's contribution in this field.  It is part of the democratic process into which each of us has a right to have an input.  I am satisfied that the provisions here for openness, transparency, flexibility, balance and a fair approach will prove in time that we do not take away rights from anybody.  We want to consider each application on its merits.  We have the board in place to make decisions.  We have made solid progress so far and that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only will we be pressing it but we may have to put it to a vote.  It is not that we want to do so but the Minister seems to be sending us in that direction.  I hope the Minister does not think I am cowed by the approach that everything is all right and that I am the one who wants to stand out against this.  I do not mind if I am the only one who stands out.  I will stand up here for what I believe are the right principles so that people will have the right to participate in planning.  It does not bother me if I am the only person in the House to do so and I know the Minister recognises that.  I am here to represent the people and I will certainly continue to do so.  I will not accept that because the Minister keeps saying he wants to be open, transparent and flexible that everybody is going to conclude that he is being open, transparent and flexible.  I am not a member of a political party.  What the Minister says may be adequate to convince the members of political parties who are under political three line Whips, but it does not convince me and I do not want the Minister to think it will convince me.</P>
      <P>What I have said &mdash; and I repeat it &mdash; is that the Minister has continuously talked about making reports available but as soon as we ask for something to be made available we are given 100 reasons it is not possible.  I know that the board will have made this decision, but I do not see why that should preclude the public, an appellant or a developer from seeking to know that influenced the inspector to come to a certain decision.  I have been to a number of appeals and I know the inspectors but not for one moment do I think that the inspectors in the Department would be intimidated into giving one report because it was going to be made public and another report because it was going to be kept secret.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  (a) No extension of time for the hearing of appeals of any class or type or kind shall be sought or accepted by the Board or imposed by the Minister under this section or any other enactment arising from staff shortages.</P>
      <P>(b) The Minister is required to ensure that the board has sufficient staff and ancillary resources to meet, save in exceptional circumstances, the time limits set out in this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Chair did not see me offering on the last amendment. What we are seeking here is to prevent the excuse of staff shortages being used by An Bord Pleanála for their failure to meet the four months deadline in the legislation.  We are concerned that this excuse is being used from time to time and may well be used to extend the deadline. In the second part of our amendment we are seeking to ensure that the Minister will provide sufficient staff and ancillary resources to the board so that they can operate within the time limits set out in the section.</P>
      <P>During the discussion the Minister drew a distinction between the board of An Bord Pleanála and the administrative process within the board.  That was an interesting concept to put before the House because the public do not differentiate between the board and the administrative staff of An Bord Pleanála. We are concerned that staff shortages should not be used by the administrative staff as an excuse for not meeting the four months objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the board to the planning process has not been referred to and the impression may emerge that there is dissatisfaction with the whole process.  That would be wrong because the majority of us accept that the decisions that emanate from the board are usually satisfactory <Col N="814" /> and I think their contribution to the planning process has been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The two areas that have caused concern and which have dominated the discussion here today are the time applications or appeals take to be decided and the absence of transparency in the process.  I consider the final results that emerged from the board as worthwhile and deserving of support.  It is obvious that our frustrations and concerns are with the length of time appeals take and the perceived absence of transparency.</P>
    <P>If the board fails within a period of four months to arrive at a decision or seek an extension of time, what is the status of the appeals?  I ask that question having regard to the status they would have with the local authority in similar circumstances.  I have extended the matter to some extent.  Basically, the amendment requires that staff shortages would not be used as an excuse for delays in processing appeals.</P>

      <P>I thought Senator Howard was going to tell me that when you look out the window on a lovely sunny day you might say it will be raining in an hour or, alternatively, when you look out the window and it is raining you might say it will be fine in an hour.  My philosophy is that if it is fine it will stay fine and if it is raining it will get fine.</P>
      <P>The statutory provision governing staffing is covered in section 10 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976.  The same applies to all boards.  In the past, applications from An Bord Pleanála for extra staff received sympathetic consideration.  I must take into account the national financial situation. If you put in different staffing provisions from those which apply to other boards it could ultimately produce fertile ground for industrial unrest.  I do not want that to happen and I am sure Senator Howard does not want it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing board and staffing levels have been increased marginally in recent times; the inspectorate has been substantially upgraded in numbers and the performance of the board, while not fully satisfactory, is moving very close to meeting <Col N="815" /> the provisions laid down in this legislation. There is no evidence to suggest that there is any problem in that regard. If there are future developments of the kind the Senator outlined, we will have to examine them, but we will not anticipate them; we will not say that that will be the position because in a number of areas we have lightened the load.  We have streamlined the system which require the local authority to send all the necessary information to the board from the outset. Previously the board were obliged to write to the applicant asking him to submit a full appeal.  We now have what might be called an automatic system underpinning many of these appeals which takes away a considerable part of the board's workload.  In requiring them to make decisions within a four month period, we are streamlining that system to enable them to make those decisions. It is not a case of off-loading or on-loading additional requirements without taking into account how the system is changing and how their management and structure can benefit from the proposals which will be implemented immediately after the enactment of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Senator Howard made a good case with regard to the problems which might arise as a result of an inadequate number of staff, and the Minister referred us to section 10 of the 1976 Act.  In view of the Minister's pressing desire to be less involved where he is not needed so that he will be able to deal with more important issues, is there any need for employees of the board to be subject to the approval of the Minister, as set out in section 10?  The phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; is mentioned in almost every section. Does the Minister consider that that is his job or would he be better employed doing the important work which he, as Minister for the Environment, has to do and which, from what he said today, he wants to do?</P>

While this is not related to the matter at issue, I agree with Senator Hederman.  In fact, I will be making proposals to the local authorities in the near future, without the requirement of new legislation, to transfer functions which were carried out only with the consent of the Minister from time immemorial.  I agree there are many areas where the Minister's involvement is not required and I propose to make any changes I can.</P>
      <P>When it comes to personnel staffing issues and matters relating to public pay, unfortunately, for better or ill, in terms of how the national purse strings are managed and the constraints on public finances, there has to be a fairly even-handed approach throughout the Civil Service and the State sector.  The consent of the Minister is not required in every instance, rather the system produces a situation where there is balance and comparability between these areas.  I do not generally have to sign documents dealing with these issues but, on a broad front I adopt an even-handed approach, otherwise there would be considerable additional costs on the Exchequer which, in turn, would be passed on to the taxpayers &mdash; a burden they are unable to carry.  That general requirement is enshrined in the legislation, not my personal involvement in the day-to-day business of the board.</P>

I do not want to give the same answer I gave Senator Howard regarding what would happen if something is not done.  I prefer to say what I will do when it happens.  As the Senator rightly suggests, there have been times when reports of this kind have not met that statutory deadline.  Usually it is because of queries raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we would be informed that the preparation of the report had been delayed but would be available as soon as the Comptroller and Auditor General had delivered on whichever point was raised in that context.  It is not a general problem.  Delays are inevitable, but we are informed of them and it is the duty and requirement of the board to meet them as far as possible, and they normally do.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 5, to delete &ldquo;giving&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;making public&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 proposes to delete the word &ldquo;giving&rdquo; in section 3 (5) (f) so that the term &ldquo;appropriate period&rdquo; paragraph (a) would mean the period of one month, depending on the day of making public the decision of the planning authority rather than the day of giving the decision of the planning authority. These dates are quite significant because there is a difference between the actual day on which the planning <Col N="818" /> authority make a decision and the date on which it is made known to the public. Indeed, notification of decisions made by local authorities generally made at least a week or a fortnight after the decisions have been made.  When the new schedule is introduced it will be more difficult for all the parties involved to lodge an appeal within the required timescale.</P>
    <P>Certain residents' associations, on the payment of a certain fee, have access to the decisions made by local authorities, but others do not.  Ordinary members of the public do not have such access and they do not know the timescale required for making an appeal.  They now have one month not only to lodge an objection but to put forward the grounds of submission. They are not allowed any margin of error because they cannot add to what they have already stated.  My concern is that there would be a time lapse from the time of access to the information rather than from the time the decision was made because there are no clear-cut procedures for informing those who are likely to be involved.  The regulations the Minister mentioned to upgrade the present procedures will certainly be an improvement. However, there is a significant difference between the giving of a decision by the planning authority and making public that decision.  There is a considerable time lapse before the interested parties are informed of the decision.</P>

    <P>An Taisce welcomed this section of the Bill and I welcomed it until I read the representations from a certain planning or housing body.  I was very impressed with the point they made and I wonder if the Minister could tell me if it has any validity.  They said there was a difference between the length of time the applicant or developer had in making up his or her mind on whether to proceed with an <Col N="819" /> appeal and the length of time given to a third party.  The applicant had a week in which they knew the third party was making an appeal and in the light of that could decide whether to allow the development to go ahead.  That would mean there would not be an appeal and the development could go ahead.  The applicant now knew he was clear of running the risk of a third party appeal hindering his development.  He might want to appeal against a condition and he would have to weigh up the pros and cons of the condition and whether it was worthwhile appealing against that, taking the time lag involved into consideration. Since everybody is now on an even footing, is that a valid argument and does it pose a problem?  Perhaps Senator Conroy would give us the knowledge of his experience in this matter?</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to alter the commencement date of the one month period allowed for making an appeal to the board.  Under this proposal the appeal period would commence from the date on which the planning authority's decision is made public instead of the date on which a decision is given as proposed in the Bill.  I believe the arrangement under which an appeal period commences when the planning authority makes a decision is reasonable and I would not favour the alternative arrangement suggested in the Senator's amendment.  However, I appreciate the concern that people who may wish to appeal to the board against the planning authority decision would know of a decision as soon as possible after it is made.  As I have said, the issue of public notice arrangements for planning matters is being examined at present and I can <Col N="820" /> assure Senators that their concerns on this point will receive careful consideration. On that basis I hope the Senator will agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Under the new planning regulations, it is my intention to have the local authority's decision put into the public domain very quickly.  This is part of the transparency I referred to earlier and that got me into a certain amount of difficulty. Secondly, the period for third party objections is being extended.  Up to now they had 21 days from the date of giving the decision and the Bill gives one month, that is an extra week.  The question of how we will resolve all these matters in the regulations is receiving active consideration at present, but it is in line with the commitment I gave earlier to try to find the best mechanisms to ensure that nobody has to wait unduly to know the decision of the local authority.  I give a commitment to the Senators on that question.</P>

      <P>The Minister used the expression &ldquo;putting it into the public domain&rdquo; so presumably people will know about the decisions.  On that point and in relation to Senator Costello's comment, apparently not all local authorities deal with this matter in the same way.  I am sure the local authority of which I am a member notify the applicant, the appellant or anybody who has made objections to an application of the same period in which they or the developer can lodge an appeal.  However, I understand that does not happen in all local authorities and where this is not the procedure some parties are at a disadvantage.  Is that what the Minister is referring to when he says he is going to make sure it goes into the public domain more quickly or is he referring to the possibility that the <Col N="821" /> decisions might be publicised in a local paper?</P>

      <P>We are referring to procedures which will be adopted by all local authorities on a uniform basis to inform the public of decisions taken.  The Senator rightly stated that, in the case of people who object, the majority, if not all, local authorities notify the individuals concerned and tell them their rights with regard to appeal, etc.  However, we all accept that some planning applications could have an additional feature in terms of how the public are informed, and these will be considered in the context of the regulations.  It could involve, as the Senator rightly suggests, advertisements in newspapers or other means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) The Board shall be answerable directly to the Oireachtas or to a designated Joint Committee thereof, not in relation to any specific appeal decision but in respect of its general policy, efficiency and fairness.</P>
      <P>(2) Where such function has been delegated by both Houses of the Oireachtas to a Joint Committee the terms of reference of that Committee shall include detailed provisions of how the Committee and the Board shall relate to each other.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would allay many genuine fears and concerns of the general public regarding certain decisions taken by An Bord Pleanála.  I would be the first <Col N="822" /> to recognise that the majority of decisions do not create major problems, but some do.  On Second Stage Senator Fitzgerald outlined experiences he had in his area, and a number of peculiar decisions have also been brought to my attention recently.</P>
    <P>If An Bord Pleanála were answerable to an all party committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas the policy under which they operate would be clear to everyone. For example, in one county a local authority had designated an area for an environmental amenity scheme, a developer applied for planning permission on the same site and received permission on appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  That was contrary to the development plan of that county.  In my county, two decisions taken within the past 12 months were also contrary to the county development plan. The county council employed consultants to prepare a county development plan, went through the normal legal process, received submissions from different bodies, examined those submissions and proceeded to grant planning permission along those lines.  However, because of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála the development may not go ahead.  This is contrary to what was decided by the county council when preparing their county development plan.  The area in question was designated for housing but when an appeal was lodged with An Bord Pleanála, the board overturned the decision of the county council.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of similar complaints about decisions and appeals that are extremely difficult to justify.  People will suggest there is redress to the courts, but we all know the cost of this and, for the majority of applications that go before An Bord Pleanála this is not a realistic option because the developer cannot afford to take his case to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile amendment and should be taken on board.  The Oireachtas joint committees have been very successful to date.  Each Member on the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; on which I had the honour to serve for seven years &mdash; regardless of their political <Col N="823" /> views, got on well and dealt with the business before them.  An Oireachtas joint committee to which An Bord Pleanála would be answerable would improve the planning process and allay the fears of the general public who feel that certain developers who do not deserve it get planning permission while others are rejected.  In my experience, those who are rejected do the most damage to this economy.  Some of these appeals have been with An Bord Pleanála for eight or nine months and, as a result, job opportunities were lost.  Hence my welcome for the provision that the decision must be made within four months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I reluctantly support this amendment because An Bord Pleanála was set up specifically as an independent forum which would be free from political or other interference when it came to planning decisions.  I do not like the idea of any intrusion by the Oireachtas in the exercise of their role and the annual reports provide a degree of monitoring and accountability which is welcome. Nevertheless, I feel bound to support this amendment because of the complaints made to me by colleagues in the political arena, at local authority level particularly, about decisions made by An Bord Pleanála which I hate to say, they would have described as perverse when one takes into consideration the evidence presented.</P>
      <P>The amendment says the board shall be answerable directly to the Oireachtas or a joint committee not in relation to any specific appeal decision but in respect of its general policy, efficiency and fairness.  We should ensure that there is accountability to the Oireachtas or an Oireachtas joint committee, especially if it caters for general provisions rather than specific ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the objective of both amendments.  I believe it is essential <Col N="824" /> in the interests of democracy that the Oireachtas should have the opportunity of a periodic review of developments in bodies such as An Bord Pleanála.  I believe that type of review is fundamental to the success of our democratic system. I regard as unsatisfactory that the only opportunity we in this House have of discussing the activities of an organisation such as An Bord Pleanála is when legislation dealing with that board comes before the House.</P>
      <P>Of course, our discussions on the functions and activities of any body to which legislation may relate is confined to the areas of that organisation's activity applicable to the legislation we are dealing with.  Therefore, I believe there is considerable merit, and I believe it is even crucial to the democratic system, that we would have in place a mechanism by which bodies and organisations set up by the Oireachtas to discharge certain functions on behalf of the State and on behalf of the people should be examined on a regular basis.  In the absence of a better system being put forward by the Minister or by his Department, then I would ask him to seriously consider accepting the amendments as proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that Senator Hederman, knowing how vulnerable I was in a situation like this, might give me a hand on this one.  However, those of you who were in public life prior to the 1976 Planning Act will recall the old system.  I think all of us sought and welcomed the change to an independent board with its own distinctive character and constitutional requirements and any failure in that respect would have to be referred to the courts.  I certainly was very glad to see planning appeals moving away from the political arena.  With the best will in the world, no matter how you would approach it, no matter how fairminded you might be, I think it was open to misinterpretation.  That change, therefore, was welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take on board the fact that Senator Naughten wants to have a debate in the House, but not on individual cases.  In view of the quasi-judicial nature of the <Col N="825" /> work of the board and its independent character, I think it would not be appropriate that it would be answerable to the Oireachtas in the way suggested by this amendment.  As Senator Costello said, you have the annual report, which presents a certain opportunity, but I would not like to politicise in any way the activities of the board and I think the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>When it comes to satisfying the public, all of you are experienced politicians. Regrettably, I have the habit now and then of tending to look as if I was trying to lecture, and I sincerely am not. However, in cases where there are opposing views, which there has to be in the case of planning appeals or the appeal would never have arisen in the first place, let us not try to fool ourselves that just debating it in the Houses of the Oireachtas eases the tension.  Clearly, there are differing views and they may well differ at the end of the process. There are occasions where dialogue can improve that and where the final decision can meet all considerations but, inevitably there will be decisions which do not accord with one side or the other.  They cannot be reconciled just by having a debate.  It is the tension; it is part of the system that is there.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to the case where a county development plan is changed by An Board Pleanála.  He asked why should county councillors or other public representatives accept that.  After all, their technical offices prepared the development plan, the public represenatives decided that plan, and why should some boards actually change the content of that plan in a particular decision?  All the planning board can do within their remit is what you can do also, because is it not true that county councillors in the exercise of their planning functions have changed county development planning by decision?  The same option is open to both sides.  The county council may do it in specific circumstances, so also may An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I really would have to say &mdash; please do not misunderstand me; it is only my belief <Col N="826" /> and I have just one man's input into it &mdash; that the Oireachtas would be well advised to accept the present situation where you have the annual report but should not try to get into a situation where by calling in An Bord Pleanála they would seek to deal in the public arena with the tensions and different attitudes out there <i>vis-à-vis</i> certain decisions.  I would not see that as being in any way favourable to the political system, and in many ways I would see people interpreting it as some kind of a return to the pre-1976 period. I am sure that is not Senator Naughten's view, but I think there would be a danger of that complexion of interference to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>My point on this amendment concerns accountability. What worries me greatly is that we now have, whether we like it or not, a group of bureaucrats appointed, probably for their lives, who are answerable to nobody.  I find it extremely difficult to accept that.  As I pointed out to the Minister, local authorities go to the trouble of employing planning consultants to advise and prepare a county development plan. Perhaps they have lands in their possession for upwards of ten years and they have a development plan for ongoing development.  Then we see that An Bord Pleanála make a one sentence decision that this development is unsuitable.  I do not want to abuse the privilege of this House in any way, and I will refrain from doing so, but I tell the Minister that when the like of that is happening it is about time those people were accountable to somebody.</P>
      <P>I have put down this amendment and I have given it a lot of consideration.  I think it is time the Oireachtas were entitled to lay down the policy and give a clear guideline to An Bord Pleanála.  I feel this is the best possible way of doing it.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  The Bill will be much better if it is included.  I believe we can look forward to much clearer decisions being taken, decisions that people can understand and where there will not be a half dozen question marks after them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister in some way misjudged the amendment by seeing it as an attempt in some way to revert to the pre-1976 situation.  It is not. It is very clearly specified in the amendment that individual decisions and individual cases are completely and totally out.  It is the global effect of the functions and operations of the board that should be a matter to be considered by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are here today discussing this legislation is evidence that the Minister himself became satisfied there were certain shortcomings in the operation of the planning system that needed to be rectified by legislation.  I believe if we had that annual review, either in a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas or in the Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps the matters we are dealing with today would be dealt with earlier.  I want to make it absolutely clear that there is no intention whatsoever that individual cases would ever form part of the review.  What would be involved would be the overall operation, how the operations of the board evolve over a period &mdash; and it is there for quite a long time now.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the only opportunity the Houses of the Oireachtas ever have had of discussing how the board operated was when legislation relating to it came before them.  These only emerged because it became obvious to the Minister and his Department that it was necessary to bring in the changes intended in this legislation.  Therefore, there is a useful role of review and discussion that the Houses of the Oireachtas or a joint committee of the Houses can discharge in relation to this body, and indeed to some other bodies as well.  I encourage the Minister to look more favourably on the proposed amendment than he has so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the last point made by Senator Howard.  I do not think there is any question of going back to the position where the Minister was <Col N="828" /> involved in making specific decisions.  That is quite clear from the amendments.  I did not quite understand the Minister.  I think he said that all An Bord Pleanála do is make a decision which changes the development plan and that local authorities can do the same.  That is not the way my local authority operates.  If there is a material contravention of the plan and we want to give a decision for some good reason &mdash; circumstances might have changed since the plan was drawn up or there may be some other extenuating circumstances &mdash; we go through a whole procedure which is similar to the procedure the plan goes through.  You advertise in the newspapers; you invite comments, submissions and so on and you have to deal with those.  Then, having dealt with them, you deal with the planning application.  An Bord Pleanála do not go through any of that rigmarole. They simply make the decision and that is that.  They just pull it out of the air and decide they will totally ignore a development plan and the public is taken unawares.  I do not quite understand what comparison the Minister was making there.</P>
      <P>Unless it is changed in this Bill, the Minister has the power to give directives to the board in relation to matters.  I am thinking of cases where the Minister gave the board some guidelines in relation to how they should make decisions on shopping centres.  I do not know if that is the only one or if there have been others.  I do not think the Minister is completely excluded from the whole thing.  Perhaps in a way he would like us to believe that he is, or perhaps that is the impression I seem to have been given in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be giving policy directives all the time.  By and large one of the very few powers a local authority has is the making of its development plan, and I am very happy to hear that the Minister intends to hand over other powers to local authorities.  I hope they will not be just about the dog pounds we heard about in relation to dog licences.  I am pleased the Minister intends to hand over more powers, <Col N="829" /> because that is what subsidiarity is all about.  In this case here I think it is fairly clear that the involvement of the Houses of the Oireachtas or a joint committee would be very limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I really have very little further to add.  It is clear that both Senator Naughten and Senator Howard are very very committed in their view that the board should be answerable to the Oireachtas in some way.  I am equally resolute in the view that that is not the road we should travel.  If I were asked whether I was entirely happy with everything that happens in An Bord Pleanála, my answer would be the same as the Senator's answer.  I know there are shortcomings and I have tried to address some of them and so have my predecessors. Part of the whole belief behind the legislation was not only the streamlining process but also to improve in every way possible the decision-making capacity and to make sure in all we have done here, in regard to public documents and trying to get decisions made more quickly, that we have a more open system.</P>
      <P>There are shortcomings; that is undeniable. From time to time all of us may wonder about particular decisions.  I am merely giving my advice to the House that I do not see that you will enhance your position in any way by being involved with a quasi-judicial, independent board, with its own independent character, in matters where very often there are clearly two distinct and opposite points of view and you are trying to reconcile them.  I do not understand how you could have this matter on the agenda in the Oireachtas without discussing individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often public representatives use words like &ldquo;bureaucrats&rdquo;.  However, the board is selected; there are nominating panels, people like An Taisce and others. It is a fairly representative and, in many ways, as good a selection process as one can find.  There are terms for the duration of the people who serve on the board and clearly over time changes are made.  I am <Col N="830" /> not in a position to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment No. 40 is an attempt to tighten up further the activity and the accountability of An Bord Pleanála by extending the conditions so that they would have regard for the provisions of the development plan, of any special amenity area order and of any tree preservation order relating to the area.  That seems to be part of the problem, that An Bord Pleanála may or may not concur in its decision with the provisions of the development plan. Local authorities &mdash; for example, Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council &mdash; adopt development plans and the overall development of an area is integrated into that.  However, there is no compulsion on An Bord Pleanála to relate its decision to the actual provisions there.  Certainly that seems to be a major gap.  The local authority is responsible for the overall development in a cohesive and comprehensive fashion.</P>
      <P>At present we have the procedure whereby our semi-State bodies and the Secretaries of Departments come before Joint Committees of the Oireachtas and are questioned very keenly on decisions made.  I do not know why there should be any problem about questioning An Bord Pleanála in general terms before the Oireachtas in relation to broad patterns of development that have been outlined by local authorities and whether they have adhered to those.  I think the Oireachtas could usefully play an accountable role in broad terms as long as it is quite clear that it will not deal with the specifics of any particular application. The balance, I think, would fall in favour of going ahead with this amendment and incorporating it in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning authorities may grant planning permission in contravention of their development plan by way of the material contravention route. This always arises when dealing with individual planning applications.  When it comes to the case of An Bord Pleanála, they, too, must have regard to the <Col N="831" /> development plans, but in my view &mdash; and this is the point I was making earlier to Senator Hederman and now to Senator Costello &mdash; it would be impossible to tie an appellant body absolutely to the development plans of 87 different local authorities in the exercise of their functions and with their wider remit.  As I <Col N="832" /> said earlier, we can agree to differ.  I am determined and of the view that because of the quasi-judicial nature of the work of the board, it should not be subject to this kind of consideration.  That is my advice to the House.  This is a democratic system and I can do no more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 31 to 39, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) An appeal shall consist of a notice of appeal and a statement of the full grounds of the appeal,</P>
      <P>(b) the notice of appeal shall be submitted before the expiration of the appropriate period.</P>
      <P>(c) the statement of the full grounds of the appeal shall be submitted within two months of the date of publication of the planning authority decision,</P>
      <P>(d) A notice of appeal shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) be made in writing</P>
      <P>(ii) state the name and address of the appellant</P>
      <P>(iii) state the subject matter of the appeal</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv) be accompanied by such fee (if any) as may be payable in respect of such appeal in accordance with <Col N="833" /> regulations under section 10 of the Act of 1982.</P>
    <P>(e) The statement of the full grounds of the appeal shall state in full the grounds of the appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope I have got the wording of this amendment correct because I found it difficult to get the meaning across properly. The reason for this major amendment is that, similar to the four month provision which we discussed some time ago, this aspect poses enormous problems for the proper consideration of planning and development matters.  I do not think the Minister has conceded any change.  I hope he will consider this amendment and come back with good news.</P>
    <P>The one month in which the Minister requires the appellant to state his or her grounds in full makes it virtually impossible for third parties in general and for some of the prescribed bodies like An Taisce to submit their views.  One of the problems the Minister may not be aware of is that the planning lists, which alert bodies such as An Taisce to what is happening are very often delayed for a considerable time.  Dublin Corporation are normally very reliable about publishing a weekly list of planning applications but An Taisce told me that recently a specific list did not reach them until 17 days after the decision had been made.  I know that other local authorities only compile a monthly list of planning applications and it could be well into the following month before the list is published.</P>
    <P>There is also the other point, which I do not suppose will bear very heavily with the Minister.  I do not imagine he will consider it to be of much importance but I would like nevertheless to make it. Many voluntary organisations which the Minister was genuinely anxious to involve in the planning process, only meet once a month.  Many of their members have to travel considerable distances to attend meetings, and unlike local authority members they are not paid expenses.  This makes it difficult for them <Col N="834" /> to meet to consider planning applications or planning appeals.</P>
    <P>A further problem is that when they send a planning officer into the planning department they find it very difficult to get copies of some of the information. Sometimes since the file is with a Corporation official they cannot see it and they have to go back again.  All these things add to the difficulties experienced by members of voluntary bodies.  Another problem is that there can be a tremendous volume of appeals coming on stream together.  It came to my attention recently that there will be three major planning appeals &mdash; Powerscourt in Bray, Lough Key in Roscommon and Carton, all of which I am sure Senators will agree are extremely important.  They are all being appealed, and I know An Taisce are interested in them.  Three appeals within a short time of each other make it extremely difficult for them to spread their resources to enable specialists to make their input.  All these matters add enormously to the difficulty.  The Minister insists that not only must they send in the grounds of their appeal in full initially but they must state at that stage whether they are looking for an oral hearing. Of course they do not know the decision the board will make about an oral hearing, and they will have put all this effort into sending their documentation to the Planning Appeals Board and there may still be an oral hearing where they will have to be represented. This puts a very unfair burden on the local voluntary groups who have a genuine concern and interest in their area.</P>
    <P>Before I move off that point I want to mention a very good booklet on planning appeals &mdash; a guide brought out by An Bord Pleanála.  On page four it says:</P>
    <P>Fundamental principles of natural and constitutional justice must be applied in the consideration of each case.  All parties to the matter raised must be fully and fairly heard by written representations and, where appropriate, by oral hearings.</P>
    <P>If a body does all that is required of them <Col N="835" /> under this section within a short period of time, one could say they have been given time to put up a good case.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in this amendment that the appeal would consist of a notice of appeal, a statement of the full grounds of the appeal, that the notice of the appeal would have to be submitted before the expiration of the appropriate period, but that the statement of the full grounds of the appeal could be submitted within two months of the date of the publication of the decision of the planning authority. That is the distinction and what I think is intended by this section.  What would happen if there was an appeal within the required time but a clerical error was made, a page was missing or something was left out?  It would appear from this that the appeal would not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Another question comes to mind: what would happen if the appeal was sent in but the wrong fee was included?  I suppose the present practice would apply &mdash; if there was time available they would write to the Minister to get in the correct fee.  A more complicated case would be if the chairman of a large association or An Taisce thought he was told to make the appeal, he sent in his intention of appeal, and he sent the fee but he was of the opinion that the actual grounds could be sent in later, and if, at a later stage the secretary of the same association sent in the full grounds, from what I understand, they could not be considered because, if the legislation was interpreted in a narrow way, that association had already communicated with the board and the board would not be allowed to consider that further information.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is committed to this way of doing things.  I do not want to give an inordinate length of time to an appellant, but I believe what the Minister is doing here is squeezing them to such an extent that I suspect in some cases people's constitutional rights will be impinged on and we may end up in a worse situation than we were before.  I would like the Minister to address some of these points.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. This tells how we can deal with the timescale prescribed in the Bill and also with the question of the balance of ensuring that the person who will be affected by the development in relation to a planning application, is not unfairly discriminated against by having to complete both the objection itself, starting the subject matter and giving the full contents of the grounds of the submission in relation to the appeal.  That is the crunch.  You must have literally 100 per cent in by the end of the month.  Even if the variation was that the objection could be lodged and that the substantial grounds would be entered but to say that the full grounds must be given means there cannot be any elaboration whatsoever after the specified period.  That seems to me to be tilting the balance unfairly against those lodging an appeal.  I do not think it is the Minister's intention to tilt the balance against the bodies who might be lodging it, those who would be affected by the application and so on.  That seems to me to be the effect of the way it is prescribed here.</P>
      <P>It means that effectively all the procedures have to be dealt with in a very short period and the fact that the period has been increased from three weeks to a month means that we end up with a restricted period, I wonder if it is practical or fair to insist on that time period for the totality of a submission.  However, as Senator Hederman stated there may be a constitutional problem if the procedures do not allow the appellant to make a full case within that timescale and if there is a direct obstacle to submitting other material that may have a bearing on the application at a later stage &mdash; whether it was omitted inadvertently or new information had become available as a result of further research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems reasonable that the subject matter of the appeal be stated and the substantial grounds be stated within the period of a month but if further relevant and important information comes to hand, there should be a channel whereby that could be brought into the appeal, I wonder if it would have a bearing on the European directives on environmental <Col N="837" /> impact assessment and if the free flow of information is being inhibited in terms of making a decision in the rigid timescale being demanded.  I believe that while Senator Hederman's proposal does not fully address the problem in section 4(1), nevertheless it attempts to tease out the complexities of third parties in particular trying to deal with an application that has been made for a planning decision whereby there may be substantial and complex grounds of appeal.  It may not be possible to put them all together within the tight timeframe that is given here but it would be possible to put them substantially together within that timeframe. Some flexibility in that respect would give due process and fairness to all concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not sure, and I will be guided by the Chair and the Minister, but I would like to ask a few questions regarding the provisions of making appeals.  Would it not be prudent to have somewhere in this section a subsection dealing with a clear, clean title by the person looking for planning permission? In other words, do you have to have full title to the property?  A person could claim a right-of-way across another person's property, which would have a bearing on the granting of planning permission. In this case, the planning authority in one of their conditions could put in that a fire escape be erected at the back of the house.  The only place a person could go from that fire escape would be right through somebody else's property. As time goes by if the owner of that property look for planning permission he or she could be turned down simply because of the stipulation of a fire escape. I know the Minister has answered my question with a nod but in all fairness there should be some tidying up as far as title is concerned.</P>

      <P>Section 4(1) of the Bill sets down the various requirements which must be met when an appeal is being made to An Bord Pleanála.  It provides, among other things, that an appeal must be accompanied by the full grounds of <Col N="838" /> appeal and the reasons, considerations and origins on which they are based.</P>
      <P>This amendment from Senator Hederman would represent a fundamental change to the proposed appeal requirements. It would allow a statement of appeal to be submitted within one month of the planning authority decision with full grounds of appeal to be submitted within a further month.  I do not accept that this two-step approach to the making of appeals is desirable.  Indeed, the fact that an appeal does not at present have to set out the grounds has been a significant contributory factor as regards delays in the appeals process.  I am satisfied that a requirement to submit the full grounds of appeal, when appealing is crucial for the efficient operation of the appeals process, and that the period of one month allowed in the Bill will give an appellant adequate time to prepare and submit his case to the board.</P>
      <P>In all the cases made by Senator Hederman and Senator Costello, it appears this is the first time this matter has appeared on the agenda.  This is a matter which has been subject to planning permission by the local authority for a period of two months at least and, on average, for a period greater than that.  It is not the first time we have heard about this situation.  Obviously people who are interested in the planning application at that time will have lodged objections to the county council or whatever.</P>
      <P>Already in the context of our earlier debate we decided on an objective of a four month limit for An Bord Pleanála. If we now begin the process of slowing up the appeal process into the board we will constrain the board in trying to meet that four month objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will go back to the 1983 Act. Section 17 (a) requires the person within a period specified in the notice being a period of not less than 14 days beginning on the date of the service of the notice to submit to the board a written statement of his grounds of appeal.  Why was that section put in in 1983?  After the 1976 Act people submitted their notice of appeal and it got so bad that the requirement was put on the independent authority to <Col N="839" /> write to the appellant to submit his or her grounds of appeal.  That was scarcely the way to do business.  If one is interested in making an appeal we want the appeal to be made and to submit the grounds for it all at the same time; in other words, to show that people are truly in earnest about what they are trying to achieve. The whole thrust of the Bill is to make it more practicable and to create the procedures which enable the board to do their business efficiently.  It is not fair to require the board to write to so-called appellants to send in their full grounds of appeal.  We are asking the appellant to do it.  That is very reasonable.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman asked what would happen if documents were lost or something happened?  Of course, common sense would be used about all these matters. It is not a question of absolutes if a mistake was made or something over which nobody had real control developed.  Clearly it is a case for common sense to be used.  In this instance also, we have moved from three to four weeks.  Up to now a person could lodge an appeal and he or she had 21 days to so do.  Now, we have extended that to one month and added the additional requirement to put in the full grounds for appeal at that stage.  It is all part of having a more sensible approach in a way which will enable the board to take their decisions within the time specified.  We have to stick to that.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, most people agree we should tidy up the planning appeals process.  My difficulty is that each time I try to put a legal mechanism in place to achieve that there is a corresponding amendment to slow up the process.  I know that in certain instances it will require appellants to prepare their case within a timeframe which they may not have envisaged in the past but I would remind the House that we are not at the starting process.  We are now dealing with an application which has been before the county council for at least two months.  I am looking at that county council making their decision and I am waiting for them to respond one way or another.  My attitude <Col N="840" /> is that if I had two months advance notice that there is a possibility that the local authority will refuse this application or that the council will uphold it, I have a clear two months notice to prepare my case and, at least, to think about what might arise.  If it does not arise it is no harm.  If it does I have had that preparation time.  Heaven knows, in the Ireland of today where we are trying to improve the systems we have, it should not be too great an expectation that a person who is interested in a planning application having that kind of notice would prepare the full grounds for appeal and have it dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my earlier contribution, it is in everybody's interest to have quick effective decisions which take account of all considerations.  Therefore, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment on the basis that this is very much part of the objective to enable the board to take their decisions within the prescribed four month period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather what the Minister says in the House does not have any legal standing.  I cannot produce the Minister's statements and use them as evidence that, for instance, I can send in extra information if I have made a mistake.  I understand that what is in the Bill is the relevant material.  That is what is important.  The Minister is now saying that if a mistake was made common sense would prevail but what does he mean by that?  I can only be guided by what I read in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill says that without prejudice to section 9 an appellant shall not be entitled to elaborate in writing upon or make further submissions in writing in relation to the grounds of appeal stated in the appeal or to submit further grounds of appeal and any such elaboration, submission, or further ground of appeal that is or are received by the board shall not be considered by it.  Is the Minister trying to tell me now that if a mistake is made common sense will prevail and that they will consider it?  That is in conflict with <Col N="841" /> what is here.  Which am I suppossed to heed or believe to be the true case?</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a good point &mdash; and I accept it &mdash; that by the time the appeal comes to this stage it has already been two months before the local authority and that therefore, everything is known about it.  However, I made a point earlier, which the Minister cleverly, or happily, avoided answering, that there is provision between the time a developer makes an application to the local authority and is refused for him to go to the Planning Appeals Board with different plans.  The Minister was not in the House when I said this, so I hope he will bear with me as I say it again, but I had the unfortunate experience of a planning appeal which I was very concerned about which had been refused by the local authority only on my prompting because it was in serious conflict with our development plan.  It went on appeal.</P>
    <P>The date of the oral hearing was changed three times.  I broke my holidays at considerable expense and inconvenience and arrived at the oral hearing to find that the developer had put in different plans which largely pulled the rug from under the case which I was making.  Then the case went ahead and I had to pay £15 &mdash; I mentioned this before &mdash; even to have my voice heard.  The £15 was demanded of me and I had to put my money on the table.  The inspector said it was not his fault and, of course, I understood that; these were the rules laid down.  The whole thing was starting to be quite an expensive day.</P>
    <P>I found the applicant had substituted a different set of plans, but the appeal went ahead.  Some time later I received a communication from the board to the effect that because it was to a certain extent a different case which was being put up to the board as compared to the one which was put to the local authority, the board were now scrubbing the whole thing but they did not refund me my £15 or indeed my train fare.  The whole thing was scrapped.</P>
    <P>I am trying to make the point that the Minister says we can have a case ready against the possibility of an appeal, but <Col N="842" /> the reality is that the plans can be changed and I do not think that the Minister has changed that procedure in this Bill.  It is fairly unlikely that a voluntary body would have the team of experts the Minister would have at his disposal.  It is not difficult for the Minister's Department and, if I may say so there are occasions when they are not that quick about making various decisions, although I will come to that later.  The Minister has a team of experts to get all this data ready for him.  I think the Minister has a very limited understanding of the voluntary organisations that, I understand, he is anxious to facilitate.  I do not know whether it was he or somebody else who went to Rio.  Here I have the national report on the United Nations Conference on Environment Development which is a splendid document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 20 is about the opportunities the public will have to be involved in the appeals process and the extent to which they should be included.  The quality of the environment can only be maintained and enhanced if all citizens and communities play their part.  The programme emphasises the need to intensify environmental awareness, information and promotional programmes so that people will know how, as individuals, they can act positively towards their environment.  It is all very fine for that to be said in Rio but the reality of this section is that the public will be crucified by the unreasonable sections of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister, on top of everything else, that the planning charges which are being hiked up everytime one goes to another appeal are such <Col N="843" /> that it is now virtually impossible for any organisation to make an appeal.  The Minister talks about them getting all this data so that they can be ready in the event of an appeal being made but they are so busy nowadays trying to raise funds to pay money into the Department for the planning charges that they find it very difficult to have all this information ready in the likely or unlikely event that there might be an appeal.  I ask, is the Minister being reasonable?  Has he any appreciation or understanding of what local bodies are put through that he would imagine that in addition to paying all these planning charges they could also pay people to get this data ready?  It is quite unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, and indeed the two following amendments, are very much at the centre of the problems we are facing on this side of the House and that we are seeking to solve to some degree.  We are endeavouring to get a fair balance in relation to the new timescale that is being established here. I put down amendment No. 17 to provide that the appropriate period would mean the period of one month beginning on the day of making public the decision of the planning authority as distinct from giving the decision, because there is a sort of no man's land between one and the other.  The Minister has indicated he will improve that situation with some form of uniform standardisation for the local authorities and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the appeal must state the full grounds and this is where the problem arises.  On the understanding that we will get regulations that will cover the publication of the decision that will improve the position and make it less haphazard, a person then has to lodge the appeal and the full grounds and that must be done within a month.  What I want to find out is whether the Minister <Col N="844" /> would be prepared to accept that the appeal would be lodged and that the substantial grounds would also be lodged on the understanding that other material may be introduced in error or inadvertently or may arise because it may be a complex issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister says people should be preparing their case two months in advance but that is not the way that matters are dealt with.  For example, a residents' association may or may not be well organised.  They have to hold meetings. They cannot simply make a decision overnight as to how they are going to proceed, so a third party is at a disadvantage. Of course An Taisce, who have obviously done a lot of lobbying on this issue are concerned with the matter too.  If we could change it in that fashion, there should be at least the facility whereby other material could, if necessary, be introduced at a later stage on the understanding that we would stick to the time schedule.  We do not want to depart from that; I believe we should stick to it. However, we should ensure that we do not tilt the balance against those who will be the recipients of a planning decision that may not be in their interests, and may not be one that they would wish for, and that they have the opportunity to put forward all the material that becomes available to them so long as they have made the substantial case in within the period specified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet had the opportunity to speak on this section. I will be very brief.  It is a great pity that the trend of this debate has been to oppose the Minister.  The purpose of the section is to try to put in time limits and in regard to each limit, amendments are being moved which would have the contrary effect.  Coming through in this section are objections to this and objections to that.  That is sad when it is taken for granted that there will be an appeal against virtually every development in this country.  Surely all planning applications are well and thoroughly considered by the appropriate statutory planning authority and a decision given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> I would have thought it more appropriate to consider the position not of the objector but of whoever is trying to put forward the development.  In that sense I would have some sympathy with Senator Hederman's suggestion in that a developer who is given permission with, perhaps, 37 onerous conditions attached to it, has an extremely tight time schedule in which to prepare his answer and appeal against those objections.  This is what we should be looking at.</P>
    <P>However, I would agree that we should keep the limits and put the pressure on the developer to put forward his appeal and give the grounds for it within a short period of time.  That is the way we should be looking at it instead of assuming that every development is going to have an objector which unfortunately seems to be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two points.  Once again Senator Hederman has sought to categorise me as somebody who does not understand this problem and the problems of residents' associations and others who might want to object to a development.</P>
      <P>Let us try to put it into perspective. We have already agreed in a previous section that the board will be obliged to make a decision within four months of receiving the appeal.  There is now a requirement to lodge notice of the appeal and the four months starts from that time. That is already agreed in this legislation today.  Now we are asked to allow a further month for the full grounds to be submitted.  Other parties have to be informed of those grounds and they also have a month to respond.  Assuming a couple of days elapse in the county council, we are now nine weeks into the four months.  I am supposed to be the one who does not understand the consequences of these amendments, but we are now nine weeks into the four months allowed as a result of Senator Hederman's amendment and that is confining the board to a timescale which is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also attacked because local authorities are imposing charges which make things impossible for objectors.  Let us <Col N="846" /> face facts.  The resources available to An Bord Pleanála from fees represent 20 per cent of the cost to them.  Taxpayers are, therefore paying four out of every five pounds for that system and let us not forget it.  They are not involved in the appeal but they are providing four-fifths of the costs.  It is not fair, therefore, to accuse me of not understanding this system and at the same time to talk about costs without looking at the full picture.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say to Senator Hederman, may the Lord keep any Minister from having to legislate for mistakes. Is it reasonable to expect me to take into account the kinds of mistakes some people make in an application form and enshrine them in legislation?  I said that common sense would prevail.  If a person submitted a 12 page document in an appeal and clearly page 8 and 9 were missing, of course that would be dealt with by common sense but to try to fiddle with legislation to take account of mistakes that might or might not happen would not be reasonable.  I have tried to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>This Seanad has already provided for a four months time limit starting from the lodgment of the appeal.  Any decision taken now would restrict the board to an extraordinary degree.  Amendments must relate one to the other.  We are not just taking an amendment now as if no debate had taken place this afternoon. Amendments must fit in with what we have decided already.  I am not putting up resistance for its own sake.  I think the legislation is practical and workable and I am sure that the response to people who are concerned in these areas will be to meet those requirements in the future in a new, different and more business like way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has misrepresented what I said.  I asked what would happen if a mistake was made.  I said what I understood the Bill to mean, which was that in no circumstances could additional information be sent in.  I read out the section and I am not going to read it again.  The Minister subsequently said that common sense would prevail and I <Col N="847" /> asked him to elucidate on that to tell us what he meant.  Was he saying that I was to believe what was in the Bill or to believe him, and how far would that commonsense go?  That was all I was asking.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not explained anything other than to say that if some pages were omitted that circumstance would be dealt with.  We have no way of knowing what would happen if a chairman wrote and sent in a certain amount of information and the secretary sent in the rest. If both submissions arrived by the same post would they be accepted?  If they did not arrive by the same post, would they not be accepted?  This must not happen. I do not think I am accusing the Minister of not understanding; I think he is unsympathetic to the realities a voluntary organisation has to face.  If the Minister said he was fed up with these voluntary organisations, that he wanted to get rid of these third party appellants because they were a thorn in our sides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I read from these very glossy booklets that are issued and are brought to Rio. This is the image we like to have abroad. This is what we would like to portray as the reality.  ENFO says that people must get involved, that they can make appeals and representations to An Bord Pleanála, that it is their duty if they want to help make Ireland a better place for their children and so on.  I am not going to quote all of it but that is what we are being told.  However when we try to implement what is in these booklets and make Ireland a better place for our children, when we try to provide better opportunities for our young people to get jobs here and go down the route we have been going for all these years, we know what happens.  Our record is nothing to be proud of and it is time we took a fundamental look at it to see to what extent we are militating against the future of this country by implementing legislation with <Col N="848" /> our eyes closed.  We have done it in the past and we continue to do it and these may be the worst we could do for the future and for the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should give the impression that people like myself want to impede progress.  I have made it clear from the word go that that is not the case.  I have beseeched and begged the Department and the Minister's predecessor to speed up An Bord Pleanála and to have more efficiency in the board. I have not asked that it be done at the expense of the small person whom the Minister tries to encourage to enter into the planning appeals process but makes it so difficult for them.  The local authorities impose charges because some were told to impose them and many did not do it very willingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to make out that the taxpayers are bearing the brunt of the costs of irrelevant and frivolous appeals. The reality is that the number of appeals by third parties was approximately one-fifth of all appeals lodged.  Of these the planning authority decision was confirmed in about one-quarter of the cases, modifications were made in half of the cases and the planning authority decision was reversed in the remainder.  Therefore, we are talking about a quarter of one-fifth.  In other words, in one out of 20 the board did not uphold the appeal.</P>
    <P>Were there frivolous appeals?  I am not sure.  I do not have that information.  We are talking about a very tiny percentage of the appeals where one could not say it was not perfectly reasonable for them to take the appeal because the Appeals Board upheld some aspect of them.  I do not think we should get the matter out of proportion.  It is something very small and limited and the vast bulk of appeals are solid appeals taken by people who have, as the Minister's own ENFO says, a real anxiety and a duty to make Ireland a better place for their children.</P>

    <P>You will be pleased to hear, a Chathaoirligh, that there will be no need for me to go back in any great detail over what I have said before because the same arguments apply.  In other words, if one is granted the extreme favour of an oral hearing by the board one would be able to clarify matters sent in in writing and elaborate or add to them at the hearing. That is really the nub of it.  Also, an extension of time for the appeal may be agreed between the applicant and the board.

      <P>I am afraid the purpose of this amendment is not entirely clear to me.  If the intention is that the board should accept further written submissions in oral hearing cases then this would simply add another layer to the unacceptable proliferation of submissions which the Bill seeks to avoid.  Equally, it would be inconsistent with the strict timescales proposed in the Bill if the appellant and the Board could agree to an extension of time for the appeal.  I could not, therefore, accept an amendment on this basis.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the Senator's amendment is saying that initial submissions may be clarified or elaborated on at an oral hearing, then the amendment is unnecessary because that is exactly what would happen in an oral hearing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  The relevant Planning Authority shall provide such information and technical assistance as is practical to appellants in complying with the requirements of subsection (1) (d).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister will accept this amendment.  Subsection 1 (d) is central to appeals.  It states that the full grounds and the arguments on which they are based must be given.  In other words, a totality of information must be provided when the appeal is being lodged.  Since the Minister has stated that he is very much in favour of transparency and co-operation and since there is now an extra responsibility on the appellants to provide the totality of evidence from the word go, there should be some degree of assistance to those who might require it. Many of those who are appealing could be people who lack technical information or knowledge of how to go about appealing and it would be appropriate that the <Col N="852" /> officers of the local authority would be available to co-operate with people to help them expedite matters.  That is central to it because we agreed that the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the timescale is tight, that it is streamlined and that everything is dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>However, it is not just a matter of haste.  We must also ensure quality by taking account of the full planning and environmental considerations.  We must ensure that those who are lodging the appeal are assisted in every possible way by those who have the technical knowledge and experience to assist them.  This is also in keeping with the Local Government Act, 1991 which makes provision for co-operation with citizens in matters relating to local government and the civic charter that is operational in Dublin city relating to co-operation between the local authority and the planning authority. For those reasons I would be delighted if the Minister would accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is of general application.  In other words, if an applicant has got permission to build a garage, or whatever and has had conditions imposed by the planning authority, that planning authority, if this amendment was allowed, would be obliged to give technical assistance to the applicant.  It might be an application looking for an extension.  In other words, the authority would give him assistance to appeal technically against the decision of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill requires planning authorities to make all documents relating to decisions available for public inspection.  I do not accept that it would be right in principle to require the local authorities to provide technical assistance on the basis proposed in this amendment.  The local authority is always a party to the appeal.  It would be quite wrong if one party provided technical assistance to another party, especially if the two parties were at odds.  Let us try to examine this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> The local authority, presumably, is being asked to give technical assistance to a group appealing to An Bord Pleanála against a decision that the county council have taken.  In this instance, the technical officers of the county council have a totally different view to that of their opponents and yet they are supposed to be required by law to give them technical assistance.  If Senator Costello uses his imagination he will know that I could not accept such an amendment.  By no stretch of the imagination could this be interpreted as the Minister not wanting to be open or to make documents available.</P>
    <P>There is another factor.  The local authority must devote their resources in the planning area to the job they are expected to do, which is to deal with planning applications.  The appeals procedure is to be dealt with by An Bord Pleanála.  I am extremely anxious that a greater consultative process would be developed between the local authority and the people applying for planning permission, even in advance of the original submission of the planning application. After that, interested parties can make their views known and have discussions. To enshrine a provision of this kind in law requiring the local authorities to do as suggested would clearly be unacceptable and would have very serious legal ramifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point that there would be two bodies at odds in the application and the appeal, the planning authority and the appellant.  We are asked in section 4 (1) (d) to give full grounds &mdash; not just substantial grounds &mdash; in a very short space of time and this is putting considerable pressure on individuals.  Third parties, in particular, may find themselves without the necessary expertise.  They do not have anywhere to go.  I am not talking about the planning authority making recommendations; I am talking about the procedures. The planning authority will give whatever technical information is <Col N="854" /> required to put the appeal together in a comprehensive fashion so that there is no error because there is no second shot at this.  It must be done in the first appeal. If a mistake is made it cannot be rectified. The Minister said there should be a consultative process at an early stage.  It should be more precise than that.  The local authorities should make available technical assistance as distinct from making recommendations.  Their functions should be to assist in the expediting a correct appeal within the time scale being imposed.  I am not sure whether the conflict the Minister spoke about is inherent in this amendment.  I do not think it is.  This is a different function in the procedures of making the appeal to ensure the maximum information is provided so that no mistakes are made and that it is kept within the time frame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be virtually a charter for frivolous appeals.  It means that anyone could look for the information, they are entitled to do, and they would then be able to demand that the planning authority would put together a case which was technically correct. It would mean that if anyone wished to object on any grounds, however frivolous, the planning authority would be obliged to put in an appeal.  The mind boggles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some minds boggled in 1978 when the local City Council was drawing up the 1980 development plan. To avoid confrontation in the planning area, I got together a group of 14 associations in my area to submit representations to the local authority about the development plan.  They took a very constructive approach.  We approached the local authority and asked if they would make us a grant of £100 towards the considerable costs of the report, such as the maps.  The chairman of the planning committee said it was outrageous that somebody would look for money to encourage people to make a presentation for something which might conflict with the planners' plan and the City Council plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Happily, I can say that in our local authority that sort of thinking has been relegated to where it belongs &mdash; back in the fifties or sixties.  We believe in the open approach and in encouraging people to be involved in the planning process.  Our planners give considerable help to various organisations who want to be assisted.  People reading these debates in ten, 15 or 20 years' time may be outraged by the idea that this amendment was thrown out because it would be wrong to assist such a group.  It is all a question of thinking.  I am surprised the Minister can speak in such eloquent terms of the availability of all documents for public inspections.  All the documents are in the planning authority.  We could contrast that with the earlier reply as to why we could not have the inspectors' reports.  It is quite common for a planning decision given by a local authority to be in conflict with a report from a roads engineer, a report on a sewerage scheme or whatever.  The planning committee and the manager have to take an overall view.  It is somewhat ironic that the Minister is obliging the local authorities to make all this information available for public inspection and yet he will not apply the same criteria to the inspector's report which, I believe, is information which should be available.  The annoyance caused to the disappointed party is bad enough but when they cannot even find out the reasons they become more alienated.  If the reports were available, case histories could assist future appellants in making applications that would conform with what the local authority required.  I am afraid the Minister is not being very logical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the 1963 Act public participation was something which was encouraged.  We have moved gradually and progressively further down that road and that is to be welcomed.  It is quite unfair to make a comparison between a situation where you bring 14 voluntary organisations together to try to interpret what they think would be the best planning for their area and to construe that <Col N="856" /> as being the same as a legal requirement on a local authority to provide technical assistance in a situation where they could be clearly at odds with the appellant.</P>
      <P>When planning, we are talking about a situation invariably where there are at least two sides, possibly diametrically opposed to each other in terms of what is to happen.  The Senator is asking the local authority in those circumstances to provide technical assistance to one side.  I am warning the Senator that if something like that was decided it would end up in the courts.  Some judge would have to decide very heavily against the local authority, and they had better start finding the resources to pay.  We cannot, in law, take sides or ask public officials to take sides in that way.</P>
      <P>We will take it to its logical conclusion. An Bord Pleanála make a decision. Would we expect An Bord Pleanála to provide technical assistance to somebody who was taking the board to court against the decision they took against that individual?</P>
      <P>I regret very much that Senator Hederman has again returned to the inspector's report.  She compared that to the stage at which the local authority is producing all relevant documents in relation to a decision it has taken on planning permission.  Everybody is made aware of the reasons for the decisions.  One cannot compare that to a situation of the inspector's report after which the decision is taken and where the board is not obliged to adhere strictly to what is in the inspector's report.  To make those two comparisons is regrettable and I doubt if contributions like that in the context of what we are trying to achieve here are fair.  I certainly do not regard them as so.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to demonstrate that we will have, and continue to have, a transparent system.  I said this earlier today in the context of a number of changes I have already put in place and others I am planning in the context of the consolidation of the regulations in public notices and a variety of other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to Senators to produce from anywhere in Europe today an appeals system or a planning system that is more open, <Col N="857" /> more equitable, or more balanced.  When you have done that I will begin to listen more closely.</P>

They are that the appellant shall have a full case stated at the same time as he is making the appeal.  We are talking about ensuring that the requirements are complied with.  It is not to engage in conflict regarding the position of the planning authority or the appellant. They may be quite different.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the appellant is in a position to comply with the law.  The Minister's reply departed from that.  He has gone into what may be the substance of the appeal where a real conflict could arise. I am not trying to raise that matter.  I want to go through the technical process and the procedures that have to be followed, and to ensure that section 4 (1) (d) is fully complied with.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 45 and 46, and in page 8, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>This amendment is in the same vein as the last few amendments we have been discussing.  It is proposed to delete subsection (3) of section 4, where it states that without prejudice to section 9 an appellant shall not be entitled to elaborate in writing upon or make further submission in writing in relation to the grounds of an appeal.  The other amendments relate in a similar fashion to elaborating on an appeal.</P>
      <P>We have dwelt on this and I do not want to go through the arguments we made before.  This is putting pressure on the appellant to ensure that everything is complied with in the one submission that is made at the initial stage.  It is not leaving the way open at all to elaborate any further in writing, whatever about orally, if an oral appeal is allowed.  It is restrictive in relation to how an appellant can deal with presenting an appeal.  I would be quite happy to see the subject matter of the appeal being stated and the substantial submission all put together at the same time.  The way should still be left open for matters that might arise for whatever reason, particularly because of the complex nature of appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals and planning applications will get more complex as time goes on, because there are more factors involved. There is the environmental factor and greater citizen awareness in relation to developments that are taking place.  We should not restrict the appellant to just the one attempt at this initial stage.  I do not want to open it up to all sorts of further submissions being made, but it should be possible to present information that might not be available initially or some matter that was inadvertently omitted. This would introduce an extra element of fairness to the procedures and would make sure there was no question <Col N="859" /> of unconstitutionality because we would have adopted fair procedures where all relevant information could be presented. We would also be acting in accordance with the European directive in relation to environmental impact assessments.</P>
    <P>The Minister might give a sympathetic hearing to this amendment.  It is tilting the balance a little in favour of the appellant. We should deal with the appellant's position with more consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add that has not been said already in response to other amendments.  This amendment sets out to cut into the principle of the Bill.  I said earlier that we do not want a host of separate submissions to return us to the position we are in at the moment, because this delays the board in making decisions and would make it impossible to adhere to decisions which have already been taken in the Seanad earlier this afternoon.</P>
      <P>It is not unfair to participants in appeals because section 9 will establish a mechanism whereby a participant can be allowed a further opportunity to comment where the board considers it is appropriate or in the interest of justice to do so.  I would ask Senator Costello to bear in mind that this amendment, and related amendments, if passed, would lead to only one logical consequence &mdash; the board would not be able to take the decisions and meet the objectives we have set for them if a situation were allowed to develop where appallants could continually submit new submissions in relation to their appeals.</P>
      <P>We have tried to move away from the experience we have had up to now, where we have reached the illogical position that the board is required by statute to write to the appellant requesting submission of appeals.  We had to go that distance to require people who had already submitted a notice of appeal to submit the full grounds.  Why was that necessary?  It was necessary because of the delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are moving a stage further now. We are requiring the appellant to submit <Col N="860" /> the full grounds of appeal, the notice of appeal and the request for the oral hearing at one stage.  We are giving an extra week, in terms of previous experience, to enable them to do that.  That is as far as we can go.  This amendment, in tandem with others, totally frustrates and cuts across the ability of the board to proceed in the way we are now proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for clarification.  He told us earlier that common sense would prevail if a mistake was made.  I asked him to expand how far that could go.  When there is contentious appeal between a third party developer and a third party in the planning authority it does not matter which side the local authority is on.  This is probably exacerbated when the local authority is on the same side as the developer.  The developer may make inaccurate, false and misleading allegations or he may make claims which are incorrect.  A relatively simple example would be where he says he wants to convert premises into offices while, for the last number of years, they have been used, illegally as such.  They send that information in towards the end of the period in which third parties are allowed to make representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the power of the board to request submissions or observations.  How will the board know that information is inaccurate or misleading? Sadly, the third party or An Taisce may have no way of even alerting the board to this situation because they have been penalised to such an extent that they are not even allowed to bring such information to the board's attention. The board is actually forbidden to consider any letter or representation which might be made.  Am I mistaken in saying that, before this Bill comes into force, the board has the power to dismiss an appeal if the appellant refuses to send in the grounds?  The Minister is nodding his head very carefully, telling me that that is the case.  I do not see why he is making such heavy play of the fact that the board has to write to these people if they do not send in the grounds of their <Col N="861" /> appeal.  The board can either dismiss the appeal or decide it in the absence of that information.  That, in itself means that the board has a method of dealing with an appellant who is being dilatory about sending in their grounds of appeal.</P>

      <P>Under the 1983 Act the board was obliged to request the appellants to submit the full grounds of appeal. It seemed totally illogical to me, if somebody was interested in making an appeal, that the requirement was on the board to request them to submit the full grounds. That was the point I was making.  We are moving away from that.  Both Senator Costello and Senator Hederman seem to take the view that the new situation is loaded against somebody who wants to appeal against the planning permission.</P>
      <P>Everything is on the table.  Section 9 comes into force where the developer has made some changes or in certain types of situations, and the appellant could not have been aware then or did not have an opportunity to learn about them.  In that case the board would be obliged in normal justice to give the appellant a further opportunity to address these questions.  That is why this section is there.  In the normal way, the developer's proposals are available to the appellant so that he can make a judgment on them. It is a much more open and better way than we have at the moment, where you have a person capable of submitting at any stage within a week of the board taking a final decision.  There could be another submission.  This is a far better system.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the recent indications of change in Government policy and its adoption of a liberal agenda; and, in this regard, seeks the immediate passage of a modern family planning Bill, a referendum on divorce before 31 December 1992 and immediate compliance with the 1988 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Norris case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion specifically calls attention to the Government's failure to implement a liberal agenda.  I had originally hoped the Government would accept this motion in the light of some liberal noises which had been coming from Ministers and Members on the Government side <Col N="863" /> but, as a result of the Government's amendment, I am afraid the Government have revealed themselves once again to have no interest whatsoever in a liberal agenda.  At this stage I am, as are many Members of this House and many members of the public, very tired of hearing promises from the Government on the issues mentioned in this motion and absolutely no delivery &mdash; lots of promises but no action, much delay and no delivery. I am glad to see the Minister for Justice here to counter that statement later on in his speech.</P>
    <P>I understand also the political difficulties which the Government obviously face on issues of this sort.  It is quite obvious there are Members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and members of the public who do not agree with the proposals in this motion.  The Government are here to govern and should show leadership but the issues mentioned here, the issues which I shall mention one by one, the Government have failed to show any leadership.  They have done quite the opposite.  They have gone into reverse gear and shied away from these issues. The liberal agenda is about a pluralist, non-denominational, a non-discriminatory society.  It is about equality of people under the law and the laws of the country not in any way reflecting the ethos of one particular church.</P>
    <P>One of the great disappointments, indeed the principal disappointment, with regard to the attitude of the Government to the issues mentioned in this motion and to others is that they have continually had to be dictated to by external forces.  I refer specifically to the courts.  It is not the first time in the history of this country that the courts have made the law of this country by giving interpretations which were relevant to the law or by dictating to the Government what they would have to do or by making decisions which forced the Government to change the law.</P>
    <P>Let us take the issue of family planning. The new Family Planning Bill was published and the Government gave a strong reaction to that matter after the <Col N="864" /> Virgin Megastore incident last year. However the Virgin Megastore incident which forced the Government to react and to publish a new Family Planning Bill; it was not a spontaneous move by the Government at the time.  It was a different regime at the time, but it was a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government; it was the same complexion.</P>
    <P>In the Norris case before the European Court it was not the Government of this country which took the initiative on decriminalising homosexuality.  It was a Senator who took the case, but it was the European Court of Human Rights which ordered the Government to take action as a result of discrimination by us in that case.  Once again, it was external factors and external institutions who had to put us back on course because we would not do the right thing ourselves.</P>
    <P>Again, on the issue of abortion, only a few weeks ago it was the Supreme Court who interpreted that appalling insertion to the Constitution in 1983 in a way which again exposes our attitude to the liberal agenda as being utterly and totally hypocritical; but also once again it was the Supreme Court which forced the Government to take action rather than the Government taking spontaneous action themselves.</P>
    <P>The last item is the issue of divorce. The Government have not yet been ordered, forced or put under pressure from outside to take action on divorce; but nothing has been done about divorce, no initiative has been taken and there is no sign of any initiative.  Perhaps the Minister is going to give us a pledge this evening about a referendum on divorce. Even when the courts have given directions to the Government about these issues or have put the Government in a situation which is morally not tenable, the Government have continually refused to react or to take progressive measures.</P>
    <P>I will refer first to the Family Planning Bill.  That Bill has been the first item on the Dáil Order Paper for a year to a year and a half.  For some extraordinary reason, having been drafted and published <Col N="865" /> it has languished on the Dáil Order Paper for that length of time.  The reason, I suggest, is that action on it, was paralysed by the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party at a party meeting and no Minister has had the courage or certainly has not been given the go ahead to bring it through the Dáil since then.  Other legislation has leapfrogged it and this one shows no sign of seeing the light of day.</P>
    <P>The contortions into which the Government got themselves on this Bill on the issue of age and of the distribution of condoms are quite ridiculous.  That is why I refer in this motion to a modern Family Planning Bill, because in modern terms the youth of this country is laughing at the politicians who cannot possibly cope with an issue like condoms and family planning.  The youth cannot believe that the Fianna Fáil Party and other parties get themselves in such a knot about an issue which is so obvious and yet so trivial in terms of what really matters for this country.  I believe that age is irrelevant in these terms.  The idea of distributing condoms through the health boards is ridiculous and I look forward to this extraordinary Bill, which presumably was the brain child of the last Taoiseach, being discarded.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record that I believe that Deputy O'Connell, Minister for Health, has the making and the possibility of being a great Minister for Health. He has a great imagination and a great commitment but he may have very great difficulties in delivering what he wants to deliver through the party of which he is a member.  I believe that is the problem we are confronted with at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk very briefly on the issue of divorce.  I do not know why we need a White Paper on divorce.  I do not know why we need major discussion on divorce.  I would have thought it was quite obvious that we first need enabling legislation on divorce, as promised by this Government.  But where is it?  It has not been produced.  It has gone on the back-burner with every single other item contained in this liberal agenda.</P>
    <P>Let me now come to the Norris case. It was announced in a blaze of glory in <Col N="866" /> this House &mdash; I forget how long ago, but Senator Norris would be able to tell me &mdash; that the legislation would be repealed, I think, by the end of 1990.  That was announced by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, in this House. That promise has been reneged on and it is inexcusable that it has been reneged on.</P>
    <P>Numerous questions have been asked in this House about that measure and about our response to the fact that the European Court of Human Rights found us to be discriminating against homosexuals but nothing has been done.  It has been deferred, we have been given vague promises; but because of vague noises offstage from the backwoodsmen in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, the Government unfortunately have refused to bring forward any such legislation. Indeed, there are indications that it will not be coming before this House in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>We are, in fact, defying the Court.  We are in contempt of the European Court of Human Rights and we are not doing anything about it.  It is, I suppose, a little sickening to see us championing so loudly the rights of the underprivileged and human rights overseas when we apparently cannot implement standards which the European Court of Human Rights have suggested we should implement.  I presume we are running the danger of being summarily kicked out of the Council of Europe at some stage if we continue to refuse to implement this measure.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to imagine how we can possible deal with a referendum on abortion in November if we get into such appalling difficulty on far less trivial issues like the age for condom distribution and the distribution of condoms. I believe that will be a particularly challenging difficulty for the Government in November or later.  I have no faith whatever that they will be able to show the leadership to stand up to the pressures which they will undoubtedly feel from the so-called pro-life lobby, the anti-abortion lobby, if they cannot even take the necessary measures on less controversial issues. <Col N="867" /> I should mention, too, the fact that I have great disappointment, and I believe many people in this party and on this side of the House had great disappointment, that the Progressive Democrats, who are the great liberal conscience of this Government, have not been able to have any input into the liberal agenda for this Government.  The Progressive Democrats are, I think, in favour and they are on record as being in favour of far more liberal social legislation in this area, but for some reason they have allowed their colleagues in Government to baulk time and time again at these measures.</P>
    <P>I think the Government amendment tonight says it all.  The Government amendment is, I suppose, one of the most bland pieces of prose I have ever seen come before this House.  It uses extremely long words which mean nothing like &ldquo;comprehensive programme of legislative reform&rdquo;, words like &ldquo;formulation&rdquo; and it refuses even to mention what Fianna Fáil regard as taboo words. It refuses to mention family planning, divorce and homosexuality.  It refers to them in that rather copy, cosy way as complex social issues.  They are a lot more than complex social issues.  They are symbolic.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons family planning is so important is because a more liberal Family Planning Bill would do an enormous amount to reduce the number of AIDS cases in this country.  The reason divorce is so important is because married couples are living in misery and nobody seems to care.  The reason the homosexuality issue is important is because our law criminalises those who practice homosexuality in private.  Yet the Government and I assume the Progressive Democrats &mdash; but maybe not, because the amendment is only in the name of Senator Wright so I do not know whom it actually includes &mdash; have put down a wording which actually refuses to even mention those thorny subjects.  That is symptomatic of their attitude.  What I would like to see is a commitment, but a commitment that will be kept by the Minister &mdash; not like the last commitment, <Col N="868" /> not like the commitment on the Norris case, the commitment on divorce, the numerous commitments on family planning &mdash; to implement the terms of this motion, to implement them immediately or certainly before the end of 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion I welcome the indications of change in Government policy in pursuing a liberal agenda.  We in Fine Gael obviously wish the Government would respond immediately, because the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, on his election promised legislation on divorce during the lifetime of this Government.  Granted other issues emerged during the year which he did not anticipate, the unfortunate case of the 14-year old rape victim, the subsequent Supreme Court judgment and the importance of the Maastricht referendum. However, if we were to go back to the first point in our motion, the family planning Bill, looking at the Government wording in the amendment &mdash; and I cannot understand why it is being moved &mdash; it mentions the words &ldquo;effective pursuit&rdquo;. To my mind the rest of the runners have long since reached home and I just wonder at the interpretation of these words &ldquo;effective pursuit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back to the Seanad and how we have dealt with the issue of family planning, I was looking through the files and I find that we debated family planning services here in March 1991. Regarding family planning legislation, we welcomed at the time the Health and Family Planning (Amendment) Bill, 1991, which was intended to amend and extend the 1979 Act and to amend section 65 of the Health Act, 1974.  The new family planning Bill appeared and was published and it will be celebrating its first anniversary on 30 June, but it has yet to be presented to the Dáil for debate, let alone in the Seanad.  No wonder there is frustration among the Members here at the snail-like pace of certain types of social legislation which causes us once again to have to resort to Private Members' time to debate important issues which should have been got out of the way a long time ago if the Government <Col N="869" /> had the commitment and honesty to face up to life in Ireland in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that a member state of the EC that has been the first to ratify the European Union Treaty has been so tardy in relation to social legislation.  The lack of Government action in following through the publication of the Bill speaks for itself because any time there is even a whimper from the electorate there is procrastination.  Any adverse reaction causes procrastination.  In the family planning Bill the condoms issue dominated. As a public representative I had no representation from any young person about the issue, and surely it concerns young people.  At what age should condoms be made available?  There is absolute mayhem within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party regarding the age, the vending machine issue, the premises and, of course, what I would regard as the cynical attitude in delegating the matter to the health boards.  As a member of a local authority I know the Department of the Environment always delegate to us work which it does not wish to do itself.  The health boards are being asked to establish and maintain a register of premises and I do not blame those for their lack of appetite in responding to that shirked responsibility.  Looking through the newspapers, many Fianna Fáil councillors objected very strongly to the 166 Deputies, and I do not think it should be the 166 Deputies but the number of Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators who had not the appetite to address this issue.</P>
    <P>No wonder we have had to put down this motion, because what happens is that the general public become cynical. Young people deal with their affairs in their own way; they make their own decisions.  They take on board the values of their parents and they can clearly separate Church and State when it comes to moral issues.</P>
    <P>I would make the point that the alarming numbers of young women, recorded and unrecorded, going for abortions is a direct link with the lack of family planning legislation.  While women have to bear the brunt, the guilt, the social <Col N="870" /> isolation, there is never a question of the identity of the 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000 men who obviously had a part in the outcome of sexual activity between them and the young girls who were forced to seek abortions.</P>
    <P>Why should it be the young girls of Ireland who have to take precautions because her partner wants sexual intercourse? Does she have to ask if he has a condom?  Does he tell her to get lost because she did not take the pill or any other precautions?  We must face up to the connection between the two issues.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a subject that should be addressed, first, within the schools where we should have proper sex education.  It does not have to be teachers and pupils only; it can be a joint relationship between parents and teachers, as happened in my own school where there was co-operation.  Second, there has to be a shared responsibility and experience of parents, young people and teachers.</P>
    <P>We would not see these young desperate, distraught, anguished, frightened young women if we did what the Dutch do.  They have legal abortions but they have the lowest abortion rate.  Why? Because it is compulsory for the 12 to 15 year olds in post-primary schools to study a curriculum course relating to parenting and childcare.  Do we have anything like that?  No, we refuse to take the issue on board.  We push it aside and hope things will be right on the night and they are never right on the night as we saw in the sad case which led to the abortion being raised.  Let us forget the humbug and get down to the brass tacks.  Let us have our family planning Bill now, and let us give leadership as we should as politicians.</P>
    <P>Looking to the area of divorce, and as one who campaigned during the divorce referendum, I can accept that it was blurred by the poverty issue.  It is not a question of saying that we will have divorce legislation tomorow, there are many things to be considered before we go ahead.  There has been nothing from the Government to smooth the path.  For instance, during the Coalition Government, there was an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown.  It is <Col N="871" /> very interesting that Deputy W. O'Brien from West Limerick handled it exceptionally well.  He was a rural Deputy.  I remembered him talking about the learning experience it was for him.  We do not have such a committee at the moment.</P>
    <P>The status of illegitimacy was abolished. These were all preparatory steps towards the divorce referendum.  We had the excellent work of Deputy Shatter, but then the issue of property emerged; and all I can say is, what has to be done now.  I am glad Minister Flynn is here because we have to look at legislation on joint ownership of the family home before we begin to look at divorce legislation. That was promised last Christmas.</P>
    <P>I have attended seminars and debates and I have listened to women who were agonising over this topic.  I remember our former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, stating, when it was one of the interim recommendations from the Second Commission for the Status of Women that there was no problem.  On 25 April 1991 he said &ldquo;Yes, there is no problem.  We will have immediate action regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court case which is going on at this time&rdquo;.  He said he was supporting fifty-fifty ownership of the family home, but nothing has happened. No wonder we are cynical.  I am asking that we have these issues addressed immediately in preparation for the divorce referendum.  We do not want them afterwards, so let us have them now.  That is something Minister Flynn can respond to positively and give us a date even when he is addressing us.</P>
    <P>The last point relates to Senator Norris.  Since I came into the Seanad, Senator Norris has had to stand up on the Order of Business on many days asking what I consider to be a basic right, that is, that we comply immediately with the 1988 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  It is ironic that in the fifties Ireland was one of the first signatories of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The implementation of the legislation of the judgment is no big deal.  I regard one's sexual life <Col N="872" /> as part of one's private life, which was the basis of the judgment; but the European Court of Human Rights recognised that it is for Ireland to take the necessary measures in its domestic legal system to ensure performance of its obligations.  As Senator Ross said, nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Two other decisions of the European Commission handed down in the seventies would help us.  They state that member states have a margin of discretion in setting the age of consent for sexual activities.  There is a reference to European developments which emphasise tolerance and understanding, and goodness knows we can be very short of tolerance and understanding.</P>
    <P>I would go along with that and I hope I am living in a democracy which stands for equality of treatment.  I also hope there would be equality of treatment in jobs, accommodation, life assurance and medical care where there is discrimination against gays and lesbians. Why can we not debate the issue which has been raised many times by Senator Norris and not just in Private Members' Time?  As Senator Ross said tonight &mdash; and I am backing him up &mdash; we create controversy by not addressing social legislation.</P>
    <P>We have other burning issues &mdash; unemployment and economic health issues.  If we respect our young people we have to deal with the social issues now so that we can deal with the main areas of concern for our electorate.  I cannot blame them for being cynical if we do not go ahead with our motion tonight and address the three points that have been raised by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity this evening to tell the Seanad about some aspects of the wide ranging programme of legislative reform which I have under way in my Department at present.  Before going into some detail about specific aspects of that programme, there are a few preliminary points of a general nature which I think are worth making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is that when dealing with areas <Col N="873" /> of social policy, which go to the heart of how we as a society organise ourselves, the process of formulating legislative proposals which are likely to prove worthwhile in practice and gain a large measure of public support, inevitably takes time. I appreciate that this can lead from time to time to frustration on all our parts, but the reality is that pushing forward proposals which have not been rigorously considered in all their aspects inevitably carries with it the danger of putting onto our Statute Book laws which are bad, with ultimately adverse consequences for the community.</P>
    <P>In making this point I am not, of course, to be taken as suggesting that there will be any avoidable delay in bringing the wide range of legislative proposals being formulated at present in my Department to fruition; I am simply seeking to highlight the reality that the process of devising sound legislative proposals to deal with complex social issues is, as Members of this House undoubtedly will appreciate, a painstaking and time consuming process in which quick fix solutions have no part.</P>
    <P>There is also the related point, to which I will return later, that in attempting to advance effectively any legislative programme decisions have to be made about the priority to be given to the various legislative proposals within that programme. Those decisions are not easy and they inevitably involve balancing competing claims in relation to what measures should be concentrated on in the short, medium and longer terms. Obviously different people will have different views on the relative priorities to attach to individual legislative measures but I can assure the House that the Government keep this matter under constant review in an effort to ensure that their comprehensive programme of legislative reform is pursued as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would like to make before going on to deal with specific aspects of my legislative programme.  The Private Members' motion refers to the adoption of a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; agenda and goes on to refer to three specific issues, two of <Col N="874" /> which fall within my area of responsibility and one which is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I have to say that I do not regard it as especially helpful or constructive to affix a label of &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; or any other vague label of that kind in relation to particular areas of social policy.  What the Government are about is devising what they consider appropriate responses to complex social issues each of which has to be assessed on its own terms and which can give rise to widely differing considerations.  The pointlessness of applying such labels in these circumstances can easily be seen from the fact that an individual might support any one of the three measures mentioned in the motion without implying support for either or both of the others.</P>
    <P>I note that the amendment to the motion in the name of Senator Wright which, I support, refers to the Government's comprehensive programme of legislative reform.  I believe that the comprehensiveness of that programme can be seen from the fact that in my area of responsibility alone there are close to 20 Bills in the course of preparation.  That is aside altogether from the various Bills which are before the Oireachtas at present, which include measures in relation to criminal evidence, the interception of postal packets and telecommunication messages and the regulation of the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>Obviously it would not be practical for me tonight to go into detail about all the legislative proposals which I have but in the context of what I had to say earlier about the establishment of priorities it might be helpful if I were to give some examples of measures which I am determined to bring to fruition in the relatively short term.</P>
    <P>A measure to which I think all Members of this House will join with me in ascribing a particular importance is the proposed Confiscation of Criminal Proceeds Bill.  The Bill, which will be a very detailed and comprehensive measure, is in the course of being drafted as a matter of priority and will be introduced by me in the near future.  It will <Col N="875" /> represent a major addition to our corpus of criminal law and it will, among other things, provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime and the creation of an offence of money laundering.</P>
    <P>While I know the emphasis of tonight's debate has not been on the criminal side, I think it is a fair point to make that legislation designed to prevent criminals living off the backs of the victims of crime is truly social in nature.  In determining priorities in relation to the formulation of proposals in relation to complex social issues, we have to have particular regard to the basic right of people to live their lives in peace and the dreadful effect which the activities of criminals can have on the quality of life in our society generally.</P>
    <P>Among the other measures to which I attach priority for reasons which I think will be obvious are the following: A Family Home Bill to give each spouse equal rights of ownership in the family home and contents.  I will refer to this again when I come to deal with the part of the motion referring to divorce; a Criminal Law Bill which will abolish the offence of suicide and abolish the categorisation of offences as felonies and misdemeanours which complicates the criminal law unnecessarily; a Criminal Procedure Bill which will deal with the recommendations of the Martin Committee; a Juvenile Justice Bill to repeal the Children Act, 1908 and replace it with a modern Bill; a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will bring about savings in costs and in Garda time through changes in procedure on criminal cases.  It will also revise the law in relation to certain public order offences, as I have referred to on previous occasions, most notably in the area of unruly and more serious mis-behaviour by wandering gangs in our cities and towns.  This Bill also contains provisions in relation to control over outdoor concerts and it will bring in a new licensing system for these events.</P>
    <P>That list is not intended to be exhaustive but simply as indicative of some of <Col N="876" /> the areas of legislative reform which I think most people would agree deserve priority.</P>
    <P>It might also be of interest to the House for me to mention two additional matters which, although not contained in the Government's programme as published, nevertheless will receive attention within the period of the programme.  The first concerns the law on occupiers' liability where modern statutory rules are clearly needed in relation to the duty of care owed by owners/occupiers of property to all types of entrants onto their property. The matter is with the Law Reform Commission at the moment for examination and report.  The Government have promised action within the lifetime of the programme.</P>
    <P>The second matter does not involve the preparation of legislation just yet but it is an extremely important development to protect our national interest in the area of financial services and investments as well as those of the public at large.  I have recently established an advisory committee on fraud under the chairmanship of an eminent senior counsel.  The membership of the committee is drawn from a wide spectrum of interests and it is charged with the carrying out of an urgent review of all aspects of the law on, and the system of investigation and prosecution of, serious fraud in this jurisdiction and to make recommendations accordingly.  I expect to have the com-mittee's report by Christmas of this year. This development reflects the Government's concern that the legal, technical and organisational responses to the development of so-called &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; crime should be swift and effective.</P>
    <P>Naturally, with such an important workload concentrated in one Department, decisions have to be made as regards priorities, having regard to the staffing resources that are available.  This is why, for example, the proposed Bill on homosexual law reform has had to be put back to a stage later than we would like. The Government accept that our law will have to be changed to conform with the decision of the European Court in this matter.  The legislative programme <Col N="877" /> makes that clear but we are constrained by other factors such as available staff resources and the need to put other reforms through the Oireachtas first.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the referendum on divorce to be held before the end of the year.  It is in this context that I am pleased to be able to confirm to the House that a White Paper on marital breakdown is in the final stages of preparation and will be published shortly by the Government.  No doubt there will be an opportunity to discuss in this House the contents of the White Paper and I very much look forward to that.  In those circumstances I do not believe it would be either appropriate or useful for me at this stage to anticipate the detailed contents of the White Paper.  I can say, however, that the White Paper will take a comprehensive approach to the matter of marital breakdown and all avenues of legal redress open to those whose marriages have broken down.</P>
    <P>I know that some disappointment has been expressed that it has not proved possible to publish the White Paper more quickly but I can give the assurance that this arises not from any unwillingness on the part of the Government to deal with the myriad of issues involved but rather from the Government's determination that those issues be tackled comprehensively and effectively.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the issues which arise in endeavouring to determine the most appropriate responses to marital breakdown are clearly wide-ranging and complex.  Inevitably they are matters which can give rise to strongly held and often opposing views.  It is the Government's intention that the publication of the White Paper should give rise to a wide-ranging and informed public debate on what further measures might usefully be taken in this area.  While obviously it would not be right to allow an open-ended public debate to stand in the way of bringing proposals to fruition, the imposition of artificial deadlines would not be likely to prove helpful and, indeed, could be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that the Government <Col N="878" /> regard as essential to their approach in this area the enactment of legislation to give each spouse equal rights of ownership in the family home.  Drafting of the Family Home Bill is at an advanced stage and it will be published as quickly as possible.  In all the circumstances I ask the proposers of the motion to reflect on whether pressing the motion in relation to a referendum on divorce taking place before the end of the year would really be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I hope in what I have had to say this evening I have given the House some broad indications of what is happening with the comprehensive programme of legislation and legislative reform for which I have responsibility.  As I said earlier, I accept that different people would assign different priorities to individual elements of the programme.  I am sorry it is clearly not possible to accommodate everyone's wishes in that regard. However, I am sure I can look forward to the continued co-operation of the Seanad in implementing as effectively as possible the wide range of legislative proposals which will be emerging over the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline Government policy on family planning services.  I would also like to give some indication of future developments which the Government propose to take in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at present a well established family planning service made possible through the Health (Family Planning) Acts which have provided the framework for the development of the services over the past 13 years.  This framework has been relatively successful towards ensuring that advice on family planning is available widely, mainly from general practitioners and family planning organisation. However, this is not to say that we can be complacent.  Apart from some minor amendments in 1985 the Act has remained unchanged now for 13 years and this Government are committed to an overhaul of the family planning services <Col N="879" /> through appropriate legislative changes in this area.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government published a Bill to amend the existing legislation.  In summary, the purpose of this Bill was threefold.  First, it provided for an increase in the range of outlets permitted to sell condoms and certain spermicidal preparations.  Second, it reduced the age limit at which persons may buy condoms and certain spermicides, without prescription, from 18 years to 17 years. Third, it removed the anomaly whereby pharmacies which were limited companies were legally prohibited from selling contraceptives.  Another feature in the Bill was that it provided that the definition of contraceptive be amended to refer to non-medical contraceptives and spermicidal preparations only.  Oral contraceptives &mdash; such as the contraceptive pill &mdash; would not be covered by the definition.  Instead, they would be controlled as medical preparations and would continue to be subject to the rigid and necessary controls of our legislation on the licensing of medicinal preparations.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have reviewed the implications of the Bill in the context of the continuing problem of sexually transmissible diseases and the growing problem presented by the spread of the HIV virus.  In these contexts, the number of sexually transmissible diseases notified to the Department of Health under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1987, is increasing.  In 1986, a total of 2,891 cases of sexually transmissible diseases were notified compared to 4,189 in 1990.  I would say there is serious under-reporting of these sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the prevalence of HIV continues to increase and the indications from the Department's current HIV surveillance system are that the virus is now being transmitted in the community outside the so-called groups considered originally to be at particular risk of contracting the infection.</P>
    <P>The epidemiological development of AIDS and HIV infection in Ireland is <Col N="880" /> similar to that experienced in other western European countries.  From 1981 to 1985 cases were reported in homosexuals and haemophiliacs and the condition was seen as a largely imported disease.  When sero-prevalence monitoring became possible in 1985 it was apparent that the HIV virus was indigenous in this country and that a particular problem existed in relation to the spread of HIV infection in IV drug abusers.</P>
    <P>To date, we have 276 cases of AIDS reported which meet the CDC/WHO' definition; some 1,214 people have tested HIV positive.  In common with other countries in the EC the spread of transmission in homosexuals is slowing down. This is presumably due to changes in the life style of homosexuals in the mid 1980s. The percentage of IV drug related cases is now 40 per cent of all cases compared to 10.5 per cent in 1986.  This movement of the epidemic towards the drug abuser has led to a steady increase in the number of heterosexual cases.  The figures for heterosexual cases show a rise form 6.6 per cent in 1986 to 9.4 per cent in 1989 in the EC countries.  Nine per cent of Irish cases are heterosexual.  In 1986 we had no heterosexual case in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An added element of risk related to the spread of HIV in the heterosexual population is the danger of transmission of the virus from a pregnant woman across the placenta to the developing baby.  This may result in the birth of babies already infected with the HIV virus with the attendant risk of developing full blown AIDS and ultimately early death.  So far nine babies born to infected mothers have developed AIDs and six have tragically died.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House, therefore, that I consider the adoption of an amendment to the Act to be a major priority in the fight against AIDS and other sexually transmissible diseases and I will be bringing forward proposals to Government very shortly, to make condoms more freely available in the fight against AIDS. It must be recognised that condoms have a role to play in the protection of public health against AIDS/HIV and sexually transmissible diseases.  It is accepted, <Col N="881" /> therefore, that condoms must be more accessible if we are to respond adequately to this growing public health problem and I can assure the House that I will be impressing on the Government the need to take immediate action towards this end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that my summer suit conforms to the sartorial standards apparently required by the House.  If you think it is too gay, I will be glad to take it off.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to support the motion. It gives me an opportunity to affirm once more my secular credentials which may have been clouded over by my recent involuntary association in a large bed in which I was quite uncomfortable, but on the edge of which I managed to perch for the last several months.  I am now, however, sleeping in very distinct quarters.</P>
      <P>I recognise the good intentions of Fine Gael.  They are in some trouble obviously.  Senator McMahon caused some fluttering when he announced at the outset that his name should not have been on the Order Paper and he quickly declared his conscientious abstention.  I also notice that Senator Kennedy's name is not appended to the motion.  I take it this means he got to the movers of the motion in time and decided he could not support the pressure from the liberal agenda.  It is a fair inference that the notable non-mention of abortion in the motion, the coy omission of the most pressing question of the hour, from the liberal agenda is due to the fact that the list of names we have at present on the motion would not have been that complete if abortion had been included.</P>
      <P>Fair play to Fine Gael for putting down this motion.  They have come a long way from the days when their own Taoiseach voted against a family planning Bill. Their secular credentials, even though they might not call them that, are above suspicion at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Ross, I thought the amendment in the name of Senator Wright was the ultimate in bland and evasive jargon, good for a laugh, which <Col N="882" /> we all need at this time.  I thought the speech by the Minister for Justice was not a great deal better in its evasiveness and the way it went into quite frivolous diversions about legislation which obviously had nothing to do with what was intended in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome &mdash; and it was only what I expected &mdash; the Minister for Health's welcome and very sensible news of his own purposes in wishing to promote a greater availability of condoms.  I hope he is successful in the Cabinet.  He must know he has wide public support.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion is timely because it reminds us that Fianna Fáil are not to be trusted on their own with a liberal agenda, no matter what promises they have given.  The Progressive Democrats position is somewhat ambivalent.  It seems to me in this Chamber, sometimes they are in Opposition and sometimes they are in Government &mdash; when it suits them.  No one can deny that they have performed a valuable role in these last years but that role seems to have run out of steam.  The dog wagging capacity of the Progressive Democrats tail seems now to be in question.  That is why it requires other parties to put the pressure on.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil cannot be trusted simply because their cynicism and their exploitation of socio-sexual issues in the party interests has been demonstrated again and again in the 1980s particularly at the time of the divorce referendum in 1986. I would like to see all party co-operation on this matter.  All party co-operation which was forthcoming, regrettably in my view, during the debate on the Maastricht Treaty should be resumed in these matters. There should be a common front where socio-sexual reform is concerned because the opposition is very formidible. We are seeing already the mobilisation of the forces of social reaction for the autumn showdown.</P>
    <P>When the time comes, I will make my own views unequivocally known about the fanaticism and hypocrisy of the anti-choice people.  They are a force to be reckoned with in alliance with one of the oldest conservative establishments, the <Col N="883" /> Roman Catholic church.  It will require all-party mobilisation to face that particular combination and we should lay it on the line.  Senator Ross talked about the need for a multi-denominational society and a pluralist society.  We are talking about the need for a secular State to stand four square and declare that the laws must be distinct from any denominational code, free church in a free State. I am including the other churches as well. To me it smacks of double-think to talk about the need to recognise the special liberal ethos of the Adelaide Hospital when we are actually talking about secular standards in public hospitals, publicly funded.  I would give no recognition publicly to the ethos of particular churches. That is for them to preach to their individual members in a free society &mdash; free churches in a free State.  They are my views and the views which should be adopted by all the parties in this State if they are to pursue successfully these aims.</P>
    <P>What is this motion looking for?  It is looking for civil rights which are the norm in western society.  It is unbelievable that we should be agonising at this stage, after tearing ourselves apart in various ways and about to do so again, about whether 17 or 18 is the age to make access to condoms available.  It is unbelievable that we use such euphemisms as the family planning Bill when what we mean is availability of contraceptives Bill.  That hypocricy is part of our double-think in these matters.</P>
    <P>We are now moving, whether we like it or not &mdash; and there are some aspects I do not like about it &mdash; into a Europe of no borders where travel and information will be part of the free market.  It is absurd to try and build these kinds of protective barriers around ourselves.  During the referendum campaign we were told about being good Europeans.  It was the cant expression of the hour.  If you wanted to be a good European you voted Maastricht but there are those among us who think that Europeans are not always good and that when it comes to sex they are post-Christian degenerates.  Logically, <Col N="884" /> the people who think like that should say, &ldquo;We cannot really be associated with you in this way and until you reform your manners according to good Irish Catholic standards we will not take your filthy money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Incidentially, it is absurd for the Minister for Justice to be talking about a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo;&mdash; a quick fix in the family planning issues that have now been foot-dragging for many years.  Senator Norris has said, to use his own picturesque phrase &ldquo;bored to death with buggery&rdquo;. What we all mean is what we wish these issues were got out of the way, that we grew up so that we could, as Senator Jackman said, devote ourselves to the really fundamental problems in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Government's continuing and effective pursuit of its comprehensive programme of legislative reform with particular emphasis on the formulation of proposals in relation to complex social issues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Ross said that Fianna Fáil had difficulties.  I think it is Fine Gael who have difficulties.  When I looked at the motion certain names were conspicuous by their absence.  I can only now conclude that there may be many names there that are not there of their own freewill.  We had some Member standing up here tonight, openly withdrawing from the motion and saying his name had been used without his permission, or words to that effect.  I wonder how many of the Fine Gael supporters in the country would agree with a liberal agenda? Senator Murphy said we had come a long way since the Taoiseach voted against his own Bill.  I wonder if we have.  If some of this liberal stuff I heard this evening was again before the Houses of the Oireachtas I wonder what way would some of the Fine Gael people vote?  I have grave doubts about how they might vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil can be very proud of our past and our present.  We have put forward <Col N="885" /> much worthwhile social legislation in our time and we are prepared to introduce more.  Many countries that introduced much of this liberal agenda, as it has been referred to here tonight, are now trying to roll back the tide and they cannot.  If they were to do it again they would think about it.  For years we had a very bad telephone service but when we eventually got a telephone service it was the best in the world because all the options were tested and the best was chosen.  In our legislation on family planning we will have the best because we have seen the pitfalls in other countries. I make no secret of the fact that I am a family man, reared into a family that stayed together and I hope that my family and their families will stay together.  We hear and talk a lot about community.  We all know that if we do not hold families together we will have no communities. The family is the centrepiece of the community.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister is bringing in a Family Home Bill.  We must always bring in legislation to ensure that families are protected and kept together as far as is humanly possible.  We see in other countries that the families of broken marriages are often thrown to the wayside with no redress or no place to go.  They are victims, they are the sufferers.  We must ensure that all those problems are very carefully monitored and that we have legislation in place that will take care of all those eventualities.</P>
    <P>One would imagine by the way we talk that marital breakdown was something that only happened in the past few years. It has been with us for years.  When I was a gasúr I saw families breaking up but I also saw them coming back together again and in later years ended up as happy families.  The family grew up, brought the parents together and things worked out.  However, if divorce had been available in those days, I wonder what would have been the end result for the family involved?  They would have no hope of pulling their parents together because they would have been in other marriages and more difficulties and problems would have been created.  From <Col N="886" /> statistics from England and elsewhere we see that generally where first marriages break up the same thing happens to subsequent marriages.  If one cannot make the right choice the first time around, can one ever make the right choice?  Sin cheist eile.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about young people.  One would think that all young people today were promiscuous and mad for sex, for condoms and for all kinds of wild life.  That is completely and utterly untrue.  Young people were never better than the youth of today.  One only has to look at the number of projects they are involved in, the new ideas they come up with for Scientist of the Year and other projects.  The youth today are more caring than previous generations.  If there is one rotten apple do we throw out the whole barrel and say that all the apples are bad?  No. We do not; if we did we would have no apples.  Why are we always picking on young people?  The children and young people who want this promiscuous way of life are a very small percentage of our population, but if some young person gets into trouble with the law we are inclined to say that is typical of the youth of today.  There is no justification for such outlandish statements. The youth of today are excellent people and I would hate anyone in this House to think that the only reason we are talking about this social legislation is to make condoms available to young people.</P>

      <P>It is a pity I did not hear that.  I can guess at it but because I am not sure what was said, I will try to not answer it.  The Senator might not come back for another answer if I was right.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment because I know the Government are working very hard to come up with the best way to meet the social problems of today's society, and they are many.  It is amazing how some of our liberals talk about abortion as if it was like getting a tooth out with no word about the rights of the babies that are being killed.  They have rights too; there is not just one life involved.  Those are complex problems and they are not simply answered.</P>

      <P>The impression I got from what the Senator said was that because they were being suppressed they were reacting in such a way as to attack society. I do not think that is right either.</P>
      <P>AIDS is a terrible scourge and a very big problem today and this Government are doing a massive job trying to slow the spread of AIDS.  Unfortunately in the case of some people AIDS is self-inflicted. Now we read in the papers that a gentleman in England is deliberately trying to infect people with AIDS.  There are people with AIDS who deliberately try to bite the gardaí to try to infect them. It is sad that people have become so violent that they want to destroy their own society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to come to grips with all these problems but I do not think making condoms <Col N="888" /> available is the answer.  If it was there would be no AIDS in countries like England and on the Continent.  However there is AIDS, and it is from those countries that we imported it.</P>

I do not find it offensive that he does not agree with the motion; I do not find it offensive that he disagrees fundamentally with it, what I find offensive is that the best part of his speech, half if not two thirds of it, had nothing at all to do with the motion and deals with all the things that Minister Flynn thinks are important.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with this Minister is that he perpetually has an agenda of his own, whether it be on presidential elections or other issues which have nothing to do with the feelings or priorities of the Irish people.  It is an outrageous insult to this House that the Minister for Justice who is charge with dealing with, among other things, the most sensitive issue of the need to clear up the mess of marital breakdown in this country, would come in and decide he was not going to talk about what this House wanted to talk about through its ordinary process but about what he wants &mdash; issues which suit him and that he feels more comfortable with, banging the law and order drum, banging the Padraic Flynn drum.

      <P>Let me say first, that our legislation on the availability of little pieces of rubber of a particular shape should be no more than that, set a minimum standard so that they can do the job they are supposed to do and forget about it after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator Farrell.  We <Col N="889" /> can trust our young people.  We can trust them to live the way they choose.  There is a contradiction between sanctimonious talk about how good our young people are and talk about the need to protect them from little bits or rubber that apparently are going to lead them into perdition. It is a fundamentally intellectual contradiction and it is also very offensive to our young people.  Our young people do not need this kind of protection.  They know far more about these things than most people of my age.  They are more sophisticated, better informed and wiser, and handle pressure in this and other areas with far greater maturity &mdash; and I speak as one who works with them &mdash; than my generation did at that age.</P>

      <P>I am very proud of them and I for one resent the patronising attitude of so many people when, in fact, all they are doing is ducking the issue by talking and waffling about young people and the need to protect them.  The problem is that people cannot handle the reality of people having sexual relations and being mature about them.  I wish to God more young people had the sense to know that there are safe and unsafe ways of getting involved in sexual activity and could be assisted by adults who are experienced in dealing with these matters in coming to mature decisions and had available to them the means to implement those mature decisions.</P>
      <P>I am sick of family planning legislation. The family planning legislation we want is to end family planning legislation and let people decide.  All we want is to ensure that standards of physical and medical safety are met, and nothing more.  After that let people make their own decisions in the name of God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Norris case, last December 12 months we were promised something, specifically by the Minister for Justice.  We got a glorious headline about it.  Wondrous things were going to happen in our day.  That is, I think, distortion of a quote that used to be attributed to the former Minister's father. Wondrous things were going to happen <Col N="890" /> in our day.  They did not, and what the Minister said here today suggests that they will not happen.  We are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and all those who touted the Maastricht Treaty around this country talking about the wonderful progressive things that were in it, seem to forget that one thing in it was a commitment to conform to the European Convention on Human Rights, which I welcome.  It is about time those who thought it was such a good idea to endorse the Masstricht Treaty, among them Senator Farrell, as I saw from <i>The Irish Times,</i> accept that it now binds this country, and do what they committed themselves legally to do and stop postponing a simply decision to change an obnoxious piece of 19th century legislation.</P>
    <P>The only thing I want to say on divorce &mdash; because I want to leave Senator Norris adequate time &mdash; is that I do welcome the indications that this Government were taking an intelligent approach in that they were going to deal with all the other issues so that ultimately we are left only with the question of remarriage.  I would have had a much greater faith in the willingness of the Government to deal with that fundamental issue of the right to remarriage when all other issues are dealt with if the Minister had bothered to address the matter in a serious way.  The fact that a senior member of the Government, a senior adviser of the Taoiseach, one who is identified by all as being one of his closest advisers, feels he can duck the issue completely when it is raised in one House of the Oireachtas should be of concern to those thousands of Irish people who are hoping for a redress which will get them out of the legal morass in which they find themselves in terms of inheritance and children's rights and many other things.  The fact that the Minister for Justice, who is charged with this, apparently either has no thoughts or will not tell us his thoughts, or perhaps has decided not to think about it, gives me great concern about the reality of the new liberal agenda.  If the relatively simple issues like family planning and gay rights cannot be dealt with and if the <Col N="891" /> somewhat more difficult issue of divorce cannot be dealt with, I cannot believe we are going to have a referendum on the most fundamental matter of all next November. I wish to give the rest of my time to Senator Norris.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most grateful to my colleague, Senator Ryan, for giving me some of his time on this matter.  I would like also to say how very refreshed and delighted I was to see that my good friend and former colleague on these benches, Senator Ross, has not lost his crusading zeal and his interest in the liberal agenda which was certainly manifest over the years I have been here.  I was afraid it might get a little muted in Fine Gael; thank God it has not.  I am very glad to support this motion.</P>
      <P>I think the Government's amendment is completely idiotic.  To delete everything except self-praise and waffle is twaddle; it is of a kind with the sort of twaddle we have been hearing from Minister Flynn.  It is not helpful, we are told, to affix labels.  Is the Minister afraid of the word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;&mdash; I understand it did not assist him greatly during the Presidential election but he should not take out his own personal ire against a simple word which is an immensely respectable word despite what happened to it during the American Presidential election also.</P>
      <P>It is important that this word should be there because there is a philosophical principle underlying it.  The Latin stem is from freedom, to be free.  It recognises the freedom of the individual to make moral choices and that is the one thing that underlines all the issues which the Minister cunningly tried to separate. They all give to the individual the dignity of allowing to him or her the responsibility and the right to make his or her own personal choices in his or her private life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it was lamentable of the Minister to wander off into areas that had absolutely nothing whatever to do with the debate.  He spoke about white collar crime, about the confiscation of the profits <Col N="892" /> of criminal activity, etc., everything that was evasive and everything to avoid the direct response.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes the Minister for Health had, he dealt in a much more direct way with the issues and I applaud him for it.  There was a certain lack of specifics but I understand that because it would be wrong to bring the details of legislation before us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of contraception, for example, last night as an experiment I went to a chemist shop in O'Connell Street to buy some condoms because I never acquired them in a shop before and I wanted to judge my attitude. I very nearly turned back because I felt I would be recognised and there would be a little whispering behind the counter.  In fact, there was not and I bought a huge number in order to draw attention to the fact that I was there.  I was very glad there was absolutely no comment.  I was served with courtesy and pleasantness and so on and so forth.</P>
    <P>The reason I went down there was that I know that in some cases, particularly in small towns, there is embarrassment. People are diffident, and they may expose themselves to the risk of what the Minister so movingly spoke about as a very fatal disease through not having access simply because they are embarrassed. The embarrassment factor is the most mean-minded awful thing.  I would urge the Minister to let there be no age limit because the most vulnerable people are the younger people.  I think there are very few really young people who are sexually active.  The ones who are sexually active are unlikely to be titillated into sexual activity by a limp piece of rubber but if they are sexually active they, sure as hell, need the protection of that humble instrument.  I would suggest no age limit.  It is important in preventing AIDS.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's statistics. I wish I could say that I also believe that there is a continuing decline in the incidence of AIDS in the gay community. It is very easy for us to say they are very responsible, they are changing their sexual behavioural patterns and so <Col N="893" /> on.  I am not sure.  Too many of my friends are now ill; too many of them are living with AIDS; too many of them are in a situation where they have not long to live.  I wish I was given at some stage by some elements of the Government some encouragement &mdash; which the previous occupier of that chair, Deputy Flynn, certainly did not give when he was Minister for the Environment and had the responsibility for dispersing lottery money &mdash; in regard to the reintroduction of that instrument that assisted in fighting back that curve of infection, namely, the Hirschfeld Centre.</P>
    <P>With regard to my own case, again I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention in this area.  I have relodged this case with Europe and the machinery has already commenced to roll.  Let me say there will be a nasty campaign here again, I imagine, from some elements with the usual self-improving moral titles.  Somebody from Family Solidarity said that we are going to look for an even lower age of consent than the United Kingdom.  We most certainly are.  They have the highest age of consent in Europe and I think in the world while France, since 1791, has had an age of consent of 15, Catholic Spain of 12 years since 1812 and even Poland, from 1932, has an age of consent of 15 years.  That country managed to produce the Pope so its moral fabric had not disintegrated completely, or perhaps it has.  That would be a view I might take.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am utterly, unrepentantly liberal and socialist and to me those are still good titles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the liberalism, yes, the liberal ethic and the liberal tradition.  It is here in the motion and the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is something we can and should be very proud of in so many respects and proud of indeed in these islands, if I may <Col N="894" /> take them in a general sense.  I personally find it abhorrent that it should be considered a matter of legislation to determine peoples' social attitudes or moral values.  That is for the individual.</P>
      <P>I have to say, however, that I think in the present day world there is a very strong and increasing tendency towards fundamentalism.  We are seeing it in one particular religion that is extraordinarily strict and extraordinarily repressive and, particularly in regard to women, is turning large parts of the world back towards the Middle Ages, if not further back.  I have seen it in one country with which I am familiar, where ten or 15 years ago it was the norm for women to wear whatever dress they wished, be it western or local dress.  Now, without exception, all those women, even if they are here in this country, feel obliged and are under pressure to wear the full fundamentalist dress decreed by law.  This is an appalling situation and it is if anything, spreading throughout a large part of the world.  One of the excuses they use is to compare it to what they would term our decadent society, and there are aspects of our society which are decadent and let us not cod ourselves over that because it is a reality.  Also, I think social issues involve more than family planning, divorce and laws on homosexuality.  They involve unemployment, crime, drugs, child abuse and childcare; these are all social matters as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to those aspects referred to in the motion, I agree that family planning should be at the discretion of the families and of individuals themselves, and I look forward to that kind of legislation coming before us and, hopefully, to supporting it.  It is very necessary and appropriate that we should, whatever our personal views on such matters may be. It should be the right and the choice of families and individuals how they conduct their lives, so long as it does not interfere with the rights, obligations or basic interests of others.  Here again I have seen &mdash; and I am sure Senators on the opposite side have seen as well &mdash; the dire effects divorce has on children; in some cases children suffer the effects of <Col N="895" /> several divorces.  It may or may not be tragic for parents if they have to separate but, invariably, the children find it very difficult.  Despite that, a decision on whether to divorce should be and will be a matter for the individuals themselves. That is something we must address and I look forward to action being taken in that respect.</P>
    <P>Let me move on the question of homosexuality.  This again is something which, for a number of people, is intrinsic, just as heterosexuality is intrinsic to the majority of the people.  It is there, it is a reality, and it should not be a question of attempting to enforce what we consider to be the correct behaviour or moral values through legislation.  I am pleased the Government accept that our law in this area will have to be changed to conform with the decision of the European Court.  I would hope that even if there were not a decision of the European Court, ultimately, we would have accepted that our law would have to be changed.  There is a responsibility on us all in these matters not simply to have a change in the law and then set up a situation in which antagonism, understandable but totally wrong, may occur. If people are homosexual they have the right to behave accordingly as do heterosexuals.</P>
    <P>I would certainly be concerned in either circumstances about the influence they might have on other people who have not, perhaps, at a given stage, grown into an adult sexual situation.  The reality is that there can be grave family problems, some of them inflicted by society or by the families or individuals themselves, and it is high time that was changed.</P>
    <P>When I was first aware of political affairs, I recollect that a Government, which would have deemed itself in many ways very much the liberal Government of the time, having replaced the conservative, old-fashioned stuck-in-the-mud Fianna Fáil Government that has been there for 16 years, because of the mother and child scheme &mdash; liberal legislation. That is a pattern.  We will hear a <Col N="896" /> great deal more from the opposite side about liberalism, but at the end of the day, when liberal legislation has to be brought in, it will be this side of the House that will bring it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations about a motion that says that Seanad Éireann welcomes the recent indications of change in Government policy and its adoption of a liberal agenda.  A lot more has been said about that than has been actually done.  We should withhold judgment for a considerable period before we agree with that proposition. The Government have been in place now for five years and very little has been done to put a liberal agenda in place.  A good example is that although a decision on the Norris case was taken in the European Court in 1988, four years ago, no move has been made on it.  There is an issue that needs to be put in place to comply with our obligations in regard to human rights and we have not taken any step to do that.  It almost coincides with the period in which the Government have been in existence.</P>
      <P>We are the laughing stock of Europe when it comes to social legislation; I would say we are the laughing stock of the civilised world.  A good example is the way we surreptitiously attempted, through the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, to avoid our responsibilities of domestically regulating and legislating for matters relating to the Eight Amendment to the Constitution.  The manner in which we were unable, unwilling or afraid to face our responsibilities in this vital area of social legislation is a good example of how we are not prepared, nor are the Government, to deal with these matters honestly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the remarks of the Minister for Justice in relation to his programme of work.  He said that the comprehensiveness of that programme &mdash; this is the programme he is engaged in &mdash; can be seen from the fact that in his area of responsibility alone there are close to 20 Bills in the course of preparation.  I had a letter from the Minister two weeks ago saying that he did not envisage the need <Col N="897" /> to reform prison legislation, and, yet, another young man in prison has committed suicide.  There have been four suicides in our prisons in the first half of this year, more than we had in the whole of last year which was one of the highest in the history of the prisions system.  The rate of suicides in Irish prisons is double that in Great Britain which has 16 times the population.  Yet the Minister has the gall to say that he has 20 Bills in preparation but our 150 year old antiquated prison system is not dealt with in one of them.  That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Health probably knows, we are the one country in Europe that segregates our prisoners who are HIV positive.  We are the single country in the European Community that does that against all medical advice and that is contributing to the spread of the HIV disease.  Because of the way we deal with drugs, Mountjoy Prison has become the biggest drugs centre in the country.  The way the Department of Justice are dealing with their responsibilities in this area is scandalous.  They are simply evading them.  I cannot take at face value what the Minister said, it is all words and no action.</P>
    <P>In relation to the main items referred to in the motion seeking the immediate passage of a modern family planning Bill, that is something we need to address, and we have the Minister for Health here with us now.  What is required in this area is the deregulation of the sale of contraceptives rather than the introduction of new legislation.  We have got ourselves into such a bind on this issue that we are talking about if we can make them available in certain areas, whether we can reduce the age limit, how we will deal with the HIV problem, etc.  We simply have to deregulate the sale of contraceptives. That is the way we must approach it.  The first thing we should do is to repeal the legislation in this area.  I do not want to put it as bluntly as that but the legislation is inhibiting the control of HIV.  Obviously there would have to be some protection but tinkering with the issue of contraception and at the same time saying we are trying to do something <Col N="898" /> to prevent the spread of dangerous diseases, is not working.  I do not think it is a very honest approach on our part.  We do not have a strong awareness of the dangers in the community we are trying to deal with.  That has to be addressed more strongly and bluntly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the referendum on divorce, we attempted to deal with that issue before.  However, we lost because we planned it badly.  This time the approach must be comprehensive.  We must have a proper strategy.  The situation is simple. There are a large number of married couples who are separated but they must maintain this legal device and we cannot acknowledge the reality that they live separately.</P>
    <P>We must sort out clearly the question of ownership of the family home.  There must be joint ownership of the family home.  That must be clarified in advance. We must sort out what powers the courts will have in relation to separation.  What will be the period of time required?  What will be the rules, procedures and regulations? The approach should be to set them out in a Bill while, at the same time, we plan a referendum.  Unless people know what they are facing they will reject the proposal out of hand.  We should recognise that people are suffering and we should not add to it.  We must take a positive approach to this and prepare a strategic plan.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Norris case, it is shameful that we have not yet addressed the decision of the European Court of Human Rights although we are bound to comply with that decision.  It is encumbent on us to translate that decision into legislation.  We cannot dilly-dally forever. We must face up to our responsibilities in this area.  Both Ministers have considerable responsibility to prepare complex social legislation.  It is not limited to the three areas referred to here.</P>
    <P>I referred to the need to address the awful prison conditions in this country and any Minister could improve those conditions if he had the will to do so. There are many matters to be dealt with but the Government have not as yet <Col N="899" /> shown their good intentions.  They have talked about it, they have made promises but nothing has been delivered.  Until we get some sign that they are serious we simply cannot accept this bland amendment that the Government are continuing the effective pursuit of their comprehensive programme of legislative reform.  The Government talk about proposals and make promises but the problem is nothing is done about them in either House.  Until that commitment is translated into legislation, I will withhold my agreement with this motion that we welcome the adoption of a liberal agenda by the Government.  There is no liberal agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Conroy made a very interesting speech.  He began by saying how much he enjoyed the speech of the previous Senator but he spoiled it in his concluding remarks.  I have to say the same thing about his own speech.  It was a very humane and interesting speech until that unfortunate and badly aimed political point he essayed at the end.  It reminded me of one of the eternal truths of Irish politics.</P>
      <P>There was a distinguished Senator in the first Seanad, Senator Frank McDermot. He was a founder member of the Fine Gael Party in 1933, and Fine Gael Vice-President and then he drifted away from Fine Gael in the thirties and was regarded as a political honey-bee who tended to fly over the Fianna Fáil honey pot.  In fact, he had some reward for his effort because Mr. De. Valera appointed him to the first Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1936 he greatly annoyed many of his Fine Gael former colleagues by saying that he would support Fianna Fáil in the 1937 election because he believed Fianna Fáil was the only party capable of making peace with Britain and that they would destroy any other party which would try to do so.  In his latter comment he was right but not in the former.  But in that there is a very central truth about Irish politics.  Fianna Fáil will, in opposition, frustrate, block, obstruct, denigrate and attempt to destroy any reforming legislation <Col N="900" /> which any other Government attempt to bring in.  Fortunately during the last 1983-87 Government there was a Government majority so many significant reforms were made but it is in the nature of Fianna Fáil to behave in this way, but if the second part of Senator Conroy's proposition were true, I would feel happy.  He said one would have to depend on the conservative side of the House to bring in liberal legislation.  If I could believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That, too, is an important point: you can depend on us to bring in the changes.  We cannot depend on Fianna Fáil.  The reason for this motion this evening is to try to flush out the Government's intentions and see if there is reality behind them.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech, with the exception of one small proviso, to which my colleague will refer in his summing up, hand written by the Minister himself, which would give us any hope that important changes will take place.</P>
      <P>The time for debate on family planning has long passed.  When the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act made it illegal to import or sell those things, most Members felt they should not be spoken about in public.  The debate lasted for all of three minutes and there was no reference whatsoever to an amendment which was made to that Bill.  Since then society has opened up and the subject has been debated over the last ten to 15 years.  I could say that people have voted with their feet but now they have voted by their actions.  It is long past the time for any debate on the principles involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> All we are asking for is something which I believe the Minister wants to do, that is, to bring in common sense legislation which meets the needs and realities of our people.  I know that the Minister, if left to his own devices, will, produce the sort of legislation he espoused when he was in a different party over a decade ago.  He had a slight aberration on the question in 1986-87 but I think his heart is in the right place and we can depend on him.</P>
    <P>I move on to the question of divorce. I have an interest to declare in this since I am one of the few people in public life who has been through a divorce and perhaps I can speak on the subject with a greater degree of involvement than most other people.  It has become fashionable to say, and Senator Costello mentioned it as well, that the 1986 referendum failed largely because the preparation was not properly done but I do not subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>No matter what preparation was done in 1986, no matter what Bill was prepared, no matter how many papers were prepared, the mood in Fianna Fáil in 1986 and the mood of Deputy Haughey, in particular, was that he would do anything that would damage the Administration under Deputy FitzGerald and Fianna Fáil were not going to co-operate. That is how it happened.  There was the occasional person in Fianna Fáil, Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Andrews, whose liberal conscience was upset by what they saw their party doing and they went into a sort of a purdah for the 40 days of the campaign.  They came out of it afterwards and said if only they had been let free what they would have done and so on. That is by the way and it happened.</P>
    <P>It may well be the case that the legislation was rushed.  It may well be that there was not proper preparation done. It may well be that some of the difficult issues on property, pensions, second families and so on were not adequately addressed.  With hindsight, there is a lot of truth in the point of view that it was rushed and not properly prepared and that these things should have been addressed over a longer period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> We were told in 1987 by not just the new Fianna Fáil Government but by Senator Hanafin, the Pro-Life group, the Catholic Church, etc., that these issues would be addressed.  Apart from Deputy Shatter's Bill on Judicial Separation, we have not seen a single item of reforming legislation that would pave the way for a second look at this question.  I really do not think there is any great sincerity on the other side of the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>My wife is professionally involved in family law as a lawyer.  I know from what she tells me of what is happening in the courts that the numbers are larger and the problems are more intractable.  Again, large numbers of people are voting on this question with their feet.  As somebody who has been through the process, I can say it is a difficult, traumatic, appalling experience and people do not enter into it lightly.  Nonetheless, the case for some form of limited civil divorce is now unanswerable &mdash; not easy divorce, not divorce that is quick or fast but basically along the lines that were proposed in 1986 with the questions then answered.</P>
    <P>My question simply is: why are we waiting five years for a White Paper?  I am prepared to accept from the Minister that it is imminent, and I look forward to its publication.  The words &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; and &ldquo;soon&rdquo; etc. have become very flexible with this Administration.  They stretch on and on and suddenly the session is over.  The autumn comes, and then the spring session and suddenly this Parliament has come to an end and the question has not been addressed.  I believe this is not a party political issue because I know the views I have are shared by many people on the far side of the House.  There are people on this side of the House who would not agree with my views on the subject.  It is not essentially a party issue.  It is a question of human rights, human suffering, human dignity and sorting out a human problem.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the people on the far side of the House to come forward with a White Paper and proposals for legislation and they will get the sort of support from us which they did not give us when we <Col N="903" /> tried it.  It is an opportunity which may not come easily again.  So I say to them, be brave and generous on that subject.</P>
    <P>The third issue, homosexuality, has been referred to by a number of speakers this evening.  Again, it is topic that was not easily discussed a number of years ago.  It is a subject which many people find it difficult to discuss.  Many people find it distasteful and there is a sort of sniggering and a pulling back from discussion of the subject.  The fact of the matter is that we have been found to be in serious breach by the European Court. We have been asked to put our own affairs in order on this matter and as a matter of common, ordinary justice we have an obligation at least to be honest as to our intentions.</P>
    <P>What I find most unattractive about the present debate on this subject is that week in, week out, Senator Norris and others have asked for information about the Government's intentions.  It is very obvious to all of us who have been a while in politics that the Government have no intention of acting on this matter. Senator Norris and others are given lame excuses week in, week out.  The matter is put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>We know the Taoiseach in an unguarded moment let the cat out the bag during a press briefing one Thursday some time ago.  He said essentially that it did not really figure on the Government's agenda at all.  Basically, my fear is that it is not on the Government's agenda and I would prefer the Government to be honest about their intentions with the people concerned and with society in general rather than string people along. What we are trying to do tonight is to get some firm indication of a specific nature of what the Government intend to do. We have not as yet got that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would be appropriate to say a few words about this Fine Gael motion.  It is important to put on the record of the House that this is not a unanimous Fine Gael motion given that one Senator dissociated himself from the motion and said he did not want <Col N="904" /> his name on it.  We had the unseemly spectacle at the beginning of this debate of another Fine Gael Senator standing up in the House and saying he did not even know this motion was coming before the House and wanted to dissociate himself from it.  If the truth be know, there must be six or seven other Fine Gael Senators who are not here tonight who privately dissociate themselves from this motion.</P>
      <P>It is nice to see Senator Ross in from the Independent benches and bringing to this House and to the Fine Gael Party a liberal spectacle that one would never have associated with Fine Gael in the past.  I congratulate Senator Ross on the fact that he has converted, in such a short period of time, the conservatism we associated with Fine Gael in the past.</P>

He said to us on the Government side: &ldquo;be brave and be generous&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Senator was brave and generous and discussed this with his fellow Senators in Fine Gael before the motion was put down because privately they say &ldquo;we knew nothing about it&rdquo;.

I <Col N="905" /> am delighted that both Ministers took time to come to this House tonight to show that they and the Government feel that this is an issue that has catastrophic consequences for many people and that it is something that has to be addressed.</P>

It is indicative of the dilemma that Fine Gael find themselves in at present &mdash; they are going nowhere and are down in the polls.  Then Senator Ross comes among them like the prophet and says, this is it, here is something for us to introduce in the Seanad and we will be seen to be on the liberal road.  I say to Senator Ross, get to know the grassroots better.  I say to the other members of Fine Gael, I do not think the grassroots would ask them to introduce this motion into the conservative closets of Fine Gael.  He has done a good job in introducing two elements of it but I wonder how much in touch he is with what Fine Gael really want.  I will leave it for the people to judge.  He has erred on the third issue.  I do not think the people of Ireland are anxious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sorry the Progressive Democrats, the great liberals of this Coalition Government, have left Fianna Fáil in the lurch to defend themselves against this motion today.  I had <Col N="907" /> hoped, wrongly, that we would have had a great liberal dialogue from them. Where are they?  I do not know where they are, but they are missing.  Maybe they have been told not to turn up or maybe they just will not turn up.

I am sorry they are not here.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Foighil made a very serious, worthwhile and revealing contribution which is on the record of this House.  The most notable thing about this debate &mdash; I do not want to say anything which is politically embarrassing for the Minister for Health &mdash; was the stark contrast between the Minister for Health's speech and that of the Minister for Justice.  I have no problem whatever, indeed I welcome what the Minister for Health said.  He gave us a straightforward commitment.  He said: &ldquo;I will be bringing forward proposals to Government very shortly on making condoms more freely available in the fight against AIDS&rdquo;.  That was what we needed to hear and that is what we heard and it was given with sincerity.  I know that the Minister for Health will deliver on that promise.  I <Col N="908" /> accept fully his bona fides in that regard. I welcome it and it should be applauded by those who have brought forward this motion.  The Minister for Justice's contribution was an insult to this House.</P>

      <P>I wish to reiterate that this motion has only emphasised the point I made.  It was a very depressing debate apart from the Minister for Health's commitment. It has only emphasised the principal point I made that any action or any promises made by the Government are because they have been prodded from outside the State.  That is what is so unfortunate.</P>
      <P>It is high time, as many speakers said this evening, that we took these issues totally out of the political arena, that family planning was no longer an issue and divorce was introduced.  I no longer share the view that we need to get the legislation right first.  Originally I felt that was a convincing argument, that we had to get the property rights and other marital legislation right first, but that has just developed into an excuse for not going ahead with divorce.  It is far too serious for us to say we have to produce legislation first and then not produce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice answered that question in his speech by saying that legislation takes time, that we must not push it forward, that it is under constant review.  He went on to insult this House <Col N="910" /> again by saying he could not introduce legislation to decriminalise the law on homosexuality because they had staffing difficulties in his Department.  I do not know what the legislation would say but I do not think it would take more than half an hour to repeal the 1861 Act and perhaps an hour to amend it.  It is an insult to the intelligence of people on all sides of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to say that they have staffing problems.  We have considerable legislation coming before us day after day and there are no staffing problems.  This legislation was not brought forward simply because the liberal agenda which the Minister so despises is not a priority in the Fianna Fáil legislative programme.  I had hoped that those who wrote these matters into the Programme for Government would be here to ask the Government to do what they urged.  However, they decided for reasons best known to themselves to stay away.  As a result, some Fianna Fáil Senators broke loose. Senator Farrell said things which I could not stand over and some of the Stone Age men and the Stone Age attitudes of Fianna Fáil came out again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is weary after his long day in the House and I assure him I will not keep him very long.</P>
      <P>The motion deals with the need for the Minister for the Environment to make the necessary regulations to provide traffic signs for cycling facilities as a matter of urgency.  It is well known to most people &mdash; and I am sure to the Minister &mdash; that I have been an enthusiastic proponent of cycling and cycling facilities for longer than I have been a member of the city council, which goes back to 1974. I have endeavoured to get agreement on various proposals which would improve the lot of cyclists and it has been an uphill struggle in more ways than one.</P>
      <P>I have a statement which I think was made by the Minister but it is from the Department of the Environment to the Assistant City Manager of Dublin Corporation. It reads:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for the Environment to refer to your letter.  In accordance with Article 2 of the Road Traffic Parking Fees Regulation the Minister has approved the Corporation's proposals for the expenditure of £3.05 million for the purposes set out in your letter, subject to details of phase 3 of scats being discussed and agreed with the Department in prior consultation with the Department in relation to any proposals for cycle facilities or traffic calming measures on national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new city council has been in office since last June and I am glad to say that much more enthusiasm exists for the idea of cycling and improving facilities for cyclists.  A great number of motions have been put down relating to cycling, parking, safety, cycle lanes, shared cycle paths and a range of different issues.  The problem was lack of money but the corporation, <Col N="913" /> thanks to my intervention, discovered that they had a little nest egg about which there seemed to be some secrecy.  There was a substantial amount of money in this fund which had come from parking meter fees.  We proposed, and the council enthusiastically agreed, that a substantial amount would be spent on various parking proposals, as I have outlined already.</P>
    <P>I find it very irksome, and in light of what I said earlier today the Minister will understand my feelings, that we are completely dependent on the Department if we want to make progress.  This has been the case for a long time.  I will outline briefly a case that started in 1976. The city council agreed in 1976 to include a cycle-way on the Stillorgan Road dual carriageway.  In June 1984 the corporation commenced work.  Subsequently the necessary works were completed and sign-posts wrapped in black plastic bags were erected.  They were subsequently removed and the cycle-ways have not yet been introduced. The scheme was submitted to the Department of the Environment for approval in December 1984, and some years later we were still waiting approval to implement the scheme.  Basically the Minister held up this scheme for so long that, today, the cycle-ways still have not been introduced. We can see how frustrating this is for somebody like me who is trying to get work of this nature done.</P>
    <P>We seem to have a council which are in favour of improving facilities for cyclists and we apparently have the money which accumulated in the fund from parking fees.  One would imagine that things could go ahead but we still depend on the Minister to give us the go ahead.  Why is it necessary for a local authority to get sanction from the Department to spend money which has been accumulated, quite legitimately, in an account belonging to the corporation?  Why do the Department have to oversee the spending of every penny of our money?  Would the Minister not agree that he would spend his time more profitably if he looked at general issues and policy issues rather than having a minute investigation <Col N="914" /> into each little detail of the local authorities' operations?</P>
    <P>A press statement issued on 19 May 1992 stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Smith, Minister for the Environment, announced today that he has given his approval to the expenditure of £3.05 million out of capital receipts and parking charges in Dublin city.  The money will be used by the Corporation for various things, scats, calming measures for traffic, provision of cycling facilities and road improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that it goes on to say that the Minister also supports the expenditure for the provision of cycling facilities to encourage more people to cycle. He hopes to be in a position in the near future to make regulations to provide for a series of traffic signs which will be used to identify such cycling facilities.  That is why I put down this motion.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility the Minister will say that these signs are ready and that we will be able to go ahead and implement a number of schemes which we have in the pipeline and which we have been unable to implement?  Will the Minister indicate whether he intends to continue this interference in the affairs of local authorities or will he give them a little more latitude and leeway to make minor decisions without the Department being kept informed of developments?  That is what we want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to advise Senators of the steps I intend to take to promote cycling.  It also, of course, affords me the opportunity not to let the sun go down on my anger in the context of being locked in battle with Senator Hederman in the earlier proceedings today and to end the day by cycling together down the old bog road as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the many benefits associated with cycling.  First, it is probably the healthiest form of personal transport. Also, where it is used as a commuter transport system in urban areas as an <Col N="915" /> alternative to the private car it brings distinct environmental benefits.  It has to be said, however, that there is associated with cycling a degree of risk which gives rise to distinct concern.  During 1990, the last year for which a full analysis of road accident details is available, 46 cyclists were killed on Irish roads.  While that figure represents less than 10 per cent of the total number of road deaths in that year and is only slightly above the average for recent years, it still represents a level of accidents out of proportion to the number of cyclists.  It is, for example, three times the equivalent rate for cars. The vast majority of accidents involving cyclist deaths and injuries result from collisions with cars and goods vehicles. Therefore, the provision of separate facilities for cyclists is the most obvious way of reducing their involvement in accidents.</P>
    <P>At present the road traffic general bylaws, 1964 provide a statutory basis for cycle tracks.  These state that where cycle tracks are provided not only must cyclists use them but other vehicles must not be driven on them.  While I accept that mechanically propelled wheelchairs should be exempt from that ban, I would expect motorists to honour the integrity of the cycle facilities.  If I am made aware of abuses of the facilities, I will consider whatever additional measures might be necessary.</P>
    <P>As to the matter of sign regulations to which the Senator's question refers and which she discussed, I will shortly make regulations which will prescribe new traffic signs for use where cycle tracks are provided.  Most Senators will be aware that a range of experiments have been carried out with cycle priority measures over the past number of years and full effect may now be given to those with the advent of the new traffic signs.  However, I ask local authorities to reassess the facilities they have provided to ensure they provide the maximum protection for cyclists.  Clearly, the ideal solution is to provide cycle tracks which are entirely separate from other parts of the road but such facilities would be difficult to <Col N="916" /> provide in many instances.  The reservation of part of the existing footway may be a more practical option in many situations provided cyclists take particular care in the presence of pedestrians.</P>
    <P>The provision of cycling facilities as part of the main carriageway is the least attractive option in terms of safety considerations. Such a solution could be a useful additional option, however, if the necessary discipline in road user behaviour generally can be achieved.  We all have a part to play in this respect but the principal burden will fall on the National Safety Council to educate and generally promote the necessary awareness and the Garda to enforce the law.  I look forward to witnessing a large measure of success of both their efforts in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin, Senators will be pleased to learn I have authorised expenditure of over £3 million by Dublin Corporation out of accumulated parking charges on various roadworks, including £500,000 on providing new cycling facilities in the city.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to pending legislative initiatives which will have a direct impact on cyclists.  The Roads Bill, 1991, which is currently before the Dáil, includes a provision relating to cycle ways.  This concept will see the introduction of designated roads or parts of roads which will be either fully reserved for cyclists or shared by cyclists and pedestrians. In addition, later this year I hope to introduce a new Road Traffic Bill which will include provisions aimed at the devolution of many traffic management functions to local authorities.  I assure the Senator that is the road I will be travelling in the context not only of these matters but in relation to other issues as well.  I hope to amplify that over the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>The Senator will, however, take into account the fact that we are coming onto new ground and I would like to have as much uniformity as possible across the country with local authorities in a position to provide uniform signs and approaches.  That takes time.  Over the <Col N="917" /> next couple of years, I see much more scope and room for local authorities to take those decisions in their own right consistent with a national programme which would be operated in such a way as to take account of a number of the safety aspects which I referred to earlier.</P>

      <P>The news is not very encouraging.  All the Minister is saying is that he hopes shortly to be in a position to take some action.  That is the same as saying &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  We still do not know when we will get permission to put our programme for cycling facilities for the city into operation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points about dismantling the sheepmeat regime and how it affects the Irish farmer.  I regret very much, as I am sure every Member of this House regrets, what happened yesterday.  I do not condone the actions taken by the farming community who drove sheep into a Government building. If one examines the dismantling of the sheepmeat policy and how it affects the Irish sheep farmer, one can understand the tremendous frustration of farmers. That type of protest does not do anybody any good but one must look at what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, and hopefully the Minister will be able to clarify the position, the sheep premium which forms a large part of every sheep farmer's income has been cut by 27 per cent.  I do not <Col N="918" /> know how sheep farmers in the west of Ireland who depend on this type of farming for a livelihood are going to rear a family when there has been a 27 per cent cut in the premium.  No other section of society would tolerate that.  No trade union or group of businessmen would tolerate a cut of that size in their income. This matter was not given the degree of urgency it merited and I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to tell us what can be done to redress this situation.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying this started two years ago.  That does not get the money back into the sheep farmers' pockets. What I want, and I hope what the Minister wants, is to restore farmers' incomes.  They have taken a hammering on wool prices; wool is only 20p a lb. They have taken a hammering on lamb prices which are continuing to drop. That, together with the fact that the premium is fixed now on 1991 numbers, means a total drop in all sheep farmers' incomes and there is no question about it.  There is a substantially greater number of sheep in the country this year than there was last year and that means that many of those farmers will have to cut back on production as a result of the change in the numbers for premium.</P>
    <P>Again, we are dealing with a crisis affecting 52,000 sheep farmers.  Those farmers and their families will not be able to survive on the land if this situation is not redressed by the restoration of income supports in the form of the beef premium and the sheep premium. Whether we like it or not, in the past number of years we have become more and more dependent on getting cheques through the post.  That is regrettable.  I would much prefer that farmers would be able to produce a commodity, sell it on the world market and get a price for it.  However, whether we like it or not, that is the way farming has developed over the past five to six years and we are going to have to ensure that the commitments that were given are met.</P>
    <P>Many farmers who bought sheep last year on the understanding that the sheep subsidy would be at the same rate as last <Col N="919" /> year now find themselves having to take a 27 per cent cut in income.  The vast majority of farmers were not aware of this huge drop in income until last Friday or until the news was published in the papers on Saturday.  We were all led to believe that Ireland, by voting yes in a ratio of two to one on the Maastricht Treaty, had put the Treaty back on the rails and given a new impetus to a united Europe.  Instead of that on Friday, before the votes were fully counted, we were stabbed in the back and had to accept a 27 per cent cut in sheep premium resulting in a drop of £30 million to the Irish sheep farmer.  Hence, we had that spontaneous protest yesterday.  I do not condone what happened, but that is why those people were on the streets yesterday.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister came back from Brussels a month ago and pointed to the different schemes which has been approved in Brussels, including the suckler cow scheme and the beef premium scheme.  However, the ink was hardly dry on those contracts before the sheep regime was dismantled.  What I and every other farmer would like to know is if the same thing is going to happen two or three years down the road to the beef premium or the suckler cow scheme.  We have to ask that question.  There is no guarantee it will not happen.  If it has happened once, it can happen again.  This is why the Minister will have a fight on his hands if he does not ensure that these premia are restored to last year's level.</P>
    <P>In the part of the country I come from and the whole west of Ireland, we traditionally produce sheep and beef heifers along with the suckler cows.  Now the sheep subsidy has been dismantled with a reduction of 27 per cent and we have got nothing for heifers.  I predict that in two years time we will be back to the situation we were in after the collapse in 1973 when in my neck of the woods calves were won in card games.  However, I do not want to pursue that; I am merely point out the major effects this shattering drop in income has had on the whole of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>What I want to know is what steps the <Col N="920" /> Minister proposes to take to restore this income.  I could lambast and criticise the Minister for the way the negotiations were handled but I intend to be positive. What I want to know is how we can restore this massive drop in income.  I was not privy to the negotiations, but if there was a limited pool of money some of it that was going towards the suckler and beef premia should have been diverted to the sheep meat regime and that regime should not have been allowed to be dismantled leaving the sheep farmers in the position they are in today. Between the drop in lamb prices, in wool prices and the cut in premium, they are all facing a 27 per cent drop in income. Many people outside sheep farming and farming generally do not realise that and that is what caused all the frustration we saw on the streets yesterday.</P>
    <P>I understand the first part of the subsidy was cleared at £4.99 when in fact it was £6.75 last year.  There is no way farmers can take this.  I hope the Minister will be able to contradict me and say my figures are wrong but I understand that this year the sheep premium will be £16.33 where last year it was £22.69.  In days gone by when we were discussing the milk quota and all of the difficulties that arose at that time the then Minister, Deputy Deasy, had to walk through a minefield not alone to ensure that our milk quota was not cut but at the time he got a 3 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance to the whole sheep industry, to all the people working in the meat factories that are killing the lambs and servicing the trade that this subsidy is restored to protect farmers' incomes.  I have seen figures published by people with no vested interest in the matter and they calculate that instead of the subsidy reducing this year, it would need to be £28, given the drop in lamb prices and in the price of wool, to restore sheep farmers' incomes to what they were two years ago.  This has arisen partly as a result of the change in the method of calculating the subsidy for sheep.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that both the Irish farmer and the Northern Irish farmer were not treated as one separate unit. <Col N="921" /> We are fast becoming the only island of Europe and we should have got special recognition.  It costs us much more to get our lamb on the French market than it costs the people on mainland Europe but that was not taken into consideration.  It must also be realised that many of the problems that have been created for the sheep regime are caused by importing lamb from New Zealand onto the French market thus affecting the price Irish farmers get for lamb and literally ensuring that Irish farmers cannot get a livelihood. That is what is happening at the present time.  The Minister will have to ensure that that does not continue.  We are exporting 80 per cent of our produce onto the French market; that is the market we have for our lamb.  We are the only country in the world with that level of our production going for export and we must protect that export market.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years ewe numbers have increased in this country from 2.5 million to five million.  Farmers were committed to developing the sheep industry on the advice of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Now they find the plug is pulled and that they can no longer continue to develop.  There is no expansion.  Young people going into farming cannot get quotas for the sheep, milk, beef and suckler cow schemes.  I do not want to go into the whole mess. Questions are being asked and I am sure the Minister is well aware of them. However, I appeal to him to try to sort out the questions on the whole Common Agricultural Policy reform before this week is out because many farmers have forms which they do not know what to do with since they do not know the bottom line.  Let me conclude by asking the Minister what steps he proposes to take to restore sheep farmers' income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Naughten for raising this matter.  At the outset I want to put the record straight and give some facts in relation to the background to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the first tranche of 30 per cent of the estimated 1992 ewe premium which <Col N="922" /> forms an important part of sheep farmers' incomes was fixed by the European Community Sheepmeat Management Committee meeting on Friday last, 19 June. The amount of the premium this year for the first time, is calculated on the basis of a single region for the entire European Community and is in accordance with an agreement reached by the Council of Ministers in 1989.</P>
    <P>As a result, the advance for Ireland amounts to £4.99 which is a drop of £1.76 on last year's level of £6.75.  There has been some compensation in the disadvantaged areas, that is, an increase of £1.31 to £4.83 in the additional rural world premium.  This will bring the level of payment to those producers up to £9.82.  Therefore the payment of the first advance of the rural world premium in 1991 amounted to £10.27 resulting in a drop in 1992 of only 45p, that is, 45p in the entire disadvantaged areas which makes up 72 per cent of the country and £1.76 in the rest of the country.  The additional premium will be paid to 37,500 of the 52,000.  These 52,000 producers will benefit from the payment which will amount to £39 million.  Taking into account the payment in April of this year, the total paid to 52,000 sheep farmers this year will be £84 million.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the level of the first advance is an estimate and that the premium will be amended in the light of market developments between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Council agreement of 1989 resulted in a change in the market support arrangement for the sheepmeat sector.  As part of the premium arrangement, it was agreed that the variable premium system, which operated only in the UK, would be abolished and a single premium would apply for all member states.  It was further agreed that these arrangements will be phased in over a three year period or until the UK authorities decided to terminate the variable premium arrangements.  This decision was taken for the 1992 marketing year, that is, one year in advance of the original time schedule but within the Council agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> That is the background and they are the incontrovertible facts.  This was decided under the French Presidency in 1989.  It was well signalled in advance; in fact many farmers were told that it would probably be halved.  In the event the implementing decision was taken on Friday last and it is not correct to say that there was a spontaneous reaction to this because the matter was well known.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to sheep farmers' incomes.  I acknowledge straightaway that sheep farmers have suffered a substantial loss because of the market situation and the reduction in this premium. I understand the feelings of farmers about the reduced level of the 1992 premium particularly when lamb prices are so low this year.  I have been in contact with CBF, the Irish Beef Export Board to impress upon them the importance of obtaining the best possible return from the market-place for Irish lamb.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the so-called spontaneous response of some sheep farmers.  More than 100 of the 52,000 sheep farmers arrived in Kildare Street.  However, the depressed price and the drop in premium of 45p and £1.76 does not justify the behaviour of some farmers who aired their grievances by forcing a number of unfortunate ewes into the foyer of the Department of Agriculture and Food intimidating some of the junior staff, messengers and receptionists who had nothing whatsoever to do with this matter.  The protestors caused a great deal of distress to the unfortunate people and to the animals concerned.  I want to put it on the record that I deplore that activity and I will not tolerate that behaviour.</P>
    <P>As Minister I have a responsibility to the staff and I have brought the matter to the attention of the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  What I found most disquieting was hearing the Deputy President of the IFA, Mr. Tom Parlon, stating that what was done yesterday was only a tea party compared to what will be done in the future and I am taking every precaution to improve security in the Department of Agriculture <Col N="924" /> and Food.  I will not allow forced entry to cause bodily injury to staff and quite a substantial amount of damage to doorways, furniture and floor coverings in a Department office.</P>
    <P>As regards the animals, some leaders of the IFA tried to suggest that this was hype.  The whole country saw what happened on television.  We are not behind the Iron Curtain.  Not alone in Agriculture House but within the precincts of this House we saw an unfortunate animal being pushed through the railings in Kildare Street.  I deplore that.  I particularly deplore it because Ireland is a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes and one of the recommendations in that Convention, which I fully support, is that sheep in particular should not be used to achieve any goal including their use to create public spectacles or demonstrations if such use is likely to be detrimental to their health and welfare.  Clearly the actions I mentioned are in conflict with that goal.</P>
    <P>I now come to another matter.  It was stated by the president of the IFA on the 9 o'clock News last night that the ink was not dry on the reform proposals when this decision was taken.  That was a distortion and a misrepresentation of the facts.  This decision was taken in 1989 long before the reform proposals commenced.  It has nothing to do with the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals.  The leader of the IFA knows that and I am disappointed that he should distort the facts.</P>
    <P>I meet regularly with farmers, farm leaders, and representatives of the agricultural community.  Yesterday morning I had a meeting with Mr. Alan Gillis, president of the IFA, Mr. Tom O'Dwyer, president of the ICMSA and Mr. Billy Nagle, president of ICOS.  I cannot understand the behaviour of somebody who was in the Department for an hour speaking with me and my officials not raising this matter and then bursting his way back into the Department to make a point.  It was extraordinary behaviour and I am taking every step to prevent it <Col N="925" /> happening again.  I spoke to a messenger boy in the foyer this morning who told me he was struck in the face and had to run for cover in fear of his life.  I am concerned about that.  I am not in any way exaggerating the situation.  People were able to see for themselves what happened.  I deplore this action in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting again with the farming organisations on Friday of this week because I want to keep in contact and exchange views with them.  It is my policy to meet and discuss all matters relating to Irish agriculture particularly, as Senator Naughten said, because we are an island nation on the periphery of Europe and must make the most of our position in Europe.  However, I want to do it in a civilised and rational manner.</P>
    <P>Turning to the present problem, I raised the proposed reduction in the sheep premium during Council meetings over the last number of months and I pressed for an increase in the rural world premium as a means of compensating farmers in member states, particularly Ireland, where market prices are particularly low.  I want to give an undertaking to the House that I will continue to press for such compensation.  I have already put it on the agenda of the next Council meeting, which is next Monday.  This matter arose last Friday.  I could hardly do things more quickly than that.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there is a substantial drop in the incomes of sheep farmers because of the market situation.  I am in constant contact with them and I will do everything I can through CBF and at a Council meeting of the European Council of Ministers next Monday to try to restore the premium in Ireland to its previous level between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that the vast majority of sheep farmers were not aware that there would be a huge drop in their incomes.  I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said and he has not contradicted any of the figures I gave.  What he did was to indicate clearly what has been approved. <Col N="926" /> However, I note from the Minister's last sentence that he will do everything in his power to restore farmers' incomes and I sincerely hope he will not accept anything less than they received last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for the Marine the need to investigate, draw up plans and provide funding for a slipway at Bunaneer, close to where the Anascaul river flows into Dingle Bay at Anascaul, County Kerry.  The parish of Anascaul has a population of about 1,000 people and the parish derives its name from the River Anascaul which flows into Dingle Bay at Bunaneer.  By sea, Bunaneer is about 13 miles from Dingle and in that stretch of coastline there is only one landing place which is at Minard Castle.  At Bunaneer there are five boats using the existing facilities, three of them to fish part time during the summer months. The only landing facility there is a channel cut into the rock which is believed to have been done at the time of the famine. During my lifetime local people have endeavoured to fish from here under extremely difficult conditions, and fishing time has been reduced because of a lack of reasonable facilities.</P>
      <P>In the old days canoes were used which were easier to handle when it came to landing.  Nowadays, bigger boats with engines find it almost impossible to land. A slipway here would be used to full advantage by the people of Anascaul thereby creating up to 20 jobs during the summer months or for at least five or six months of the year at lobster fishing. There is a coastline here of at least five miles where lobster fishing is not being exploited due to the lack of landing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in the parish of Anascaul are taking full advantage of tourism. They are also taking full advantage of the fact that this is where Tom Crean of the South Pole fame came to retire after his many exploits and expeditions and it is also the parish where the famous sculptor <Col N="927" /> Mr. Jerome O'Connor was born.  A slipway at Bunaneer would be an added amenity and a further boost to tourism for the people of Anascaul.  Various organisations and individuals have been making representations to me for a number of years to try to get a reasonable job done at this location.  I would now ask the Minister for the Marine to investigate and do a costing with a view to providing the necessary finance for this development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <P>I want to express my extreme disappointment at being informed yesterday, that the Department of the Environment have not considered upgrading the N69, the road between Limerick and Tarbert, to the status of a national primary route.  I would like to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for confirming this.  It contradicts the recent announcement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, that the route would be upgraded and that this would mean that the development of the road would receive top priority in national policy in both national and EC funding.  I now ask the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, to immediately clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to be informed by your good self that my request to the Minister for the Environment to confirm to Seanad Éireann that the N69 was being upgraded was refused as &ldquo;a matter not suitable for discussion on the grounds of <Col N="928" /> lack of ministerial responsibility&rdquo;.  I am questioning this.  You kindly invited me to discuss the situation in your office and informed me that there was no proposal from Limerick County Council for upgrading and that the Department had no responsibility.</P>
    <P>Over the past six years, I and other Rathkeale councillors have proposed motions to Limerick County Council for improvements to the N69.  There is a large file of correspondence on the issue and the views of the council on the matter have been conveyed to the Minister in more recent times &mdash; in November 1989 and in November 1990.  The then Taoiseach was contacted on the matter in November 1990.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Limerick Leader</i> of 13 June, a report referred to Minister O'Malley's statement:</P>
    <P>Announcing that the road from the Dock Road at the city to Foynes is to be designated as a national primary, he said that funds to upgrade that road to the appropriate standard would be made progressively over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The people of Limerick, who see the development of the potential of the estuary at Askeaton and Foynes as seriously inhibited by the condition of the N69, deserve immediate clarification of the issue.  I am disappointed that the Minister for the Environment did not take the opportunity yesterday to do so.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 June 1992.</P>
