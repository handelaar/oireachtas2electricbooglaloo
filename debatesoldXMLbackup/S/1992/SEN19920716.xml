      <P>I have notice from Senator Upton that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make regulations to ensure the system of environmental impact assessments complies with European law.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ó Cuív of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to consider giving pensioners on the Aran Islands limited access to free travel on Aer Arainn during the winter months, when travelling by sea is unsuitable for older people.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to seek an immediate response from the EC to his submissions on disadvantaged areas once he received the results of the analysis from the appeals panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Upton, Ó Cuív and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Upton's and Ó Cuív's <Col N="2294" /> matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, as this is the last day of this session, I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, on behalf of the House for the session that we have just had, as well as the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Acting Chairpersons who have been of help to the House.  I would like to thank also all the staff, the press, radio and television and to all the acting reporters that have looked after us here.</P>

      <P>I was just about to get to the Members themselves and to wish everybody a very well earned rest.  I hope Members have their toes on whatever beach this time next week and enjoy the break.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Opposition Members at times had difficulty with the way things were done, but it was always in the interests of the House that we made every effort to ensure that the standing of the Seanad was improved.  I hope the session has been a worthy one and I look forward to coming back to another term.</P>
      <P>Today's business shall be Nos. 1 and 2.  Business shall be interrupted with a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the debate on all Stages of item No. 1, if not earlier concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. by the putting of one question from the Chair, and the debate on all Stages of item No. 2, if not earlier concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 4 p.m. by the putting of one question from the Chair.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Wright in thanking the various people who have helped the House to function during the past session.  In particular, I thank you, <Col N="2295" /> a Chathaoirligh, and the officials of the House, who are always courteous and helpful.  I thank the press, especially our own press corps, who give us a very good service, who take the House seriously and who attempt to convey to the wider public the substance of what is done in the House.  Our regular press corps, who are in the gallery today, deserve our thanks.  If we do not always get the coverage we would like, the fault does not lie with the press gallery but rather, perhaps, at the subeditors' table.  I also thank all colleagues in the House for the session just passed.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a very serious suggestion to the House on this our last day of the session.  It was very clear during the debate on the Maastricht Treaty that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the way in which European matters are discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am aware of the proposal for a wider European committee, but it is my contention that this House distinctively should be in a position to carve out for itself a significant role on European legislation and European matters.  I propose to the Leader of the House that he set up a small group, aside from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, perhaps comprising one person from each party, to consider on an all-party basis the way in which that could be done. I hope in the next session we may be able to put in place some method whereby the House could play that distinctive role. Yesterday Senator McDonald, in reference to today's item No. 5, made the point that there is a range of reports on European activities that have not been and will not be debated.  I make that suggestion in a very constructive way and I ask the Leader of the House and other parties to join Fine Gael in examining the proposal.  We all have plenty of ideas, it is a matter of taking action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to today's business, there should be no difficulty in finishing the first item by 1 p.m. and, judging from the number of speakers my party have available, there should also be no difficulty <Col N="2296" /> in concluding the second item by 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>Senator Hederman, you are using very emotive language, and I urge you to address a question to the Leader of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to be more moderate in my language.  Does the Leader of the House seriously believe that this House can discharge the obligations, responsibilities and rights that it has under the Constitution to go through legislation?  In my view, Members are being denied that constitutional right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader of the House believe that Members are collectively elected to do a job?  I believe that we have collectively lost sight of that. I appeal seriously to all sides of the House because the remedy is in our hands, it is not in the hands of Cabinet, the Minister or anyone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the courteous and fair way in which you have conducted the business of the House during this session.  I thank the staff of the House for their efficiency and for the kindness and courtesy they have shown us during this session.  I also thank the various other people who have provided us with assistance and help.  I thank the press for the way in which they have covered the proceedings of the House and I compliment them on their endurance, for the way in which they have sat through debates that I suppose at times must have fallen somewhere between being fairly boring and very boring.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's comments on the importance of conveying European issues to the wider public.  That is an enormous challenge as these issues are complex, difficult and often not suitable for short discussion.  That matter should be taken up in the autumn. Senator Hederman has a certain case in relation to the way in which we manage our business as we approach the end of a session.  I ask the Leader to consider our affairs in that respect and try to find a better way of doing things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in expressing thanks to all those who have been mentioned.  I shall not go through all those who have to be thanked again, other than to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, for your courtesy and the way in which you have handled the affairs of the House in the past session, even to the point of taking matters on the Adjournment that you <Col N="2299" /> might otherwise have ruled out of order, as I think you did last week and for which I thank you.  I also thank the officers of the House, the press and other Members.</P>
      <P>I wish to say to Senator Hederman through you, Sir, that while my party's views on the realms of this House are well known, while it exists we will give it the respect that it deserves and that you, Sir, deserve.  It is up to the House, as it always has been, to regulate its own affairs and I am sure that that will continue.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in his hopes for the next session.  Reform of the Seanad has been debated in the House, the matter has been referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and certain improvements have been made. There was a universal call that there should be access for MEPs, senior officials from the Commission, and so on, to come to address the House.  That would be a welcome development.  It is worth noting that the Maastricht Treaty contains provisions that relate to inter-parliamentary co-operation and the need to have national parliaments more closely involved in the workings of the Community and those of the European Parliament. In that context, it would be very appropriate for us to proceed along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Manning's request for a discussion on Europe immediately after the Seanad resumes.  Most Senators are elected by local authorities and local authorities are now very confused in so far as there is a large number of peripheral organisations in Europe.  With your permission I will name them.  They are the CPMR, the community of Peripheral Maritime Regions and the AER, which is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator is trying to come to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to make a point, not a speech and, with your help a Chathaoirligh, I will succeed. <Col N="2300" /> Many members of local authorities are anxious to do the right thing and be associated with the right organisation.  In that respect this House can give them guidance by having a discussion on the matter.  I strongly urge Senators to accede to the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the thanks expressed to the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader of the House, the media and, particularly the staff who have had to cope with the many amendments I tabled.  I re-echo Senator Hederman's comment that we do need to conduct our business, particularly towards the end of a session, in a more efficient manner.  We should ensure that our business dove-tails to a greater extent with the activities of the other House and that a greater volume of legislation is initiated in this House.  Both Houses should be able to go into recess at the same time without there remaining a large number of Bills to be dealt with by this House after the other has risen.  That is something we should examine in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The suggestions that we invite members of the European Parliament, mentioned by Senator Dardis, and Ministers to deal with specific issues, as suggested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the talks on Northern Ireland, appear to be legitimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to feel somewhat like Senator Ó Foighil.  I raised a question in the House on the last two days on the Order of Business and, perhaps, the Leader of the House cannot answer it because of some Standing Order.  Since we have sent good wishes to Kings, Queens and Donegal goalkeepers, surely we can send a message of goodwill to His Holiness, the Pope.  If the Leader of the House cannot do so perhaps you, a Chathaoirligh, can do so on behalf of the House.  I would like the guidance of the Chair on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Leader to consider asking the party Whips to meet, and group the 45 or 46 non-Government motions on the Order Paper, and arrange for a few days discussion to clear the Order Paper early in September.  A number of very important motions have been tabled by Senators from all sides and it would be useful to have a discusion on them.</P>
      <P>I should like to re-echo the sentiments expressed by the Leader of our party in the Seanad, Senator Manning, on the scandal of our not having discussed the half-yearly statutory Reports on Developments in the European Communities over the past five years.  It is a shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the compliments and gratitude extended to the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirlech, the staff and the press.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I called on the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the health services with particular refernce to the Southern Health Board and their allocation of funding.  While they did receive a substantial increase in allocation this year they are now confronted by a crisis in Tralee General Hospital.  I would ask the Leader of the House to ensure there is a full debate on the health services, with particular reference to the various health boards and their funding, when we resume next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to reports which appeared in this morning's papers with regard to Senators' salaries arising out of a statement made by an Independent <Col N="2302" /> Senator here last evening.  Having served in both Houses I consider Senators are under-paid.  I should like to make that clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the matter has been resolved but I asked the Leader of the House why it has taken three days to accept a message of good wishes to His Holiness, the Pope, for his recovery.  I did not support the Leader's colleague on this before because I understood there was general acceptance that the message should be sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that, when less Christian countries than ours have been sending messages to His Holiness following his serious operation yesterday from which it would appear he is recovering, thank God, that it was completely ignored by the Leader of the House yesterday when responding.  I understood all Members were anxious that that message should be conveyed yesterday.  I hope it will be sent today.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before calling on the Leader of the House to reply I should like to make one or two observations.  I too would like to thank all Senators for the great co-operation I have received over the past six to eight months.  I should also like to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, and the temporary Chairmen, for their help.  They worked very well throughout the year.</P>
      <P>In particular, on behalf of Members I want to congratulate Josie Briody, one of our staff, who is leaving after 11 years service in the Seanad office.  She has been extremely helpful and courteous to Senators at all times.  I know I speak on behalf of all Senators when I say that I regret she is leaving us.  Happily, we are losing her through promotion within the system.  When I congratulate her, I know I do so on behalf of all Senators.  I wish her well in her new role and thank her for the help she gave us during her 11 years in the Seanad office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Lydon's proposal of yesterday and the day before &mdash; I took it on board when I returned to my office yesterday.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Foley's request for a debate on the health services when we resume in the autumn, I should tell him we will allow time for debate of topical matters.  With regard to Senator McDonald's request, in the past few days I said that under topical headings we would debate some of the issues that have been raised regularly.</P>
      <P>Senator's Manning's proposal is worthy of consideration.  As he rightly said, this House is an ideal forum for the type of debates he would like to see.  It was recognised by the Taoiseach after the holding of the Maastricht referendum that there is need for a greater pool of information to the public on issues relating to EC legislation and policy.  It is hoped that either among the Whips, or at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we will be able to give that consideration.  As the Cathaoirleach knows, it is our intention to meet during the summer recess to review reforms of the House.</P>
      <P>Finally I should say that if Members do not have respect for the House it is difficult for the public to have respect for us.  I hope there have been some misquotations in some of the reports and comments I read in today's papers.  The fact that we have initiated some reforms, that each grouping within the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured over the time I have been Leader of the House not to respond in any personal fashion or in my personal capacity, but I have difficulty having listened to some of the comments this morning, particularly by a Senator who, as a Member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, was a participant on the committee dealing <Col N="2304" /> with reform of the House.  That committee intend meeting throughout the summer to ensure the conduct of business in this House is changed for the better. Such comments should be made at committee meetings rather than running to the Press for cheap publicity such as we witnessed.</P>
      <P>If we want to follow that line of attack &mdash; as I perceived it yesterday and today &mdash; we should examine the record of each Member of the House, their attendance record and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely Bill as we have been calling for a long time for the extension of the grants to mature students.  It gives an opportunity to people who, for one reason or another, social, economic or educational, were not in a position to pursue further education, to avail of it now.</P>
      <P>The Minister has opened the door for mature students to seek third level qualifications. Mature students are extremely determined in relation to achieving their goals.  The importance for mature students is the improvement in the selfconcept that comes from pursuing a third level qualification.  They take pride in the fact that, when they qualify, it will be easier to get employment in this technological age.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on the part mature students will play in the central applications process?  For instance, will a single parent who obviously does not want to leave her environment but who would like to pursue a qualification in the local third level institution, be treated as a special case?  Will the Minister instruct universities, Dublin Institute of Technologys and regional colleges to deal with them on that basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question relates to the case of somebody pursuing a third level course and opts out for one reason or another. Perhaps in five years' time as that person matures he or she may want to take another third level course.  Would such a person be regarded as a mature student? The Bill is in line with the education objectives set out in the section of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which particularly concentrated <Col N="2306" /> on the upgrading of education for mature students.  With the passing of the Bill all the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> objectives in that regard will be achieved.</P>
    <P>We are already aware that there are 1,600 mature students in full-time education in third level institutions.  It would be fair to anticipate that with the generous grant scheme now in place we will see a doubling of that figure in the first year of operation.  This is something I welcome.  Students can be very grateful to the Minister for the foresight he has shown in bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention major increases in the higher education grants recently announced by the Minister.  They are even more significant when you consider the extraordinary increase in the number of places in third level colleges over a ten year period &mdash; 34,000 extra places.  That is significant and augurs well for the future. We can pride ourselves on recognising the importance of education and its meaningfulness in the context of giving a full life to each and every student going through the hallowed halls of third level colleges.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints in the past, particularly from the PAYE sector, about the higher education grants.  They feel that they have been hard done by, they point to the fact that grants were based on gross salaries and they perceived the self-employed doing particularly well out of the system.</P>
    <P>The increases should mollify a large percentage of the PAYE sector because now that the limit is £19,500 there will be an extra £2,000 for additional students from the same family in third level colleges. The Minister has gone a very long way to ease the situation for many people in the lower income group.  This applies particularly to the middle income group who have been most vociferous in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the statistics from Cork County Council last year.  It gives an idea of why there is a perception that one sector seems to be doing far better <Col N="2307" /> than any other.  From our statistics relating to all grants paid, the highest number went to farmers and the agricultural sector generally.  Obviously the smallest number went to the higher professionals and 20 were paid to the lower professionals. Employers and managers received 30; the salaried employees 20; non-manual and unskilled 65; skilled and semi-skilled 80 and the unemployed and retired 100.  That forms a basis for questioning the equity of the system.  It gives good grounds for people in the PAYE sector to raise questions as to the fairness of this system.  If a farmer or a business person takes out a loan he can write off the interest paid on that loan as an expense.  Why can the PAYE person not offset his mortgage in terms of the grant? He can say he is paying out £2,500 a year by way of mortgage.  If the Minister is allowing the business people to have that write-off in interest, why not allow them to have a write-off in terms of a mortgage? These are questions which will have to be answered.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister carried out a major review of the grants system to ensure that equity will be brought into the scheme.  I am very happy that the increases which he has now put in place will ensure that the middle income group will gain far more from this extraordinary increase at a time of great financial stringency within this economy.</P>
    <P>Every year we have a difficulty about the payment of higher education grants, and some local authorities are far more efficient than others.  Somebody entering a college in October may not have grants paid until the next year.  This is intolerable and it puts great pressure on the student involved.  Will the Minister look at streamlining the operation of the payment of higher education grants?  It is in stark contrast to the way payments of ESF grants are made.  Within two or three weeks of students coming into regional colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology, these grants are made available to them and they do not suffer the same hardship.</P>
    <P>Given that we are talking about <Col N="2308" /> regional colleges and universities, may I ask the Minister about the term &ldquo;regional colleges&rdquo; particularly since we entered into the central applications system?  As somebody teaching in a regional college, I find myself faced for the first time in Cork with students from Monaghan and from all over the country.  The concept was that a college would cater for a region, but because of the advent of the Central Applications Office I now find that students in Cork come from all over the country, and then we have the ludicrous situation of students from Cork going all over the country.  Will the Minister concentrate on the word &ldquo;regional&rdquo;? Are we actually catering for the regional concept and can we cater for it under the CAO system?</P>
    <P>With the advent of the more streamlined central applications system, I fear that in many instances we have put square pegs into round holes.  At the end of the day points will determine where students will go.  One would expect a student taking a course in tourism skills to be extremely outgoing; yet in many instances under the new CAO system we find people who get in because they have the points but who may not at all be suitable for that course.  I fear that students will opt out of courses to which they were never suited.  They went in because they got a place and a grant, but having gone into the course they find themselves totally unsuitable.  A number of people, for instance, who would not have physics find themselves in a technology course.  They find that they have to start with physics from day one.  They never really intended to pursue that type of course, but because of the points system and the practicalities of the situation they find themselves in it.</P>
    <P>This year I have noticed a fair number of students in the college opting out because they were pursuing a subject they are not really interested in.  While I can understand the Minister's dilemma in overcoming the problems, I am a believer in the points interview system, because eligibility, practicality and the suitability of the student to the course is all important.  When a student gets a <Col N="2309" /> place after an interview on the basis of points, one knows that it is the course the student wants to pursue.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised the point last night that 75 per cent of our students now go on to senior cycle.  That is a marvellous achievement to date.  The aspiration in the Green Paper is for a figure of 90 per cent.  That is very laudable and something the Minister and each and every one of us in the educational system should encourage.</P>
    <P>Given the major number of places that have been provided in third level institutions, if the growth continues these institutions will be cracking at the seams. Has the Minister considered having a look at other options?  The Outreach Centre is something that we should now look at.  It has many advantages.  We should have second level schools with an excellence in, say, automobile engineering or mechancial engineering which in the first year of certificate course would ensure that many students would be able to pursue their courses in an appointed Outreach Centre for the first year of that course.  In the regional colleges and universities we now have a system whereby somebody does a certificate course, goes on to do a diploma course and the option is there for that person to go on to do a third year degree.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the system could be made flexible enough so that with the Outreach Centre students in a locality would have an opportunity of pursuing the first year there, thus enabling financial constraint on parents to be removed because students would be living in the local community and attending a local school.  All of it would be under the aegis of the regional technical college and, ultimately, the National Council for Educational Awards.  By doing that we could ensure that the standard of excellence within regional colleges could be maintained. It would be up to each school, and indeed the regional college, to ensure that the education is of the standard they would wish and that they have in the colleges.  That is worth thinking about, because down the road there is a large <Col N="2310" /> number of students coming onstream who want to have a third level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows it is his duty to ensure that as many students as possible go through the cycle, because in the modern era unless one has a third level education the chances of getting meaningful employment are reduced dramatically.  One avenue that may be open to the Minister in the near future is through the Outreach Centre.</P>
    <P>I will return to the question of ESF grants and the great play that has been made of the Minister's announcement in this regard.  It has stuck in my craw over the years to see the children of parents who could well afford to send them to regional colleges not alone having their fees and books etc. paid for but also getting a maintenance grant, while down the road somebody who has not the same means at their disposal for one reason or another cannot send his children to college.  I have always questioned the equity of that.  I do not mind going on record and saying that the Minister's decision to means test the maintenance portion of the ESF grant is right.  That decision will have an impact on those who are less able to afford college and at the end of the day we will thank him for it.</P>
    <P>It is a very progressive Bill, one that each and everyone of us welcomes.  Our hope is that mature students will take up the opportunities and will be better persons as a result, better educated, far more employable and making a very meaningful contribution to the economic life of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very welcome. It arises from the commitments and provisions contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It will <Col N="2311" /> give mature students an opportunity to benefit from third level education.  It will provide anybody who is over 23 years of age, subject to a means test, with a chance to get back into the educational system.  It will give those people who never got a chance of third level of education the opportunity to avail of it.  It will give some people who did get the chance but refused to take it for one reason or another &mdash; for example, people who have become redundant, have retired, or are unemployed &mdash; the opportunity of getting back into the system. That is desirable.  It will also give emigrants returning to this country after a spell away an opportunity of getting back into the system, subject to meeting the means test.  These are worth while provisions and I welcome them.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly a certain cost will arise from this initiative, but the money will be very well spent and is bound to pay dividends in the longer term.  The extra cost to the colleges in some cases may not be particularly great as at least some of that cost will be at the margins.  It will not cost a great deal extra in class sizes, which may be increased from 50 to 60.  I acknowledge that in the various teaching support aspects of college life there will be extra costs in relation to tutorials and, for example, the one-to-one aspects of going to college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express a degree of concern in relation to the financial pressures which some colleges find themselves under at present.  While in the past one could have argued that there may have been a case for increased efficiencies and so on, we need to bear in mind that there is a risk in restricting financial resources for colleges in as much as that may result in standards beginning to fall.  If standards fall that will be very damaging to the quality of the degrees awarded by the colleges; and the colleges stand or fall on the quality of the degrees awarded by them.  I should have said at the outset that I work in the third level sector and I have the greatest confidence in the quality of degree courses and the various certificate and diploma courses which are given at Irish <Col N="2312" /> third level colleges.  It is very important that we protect those standards very jealously because if standards begin to fall it will be in nobody's interest; degrees will become devalued and the colleges will not serve the purpose for which they were founded.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the decision taken in the other House by the Minister to include in the Bill mature students who are at present in the system.  This is a very welcome initiative.  It would have been very unfair if those students had been excluded from the provisions of the Bill because they had completed part of their course.  It would have created an unfortunate and unacceptable level of discrimination. I am glad the Minister acceded to the arguments which were made in the other House and that he saw fit to change his mind.  It will cost something in the region of £800,000 to £1 million, but even in the present financial circumstances that is money well spent and it will pay dividends in the long run.  I welcome the fact that the Minister during the debate in the other House was prepared to listen to the arguments put forward, and that is one of the more desirable aspect of our work in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister restricts the provisions of this Bill to those students entering third level education for the first time.  In other words, I am disappointed that some students who have already obtained a third level degree are excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  To qualify under the provisions of this Bill one is subject to a means test.  Somebody who has a third level degree will have to pass a means test to get back into the system so that means the person is not exactly well off. It is a pity that having a third level degree excludes people from the provisions of the Bill.  In the case of some people who hold third level degrees the reality is that the qualification which they have obtained is not particularly useful to them.  That holds in the case of people who have been out of the system for a long time.  Because of the technological changes and so on, a degree from 20 or <Col N="2313" /> 30 years ago would not be of very much value now in terms of obtaining a job or in the whole area of knowledge they had studied.</P>
    <P>In the case of law, the primary basic qualifications in law is that one either becomes a barrister or a solicitor.  It is quite possible to obtain a degree in law, which is just one step along the way.  It does not get one very far in terms of pursuing a professional qualification in law and becoming a barrister or solicitor. A degree in law or in arts is not of much use when you want to become a lawyer. It is a pity that restriction exists in the Bill and that it will disqualify people from benefiting from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know an individual who has a degree in arts who now wants to become a lawyer and who would qualify on the basis of the means test, but as I understand the present provisions of the Bill that person will be excluded from benefiting from it. That is a pity.  It is particularly so in relation to a profession such as law which had in the past been very much biased in the direction of those people with plenty of money who come from the wealthier segments of society.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which I particularly welcome is the fact that it will increase the number of mature students who will pursue third level education.  As somebody who works in that sector, I think it will be very beneficial in the faculty of veterinary medicine where I lecture. Some mature students take veterinary degree courses and everybody in the faculty would acknowledge the contribution which these mature students make to the welfare of the college and the whole student body.  They add a degree of maturity and stability to the student population which is very valuable.</P>
    <P>While many mature students are certainly not more intelligent or more capable than the other students, they have a maturing effect; they have a better perspective of the way the world works. They can be a source of very sensible advice and help to 18, 19 and 20 year old students who have just come from second level education and who have been through a system where, in effect, they <Col N="2314" /> have been force-fed with knowledge, exam techniques and soon.  The fact that these students can interact with people who may be 25 to 30 years of age, who have had considerable experience with the world and how it works, is very beneficial to people who have just left the second level sector.  The fact that mature students will be present in greater numbers in the student population will be very beneficial.  It is a side effect of the Bill which may not have received the attention it deserves.  It is always a pleasure to speak after Senator O'Keeffe who is always a source of new and stimulating ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>For a change, I agree with most of what the Senator said.  I sincerely hope that will not disturb him unduly.  I am not going worry about it although I would not like to see it happening too often, for both our sakes.  I agree with him when he referred to the self-employed doing very well out of the present system.  There is no doubt about that and it is something the Minister needs to review very carefully.  There is a very strong bias in the present system in favour of those people who come from the better-off elements of society.</P>
      <P>Any body looking at the statistics in relation to those who participate in third level education could not but be struck by the manner in which they are biased in favour of the higher socio-economic groupings.  The reasons this should not persist are complex.  Despite the introduction of grants during the past 15 to 20 years there has not been a significant change in the pattern and in the type of people who go through third level education now compared with, say, 30 years ago.  That is something which needs to be analysed and considered very carefully. The initiative in this Bill will, to some extent, help to change the balance although I would not be carried away in relation to the extent of the changes it will make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are special problems in relation to third level education for those families <Col N="2315" /> who have more than one member of the family in the system.  It is very expensive to put somebody through college; I reckon it costs in the region of £5,000 to £10,000.  That is a great deal of money for people on average incomes.  Where more than one member of a family is in a position to go through college that creates a very great burden.  The Bill will go some way towards shifting the balance in the right direction although I would not be particularly optimistic in relation to the extent of the shift which is likely to occur.</P>
    <P>The final point to which I wish to refer raised by Senator O'Keeffe and relates to the manner in which the higher education grants are paid by some county councils. The Dublin County Council, of which I am honoured to be a member, have prided themselves on the efficient manner in which the money is paid to students who live in County Dublin.  I understand there is a very serious problem in relation to some county councils. I am aware of the problem from students in the college who are left waiting until after Christmas to obtain their money.  In effect, it means that students have to borrow money from banks and so on, which, in turn, means they have to pay the interest on it.  It is a very serious problem.  I agree with the suggestion that this whole business should be streamlined and I hope the Minister may be able to take some action in that regard.</P>
    <P>This is a very welcome Bill.  My main criticism of it is that it appears to exclude, across the board, those people who already have a third level degree.  I urge the Minister to have another look at that aspect of the Bill to see whether some changes could be introduced, perhaps by way of regulation, which would allow that relatively small number to benefit from the provisions of what is a very progressive Bill.  Because of the means test provision in the Bill the cost of making that change should not be particularly great.</P>

      <P>On the last day of the session I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and <Col N="2316" /> the Clerk of the Seanad, for your kindness, courtesy and understanding during this session.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly. Many of the points I was about to raise have been covered very well by the Senators who have contributed before me, all of whom were very well versed on everything in the Bill.  I am reminded of 1965 when the late P. J. Lenihan, father of two very eminent former Members of the Seanad and now Members of the Dáil, made a speech in Castlepollard in which he said: &ldquo;The greatest scarcity facing Ireland is knowledge&rdquo;. Looking back 27 years on the progress we have made in our educational system all the legislators &mdash; Members of both Houses &mdash; the various Ministers and Department officials, may be extremely proud of the great contribution they made to generations of boys and girls in our schools so that they are now among the best educated young populations in the world.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to welcome this Bill. As someone who came from a not so well off family I left school at an early age because of a lack of grant funding and lack of transportation.  Many students at that time could not get a secondary education, because of the distances involved, perhaps eight to ten miles.  Transportation was a simple basic requirement. From that point of view I am delighted to welcome the Bill which provides for massive increases in the upper income limit for the many families who will be affected by it, particularly the low income and the middle income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new arrangements a family with one to three children will qualify for full fee and full maintenance grants on an income of £15,000.  This represents a dramatic increase on the present income limit of over 40 per cent, or £4,200.  At a time when resources are scarce and when tightening the belt is the order of the day, not alone in Ireland but in every English speaking country, the Americas, Australia, Canada and Britain, this is a magnificant achievement by the Minister and his Department.  This is an ideal opportunity <Col N="2317" /> for those who are unemployed to look at the situation.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and face the facts as they are presented to us.  For a person who is unemployed or made redundant the outlook is not very bright.  At a meeting two weeks ago a very senior gentleman told me that not since the war has America and England been in recession at the same time and that not until one or other comes out of recession will we get the help we need for an upturn in our economy.  Apart from the financial disadvantage of being unemployed, the biggest disadvantage is not having a reason to get up in the morning.  What better than to become a mature student for at least the next year or two.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and I look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who took part in this debate.  I found it extremely interesting.  I thank them for their thoughts and their contributions.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased at the welcome given to this legislation from all sides of the House, including the Independent Benches.  It is very heartening to see that.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the legislation is being judged on its merits and that the changes in it are particularly welcomed and that the support and comments have not come purely from a political point of view but from the point of view of educational interests.</P>
      <P>This is very progressive legislation. The package of improvements in third level grants which we announced recently and the changes in the criteria add up to one of the most fundamental overhauls of third level student support schemes ever carried out.  If one looks back on the changes of the past few weeks and incorporates these proposed changes, one is looking at the most historic and dramatic overhaul and reform of the student grant system, and it will be seen as such through out the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Doyle appealed on behalf of students in the lower middle income families who still will not qualify <Col N="2318" /> for grants even within the new limits.  As I pointed out in my introductory speech, the limits which we have introduced are dramatic and historic.  It is about as much as the Exchequer can bear at present. The increased limits are up to 50 per cent and at a time of pressure on expenditure that is very dramatic indeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman also referred to the case of a family with two children sitting the leaving certificate examination this year and the difficulties this presents to their parents in relation to their proceeding to third level education.  I am also introducing an improvement in the special increase and the limit of £2,000 in respect of each child after the first child attending third level education.  That should help that type of family.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked about the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in the new criteria I am introducing. First, the grant applicant will authorise the relevant local authority to supply the Revenue Commissioners with copies of grant application documents.  It will be in the hands of the grant applicant to authorise his or her local authority to do that; they will be expected to do it. The grant applicant would also authorise the Revenue Commissioners to make any necessary inquiries and seek any further documentation they consider necessary. The Revenue Commissioners will also be authorised to supply any relevant information to the local authorities.  What would happen then is that a percentage of applications would be sent by local authorities to the local offices of the Revenue Commissioners.  The local offices of the Revenue Commissioners will check the data against their own records and advise the local authorities who retain the function of determining grant eligibility. On that point, we have looked at the criteria.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have pointed to what they regard as a bias in the system where students from particular backgrounds obtain grants and students from other backgrounds do not.  As a first step &mdash; and this would not be my last word on it because there is a lot more in the reform area to be undertaken I was keen to have <Col N="2319" /> something undertaken which could be implemented this September rather than wait the two or three years which a more fundamental review might take.  As a first step we have brought the Revenue Commissioners into the heart of the assessment process.  That is not to frighten anybody; it is to bring those people who were charged in their everyday work with assessing income additional professional expertise to support the local authorities as they determine whether a particular applicant gets a grant.  It is bringing in the Revenue Commissioners in aid of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>What is being agreed now with the Revenue Commissioners is that a percentage of applicants will be sent by the local authority to the Revenue Commissioners every year for checking.  I would expect that the local authorities, in selecting the batch of applicants to be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, would have a proper balanced profile and take a totally objective view in the selection of the batch that would go to the Revenue Commissioners.  It will tighten up the process considerably.  It is one thing dealing with the local authorities when it comes to income &mdash; there is income from all sources, non-businesses income, personal income, interest and all these matters &mdash; but it is another matter dealing with the Revenue Commissioners who can apply particular penalties.  That is an important first step and it will go a long way towards removing suspicions and perceptions in regard to the scheme. It is not necessarily the final word on it but we will continue to review it to see whether that particular change results in the necessary improvements this year.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of providing more places for mature students.  There is a number of other initiatives in the pipeline which will help mature students, particularly the modulisation of courses.  That will facilitate part-time attendances; for example, people can study and progress at their own pace, can accumulate course credits progressively and carry those credits with them from institution to initiation in the <Col N="2320" /> future.  This is all discussed in the Green Paper.  That will give more flexibility in the system, not just in Ireland but hopefully throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The need for a comprehensive system of certification was mentioned by a number of Senators.  That is dealt with fully in the Green Paper and we have to make more progress on that urgently.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello suggested that in 1991, 20,000 applicants in the CEO did not get offers of places.  I have been looking at those figures since the Senator made that suggestion and the facts, as I have them, are that the CEO had 40,000 applicants who had the required academic attainments and from that figure 33,000 offers were made.  In fact, only 7,000 did not get offers.  I may not be dealing with Senator Costello's point as he may be including people who have not reached the necessary academic attainments, but of those who achieved the basic academic requirement, 33,000 out of 40,000 received offers; therefore 7,000 did not get offers.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the point of documentation of the review on the grants scheme being made available to the Oireachtas.  We will be publishing full details of the outcome of the review.  I do not think it is necessary to publish all the background papers.  Once we publish the new arrangements, the new scheme and the entire procedures in detail, I think that will meet the Senator's point more than adequately.</P>
    <P>The question of means testing the ESF grants has been raised by a number of Senators.  I am heartened by the maturity of the comments of Members, even Members who oppose my decision to means test ESF grants.  Their request is to postpone it.  This is a more thoughtful approach than the blanket demand of some commentators to abandon it when the proposal first emerged.  The position has been very well put by a number of Senators.  We cannot, on the one hand, argue that we ought to have more people at third level and at the same time argue that we must not means test the regional technical college grants.  It does not <Col N="2321" /> matter where the money is coming from. Just because it is coming from Brussels does not mean we should treat it like confetti or in any way differently from what we would do if it were money from the Irish Exchequer.  It is so inter-related now and the offsets are so amalgamated that it does not make that much difference. The argument that it is European money does not stand up.  In any case, the EC only provide a certain amount of it.  Last year £10 million of Irish Exchequer money went into ESF grants.  It was to control that that the means test decision was taken.</P>
    <P>This is all about equity.  I want to ensure that the same rules apply, whether one wants to send one's child to university or to an regional technical college. Taking a different view of regional technical colleges is putting them into a second-class category, and that is unfair. It is important that the same rules apply to all third level colleges.  Regional technical colleges are very fine institutions. Last week's legislation on new governing bodies, more autonomy, nationally appointed chairmen and so on, will greatly enhance the standing of the regional technical colleges.  We are also discussing a possible change of name for regional technical colleges.  They will be greatly enhanced as a result of this and over time will gain the stature and status which the present university system has.</P>
    <P>In that context it does not make any sense not to means test entrants to regional technical colleges and to universities. What does one say to people who are on a very large income and send their children to the regional technical college, while three or four doors away people who are a few thousand pounds over the limit, receiving maybe a fraction of the income of their neighbours, cannot send their child to university?  It does not make any sense, apart perhaps from some short term political advantage, not to means test the regional technical college grants.  The universities and the regional technical colleges are being put on a level playing pitch and that is critical. More importantly, the alternative is to turn away students.  If grants are not <Col N="2322" /> means tested there will be fewer places and students will be turned away.</P>
    <P>The new grants scheme is much fairer. It applies the same rules to everybody and raises the threshold across the board. That threshold has gone from £10,700 to £15,000.  That is a very dramatic increase by any standards.  The new scheme is much fairer and much more equitable.  I do not see the need to postpone it.  It is important that we get started in September.</P>
    <P>I take the point that some students may have been making arrangements some months ago before the ESF grants scheme was finalised.  It is some months since I said publicly that the way to tackle this is to continue the means testing and get the threshold up for everybody, so that the same rules will apply, whether one wishes to go to university or to a regional technical college.  We are playing rules at a higher level because there is a higher threshold for everybody.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully, and with a very open mind, to the arguments on ESF grants.  I have tried to be extremely objective about that but any deviation from that decision would not be equitable. It would not be fair to students who need grants to go to universities.  It would be wrong of me to perpetuate the notion that the regional technical colleges will cater for the less well off and the universities will cater for the well off.  That is what I would be doing if I took the decision not to means test grants for one institution and to means test grants for another institution.  I am keen that universities and regional technical colleges are given the same stature and status. This is the way to do it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe asked about the CAO in relation to mature students.  That is not a problem because it is a matter for the individual institution.  They will not have to avail of the CAO application system.  He also expressed a wish that regional technical colleges would be truly regional.  I accept that point but they also have a national perspective, which they must continue to develop.  He pointed to the advantages of &ldquo;Outreach&rdquo; which we must keep in mind.  He also suggested <Col N="2323" /> that we make preparation for additional mature students.  We will continue to monitor that situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton and others discussed the delay in payments.  We need to be realistic and anticipate some teething difficulties, particularly in regard to new applications for grants this year because of the very large number of changes in the scheme.  Every effort is being made to give local authorities the best help avaialable.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned yesterday the surge of legislation from the Department of Education.  It is important in the context of the Green Paper that we try to establish a legislative base across the board.  This seems to be greatly lacking in the education system, which operates on precedent and is very <i>ad hoc</i>.  There is need for much more legislation.  Hopefully the regional technical colleges Bills and mature student Bill will pave the way for a series of Education Acts or one major Education Act.  I have not finally decided on the road to take but I will listen to the debate on the Green Paper and see what emerges.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also spoke about the timing of ESF grants.  I have dealt with that as best I can.  He put particular emphasis on tackling the problem of disadvantage in the education system.  I totally support that.  This is the first of six aims of the Green Paper.  We have put the tackling disadvantage in education at the very top of that list.  That is not just a platitude; we must give effect to this, and one way to do it is through the mature student legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly was very supportive of the legislation.  I thank him for that. He put forward some interesting ideas. Senator McKenna spoke about second chance education and adult education, particularly the link with employment.  It is quite clear &mdash; Senator Doyle gave some statistics last evening &mdash; that the longer one stays in the education system and the more qualifications one gets, the better chance one has of getting meaningful employment.  A recent analysis of the long-term unemployed on the unemployment <Col N="2324" /> register shows that a very high proportion of the long term unemployed did not proceed beyond the intermediate certificate level of education.  So there is a clear link between education and employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy made the very same points about the link with employment. A number of Senators spoke about the need for a social partnership in education. I think the Green Paper will go a long way to achieving this.  Senator O'Keeffe asked me to look at the position of single parents and returning students. I will certainly do that.  He also asked me to re-examine the criteria.  Senator Doyle made a number of points about eligibility. I hope my comments today explain the position with regard to that.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done within the education system and I look forward to playing my part.  I hope we will have a lot more legislation in the not too distant future.  We have come a long way.  We have a superb education system, one of which we are extremely proud.  The Irish education system is renowned for its quality all over the world.  My aim in enhancing, developing and building that is not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  I want to cherish the best of what we have built over many generations. Because we, the Irish, value education, we must continue to develop and enhance our system and prepare it for the changing world, as the Green Paper suggests.</P>
    <P>Twenty per cent of all Government expenditure is on education.  One pound in every £5 of Government expenditure goes on education.  Twenty five years ago that was only 13 per cent.  Third level education particularly has benefited. Third level education now gets 22 per cent of the entire education budget, compared with 8 per cent in 1966.  A dramatic emphasis has been placed on third level education in the past 25 years &mdash; and rightly so; we do not deserve any thanks for that.  The value which we Irish place on the education system has been underlined.</P>
    <P>Access is being improved under the legislation.  I hope that the issue of equity <Col N="2325" /> is being addressed in some way.  It is certain that transparency has been addressed.  I thank Senators for their support for the Bill.  If Senators have any further queries, I shall try to deal with those on Committee Stage.</P>

Specific reference was made to two different types of definitions &mdash; one for social welfare, which reflects exactly the definition provided in this legislation, and one in the Finance Bill.  From that point of view Senator Jackman's query reflects an anomalous decision that we have tried to address.  If I remember correctly, the Minister for Finance refused to accept that particular interpretation.  I am not sure whether that will have any implications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister spoke about ESF grants.  I wish to repeat a point I made then as this is really my last opportunity to do so.  The legislation still does not address the position of those in the case studies that I outlined to the House last night and about which I feel so strongly.  The three people who came here in a deputation are just three of <Col N="2328" /> many who will not have access to third level education for their sons and daughters. The Minister referred to a sum of £2,000 for each student at third level education, but that provision will not apply to those involved in any of the three case studies I spoke of.  Parents will face the agony of having to tell their children that they cannot go on to third level education. Students are still waiting for the results of CAO applications to know whether they have been accepted for the courses they applied for, but presuming that they will be accepted, I appeal to the Minister to postpone his decision.  I am glad that the Minister recognised our use of the word &ldquo;postpone&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why were the results of the review not released ahead of the Minister's decision?  In that way Members would have been able to determine the way in which the system is not working and would have recognised the inequity of the existing system for third level grants. We could then have examined the review and would be in a position to evaluate what the Minister has said about equity. As politicians we have a duty to serve the people; it is not for us merely to take one line or another of bureaucratic thinking as to whether a student should or should not be able to avail of a grant.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in this case is on &ldquo;catching&rdquo; the higher earner.  We have no difficulty with the self-employed or the higher and not so high income earners but it is impossible for me to accept the Minister's decision.  Those involved are not nameless.  Their children will not have access in September.  Students opted for courses, basing their decisions on the position that pertained this February. It was my understanding that a certain amount of time had to elapse before new regulations could come into play.  I state very strongly that it is my belief that the Minister might not have acted but for the lobbying, the letters that were written and the fact that a Private Members' motion, in the Dáil tabled by Fine Gael and supported by the Labour Party, implored him to postpone his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the beginning the word used was <Col N="2329" />&ldquo;abandon&rdquo; because we did not expect that the report of the review committee would be forthcoming.  I point out to the Minister that this decision was not originally his, it was a decision he inherited.  Surely it is no big deal to think in terms of humanitarian reasons.  I could agree with what the Minister is saying if I took a practical, realistic viewpoint, but not when it comes down to the real issue. As a teacher for a number of years I would find it very difficult to accept that just one student would be denied access to third level education.  The figures speak for themselves.  We should strive to make the very high earner pay, but the problem we have simply will not go away.</P>
    <P>I gave an example relating to Limerick County Council and Senator O'Keeffe referred to the position in Cork.  We are still talking about a 1991 level of 19 per cent participation of children of PAYE workers versus the 66 per cent participation level of children of farmers and other self-employed people.  The level of participation of children of the unemployed still stands at 16 per cent, a very small number. I taught at an inner city school for 25 years and up until recent years, when the regional technical colleges emerged, I could count on my fingers the number of students from that school who went on to third level education. Such low participation levels do not result from a lack of intelligence but because the students come from black spot areas of 80 per cent unemployment in Southill, Limerick.  In their wildest dreams those students could not go on to third level education. They still do not have access to third level education.</P>
    <P>The dependency culture is continuous. People who think that there is equity in the system are fooling themselves.  When I think of equity I do not think of 50,000 versus 15,000 only; I think of 50,000 and the students who come from a background of unemployment.  Granted participation level of the unemployed sector improved from 11 per cent in 1990 to 16 per cent in 1991, but they are not getting access and that is what equity is about. It is mentioned numerous times in <i>Education for a Changing World.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" /> If I were asked what I associate with the Minister, Deputy Brennan, I would say &ldquo;equity&rdquo;.  When it comes to the reality of that equity, what do I say to the man who had worked 30 years to allow his daughter access to third level education?  He will not be able to send her to third level for which he has worked hard.  If that were the only case I contend the provisions should be changed for that purpose.  The Minister has put the cart before the horse.  We should first have had access to the report when we would have been sympathetic to and in support of the Minister, pointing out that there are inequities throughout the system.  We know that the means-testing within the traditional universities &mdash; if one might describe them as such &mdash; has not worked but we now propose to apply that system to the regional technical colleges.  I do not for one minute believe that European money is thrown away when 65 per cent of European money is to be backed up by 35 per cent of ours.</P>
    <P>I feel so passionately on this issue I would plead with the Minister to do something about it.  I do not think the numbers of people involved would be huge or that the relevant expenditure would run into millions.  I listed the people who will not have a hope &mdash; such as gardaí, nurses and so on, people barely above the income limit of £15,000; it is not a big figure.  I am talking about people who worked all their lives and who themselves did not have access to third-level education but whose life's ambition was to provide such for their children.  What will their children say?  They will be utterly disillusioned and embittered.  I predict they will end up taking the £50 on the dole queues &mdash; which is where they will have to go &mdash; or the £39 maintenance grant.  I really appeal to the Minister to effect that change.  If he can do so it will be even more important than the decision taken though the amendment tabled in the Dáil in respect of mature students. This really is a cry from the heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us very much welcome section 3 which involves the extension of the Principal Act to include <Col N="2331" /> mature students.  Despite the Minister's efforts and the good ideas now being implemented in relation to raising the income eligibility &mdash; including the mature students and index linking &mdash; we have still not tackled the heart of the problem, that is that there are far too many in the lower category, socio-economic groupings, who simply do not make it to third level to which I referred on Second Stage. Can we adjust or expand the system and encourage local authorities, who provide the grants under the various schemes, to become more involved in identifying areas of lack of participation at third level, to adjust their powers in relation to the payment of grants, thereby assisting people out of the morass of illiteracy and poor levels of education?</P>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to write formally to all the local authorities informing them of their powers under the Bill, that while they must have a scheme approved by the Minister, nonetheless they could produce a specimen or pilot scheme themselves specifying how the higher education grants are to be used. Perhaps the Minister could ask them to come up with ideas in relation to the problems they may experience.  Each local authority area is different.  I am thinking of the area in which I would be involved as a local representative, that is the north inner city of Dublin, where there is an incredibly low rate of participation in third level education.  I would have ideas about ensuring greater participation there.  For example, I could suggest a link-up of primary schools with vocational schools and the third level colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology in the vicinity, so that they could co-operate and liaise with each other at an early stage.  This would mean that at the end of the road students could foresee a possibility of participating in third-level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is just one specific suggestion in the content of what this section is about, that is, extending the categories of students who come under the umbrella of the Higher Education Acts in local authority areas.  I would be delighted if <Col N="2332" /> the Minister would invite submissions on how it might best be done.  It is particularly relevant with our present very high levels of unemployment, there being many categories of people anxious to reenter the educational system, particularly women and community groups involved in education, whether it be the National Adult Literacy Association, Aontas, or whatever.</P>
    <P>Now that the provisions of this Bill are extending grant eligibility to mature students we will probably have to do somewhat more to ensure that these grants are made available at an earlier stage.  Mature students are more at the whim of funding arriving at the right time when other students dependent on their families and who would have some fallback. Certainly I have had a great deal of representation from the Union of Students in Ireland in relation to the great variation among local authorities in the payment of student grants &mdash; some pay the first moiety in September, others in October or November, and others still as late as December.  The payment date of the second moiety may vary as well.  In addition there are variations in relation to whether it be a first-time student or continuing student.  We need to tighten up that provision in this section extending the grant to mature students.</P>
    <P>The third and final point I want to make relates to European Social funding. Like Senator Jackman, I have been very concerned about the manner in which that development took place.  What we have here before us forms part and parcel of the package declared to be introduced in January last.  Legislatively, this part is now being introduced.  The other proposal which did not have to be introduced legislatively &mdash; namely, the limitation in relation to the maintenance section of ESF funding &mdash; was implemented straightaway in January last to apply from September next.  In that sense the Bill would be much better if the package were related to the future rather than being implemented piecemeal.  I contend that the timing was wrong and has led to many problems.  Indeed the £10 million the Minister mentioned is only 35 per cent, <Col N="2333" /> being the small amount of matching funding on the part of the State.  It would be better if the Minister ensured a greater allocation of funds for this educational purpose from the European Community. After all, the Minister for Finance goes to Europe to argue his case for extra funding.  As there is greater focus on education under the new European Union Treaty why should the Minister for Education not also go to Europe to argue his case?  Ireland has a greater obligation, having a particularly young population and therefore the EC should be prepared to pick up any shortfall in this area.  That would have been a better approach.  Even at this late stage it would be much better from our point of view to ensure that all of those young people are catered for within our education system and none transferred to the dole queues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a fundamental disagreement with Senator Jackman on the ESF question.  I take Senator Costello's point about the timing but I suppose whenever you do something, somebody will be adversely affected.  I hope there are not too many such persons. There has been valid criticism on the question of timing, not on the principle itself.  The Senator is right in saying that there must be more access to third level education, greater care for the disadvantaged and increased participation rates from city centre schools.</P>
      <P>We must include these measures in the Bill and when funds are short people on £50,000-£60,000 a year should not be grant aided to send their children to the regional technical college.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we argue for equity we must make sure that the limited resources for education are targeted where they are needed.  That is the purpose in means testing the ESF grants. I know the Senator is arguing that perhaps the principle is right, but that we should put it off until next year. However, the new limits, as I said earlier, are the way to means test the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to do a lot more and Senator Costello argued very strongly yesterday and today to increase the participation rates from the disadvantaged <Col N="2334" /> areas.  Some 50 to 60 per cent of all participants at third level will now be in receipt of some grant aid, which is a dramatically improved figure.  We must remember that over the next couple of years we will be heading for a participation rate of about 45 per cent in the 17 years age group or so &mdash; age cohort as they call it technically &mdash; going on to third level.  That is almost twice the number in the UK.  It is close to the top of the league in the European Community and by most standards, measured against other western developed countries, the participation rate is extremely high.  In Portugal, for example, about 20 per cent of students in second level go on to third level.  We must appreciate that there is an increasing proportion of disadvantaged children and students included in our numbers.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello made a point with which I agree and I will certainly augment it.  At present I am having discussions with DCU, Trinity College and Tallaght regional technical college about a formal link with disadvantaged schools.  I must be careful about designating schools as disadvantaged, because that in itself creates problems, but we are in the process of getting a third level institution to adopt a particular school in the city centre or other disadvantaged area and make special arrangements, in so far as they can, to bring students from that disadvantaged area into those colleges.  We have been in touch with them again recently to establish their plans in that area and it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>Proceeding to third level education is not just a matter of cash or grants; it is a much deeper problem involving background and attitude.  One programme which will help is the new augmented home liaison scheme where teachers go into homes and talk to parents because very often a parental attitude causes a difficulty in relation to third level.  Some homes &mdash; not through their own fault &mdash; do not have a history, a tradition or a background of respecting third level education and I hope the home liaison scheme will help to change that attitude. In some cases where the grants are available <Col N="2335" /> in disadvantaged homes they are not taken up; it is not just the financial aspect, it is the general background and an attitude which we must try to improve.  It is not their fault and the home liaison scheme will improve the position and the links with universities.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about writing to local authorities.  We are in touch with them regularly and perhaps I will write to them formally asking how the scheme is working and if they have any suggestions. In particular, in view of the Senator's query, will ask them to report to me on participation rates from various socio-economic groups in their county in so far as they can give that information which would be useful.  As the Senator said, it is necessary to streamline the system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important it concerns a support structure and perhaps constructive help for the Minister.  I am aware that the accessing of students from disadvantaged areas will not happen overnight and I would not wish to have that mixed with the question of equity because it is an educational matter which must begin in the home.  It is a first level, second level and third level problem and it will be long term, there is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, and it is true, there is not much value placed on education in certain areas and a support system within the community will help to change that as well as a smaller pupil-teacher ratio for disadvantaged children in schools, etc.  It starts from the cradle, it is not a question of suddenly saying that everybody should have access to third level.  There is always the option; people do not necessarily want to go, it may not suit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think third level education is <Col N="2336" /> a panacea for all our ills because the Culliton report made the point very strongly that we are moving from the academic area and may be forgetting the basic skills and technology which one can get from post-secondary education and then moving on through certification and diploma.  Obviously, we hope they will have access to third level, but that is something we will be debating again and again on the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the whole area of disadvantage can be solved overnight. I was referring to the small numbers who will be victimised, as it were, this year.  I understand the Minister has to make a specific decision, but I hoped he would have waited until we could have looked at the review and the decision.  I am disappointed in that issue, but something may happen between now and September to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Line 9, section 3 (v) says that a mature student should comply with &ldquo;such other requirements&rdquo;.  It related to a point I made last night, particularly in regard to assessment procedures.  The Minister answered some of the queries I raised last night and referred to the fact that the grant applicant goes with his or her documentation to the Revenue Commissioners. I hope I am right in my understanding of that.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the fact that a certain percentage of applications to local authorities would be forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners who would check them.  How efficient are the Revenue Commissioners in evaluating cases? Earlier this year in the Dáil the Minister for Finance &mdash; I may not have the exact wording of his reply &mdash; said that a very low percentage of self-employed people were audited.  He also said that the majority of that low percentage had made incorrect income tax returns.  They are very valid points in relation to the Revenue Commissioners and the assessment procedures.</P>
    <P>At present the most active people in local authority areas are accountants who are busily ringing up local authorities to find out what this new legislation means. I am sure they are assessing the best way <Col N="2337" /> to beat the system for their clients.  The local authorities are inundated with telephone calls from accountants asking what exactly it means for the self-employed. The Minister did not refer to assets.  The self-employed have very substantial amounts of income associated with them; will such income be included in assessment?</P>
    <P>The next question relates to something done by local authorities over the last number of years.  Will the Minister look at the idea &mdash; as I said, it has been forwarded to the Department of Education &mdash; of giving some resources to local authorities to employ accountants on a consultancy basis even for the month when the pressure is on in regard to assessment? There seems to be some block on that type of innovation, although it would be practical and it would not be very expensive.  The local authority would employ an accountant on a consultancy basis.  If the Minister is sincere in relation to equity, he must agree that having the accountant <i>in situ</i> working with local authority officials, just for that month alone, would be far more practical and that it would save much more money and the time of the Revenue Commissioners. The accountant would be working on the system in the place in which it operates. That might be a better way to operate.  Of course, there would be some resources to be paid to local authorities to employ the accountant on a consultancy basis even for that month.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Costello and I referred to the question of who is the final arbiter of assessable income.  Statutory authority lies with the local authority.  Will it be the Revenue Commissioners, or will it be the local authority?  Will it come back again from the Revenue Commissioners to the local authority?</P>
    <P>With regard to the drop out rate for students, universities are slow enough to give the first year drop out rate, but it is very high.  Some people have had to drop out during the first week or two, which is the most expensive period of their college life.  We know there are delays and that parents are ringing up asking the Minister to appeal to local authorities to have the <Col N="2338" /> grants ready by a particular time.  There is going to be a whole new structure here. I would question the whole system if, due to slowness, one single student who had the points to gain access, was embarrassed socially and economically and could not survive for one week because of the cost of books or clothes and had to drop out.  The £39 maintenance grant, which goes a long way towards helping the hard pressed student, would not pay for digs.  The grants have to be <i>in situ</i> on the day before a student embarks on his or her career in either a regional technical college or university.  We will be monitoring that situation, as will the parents.</P>
    <P>Given the new scenario, would the Minister not have been wiser to take extra time to deal with this far more comprehensively and to have had the report, which we could have all studied. We could than have come in here with proposals.  The social partners in the education would have had a chance to dissect the report and they would have come back in with positive proposals for the Minister to implement.  I wonder if it is premature for the Minister to embark on a huge operation next September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that his Department are pursuing the formal linkup with various schools between Dublin City University, <Col N="2339" /> Trinity College Dublin and Tallaght. Will the Minister consider extending that to the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology where there are many specific useful courses?  Kevin Street and Bolton Street, for instance, have courses in the areas of engineering construction and electronics.  The College of Catering, Cathal Brugha Street, caters for a wide variety of activities.  Those colleges are located in the heart of the city and they are accessible to everybody.  They are located in areas where we probably need to try to break the mould of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Could I refer to the point made by Senator Jackman in relation to the Revenue Commissioners?  That is a crucial area in establishing a transparent and equitable system.  I welcome the fact that penalties are being imposed now for falsification of forms and so on.  The point still remains that we would need to know what level of checking up of applications by the Revenue Commissioners will take place.  We would require fairly substantial monitoring of the system to make it worthwhile.  If the chance of being caught out is slim, obviously there will be inequity.  There is an inequitable system in relation to the PAYE and other sectors applying for third level grants.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to publish an annual report of the findings of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to all the local authorities in this area and in regard to the higher education awards also?  That would be perhaps the only sure way of ensuring that we have a transparent system so that we could view the statistics which came out as the Revenue Commissioners did their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of space in the colleges, that needs to be dealt with through the modularisation of courses.  I know it is being discussed in the Green Paper.  It needs to be treated with great caution.  We would have courses where people would study for a period of time and then go elsewhere or do different courses in module form and that would have a credit system built into it.  The experience of that is certainly mixed.  It <Col N="2340" /> is something that we have not been used to in this country.  It is something which happens quite a lot in Britain and in America.  There certainly is quite a variety of opinion among educationalists as to whether or not it has a great value in terms of the equality of education it bestows.  I would not like to see our system become fragmented, with a dilution in the quality of our graduates and the quality of our courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Jackman asked me a few questions with regard to the efficiency of the Revenue Commissioners. I know what the Senator is getting at, but I have no doubt about their efficiency in this area of income assessment.  In so far as we have any top experts on it, the Revenue Commissioners is where they are.</P>
      <P>On the question of assets, that is not included in this phase of the criteria reforms.  All we are doing here is bringing the Revenue in to the income assessment area.  The asset based question is a very complex one.  It extends not just to education but to social welfare and a whole range of other areas.  I have undertaken to look at that between now and September 1993.  I was keen to get something up and running this year, which we have done.  Assets are not included in the current criteria, but I would not rule out looking at that over the next few months in preparation for them next year.  It is a very complex area, as the Senator will know.</P>
      <P>On the question of accountants for local authorities, we have regular discussions with local authorities about these matters.  There is always pressure on for staff.  I will review the overall staff at local authority level in the context of these grants.  I cannot raise any expectations that I can fund additional staffing for them.  If I am satisfied from talking to them that a major difficulty arises here and there, I will see what arrangements can be made for that local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the final arbiter and whether it is the Revenue Commissioners or the local authorities, the job is firmly with the local authorities.  The local authorities <Col N="2341" /> are the people who make the decision.  The Revenue Commissioners are in aid of the local authorities, as it were.  In the final analysis the local authorities will have to take on board the advice and opinions of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have raised the question of speed.  I have undertaken to look at the cash flow aspect of student grants as soon as I get an opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about linkages with the Dublin Institute of Technology. That is a good idea and I will discuss it with them.  I believe they are doing something in that area but I am not clear what.  Now the legislation is in place and the new board are up and running, I will discuss with them whether they can take on a similar project as envisaged by Trinity College, the Tallaght Regional Technical College, etc.</P>
    <P>He asked also about the role of the Revenue.  The onus will be on the applicant to make a full declaration of income on the basis of precise instructions.  The purpose of bringing in Revenue, apart from their expertise, is to demonstrate that we are serious about the declarations made.  There is no formal although there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that people are not declaring proper incomes.</P>
    <P>We want to make it clear that there are penalties and the onus is on the applicant to make a clear declaration of their income because it can now be double checked not only by the local authority but by the Revenue Commissioners. Applicants should be aware that they are not making declarations only to the local authorities, they may also be making them to the Revenue Commissioners. That is an important tightening up of this system and it is only fair to people who approach it properly.</P>
    <P>The question of modulisation is complex. Under the umbrella of the Green Paper we should discuss at greater length the question of fragmentation, credit transfer and how that affects the quality of degrees.</P>

In any case, the Revenue Commissioners would probably let me have a report as to how the scheme is proceeding.  One could consider publishing policy reports and some form of progress reports on how the role of the Revenue Commissioners is working. I do not want to commit myself to the Revenue Commissioners coming out with a report on the various groups.  That may not be the way to do it.  It might be better to let me have a report from an educational point of view, not from a revenue hunting point of view.  I would prefer to hold on that until I see what their reaction to their work is.  I would favour giving some form of information and I will do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask this question because the local authorities are the experts in dealing with grant processing. They have been doing it very effectively for a considerable number of years and they would be dealing with smaller numbers, whereas the Revenue Commissioners have a plethora of <Col N="2343" /> applications before them.  While it is important that they liaise with each other, I think the local authorities have been hamstrung by limitations pursuing an applicant whom they feel is not bona fide and obviously the Revenue Commissioners will be able to help them in that area.  That is very welcome.  It would be important for the Minister to speak immediately to the local authorities in order to streamline what will have to happen to ensure that all students get their grants on time in September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister, particularly in the light of European Union, would consider including open university courses, IPA correspondence courses &mdash; which now cost £2,000 &mdash; and students pursuing courses other than those covered in the Bill would be grant aided.  I am being constructive because we do not expect things to remain static. Another area would be satellite courses perhaps co-operating with the UK because there is no language barrier.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look also at distance learning as this would help to keep people in their own localities.  I would see no problem with a student in Mayo or Wexford for instance, counties which do not have a third level institution, pursuing a course through distance learning. We know from research that economic activity is stimulated by graduates staying in their own area, and the study courses could be linked with UCD, UCG, etc.  I am asking the Minister to consider this so that he would not have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas to introduce such courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one post-graduate MBA <Col N="2344" /> course for mature students who are working in the University of Limerick.  We have to look forward and try to stay ahead of the posse.  I am concerned about four areas &mdash; open university; IPA correspondence courses, and the £2,000 fee makes this inaccessible for the unemployed; satellite courses; and distance learning.  I hope the Minister will keep this in mind.</P>
    <P>I notice a tremendous movement of students into the humanities.  Is the reasoning behind connected with cost? Arts, unlike science or engineering courses, is not as expensive in terms of equipment, laboratory use, etc.  Has this new surge towards the humanities more to do with the cost factor and taking students from the live register than with a love of the humanities?  These are general questions but I would like the Minister to respond to the question of opening up courses for mature students so that we will be in line with our European neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that mature students who are already attending approved courses and will continue in those courses in the 1992-93 academic year, will be eligible to apply for grants. These students will also benefit from the substantial increases in the income eligibility limits which were announced recently by the Minister.  They will also benefit from the Bill's provision that any mature student who secures a place in a third level course will be regarded as satisfying the academic attainment requirements for the award of a grant.  In the regulations which the Minister will be required to make under this legislation, will it be possible to make any exceptions in the case of mature students who have already secured a third level qualification or who completed part of a third level course leading to a third level qualification or, indeed, who may have participated in a third level course outside the country?  Take, for example, the case of a mature student who pursued a third level course in a seminary and secured a third level qualification without the benefit of a grant.  If that person subsequently <Col N="2345" /> decides not to continue in a clerical role, but to re-enter the lay workforce, will he be entitled to a grant as a mature student if he decides that his only means of securing employment would be to return to third level and secure an additional qualification or, perhaps, finish the qualification he was pursuing at the time he decided to opt out?  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this section and the amendment that extended the system to those who are at present within the system as mature students.  Once a mature student has the leaving certificate, satisfies age and income requirements, and has obtained a place, there should be no obstacle. There is no need to further divide it into categories and the amendments that Senator Jackman and I sought to introduce are unnecessary because the broad definition of mature students seems to encompass what we were referring to. Senator Mullooly put it very well when he said somebody may have been in a seminary and engaged in a course of studies that could have led to a post-graduate qualification.  A person could have done a third level course outside the country many years peviously, may have engaged in a form of employment and become unemployed and then found the third level qualification was irrelevant to present needs.  In that case a mature student may wish to avail of the grant to continue his or her education.  Can the Minister clarify that that is covered in the Bill?</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jackman that distance learning should be incorporated into the system.  If somebody went abroad to do a module of studies would such people be covered by the grant scheme here?  Can there be a link up with some of the European programmes that are coming onstream now &mdash; such as the Erasmus programme or Lingua programme or any future programmes &mdash; between local authority grants and funding from Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, <Col N="2346" /> I welcome this provision.  I appreciate Senator Jackman's concern about distance learning.  Senator Mullooly made a very good point in relation to a specific category of people who may seek a total change of direction in relation to future employment.  There is also a category in which the vocational education committees were very much imvolved over a number of years.  One specific course, diploma in social science, was undertaken in quite a number of community colleges and vocational schools in the Munster region.</P>
      <P>In relation to the whole area of adult education and the necessity for certification a substantial number of people came back into the education system, through those types of courses.  Having got a taste for further education they would welcome the opportunity to do a degree or some form of third level course. This would entail a substantial amount of money.  One has to recognise that courses of three hours duration each night for three nights per week cost people money but if they wanted to further their careers in terms of full-time education it would cost a greater amount.  I would expect that those mature students would not be precluded from taking on those courses and would not be excluded from this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education would approve it.  That is a rapidly developing area and it is one about which I want to develop my thinking.  I am advised that regulations are not necessary under this legislation.  Under the provisions of the 1968 Act there is power to make regulations.  On reflection, it might have been useful to have such powers here but at this juncture it is not essential to insert them.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly and Senator Costello asked me about the exceptions to the scheme.  I want to make it clear that the scheme which exists can be changed without coming back to the Dáil or the Seanad.  There is provision to develop and amend this scheme within certain parameters without necessarily legislating. The present legislation and the 1968 Act refers to first-time students.  If it is that person's first time at third level then he or she can apply for and receive the grant provided the means test is met. That person can be someone who goes back to do a BA and then an MA and they will get the grants for both degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no bar on post-graduate work. The test under the scheme as at present drawn up is for a first time student.  For example, a person who would be ruled out would be one who does a BA, comes back and wants to do a BComm. We have drawn the line at that point as we cannot do everything.  This is the first time mature students have been formally recognised in legislation.  It extends the grants to them but it is asking too much to pin down every corner.  That may develop in time.  At this stage our duty is to ensure that somebody who comes back into third level education can obtain a <Col N="2348" /> degree or a qualification.  We have to stop somewhere.</P>
    <P>I take the points that have been made but it is simply a matter of where we draw the line.  I have taken the view that our duty is to permit someone to get a qualification. I do not think it is our duty to carry on that assistance and help them get a second qualification at the same level.  They may do a BA, then a BComm and then come back the next year and do a BSc.  One may ask, why not?  There is no real answer to that. Education is always useful, always important and always valued, but from the point of view of funding the State will support them in getting one qualification at that level but will not extend that support to another qualification at the same level.</P>
    <P>Many queries and anomalies will arise. All I can say to the House at this stage is that it is a brand new scheme and we will have to see how it works.  If anomalies appear we will look at them.  I will see if I have power to amend the scheme to include the category referred to earlier. However, there is no automatic exclusion in the legislation of the type of person referred to by Senator Costello.  There are many examples that could be given but the basic point is that if a person has a qualification at one level, a B.Comm., for example, the State will not help that person to get a BA.  Anomalies will arise and we will monitor them and, in so far as we can, we will take account of them.</P>

    <P>Question proposed:&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the continued development of the Industrial Credit Corporation plc.  It allows for an increase in the amount of borrowings which the corporation may undertake.  The Bill also provides for a change in the name of the Industrial Credit Corporation to ICC Bank plc., for the supervision of the company by the Central Bank, for revised principal objects of the company, for the company to amend their memorandum and articles of association to accord with the changes in the Bill and for some technical matters.</P>
      <P>The ICC's current borrowing limit of £1,000 million, which is also the amount which may be guaranteed by the Minister, has almost been reached.  This limit was introduced under the terms of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1990.  I should point out that borrowing includes deposits with the company along with borrowing in the normal sense.  The Bill provides for an increase in the borrowing limit to £1,300 million but leaves the guarantee limit unchanged at £1,000 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> This Bill marks a departure therefore in that the increased amount of £300 million in ICC's borrowing powers will not be guaranteed by the State.  It reflects the policy which has been in operation for some years of reducing the Exchequer's exposure through guarantees to commercial State bodies in so far as that can be achieved.  Steps will be taken by ICC to ensure that the two types of borrowing will be clearly segregated and identified by lenders and depositors.  I wish to make it clear that there is no change in relation to existing lenders and depositors with the ICC; their funds continue to be fully covered by the State guarantee already in place.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the detailed provisions of the Bill, I should like to give the House an indication of developments in relation to the corporation since 1990, when a Bill to increase ICC's borrowing limits was last before this House.</P>
    <P>ICC are a merchant bank of some standing, particularly in the small and medium sized business sector, where they have most of their customer base.  ICC have been developing along satisfactory lines.  They have enjoyed a consistent run of profitability since their incorporation and have paid dividends to the Exchequer over many years.  After tax profits in 1991 were £5.86 million and dividend payments increased from £1.4 million to £1.8 million.  These assets amounted to over £1 billion at the year end.  ICC recently published their half year figures, which showed a steady performance in profits after tax of £3.27 million and a continuation of their interim dividend, yielding over £700,000 to the Exchequer.  The chairman stated at the release of these figures that he expected a satisfactory outcome for the year, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    <P>ICC recently withdrew from activities which were not providing an adequate return, such as hire purchase, leasing and fund management.  They are now concentrating on their core activities &mdash; term lending and trade finance to small and medium size business, treasury including foreign exchange and venture capital.  In addition, they will continue their involvement <Col N="2351" /> as an adviser in corporate finance activities.  The ICC are adopting a prudent approach to the growth of their assets rather than a push for growth; they are concentrating largely on working their existing assets to maximum effect. I am confident that the trend towards full commerciality of the ICC, which has been ongoing for some time, will continue under the direction of the new chairman, whom I recently appointed. The provisions of this Bill will help the corporation to maintain their present steady progress and enable them to meet the challenges of the post-1992 situation in the financial services area.</P>
    <P>My predecessor announced in May 1990 that he was inviting firms to tender for a consultancy assignment on the future options available in relation to the ICC.  Subsequently the consultants report that ICC would require additional capital in the years ahead which would not necessarily be available from the Exchequer and without which the future development of the company could be restricted.  They found that there was no compelling strategic reason for the continued retention of the shares in ICC in State ownership.  They therefore recommended that the Minister should sell his entire shareholding in ICC.  The Government accepted that the option of a sale of the State's shareholding in ICC should be explored further and the consultants were employed &mdash; on a no sale no fee basis &mdash; to assess the prospects for a sale. However, no suitable purchaser of the State's shares in ICC has emerged so far. I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been some significant developments in the State banking sector since legislation relating to the ICC was last before this House.  The trustee savings banks have now amalgamated. Legislation extending, <i>inter alia,</i> the areas of business that ACC can engage in was passed earlier this year.  It will be obvious that the main sections of this Bill follow closely the lines of the ACC Bank Act, 1992.  It is important to recognise, however, that there is still a substantial difference between the ICC <Col N="2352" /> and the ACC Bank in that the former is a merchant bank concentrating on the business sector with few retail outlets, whereas the ACC Bank is now largely a retail bank with a traditional concentration on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>There has been suggestions that the State's banking activities should be amalgamated, and perhaps sold to the private sector.  A simple merger of the ACC and the ICC has also been suggested.  I am keeping the various options available to me under review.  All I can say at this stage is that I am not ruling out any particular course of action, including a sale of ICC, should a suitable purchaser emerge.</P>
    <P>As regards developments in the banking industry generally in recent years, we had a very interesting and thorough debate here on 11 June last.  As I indicated then, legislation for the building societies, the Trustee Savings Banks, the ACC and now ICC has been introduced by the Government over the past few years.  The EC Second Banking Directive will open up the Irish market to further EC competition.  Steps have been taken &mdash; such as lowering primary and secondary liquidity requirements, the adjustments to the DIRT tax and new arrangements for the bank levy &mdash; aimed at improving the competitiveness of Irish banking in the new environment.  The more stable economic and monetary conditions that will result from full Economic and Monetary Union will help Irish business, including the banks.  The completion of the internal market and greater economic and monetary integration in the Community will create opportunities as well as challenges.  The more competitive that Irish banks are in their domestic market, the more likely it is that they will be competitive in the broader European market.  The financial institutions &mdash; not least the ICC &mdash; seem to me to be keenly aware of the need to increase their competitiveness in the light of the challenges ahead.  Size is not necessarily the major impediment, depending on the segment of the banking market being sought by our domestic institutions, including ICC, ACC and the <Col N="2353" /> TSB.  Indeed, some of our financial institutions, despite their relatively small size, have made good progress in markets abroad.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank and my Department are working to ensure that we have a healthy and competitive banking sector which will be capable of meeting the challenges ahead.  The availability of capital &mdash; including working capital and venture capital &mdash; from the banks, particularly for small and medium sized firms, is an issue frequently raised in recent months, not least in the debate here on 11 June. As I indicated to Senators during that debate, the Central Bank have investigated this matter at my Department's request and have assured me that there is no evidence that the banks are operating a credit squeeze.  Bank lending is not constrained by capital requirements or liquidity conditions.  However, both borrowers and lenders have become more cautious.  It is my belief that while there are ample funds available for sound viable projects, it can be difficult to obtain finance for the more high risk type venture.</P>
    <P>While the provision of working capital and equity finance for small and medium sized enterprises is a commercial matter for the individual banks concerned, I have exhorted the banks to act in a positive way to assist Irish business.  I will be keen to monitor the banks ongoing response in this area.  I am glad to note the recent initiative by the Small Firms Association in securing a particular scheme for its members with one of the main banking groups.  It is notable also that ICC have long operated a venture capital arm.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that the banks have made available £10 million under the young entrepreneurs scheme.  In the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress the four associated banks agreed in December last year to provide a further £15 million for the creation or development of small and medium sized businesses with employment potential. These schemes offer loans at reduced rates of interest and do not require personal security from suitable applicants. <Col N="2354" /> More than 220 projects have so far been assisted under these schemes.  These are new business projects which in all likelihood would not have proceeded without the availability of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Also in this general connection I can indicate that my officials have been holding discussions with the life assurance and unit fund industries regarding the impact of the DIRT changes on their products. The importance of equity investments for small and medium sized Irish industry is one of the major factors to be taken into account in regard to any changes which may emerge from the current discussions.</P>
    <P>To return to the provisions of the Bill, I have already referred to the fact that the increase in the borrowing limit of £300 million provided for in this Bill will not be guaranteed by the State.  Following the enactment of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1990, my Department in conjunction with ICC undertook an examination of this question in so far as it relates to the corporation. As a result of this examination I am satisfied that the corporation can &mdash; and indeed should &mdash; tap the market for unguaranteed deposits.  I wish to repeat that the position of depositors and lenders who already have funds with ICC is not affected by this change.</P>
    <P>Following the passing of this Bill, ICC propose to establish a subsidiary company which will take deposits on an unguaranteed basis from the outset. Deposits with the parent company will continue to be guaranteed within the limit of £1 billion.  In this way ICC will distinguish clearly between deposits which are guaranteed by the State and those which are not guaranteed.  This arrangement will enable ICC to continue their normal business, but their further growth will be funded from the new unguaranteed deposits through the proposed new subsidiary.  The ICC will underpin the subsidiary with their resources.</P>
    <P>ICC are of the view &mdash; and I accept their view as they are the ones who have to operate the arrangements on the ground &mdash; that it is essential to adopt this structure.  They have done their research <Col N="2355" /> on this matter and their considered conclusion is that this is the arrangement which will best maintain confidence in the bank.  Any other arrangement could create confusion about the level of guarantee possessed by a particular depositor.  It is very important not to create any uncertainities in a banking situation and ICC's proposals in this regard are designed to maintain full confidence in the ICC.</P>
    <P>I might add that this arrangement is not part of the Bill itself, but I thought that it would be of interest to Senators to know how ICC propose to adapt to the change in the guarantee arrangements.  I am confident that ICC are in a sufficiently strong financial position to make a success of this substantial change in the manner of their funding.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the definitions section and is self explanatory.  Section 2 provides for a change of name of &ldquo;ICC&rdquo; to &ldquo;ICC Bank plc&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; in ICC's title serves to emphasise its commercial orientation.  It is seen as helpful from a marketing and development viewpoint. Also, in international terms, it is desirable that the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; be used for ease of recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the application of certain supervisory provisions contained in Central Bank legislation to the ICC at a date, or dates, to be determined by ministerial order and after consultation with the Central Bank.  The supervisory provisions will be administered by the Central Bank itself; in other respects I, as Minister for Finance, will continue to exercise my existing functions with regard to ICC.  The proposed Central Bank supervision is in line with Government policy in this area, namely, that given the small scale of resources available for financial supervision of deposit-taking institutions in Ireland and given EC requirements for the regulation of financial markets, it is appropriate that a body such as the ICC should come within the prudential supervision of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>This provision is similar to a provision <Col N="2356" /> in the ACC Bank Act, 1992.  The change has already occurred in the case of the Trustee Savings Bank and building societies and is part of the consolidation process that is required by the imminent completion of the internal market in financial markets, with its attendant increase in competition.  ICC are fully supportive of this new relationship with the Central Bank and see it as an essential step on the way to becoming a competitive banking institution subject to the same rules and regulations as the other credit institutions supervised by the Central Bank.  ICC have for some time now been submitting financial reports to the Central Bank on an informal basis similar to those which the bank requires of other credit institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is concerned with making explicit the powers of the corporation to engage in normal modern banking and financial transactions and to provide associated services.  The existing principal objects of ICC date back to the 1933 Industrial Credit Act, which established the corporation, as amended in the 1971 Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act. These provisions required that the principal objects of the company should include dealings of the corporation with trade or industry in the State.  There will be no change in ICC's traditional role as a merchant bank primarily for the small and medium sized indigenous business sector except that the scope of their operations will be somewhat enlarged.  The section also provides that the exercise of the revised objects may be made subject to such conditions or limitations on amounts as may be determined by the Minister for Finance or the Central Bank, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The section is similar to section 5 of the ACC Bank Act, 1992.  Given that both State banks are expected to operate on a commercial basis and that both will be subject to Central Bank prudential supervision, it is desirable that similar principal objects should apply to both banks.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an increase in the borrowing powers of the ICC from £1,000 million to £1,300 million.  The last <Col N="2357" /> increase was in 1990, and the increase now proposed should last for a number of years, given ICC's concentration on existing assets, rather than the pursuit of asset growth.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires the ICC to amend their memorandum and articles of association to bring them into line with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a technical measure which extends the scope of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, as amended, and the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, as amended, to ICC.  These Acts already apply to banks and building societies, and to ACC Bank, and it is desirable that ICC should be covered similarly.  The first part of the section relates to the acceptance of bank records as evidence in the courts, and the second part to the rules relating to bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill presents no difficulty for Fine Gael.  It is fairly mundane and is similar to many Bills relating to Government banks such as the ICC and the ACC that have gone through the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the main purpose of the Bill was to provide for the continued development of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Given that the corporation are a State bank, it is obvious that there will be occasions when it will be necessary to come before the Legislature to make provisions in line with development.  We want to assist in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill allows for an increase in the amount of borrowings that the corporation may undertake.  That is accepted.  While under the Bill the ICC may increase their borrowing limit to £1,300 million from £1,000 million, it is interesting that the extra £300 million will not be covered by guarantee.  That is a welcome innovation.  We have to move away from the notion of continued Government guarantees for banks and the establishment of Government controlled banks in the commercial marketplace in a different way from the way <Col N="2358" /> commercial banks are set up.  I know that the intention within the ICC is to set up a separate structure by way of a separate company to administer the increased borrowing so that the issue will not be clouded for depositors already investing under a guarantee arrangement.  New criteria will be laid down for future lenders.</P>
    <P>The change of name is a non-issue; it is a marketing feature.  The title &ldquo;Industrial Credit Corporation&rdquo; may seem a little cumbersome and, perhaps in this age of marketing &ldquo;whiz-kiddery&rdquo; the change to &ldquo;ICC Bank plc&rdquo; is a more jazzy title.</P>
    <P>The supervision of the company by the Central Bank is in line with the Government policy of seeing that State banks compete with private sector banks on fairly identical terms.  Such a regulation is necessary.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned, many of the elements dealt with in this Bill have a parallel in the legislation for the ACC that went through the House some time ago.  The main scope for debate in relation to this issue is not so much the narrow confines of the Bill but rather the implications of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The most serious matter was the decision in principle taken to carry out in conjunction with the consultants, Stokes Kennedy Crowley, an in-depth assessment of the Industrial Credit Corporation. The consultants were also asked to make recommendations to the board of the ICC, recommendations that would be of compelling interest also to the Government.  The consultants had no difficulty in recommending that the Minister sell all his shares in the corporation. Given the movement towards privatisation that is evident these days, the Cabinet subsequently agreed in principle to that recommendation.  Matters were taken a little further and the ICC were then bidding for a suitor, Government shares were being sold, leading to the privatisation of the bank, a fairly dramatic development that might have been unthinkable some years ago.</P>
    <P>Enormous changes are taking place within the ICC.  Initially the ICC were set up as a State bank and were narrowly confined to the industrial sector, as indicated <Col N="2359" /> by their name.  The original title of the bank, which still remains, was the &ldquo;Industrial Credit Corporation&rdquo;, not the &ldquo;Commercial Credit Corporation&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Business Credit Corporation&rdquo;.  The primary purpose of the corporation was to be a main arm of Government in the industrial sector.  There was a structure of funding companies, an equity structure, a borrowing structure and, possibly, a Government grants structure.  An element within that was credit.</P>
    <P>In the early years it was recognised as an extremely difficult task to get industrial projects off the ground without the provision of a benevolent bank that had State support and whose <i>raison d'etre</i> was to work in that sector.  The huge changes that have occurred probably reflect the change in the structure of Irish industry. In the early years the ICC were heavily involved in the funding of many indigenous Irish industries and in that regard they performed a very major and satisfactory role.  That kind of banking was very difficult because it was concerned with a high risk sector of the economy. With the movements towards free trade with Britain and the European Community that objective became more and more difficult.  A massive investment in Ireland through multi-national companies and the activities of the IDA also had to be taken into consideration.  To a large extent the multi-national companies were not banking with banks such as the ICC.</P>
    <P>There was a major levelling of Irish industry through European Community membership and substantial rationalisation in the textile sector and there was a change in the ICC's attitude towards business.  The portfolio of the ICC today reflects a much smaller proportion of the total lending, short, medium and long term, involved in the sector for which they were established, namely the industrial sector.  It is obvious that before there was a change in investment there had to be a change of policy within the ICC.  Before there was ever a question of privatisation, of changing the name or of getting involved in marketing, <Col N="2360" /> the corporation which was set up by the State to bank industry gradually became much more involved in commercial banking in areas unrelated to the <i>raison d'être</i> for which they were established.  The ICC became heavily involved in hire purchase, leasing and all kinds of commercial activities in the services sector.  Those activities had nothing to do with the industrial sector.  Arrangements were entered into with pubs, shops, restaurants and hotels, activities far removed from the bank's original purpose.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that with the ICC in the marketplace and with a supposed huge number of people invited to consider purchase, there is no buyer.  The Minister stated that no suitable purchaser of the State's shares in the ICC has emerged so far.  One of the problems is that measured in either international terms or in Irish terms &mdash; when one considers the size of our two big banks, the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland &mdash; the ICC are a very small bank.  The Minister referred to several options the State might have in this area.  He talked of a possible merger with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That is what is needed here, given the relatively small size of the ICC and the ACC; the fact that the ACC are becoming involved in mainstream commercial banking activity to a greater extent; the problems in agriculture and that the ICC are adopting an identical policy in which a much lesser proportion of lending is in the industrial rather than the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>Where there is this convergence of the two banks in the centre, and given that they are both relatively small banks, it would seem to me that the most rational approach the State could adopt if they are interested in privatisation &mdash; and I would support the privatisation of these two banks &mdash; would be to positively seek such a merger.  We must consider the convergence and the fact that these two banks are dealing with the State and know how to deal with Government.  The idea of knocking heads together might not commend itself to some people working within the system when one thinks of <Col N="2361" /> the personnel issues involved, but objectively, from a Government point of view it might be the best route to take &mdash; to get the ACC and the ICC moving together, to privatise a merged single bank rather than attempting to sell off two relatively small banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the venture capital issue and the fact that the ICC are involved in it.  That is one of the biggest problems confronting the Minister today. We talk about creating jobs here, but it is a very difficult environment.  Sometimes there is a very hostile and conservative attitude to risk in this country.  The Government abolished NADCORP, which was a State venture capital agency. I regret that very much, because a body like NADCORP was established specifically to get into venture capital only.  I do not think the record of banks becoming involved in venture capital is all that good, because you are talking about training, which is completely different. If one is trained for banking or for the disciplines associated with it, one is being trained to adopt an attitude in the assessing of high risk ventures which is not the appropriate training for this area.  I have seen cases where banks involved in venture capital simply continued to encounter huge problems because their personnel are trained as bankers and not as venture capitalists.  I take a serious view that the present Government do not have a venture capital arm.  It is not good enough to say that there is a venture capital arm in the ICC, that that is the arm of Government in the venture capital sector, because at the end of the day it is a bank which is behaving more and more commercially in competition with the commercial banks and commercial interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have to re-examine this entire venture capital issue.  There are huge problems in the Irish industrial economy, particularly when one sees the huge proportion of industrial wealth now held in the multinational sector or how dismal is indigenous Irish performance in the industrial sector.  Let us make a comparison with some other countries, such as Finland and Sweden.  Finland was <Col N="2362" /> a country decimated by World War II. They fought both sides in the war and had huge war debts to be paid to the victors.  They have harsh climatic conditions. The Finns have legislation which will not allow foreign companies to come in and take majority participation in industrial companies.  Yet from a nil base they were able to build up an indigenous industry.  This was built by the Finns through technical institutes, through learning, through banks, where their resources and activities are much more in the hands of their own people than are ours.</P>
    <P>To be frank, for a long time I have not regarded the ACC and ICC as benevolent banks or arms of Governments. In the morning I would happily hive them off into the private commercial sector.  I would not see them as being special, with a special brief, because that has not been happening.  The gap remains.  The Minister should take a very close look at the dearth of available fresh capital.  I think he should agree with me that, for all the reasons to do with the wrong kind of training, a bank is not the appropriate structure.  There is a glaring need for the State to look at some type of structure similar to NADCORP before that situation can be rectified.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I congratulate the ICC on their success over the years.  I know their recently retired chief executive. I know their present chief executive fairly well and admire him very much. ICC are a competent organisation and I wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the purpose of this Bill is to update the activities of ICC set up originally under the 1930 Act. A lot of adaptations have taken place in the interim period, the latest being that of 1990 when the Minister of the day extended the limit on their borrowing from £800,000 to £1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being sought under this Bill is an expansion of their activities into other areas.  There were and are restrictions on them at present.  The Bill suggests that their scope is too limited, that they should expand from the definition of what is <Col N="2363" /> described as the small and medium sized business sector.  Under the provisions of this Bill the ICC will be able to deal with the professional sector, including solicitors, architects and engineers.  That will necessitate new contacts, which it is to be hoped will ultimately increase their present volume of business.</P>
    <P>While the Bill will bring the operations of the ICC under the supervision of the Central Bank, from our experience that will mean little change.  To date they have been providing information to the Central Bank &mdash; a requirement of this Bill &mdash; which I do not think should pose any difficulty for ICC.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that the ICC have found themselves approaching their borrowing limit of £1 billion.  Therefore, it was expected that within three years they would reach their current limit of £1.3 billion.  Obviously, we will be exhorting the Minister, if ICC are still in State ownership when that time comes, to be in a position to cater for that eventuality.</P>
    <P>I understand also that ICC want to remain a specialist bank in the smaller and medium sized business sector.  In fairness to them, it has to be stated that they have been a resounding success.  For instance, last year they paid a dividend to the State of £1.8 million, not an insignificant sum to the State coffers.  My understanding is that with the increase in the borrowing limit this dividend will increase substantially.  We should never forget that they were subjected to a tax charge of £1.5 million last year, giving to the Exchequer a total yield of £3.3 million.</P>
    <P>Interesting points have been raised about privatisation.  It is interesting to examine the valuation of the company. It has fluctuated from between £45 million to £75 million.  That raises the whole question of what the Government should do with this bank.  Should they privatise if?  If we look at it in the cold, calm light of day we see that, even if we were to spend 50 per cent of it we would still have an asset worth in the region of £35 million.  Any Minister for Finance will have to look seriously at that option and <Col N="2364" /> ask why he should hold on to a State asset which can yield the Exchequer £35 million almost immediately.</P>
    <P>I understand that the time may not be right for flotation, given the recent experience of Guinness Peat Aviation. Under the new provisions it might be advisable to allow this bank to extend its activities and to become even more attractive and more commercial.</P>
    <P>Of course the question of their amalgamation with ACC arises.  If that occurred it would allow the base of operations of the two banks to be extended and ensure that in the event of privatisation we had a far more valuable asset to float and that they would have representation in almost all our large towns and cities.  The Minister must seriously examine that prospect. Between them they would be an extremely valuable and immediate asset to the State, something from which the Exchequer could benefit while at the same time continuing to reap the benefit of profits from a privately owned operation.</P>
    <P>As a result of the expansion in the building societies, the trustee savings banks and others, the financial services market is competitive.  It will become even more competitive and we can be proud of the achievements of the ICC in looking after this specialist sector.</P>
    <P>Many people will complain how expeditiously they move against businesses in difficulty; I understand they topped the league at one stage, but to be commercially viable nowadays a bank must look at their operation and ensure that they have a return for their money. However, as a State enterprise we can all be proud that they achieved what they set out to do.</P>
    <P>Given that we have expanded both ACC and ICC the Minister should allow them to become much more commercial, at the same time keeping in mind that the amalgamation will ensure greater competition in the financial services market. It will increase the State asset value of both companies and when the time is right I will exhort the Minister to consider amalgamation and privatisation.  I have <Col N="2365" /> no difficulty in recommending this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to be a measure to make the ICC a more attractive proposition for privatisation.  Their new name, the ICC Bank Ltd., creates the right aura for that element of society who, from time to time, like to purchase a bank.  The prospect of the privatisation of the ICC must be seen in the context of the experience of recent privatisation attempts in this country.  I do not want to rake over the painful history of these privatisation traumas; suffice it to say that the public's confidence in the whole process has been very seriously eroded. The decent and correct thing for the Minister to do now is to restrain himself from rushing down the road to further privatisation, even if this haste is carefully disguised in the form of an innocuous Bill which is designed to give the right impression to people in the financial world who are able to understand the process of financial wink and nod.  These wise financial people understand only too well the political contortions that a good Minister has to go through.  These are the people who get value for money from the weekend newspapers where the finer points of the political game are explained to them.  Indeed, on that score, to digress slightly, a particularly curious columnist appears in one of these newspapers &mdash; a colleague in either the Minister's House or this House &mdash; and expresses his or her omniscient views at great length.  It is remarkable that a politician with that amount of column space keeps his or her name secret.  Maybe someone as pious and knowledgeable as the Minister might be able to solve the mystery.</P>

      <P>I had not noticed and I read it most weeks.  The provisions of the Bill give explicit powers to the ICC to provide a full range of banking and associated financial services.  As far as I can see that appears to be another move to clear the decks and get rid of unwanted restrictions <Col N="2366" /> and baggage attached to the ICC which those people who favour privatisation find troublesome and inconvenient and indeed an inhibitory factor in the whole process of privatisation.</P>
      <P>The process today is the third act of a three part serial involving the privatisation of three banks, the ACC, the Trustee Savings Bank and now the ICC. The least one would expect is that the Minister would have left a longer interval before getting back on the course of privatisation. The aims of the Bill are secondary to the objective of facilitating Irish industrialists trying to develop the economy.  The main role of this legislation, introduced on the last day before the recess, is quite simply to polish up the family silver prior to it being flogged for a quick financial fix.  Indeed, the extent of the financial fix involved is fairly small if Senator O'Keeffe was correct when he said that the bank is worth £35 billion.  If he is correct, then it is not a great surprise that the rumours to the effect that nobody is prepared to purchase it appear to be consistent with the value Senator O'Keeffe put on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking process behind the Bill is indicative of the Government's inability to think strategically in relation to the possibilities for linking the existing banking institutions, namely the ACC Bank and the ICC, although I was pleased to hear the Minister at least allude to the fact that this is still a possibility.  If those banks were brought together they could fill a valuable role in the context of the developing Europe and they would have the potential to bring considerable financial benefits to the country from the huge European market which we voted to become an integral part of recently. There has been much criticism, rightly, levelled at the commercial banks because of their lending policies and their reluctance to apparently take any significant risk in relation to their ability to invest and to support industry.  The Irish commercial banks seem to be committed to the idea of restricting their investing and their lending to safe bets.  If this country is to develop there will be a need for what Senator Staunton called &ldquo;a greater <Col N="2367" /> supply of venture capital&rdquo;.  There is a crying need for considerable developments in that area.</P>
    <P>In invigorated new banking group under the indirect control of the State and perhaps in association with some dynamic element of the banking world could provide worthwhile and badly needed competition for our excessively cautious commercial banks.  It is very important when the economic control of this country is rapidly moving to Brussels that we should have a banking group committed to providing venture capital and support for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton was correct when he spoke in terms of the lamentable state of investment in Irish industry and indeed the manner in which Irish industry has performed compared with the levels of performance of the multinational industrial sector located in Ireland.  Our indigenous industry has fallen behind these multinationals to a considerable extent.  Part of that problem relates to the availability of venture capital and another part to the excessively cautious nature of Irish banks.  That is understandable from their point of view because banks exist to make profits for their shareholders and various other proprietors. They do not exist to develop the economy and it is important that the Government put in place the various aspects of a banking service needed to facilitate such development.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at what I believe to be the basic reason behind the introduction of the Bill at this stage.  It is essentially part of a process towards further privatisation and I do not believe that that should be the priority.  In terms of our priorities we should be setting in place a system of banking which will supply venture capital for those Irish industrialists committed to the development of indigenous Irish industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC are a merchant bank of some <Col N="2368" /> standing, particularly in the small and medium sized business sector.  They have played a major role in the financial services and support of Irish businesses for over 60 years.  They see themselves as being involved with customers in a partnership to their mutual advantage.  I have strong views on the banks and their support of industry which helps to create jobs.  Down the years, I have been impressed by ICC and their closeness to their customers.  The company have also accumulated an understanding of business and its needs.  We talk in this House today of changes, and we had a debate recently on banking and my colleagues and I criticised banking in the nation today.</P>
    <P>The ICC have stayed closer to their customers than some of the other banks. With all the changes in the European scene, there are changes also in the banking world, but they aim to build on their strengths to enhance further their position and provide for the financial services and the business sector.  They are involved in cash to tourism, to the food sector, to engineering and to the retail sector.  I pay tribute to the board and their members.  Sometimes it is only the person upfront who gets credit.  The ICC have a good record.  I will leave privatisation issues to people who are more familiar with finance and to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short and it is important. Mr. Michael Quinn, the managing director of ICC recently said:</P>
    <P>Our long experience as a specialist Business Bank laces us in the unique position to partner the growth of Irish enterprise.</P>
    <P>He intends to build further on this specialisation and expertise being entirely focused on servicing the financial needs of business, in particular small and medium-sized business.  Over and over again in this House, I have talked to Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Ministers for Finance and hoped that they would listen to my suggestion that there should be more finance, even small finance, in place to back up Irish industry that got into financial trouble.  I am not <Col N="2369" /> moving away from the Bill, even though I am really referring to the IDA, to finance and to industry.</P>
    <P>This bank has saved some companies that would otherwise have gone to the wall, but sadly we still have not got our act together in protecting and putting in place finance for Irish based and Irish owned companies.  We seem to think that the Irish entrepreneurs are not as good at being industrialists and employers as foreign companies.  They are not listened to by Ministers, officials and the authorities. I have said this over and over again, I will continue to say it until some Minister takes a hard look at home-based industries to ensure that they are given the same if not better concessions than the people who come into the country but if they hit trouble, they leave. Members in this House know of many such cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it to this House.  I hope that in the quieter weeks a couple of Ministers will sit down and listen to me.  Irish industries that need finance would have closed by now but for the fact that they were tough.  I know some of these entrepreneurs.  I am aware of the challenge facing all of us &mdash; the banks, the insurance companies and industry.  This bank has survived and has a good record.  I have no problem with this bank being privatised or left as it is as long as it continues to back small and medium sized businesses that will maintain jobs.  They play a major role in tourism and industry which creates jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Honan's remarks in relation to the need for the banking industry to be more sensitive to the needs of indigenous businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC have a consistent track record as the Minister indicated.  Since its incorporation it has made a profit and has paid dividends to the Exchequer over many years.  It has been a success.  One always wonders why something that is a success has to be tinkered with or changed.  We <Col N="2370" /> would hope that any changes will be for the better.</P>
    <P>According to the annual report of the Director, Mr. Quinn, the ICC's core activities, lending, treasury and venture capital, achieved record profits in the past year.  It was a good year for the ICC.  There were certain limitations in the hire purchase and leasing areas and the Minister was very critical at the time that their performance in these areas was somewhat disappointing.  It is interesting to note that the ICC divested themselves of those activities.  They withdrew from the hire purchase and leasing markets and ceased fund management where they were having difficulties.  That is the mark of a good management team.  As a result in the past six months, they have increased profitability with a pre-tax profit level of 9 per cent and a 6 per cent dividend which is strong by any standards.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated the Exchequer received £1.8 million last year, a sizeable sum.  The Exchequer is doing quite well from what Senator O'Keeffe described as an asset valued at about £35 million if sold on the open market.  The profits in the six months, to end of April, were £4.65 million.  The bank have rectified the difficulties experienced in 1991 and concentrated on the core business, which is the area of lending and venture capital.  They have had enormous success in an area they penetrated over the past three or four years, foreign exchange services and treasury risk management and at present have an 11 per cent growth rate compared with the norm of 2 per cent.  Clearly they are able to identify new areas and cut adrift from loss-making ones.  That is a sign of a very healthy operation and a very healthy management structure.</P>
    <P>The question which Senator Honan focused on is one which we as legislators and partners in the social partnership comprising industry, business, the farming community, the trade union movement workers and the Government must consider.  Her question related to industrial policy and how best we can promote <Col N="2371" /> the policy outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  ICC are a key player in this regard because that is their function, they were set up to provide industrial credit and to specifically target small and medium-sized indigenous industries.  That still remains a major part of their operation, whether in tourism, small manufacturing units or the agri-business, in which the ACC are also involved.  They have been successful in this area as well as in the venture capital area and have done a reasonably good job.</P>
    <P>We should be focusing our attention on some of the larger banks who have more assets but have been extremely cautious in making them available to the Irish investor, industrialist, or developer. We must realise that the banks, particularly the State banks have an enormous responsibility to participate to the full in the development of our infrastructure, and our industrial base so as to create employment opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>Every Minister must focus on this and examine the track record of the banks. The banks promised in the region of £50 million under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> towards the achievement of certain targets.  That is peanuts, as the Minister knows from the various schemes he has introduced to reduce the unemployment figures.  It will not work.  The necessary investment is not being made and jobs are not being created.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is wilting as a result of a lack of investment and in sufficient money from the commercial sector and the failure of the small and medium sized businesses to expand sufficiently.</P>
    <P>The ICC deal to a large extent with this area as well as with group schemes in the State and semi-State sectors.  The teaching and the nursing professions, publicans and many people in the State and semi-State sectors are involved with the ICC.</P>
    <P>The question of how we might improve indigenous investment should be considered by the Minister.  The Minister <Col N="2372" /> when commenting on section 9 said that there have been suggestions that the State's banking activities should be amalgamated, perhaps sold to the private sector and that the simple merger of the ACC and ICC have also been suggested. We have to look at all the options.</P>
    <P>First, on the option to sell the Government attempted to sell ICC last year and as I understand, found no takers.  There simply was not sufficient interest in the open market.  In my view the extra fillip being given in this legislation is directed at attracting the private buyer and investor to ICC.  It is clear that the additional £300 million borrowing limit that is not guaranteed by the State is directed towards operations in the private sector. I imagine the Minister intends to look for private offers.</P>
    <P>It would be a shame if that was to happen.  The ICC have consistently returned a profit to the State.  They have been successful.  In the venture capital area management are level headed, have made good moves, and have cut back where they found themselves in a loss-making situation.  What we have to do is work towards the amalgamation of State corporations, whether ACC, the ICC and the Trustee Savings Bank, all of which have been touched by legislative proposals in the recent past, into a new State financial structure.  In the first instance we need a strong financial base with good financial assets which none have on their own but would have if amalgamated. That is necessary in the European context because competition will be much greater in the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we need it because of Government policy; the policy which this Minister, more than anybody else, enunciated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The thrust of the social partnership is to deal with unemployment, the social problems and the social services.  To resolve our problems we need the fullest co-operation from the banking system, I do not think that has been forthcoming.  One way of doing it is to suggest that these amalgamated corporations, which will be <Col N="2373" /> banks in the full sense of the word, should follow that direction in the future.</P>
    <P>Something I have often wondered about both in the context of the postal services and the post offices is the fact that there are offices around the country that would be an ideal base for a level of banking.  A certain level of banking is taking place.  Let us look at our own municipal and county authorities and the city of Dublin for which Dublin Corporation last year had a budget of £218 million which is a substantial amount of money.  I am sure Dublin County Council had a similar budget.  If we go around the various local authorities we will find that there has been a substantial amount of money &mdash; not less than £1 billion &mdash; going through their hands in the course of a year in the form of their annual budget. I do not see why the local authorities could not have the benefit of the State banking system to deal with the processing of that money rather than the present situation whereby it is put into one bank or the other.  Rather than set up a municipal bank this is an area from which we could be looking for further investment, further indigenous funds which could be used for the purpose of building up local industries.</P>
    <P>Because the new legislation removes the <i>ultra vires</i> rule allowing the local authority to set up their own business, their own enterprise, that is an area on which we could fruitfully focus attention.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the latter option &mdash; not at the privatisation option &mdash; of examining the original function for which the bank was set up, the extended function that has been given to it now, extending the assets further, making it more competitive and refocussing its attention on the development and support of indigenous Irish industry.  The National Development Corporation which has seen lean days in recent years should also be brought into the reckoning here.</P>
    <P>We have a successful operation here in the ICC and I hope the proposals in the Bill will continue to make it more successful in competitive and expansion terms.  I hope the thrust of the bank's <Col N="2374" /> activities will be further refocused on an internal, national capacity as well as on operating on a broader European plain. The bank's assets and investment should be directed towards the alleviation of the unemployment crisis and the Minister for Finance should direct his energies towards improving the strength of the State banking system through amalgamation rather than through privatisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the main provisions of which are to provide for the continued development of the Industrial Credit Corporation, to allow the corporation to increase the amount of borrowing, and also to change the name from the Industrial Credit Corporation to the Industrial Credit Corporation Bank plc. and also to give supervisory power to the Central Bank.  It is very important that our banks would be streamlined, particularly when at the end of the decade we will have to face the biggest change of our lifetime, the introduction of the EMS, when we will have a European Central Bank made up of representatives from all the other banks of the European countries.  This will result in enormous change and it is important that our banks be geared up for it.  We all have our own ideas about banks and banking and very often I think that banks are only concerned about profit margins and the amount of profit they show at the end of the year.  It is important that they show themselves to be profitable but it is also important that they make a major contribution to the development of the economy and particularly industry.  I would like to see the banks paying more attention to native industries because very often those industries are starved for finance.  As public representatives we meet people from time to time who are trying to set up industry and they tell us that they cannot get adequate finance to do so, whereas foreign industrialists coming in seem to be able to get all the concessions they seek provided they are able to create jobs.  I would like to see the banks leaning more towards native industry, giving <Col N="2375" /> more assistance to people who are prepared to make a commitment and who are prepared to create jobs in their own locality because we need something radical like that at present.  Banks should not just be concerned only with the profits they show at the end of the year; they should be concerned about the development of the economy, the creation of jobs and so on.  I would certainly like to see them give more attention to that particular area.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Corporation &mdash; as they have been known up to now &mdash; have given great assistance to small industry: indeed, that was the purpose for which they were set up many years ago.  They have succeeded in bailing out many industries and giving them a helping hand along the way and they still have continued to show profits.  That proves that they have been a good organisation. I hope in the years ahead they will continue to prosper, to help Irish industry and to create employment where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I had a three hour speech but in view of the day that is in it I will abbreviate it.  The Minister has indeed brought in an important Bill and the fact that he is with us and has seen the necessity and importance of getting it through before the end of the session is something to which we in this House should respond by welcoming and passing it this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a particularly appropriate this afternoon that a banking Bill should be passing through because it is an afternoon when everyone has been waiting very intently, as indeed my colleague Senator Hussey has inferred, to hear what the Bundesbank have decided at a very crucial meeting today.  If the rates are being increased, particularly the Lombard rate, that will have very significant effects for banking throughout the rest of the European Community.  It is also an appropriate day to have a banking Bill in this House; it is very relevant also that it is the ICC.  ICC has been one of the success stories of the Irish State and one of the <Col N="2376" /> success stories of Irish banking.  It is appropriate that we in this House should, from time to time, look with a very critical eye upon our banking institutions.  It is also appropriate that we should give them the great credit they deserve in that they have shown outstanding ability within the Irish State.</P>
    <P>The professional ability of our bankers is second to none.  They often have a relatively small staff as compared with their various competitors.  Among those success stories has been the ICC.  I join in sending congratulations to the previous chairmen and boards, the present chairman and his board and the excellent executives and staff of that bank.  I wish them well in the future.  They have suffered under a number of disabilities.  One of these, which is being clarified today, is their title.  I have dealt with this bank on many occasions and have referred to them on many occasions even outside this country.  However, even in London, just next door to us, if you mention &ldquo;industrial corporation&rdquo;, they do not know what you are talking about.  They wonder if it is a discount house or some form of factoring financial institution.  You try to explain to them that it is a merchant bank, that it is not really a merchant bank, however, but does have merchant bank capability.  It is really a little bit overdue that it should have this title of &ldquo;bank&rdquo;.  That is what it is, and a very good one.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant that we have recently put through the ACC Bill and that there have been developments in relation to the trustee savings banks.  It would be reasonable to expect that with the opening up of the banking situation further banking institutions will come into this country, even though the market is a relatively small one.  But for all sorts of reasons it still has certain attractions for other banking institutions.  Whatever may have been the case over the last couple of years regarding privatisation, I think with this Bill and with the development in the monetary system in western Europe it is not unlikely that we will find some foreign banking institution in some way taking a share or co-operating in <Col N="2377" /> the development of the ICC and indeed having some sort of relationship perhaps with the ACC and TSB.</P>
    <P>I am not absolutely convinced that those three institutions, or any two of them, should come together.  They are very different institutions, as the Minister rightly pointed out.  The ACC, for example, is primarily a retail banking institution, which the Industrial Credit Corporation is certainly not.  In terms of size, the actual critical mass size that one would have between ACC, ICC and TSB is not very relevant in banking terms.  Even the combined group would be extremely small.  That does not mean that a small group cannot succeed; but it would be an illusion to imagine that in some way bringing those three together would in itself necessarily make a significant strategic difference.  There might be other reasons for bringing them together.</P>
    <P>While we are on the subject of size, it is again appropriate to be passing this legislation today because it is today that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank have started to totally change what used to be the great banking institution in these islands, the Midland Bank.  It was the great bank over so many years in the United Kingdom and indeed had various associations over here.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to my initial remark about occasionally being critical here of the banks.  I hope the banks will listen to some of this criticism, but they very likely will not.  Maybe someone somewhere or another will actually read what we are saying &mdash; and I think we have had pretty restrained debate both this time and previously. If the banks lose touch with their customers, if they do not listen to this or if they ridicule it or do not bother about it, they may well find happening the sort of change that happened with the Midland Bank, where they ignored, for example, the private retail sector.  Now, too late, they made a desperate attempt to come back and call themselves &ldquo;the listening bank&rdquo; and had all this meretricious public relations campaign. It ended up being taken over by another banking institution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2378" /> It is very much a time of change in the banks.  This Bill, the very last we are looking at in this session, is in fact probably a very important Bill in some of its implications in relation to banking in this country.  I would like to join in welcoming the Minister for Finance on coming into this House on our last day here and bringing in this important Bill.  I join in wishing the Industrial Credit Bank well in the future.  I am sure it will be even more successful than in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators, who on this last day of this session have stayed back to participate in this debate, for their interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Corporation have contributed very well to the economic development of this State for over half a century and I think that Senators who spoke recognised this contribution. I would also like to pay tribute to the excellent work done over the years by Mr. Jim Barton, who spent much of his lifetime in various roles in ICC.  In my earlier job in the Department of Labour I regularly had contact with him on different matters and he was very helpful to the Department over all of those years. I want to express my recognition of his work.  The present chairman, Mr. Redmond, who has taken over since March, is an excellent chairman and I wish him well in the job.</P>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill will add to ICC's capacity to continue their good work.  As Senator O'Keeffe indicated, there is no doubt that ICC have helped many small and medium sized Irish businesses to expand and prosper over the years.  As I said at the outset, ICC are already very close to their statutory borrowing limit and without the increase proposed in this Bill the company's development would come to a halt.  ICC are constantly evolving their services in the light of the changing needs in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill allows for the continued progress of the company in line with modern banking practice.  For example, the change in the name to ICC Bank is <Col N="2379" /> regarded by ICC as a significant improvement in terms of easy recognition of the company as a bank and in terms of their marketing activities.  It does not mean, as one Senator indicated, that I am going to sell it during the summer recess.  That comment is slightly off the wall.  I would tell the Senator that he is wrong.  ICC are already supplying the usual banking returns on an informal basis to the Central Bank and look forward to the formal supervision by the central Bank entailed under section 3 of the Bill.  It is very important, given the need for a coherent and consistent prudential supervisory system for all deposits taken in banking institutions, that ICC should be brought into that system.</P>
    <P>The principle objectives contained in the Bill will make explicit for the first time in the legislation the powers of the ICC to engage in normal modern financial transactions and to provide a full range of financial services.  Senator Staunton went back over some of the work which they have done over the years and I would like to thank him for his comments on what is going on generally in the banking system.  I will certainly take note of his words of wisdom about just how we should structure some of the arrangements in the period ahead.  The previous provisions in this regard date back to 1933, with some minor amendments in 1971.</P>
    <P>The Bill will confer on ICC certain protections under the Bankers' Books (Evidence) Acts and the Bills of Exchange Acts, which have long applied to the private sector banks.</P>
    <P>ICC is a merchant bank of some standing, particularly among the small and medium sized businesses.  Senator Honan referred to their customer base.  The measures proposed in the Bill are particularly appropriate, given their more commercial orientation in recent years.  It may be said that ICC are one of our more successful State companies, because although they have the benefit of State support for their borrowings through the State guarantee and did derive benefits from various schemes they administered <Col N="2380" /> on behalf of the State over the years, they are now in a position to go forward without such supports, and I want to thank the Senators who welcomed that. ICC have been consistently profitable and are one of the few State companies to pay a dividend to the Exchequer on a regular and predictable basis.  Some of our State companies have successfully done that over a few years and have then gone into decline, but there are a few who continually pay a dividend to the State and that is a success for the company concerned.</P>
    <P>ICC do of course have to operate the same prudential policies in regard to their lending activities as other banks do. Nevertheless, they have gained a reputation, particularly among the small and medium sized indigenous business sector, for their approachability and flexibility in dealing with the clients' financial needs. Indeed, many leading companies in that sector in Ireland today have been clients of ICC when they were smaller.</P>
    <P>ICC face the same challenging future as other banks in the open market conditions which will apply from next year. Following a £40 million subordinated debt issue earlier this year, which improved their capital adequacy ratio, they now have a firm capital base.  They are a profitable bank which can face the challenges of the future with confidence. Although they are a small bank in a European context, sometimes it is not realised that with assets of approximately £1,000 million, they are the fifth largest bank in the State.  We need to keep that in mind. The type of responsive and flexible customer service which they have learned to provide will stand them in good stead over the coming years.  The provisions of this Bill will assist them to progress. Senator Honan and Senator Costello referred to the service they provide for their customers and the progress they have made.  Senator Hussey paid tribute to them for the contribution they have made to the financial sector.</P>
    <P>As Senators will recall, I dealt with the question of guaranteed and unguaranteed borrowings in my opening speech. As I said, there should be a clear understanding <Col N="2381" /> that existing depositors and lenders with the ICC are not affected by this change.  Their position will remain fully guaranteed within the existing limit of £1,000 million.  As Senator Staunton said, this is a useful innovation.  The State guaranteed base has been decreasing for a number of years, and this is the proper way to proceed.  Previously all borrowings were State guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The 1933 Industrial Credit Act which established the ICC envisaged that the predominant function of the company would be in the giving of credit while also investing in equity shares, debentures, etc.  There is no departure in this bill from the fundamental principles enshrined in the original Act 60 years ago.  As Senator Staunton said, the ICC were established specifically to provide loans for industry. The principal objects set out in the 1933 Act referred to trade and industry.  As happens in the case of most legislation, the people who drafted that Act had a lot of foresight.</P>
    <P>Since their foundation in 1933, venture capital has been the core activity of ICC. Through direct subscription-purchase of shares, underwriting and the exercise of options, ICC became a shareholder in a wide variety of Irish businesses.  The provisions of the Bill will not diminish ICC's activities in the venture capital area.  During the past decade a number of significant developments both in Ireland and internationally have led to a greater awareness of the importance of investment capital for growth.  For example, it has been recognised that exclusive reliance on debt finance might not always be the most appropriate form of capital formation and there has to be a willingness on the part of individual entrepreneurs and management teams to allow outside investors to become shareholders in their businesses.  ICC's relationship with the small and medium sized sector has been and is more focused than other financial institutions in the State.  This sector are increasingly interested in venture capital to improve their debt-equity ratio and to provide permanent capital for growth.  In 1986 ICC, in recognition of the growing importance of this sector <Col N="2382" /> and of the higher risk profile investment capital presented, decided to concentrate activities in a separate division.  The nature of banking with its fixed margin lending, often secured, is fundamentally different from venture capital with its total risk and no security.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years between £25 million and £30 million has been invested annually by Irish venture capital companies. This figure excludes the BES schemes.  Relative to GDP, Ireland has an extremely high level of venture capital activity.  Some Senators do not seem to be aware that this is the case.  ICC seek to invest between £3 million and £5 million per year.  To date, a portfolio in excess of £20 million has been built up, representing both publicly quoted companies and approximately 30 private companies.  Senator Honan referred to the significant contribution they have made in the provision of venture capital to small and medium sized industries. Despite the higher risk associated with the provision of investment capital, because of their strong traditional involvement in small and medium sized enterprises ICC have a unique role to play in the provision of funds for indigenous Irish industry.  Of necessity, a prudent and very selective policy results in a relatively small number of suitable investments, as ICC concentrate on established business rather than startups.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general availability of venture capital &mdash; Senator Staunton and Senator Upton referred to this issue &mdash; I think it can be accepted that ICC are doing their share in this regard.  I referred to this issue in my opening speech. Senators will recall the various changes introduced in the recent past, for example, a total of £25 million under the young entrepreneurs scheme, and its successor scheme agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which offer loans at reduced rates of interest and do not require personal security; the recent initiative by the Small Firms Association with one of the main banking groups regarding charges for their member firms and other related <Col N="2383" /> matters; the ongoing discussions about the impact of the DIRT changes on the life assurance and unit fund industries and the IDA's operations in the area of equity finance for indigenous industry which is likely to be increased in line with the recommendations in the Culliton report.  The IDA have taken over the NADCORP portfolio.</P>
    <P>I will continue to meet with the banks and emphasise that the availability of finance on a reasonable basis to Irish industry is in their long term best interests.  The provision of an adequate supply of capital to our indigenous industry, including fledgling firms, will enable our economy to prosper and grow and will assist in our employment creation efforts.  Senator Costello referred to the contribution the main banks can make in this regard.  This prosperity and growth will, in turn, feed into the bank's bottom line in the normal way. The Irish banking industry is a success story by and large and I should not like to see an excessive degree of caution creeping into their operations in the light of present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Senators Staunton, O'Keeffe, Costello and Upton referred to the merger of the ICC and the ACC.  With regard to the future of the ICC and the ACC, the principal objects of both bodies will be the same after the enactment of this Bill. That does not mean the two banks will operate in exactly the same markets.  The ICC are a merchant bank who concentrate on the business sector with few retail outlets.  The ACC bank are now largely a retail bank with a traditional concentration on the agricultural sector. The main change for the ICC in regard to their objects is that they will no longer be restricted to lending to trade and industry within the State.  It is not intended that the ICC will expand significantly into personal banking or abroad.  Nevertheless, if suitable opportunities were to arise in such areas the ICC should not be restricted from pursuing them.</P>
    <P>Any questions in relation to the future of the ICC-ACC will be dealt with after <Col N="2384" /> full consideration of all the options.  I should like to give both banks time to settle down under their respective new Acts before taking final decisions.  Of course, there is also the possibility of the sale of ICC to the private sector should a suitable purchase emerge.  That item is still on the agenda.  I am not ruling out any course of action in regard to this matter; all options are being kept under close review.  Obviously the possibility of a merger between these two State banking institutions exists.  However, the close similarity between the provisions of key aspects of their respective legislation is not an indication of any decision in that regard.  I want to make it clear that the matter is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been introduced in respect of the trustee savings banks the ACC and the ICC.  The trustee savings banks merged over the past six months. I believe the various institutions should be given time to adapt to these changes. Any merger would be likely to involve substantial disruption while rationalisation took place.  It must be remembered that each of these institutions has a long and proud history and each has its own market niche and customer base; each is successful and profitable in its own right.  I would not be interested in change for change sake or merely to have a single entity which, while it would, of course, be bigger than the individual parts, would not necessarily be more successful than the parts.  It is arguable that the bigger the entity the more remote from their customers they are likely to become.</P>
    <P>We need financial institutions in the State which are in close touch with their customers and responsive to their needs. That was the conclusion reached in the debate on 11 June.  Practically every speaker had a go at the main banking groups because they felt that the managers in the regions had very little control and were not able to make decisions. Whether that is perception or reality, it was the conclusion of many contributors to the debate in this House on 11 June.</P>
    <P>The existing State banking institutions have an excellent reputation and I need <Col N="2385" /> to be convinced that any changes will not cause a setback in their evolution.  We must look at these matters very carefully.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not preparing ICC for privatisation. This is not, as Senator Upton suggested, its main purpose.  We are not polishing up the family silver for sale.  If we get the right bid, I will not even polish it.  The introduction of this Bill is motivated by the fact that ICC have reached the limit of their borrowings and they want to change for market reasons and to fulfil their own ambitions.  It should be remembered that the founding legislation allows the Minister for Finance to dispose of his shares in the company as and when he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>There was, in effect, a flotation of the company in 1933.  Some Senators with ideological views think that flotation was started in the Thatcherite era.  It should be remembered that there was a flotation of ICC 59 years ago, designed to facilitate private ownership of at least part of the shares in the company.  In the event, relatively few of the shares were taken up by the public.  At the moment no more than 770 shares out of a total of 12 million are held by private shareholders.  ICC still retain their Stock Exchange listing.  Far from doing anything new, we are reverting to what was being done almost 60 years ago.  Perhaps we are catching up with the past rather than changing things for the future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe thought that the valuation would be of the order of £35 million. That point was taken up by Senator Upton.  The net assets of ICC are listed in their most recent balance sheet at £54 million and I would expect the sale value to be somewhat greater than the net asset value.  The figure of £35 million would not be correct.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy referred to the changes in the German interest rates announced today by the Bundesbank.  It is to be hoped that these changes will not cause adverse results.  We have been closely following that meeting today, as has everybody in Europe.  The latest information is that the Bundesbank have raised the discount rate by 0.75 per cent. However, they did not raise the Lombard <Col N="2386" /> rate, a move which might have had an adverse effect here.  We were all worried about that, but so far there has been no dramatic reaction in the ERM.  Italy has raised its discount rate in line with Germany. While it does not affect the Lombard rate, I think it will put an end to any view that we might see a decrease in rates in the remaining part of the year; at least it means no increase.  In recent days we thought that might be the difficulty.  All is not too bad.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Environmental Impact Assessments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the need for the Minister for the Environment to make regulations to ensure that the system of environmental impact assessments complies with European law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concerns relate to two matters. First, the fact that the EC Commission has formally complained to the Government that the existing regulations do not comply with European standards.  This complaint could lead to an action against <Col N="2388" /> the Government in the EC Court of Justice unless the Government clarify the regulations to the satisfaction of the Commission.  Second, since the Commission took steps to initiate infringement proceedings the Government have introduced further legislation that may constitute a further breach of European law on environmental impact assessments, EIA.</P>
    <P>The background to the Government's difficulties lies in the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment which was introduced in 1985.  That directive required that all planning projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of factors such as their nature, size or location had to be subjected to a procedure that would assess their effects on the environment. This procedure involves a detailed statement from the developer, which statement is called an environmental impact statement, EIS, and comments from prescribed bodies and the public generally and, in certain circumstances, other EC member states.</P>
    <P>The EIA has proved to be an extremely valuable tool in the planning process and has helped to clarify the environmental effects of several controversial projects, ranging from various interpretative centres to more major projects such as those proposed by Sandoz and Merrell Dow.  That is not to say, of course, that the EIA system could not be improved. One of the concerns of the Labour Party has been that the preparation of an environmental impact statement should be done by an independent, objective expert, rather than by the developer.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission has, I understand, complained about several aspects of the Irish regulations which implemented the EIA Directive.  Would the Minister confirm to the House that a formal letter under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome has been received by the Government, when it was received and what the precise complaints made by the Commission were?  Could the Minister tell the House the nature of the reply made by the Government and outline <Col N="2389" /> whether the Commission has been satisfied with the response?</P>
    <P>My information is that the Commission has a number of worries.  The first is that the directive was implemented late.  It should have been implemented by 3 July 1988.  In fact, the Government's regulations did not come into force until 1 February 1990.  Delay in implementing directives seems to be something of a habit of the Government, as there are several other environmental directives that have not been implemented.</P>
    <P>The second worry is that the regulations were to vague in a number of respects.  Too much discretion was given to local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the Minister for the Environment regarding various stages of the process, such as whether an EIS should be submitted and what it should contain.  The duties under the directive were not spelt out with sufficient clarity.</P>
    <P>The third worry was that public access to the process of EIA was inhibited by the imposition of fees for making submissions to An Bord Pleanála.  However, since receiving the complaint, the Government have increased fees by a massive 100 per cent from 17 February 1992.  An applicant who appeals a decision on a commercial development and an air and water licence, and who requests oral hearings on each, now has to pay a massive £422.  Even those who wish to submit a short comment on an appeal must pay £30.</P>
    <P>The fourth worry concerns the use of section 4 motions.  The Commission asked how those could affect or by-pass the EIA procedures.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government have failed to implement fully the recommendations of the Barrington Committee on this issue, the expert advisory committee on local government reorganisation and reform.  The Barrington Committee recommended that section 4 should be removed from the planning process. Instead, section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1991, requires a three-quarters majority of councillors for that purpose. That leaves open a possible use of section 4 to conflict with the requirements of the <Col N="2390" /> EIA Directive, although the possibilities in that regard would be limited, given the restrictions of section 44 of the Local Government Act.  For some councils it can be a problem to have three-quarters of the council present.</P>
    <P>These matters are of great concern to the Labour Party who share several of the Commission's worries in relation to the Government's regulations.  I therefore ask the Minister to amend the EIA regulations in order to meet the points raised by the Commission.</P>
    <P>My second concern is with recent legislation. Article 12 (2) of the Directive obliges the Government to send to the Commission the text of all legislation relevant to the Directive.  Could the Minister give the House a list of the legislation notified under that provision?  In particular, have the Government informed the Commission, or do they intend to inform the Commission of the legislation, such as the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, which was passed by both Houses last Thursday?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcome the general principle of ensuring a speedy and efficient planning system, which is enshrined in that legislation.  However, I am concerned that the legislation gives too little opportunity to comment on projects and that that may be in conflict with the EIA Directive.  The Directive keynote is consultation and exchange of environmental information.  However, the legislation interferes with that by providing that neither a developer nor a person who makes submissions can have a chance to respond to points subsequently made by other parties.  For instance, a developer does not have the right to rebut inaccurate information submitted by an objector.  An Bord Pleanála can allow a reply in very exceptional and limited circumstances, but that is completely inadequate for cases in general.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party proposed amendments to the legislation in this House on 24 June 1992.  The amendments would have addressed the problem but, unfortunately, they were not accepted.</P>
    <P>The Roads Bill, 1991, has been languishing in the legislative backlog for <Col N="2391" /> more than a year.  My difficulty with the Bill is that the sections of it dealing with EIA for roads and motorways, sections 48 and 49, largely repeat the existing regulations about which the Commission have complained.  These sections are extremely flawed because they do not spell out the details of what must be included in an EIS.  The information is contained in Annex 3 of the Directive and it is nowhere reflected in either the current regulations or the Bill.  If the Minister does not take the appropriate steps to deal with the matter I shall propose an amendment on that issue if and when the Bill reaches this House.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, a legislation to which, as the Minister will recall, the Labour Party made an extensive contribution in both Houses, provides for some amendments to the EIA process.  I should like to know when the provisions of the Act relating to EIA will be brought into force.  Will it happen in the lifetime of this Government?</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1992, (S.I. No. 3 of 1992), impose a massive increase in fees for anybody who wishes to be involved in the EIA process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished and disappointed at the negative attitude adopted by Senator Upton on this matter.  I find it very hard to reconcile that attitude with his usual constructive approach to issues. In effect, the Senator has sought to ignore or discourage all that has been achieved on EIA in recent years.  That is both unfair and misleading and I am, therefore, glad of this opportunity to set the record straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to begin by assuring Senators that there is absolutely no basis for suggesting that Ireland has been unenthusiastic or unwilling in relation to Directive 85/337 on EIA.  On the contrary, the Government have always been convinced of the importance of environmental impact assessment as an instrument <Col N="2392" /> of the preventive or precautionary approach to environmental problems. This has been reflected in our approach to implementing this directive.  We have an EIA system that accords with the directive and stands up to comparison with the systems in other member states.</P>
    <P>It will help to put this matter into perspective if we look back beyond the EC Directive.  The fact is that Ireland was among the very first countries in Europe to make legal provision for environmental impact assessment.  This was done in the Planning Act, 1976 and in regulations made the following year.  Under those regulations planning authorities could require the submission of environmental statements for major projects. Therefore it will be seen that Ireland was operating the environmental impact assessment process three years before the EC Commission even brought forward a proposal for a directive and eight years before the directive was adopted.  There could be no clearer evidence of this country's commitment to EIA, nor any more conclusive rebuttal of the outrageous implication that we adopt a foot-dragging approach in this area.</P>
    <P>So far as Directive 85/337 is concerned, Senators may be assured it has been incorporated into Irish law in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  I would like to quote chapter and verse on this to show just how detailed our approach has been, but time does not permit.  Suffice it to say that EIA has been built into the development control process under our Planning Acts and a wide range of other development control procedures, including approval of motorway schemes by the Minister for the Environment, aquaculture and foreshore licensing by the Minister for the Marine and so on.  I must emphasise that all of these EIA procedures take full account of the requirements of the directive and that they see to it that projects covered by the directive are subjected to the necessary rigorous evaluation of their likely environmental effects.</P>
    <P>As for the practical operation of EIA in this country, an inventory compiled by the environmental research unit of my <Col N="2393" /> Department shows that 83 environmental impact statements were submitted to competent authorities in connection with development consent applications during 1991.  This high number is attributable to two factors.  Firstly, it reflects the Government's approach of implementing the directive for all classes of projects in annex II of the directive, which is almost unparalleled in any other member state at this point.  Secondly, it indicates that we have applied stringent thresholds for determining when annex II projects have to be subjected to EIA.  Research by the EC Commission shows that, <i>pro rata</i> with other member states, a high proportion of projects are being subjected to EIA in Ireland.  Can there be any clearer indication of our commitment to EIA than the significant extent of its use in practice?</P>
    <P>I should add that we must of course be concerned with quality as well as quantity where EIA is concerned.  The environmental research unit of my Department are co-operating and assisting with a recently-initiated project being undertaken by a research student from Manchester University &mdash; one of the leading research centres on EIA &mdash; on the quality of environmental impact statements prepared in Ireland.  This involves assessing these statements using a package developed by Manchester University. While there are certain reservations about the applicability of this package in Irish circumstances &mdash; because it was designed for United Kingdom conditions where EIA normally takes place only for much larger projects than in this country &mdash; nonetheless the results should be interesting.  Research using the package in England has shown that environmental impact statements there have been of mixed quality and it may well be that similar results will emerge here.  Whatever the outcome, it will be of considerable benefit to those involved in the preparation and assessment of environmental impact statements.  The Environmental Protection Agency's function of preparing guidelines on the content of environmental impact statements <Col N="2394" /> will be of considerable additional assistance in this area.</P>
    <P>I should say also that the EC Commission wrote raising certain queries about implementation of the directive. However, most of the points raised were of an academic or hypothetical nature, ignored the reality of how EIA is operating in Ireland and had little, if any, practical relevance to the effective operation of an EIA process.  A detailed response to all the points raised was submitted to the Commission some time ago and we have heard nothing further since.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have made it abundantly clear that Ireland has a very positive and committed attitude to environmental impact assessment and that we have taken a diligent and thorough approach to implementation of the EC Directive. Against this background, I can only say that Senator Upton's call for regulations fails utterly to take account of the comprehensive measures already adopted for transposing the directive into national law.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that section 4 of the 1991 Act has brought a radical improvement in terms of any infringement that may develop in the context of the use by elected members of the provisions of this section.  I am glad to note that Senator Upton and the Labour Party have taken on board the recommendations of the Barrington report in their totality.  If the case is being made to this House that aspects of the Barrington report as they might refer to this provision are to be the gospel, then I take it that Senator Upton agrees with all of the other recommendations of the Barrington report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Labour Party will be abolishing all the urban councils later this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as planning fees are concerned, it has been a ritual of the Labour Party that you should not charge, that somebody else should pay.  That begs the question: who should that be?  I should stress <Col N="2395" /> that 20 per cent of the cost of planning appeals is paid by those who avail of that redress, the remaining 80 per cent being paid by the ordinary taxpayer not directly involved in the process.  I take it from what Senator Upton has said that he contends taxpayers should carry a greater load than the present 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new planning Bill and the lack of opportunity for a developer to rebut objections, I have made it absolutely plain that the field is clear in that there is an opportunity for developer and objector alike to respond to one another.  For example, it is possible an objector may advance a claim that does not withstand objective scrutiny.  It is equally possible that a developer might do so.  I have left the field clear for both parties to respond.  The provisions of section 9 of that Bill afford the opportunity for planning appeals officers to determine whether further information is required and, if so, the relevant opportunity is provided.</P>
    <P>Taking the points raised this afternoon along with the major ones raised by Senator Upton, the House can be assured that as far as the environmental impact assessment process is concerned not only have we met our obligations but we have blazed the trail for the European Community, have led the way and to the extent that we can improve that process, we shall do so.  As the House goes into recess, the Seanad can be assured that these matters are in very safe hands.</P>

Among <Col N="2396" /> all the hundreds of cases encountered by the Minister for Social Welfare I do not think any, if acceded to, would cost less money than the one I now advance.</P>
      <P>I am making the case for a limited form of free travel to pensioners on the Aran Islands on Aer Arann services throughout the winter.  I checked the 1986 census of population and found that at that time there were 226 pensioners on the three Aran islands, of whom between 35 to 40 would be aged 80 or over.  Therefore the numbers involved are not great.  Nonetheless, they represent a significant proportion of the island population.  They have been granted free travel on ferry services already, which over the summer months provides them with a reasonable amount of free travel.  However, in winter, particularly in the case of the two smaller islands, sea travel is a most uncomfortable mode of transport.  We must also acknowledge that the usage of free travel in winter, particularly in the case of Inishmean and Inisheer, is very limited because the ferry service operates on a few days each week only.  This means that if, for example, pensioners want to avail of the free travel service by ferry in the winter from Inisheer they could get the boat free but they would have to pay for two or three nights accommodation if they wanted to visit a doctor or a clinic in Galway.  It would cost them more than going on the aeroplane.</P>

    <P>Will the Minister consider granting each pensioner on the island five free passes to be used between October and April each year?  If each pensioner used the full quota of five passes at a cost of £28 return the total cost per annum would be £31,640.  If you accept that many of those pensioners never move off the island &mdash; some of them are bedriddeen &mdash; and that others would not use all their passes, the probability is that the total cost of such concessions would be £15,000.  Even in these times of financial constraints, particularly in the context of the social welfare budget, it is a very modest sum of money.  The carrier which would be aided by such seats being taken up, is a company called Aer Arann who <Col N="2397" /> at present is in receipt of a subsidy from Údarás na Gaeltachta, a State Agency.</P>
    <P>I understand that several people as well as myself made representations to the Department on this question and they have always been met with a similar reply.  One objection is that if outbound pensioners from the island were given this concession people not living on the island could look for it in reverse.  Under my proposal, this would not be possible. It must be recognised that the principle of special concessions for island dwellers, particularly in getting to essential services like hospitals, is recognised by the two-tier fare system in operation with an existing State subsidy, where an islander resident on the island who buys the ticket on the island gets a cheaper rate than an islander who lives in Galway and wants to visit the island.  The other objection is that there are already modern ferry services.  I have addressed myself to that but to highlight the reality I will quote from a letter I received:</P>
    <P>Sé mo bharúil go bhfuil eagóir dhá dhéanamh ar oileánaigh.  Seo sampla de rud a tharlaíonn go minic.  Dé Máirt seo caite bhí ar an dochtúir seanfhear 88 bliain d'aois a chur go dtí an t-ospidéal.  Bhí an lá go dona agus ba mhór an chontúirt an fear a chur ar an mbád.  Bhí ar a iníon taisteal leis agus b'éigean dóibh £56 a íoc ar dhá thicéad fillte.</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh an duine sin ar an mórthír bheadh otharcharr curtha ar fáil, tiománaí agus banaltra agus chaithfidis dul go dtí an teach agus an othar a bhailiú.  Is ar an mbord sláinte a thitfeadh an costas sin.  Sa chás seo is léir ní amháin nach bhfuil buntáiste ag muintir an oileáin faoi láthair ach go bhfuil siad faoi mhíbhuntáiste mór.  In other words in this case an 88 year old man had to go to the hospital on the mainland, where the ambulance would have picked him up. As he was from the island free travel was not available and he and his companion had to pay for two return tickets.</P>
    <P>There are people who believe &mdash; and it is something that caught me by surprise &mdash; that islanders, because they live on an <Col N="2398" /> island, do not suffer from seasickness. My experience is that there is no worse sea traveller than your average islander. I know one youngish lady who told me that she got &ldquo;seasick&rdquo; in the plane.  At least she was on it for only ten or 15 minutes as opposed to being an hour or two hours on the sea.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to look favourably on this request.  It would be a very limited scheme and would not create any great precedent.  We are talking about a public service, a limited number of tickets clearly identifiable which could, if necessary, be administered through the co-operatives as many public schemes are on the island. They could be clearly identified in the pensioner's name which, if not used by the person they were intended for, would be invalid.  The total cost of what I propose is in the region of £15,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme, which applies to everybody over age 66 who is resident in the State and to certain incapacitated people, is available on the road and rail services of Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, and certain private bus services.  The service is also available on the two ferry services which service the Aran Islands, namely, Aran Ferries, Galway and Island Ferries, Rossaveal, and ferries servicing Cape Clear, Sherkin Island and Arranmore Island.  In general every effort is made to ensure that people can avail of free travel using the standard travel facilities available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme will cost £29 million in 1992, an increase of some £1.5 million over 1991.  This scheme is unique in Europe, providing free travel for all permanent residents of 66 years and upwards, irrespective of means, to encourage them to remain active in the community.  Obviously the degree to which people can avail of the scheme depends on the extent to which transport services are available.  The use of private bus contractors and ferry services has enabled more people to avail of the service. <Col N="2399" /> However, there are still districts where public transport services are very limited and where people are not in a position to avail of the scheme to any great extent.</P>
    <P>The Aran Islands, happily, are well served by the ferry services to and from the mainland which are of a high standard. Clearly, I have a certain sympathy with the point made by Senator Ó Cuív regarding the difficulties of sea travel during the winter months.  I understand that, in cases of medical emergency, the health authorities can make suitable arrangements to transport people to the mainland if circumstances warrant it. However, I see little prospect of being in <Col N="2400" /> a position to extend the free travel scheme itself on the lines he proposes.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in a universal scheme of this kind, to afford special arrangements to any particular category.  Clearly the main consideration would be one of cost, taking into account the possible wider ramifications of such an extension for other areas.  If any additional funds were to become available for the scheme there are already a large number of proposals for extending it in one way or another to areas or categories not covered at present.  I will bear in mind what the Senator has said but I would not like to hold out any prospect of early developments in this regard.</P>
