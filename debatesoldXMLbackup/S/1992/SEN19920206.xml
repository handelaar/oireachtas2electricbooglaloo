      <P>I have notice from Senator Dardis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make provision for a northern access road from the new motorway by-pass to the town of Kilcullen, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to accede to the expressed wishes of Seanad Éireann and Dublin Corporation by making a substantial cash grant from lottery funding for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make extra funding available through the Eastern Health Board for Wicklow community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Dardis, Norris and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Dardis' matter and it <Col N="334" /> will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Norris and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item No. 2, the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991, Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 2.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed to the change in the Order of Business today to facilitate the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party in the very important task before them this afternoon.  All I can do on behalf of my colleagues on this side is to wish them well in their important deliberations, important not just to themselves but to the nation.</P>
      <P>We again find ourselves trying, albeit very inadequately, to express our sympathy on the occasion of the carnage in the north of our island yesterday.  We have run out of adequate words, if there are adequate words, to express what we all feel.  All we can do yet again, through you, a Chathaoirligh, is to ask the Acting Leader of the House to recognise that it is long past the time when this Chamber should at least devote one day to express our views and to sympathise with those 26 immediate families, and God knows how many others, who have been affected in the past five weeks, and the 12 families tragically bereaved this week alone.  I plead, through you, a Chathaoirligh, with the Acting Leader to allow time next week, if at all possible, even if we have to sit an extra day &mdash; I do not think anybody would mind being generous with their time on this issue &mdash; to debate this issue.  If this Chamber is to mean anything, if it is to reflect the values for which it was established, we have to immediately give our time and deliberation to the tragedy in the north of our island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with Senator Doyle's good wishes to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> I believe Senator Doyle has eloquently and validly put the case that we in the institutions of democracy cannot remain silent about Northern Ireland.  Effectively, it is creating a situation where the only voice that is heard is the voice of terror.  As Senator Doyle said, the circumstances can be organised, we can have an extra day's sitting or we can change our business.  All of us, whatever our views, have an obligation to challenge ourselves and our positions on Northern Ireland.  There are differing views on what should be done next.  All of us have an obligation to challenge ourselves and the only way we can do that in a way that is consistent with democracy is through the use of the institutions of democracy.  I appeal to the Acting Leader to allow us to have an open-ended, serious discussion on Northern Ireland with sufficient time given for those who wish to speak.</P>
    <P>While it does not have the immediate urgency of Northern Ireland because of recent events I repeat my plea to have a debate on unemployment.  The reason I raise this again is simply to make it clear that I am not talking about a debate on industrial policy, I am talking about the 250,000 unemployed people, not what we can do for them over a period of two or five or ten years but what could be done about the way they are treated now.  That is why I want the issue of unemployment and unemployed discussed, not industrial policy, not growth prospects, not anything else but what happens every day, every week, to 250,000 people in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also be associated with the statements in relation to the terrible events which took place in Norhern Ireland yesterday.  Again, I appeal to the Acting Leader of the House to allow the debate on Northern Ireland to go ahead to the extent that anything can be done now.  We need to look towards political solution and this Chamber might as well put in its tuppence worth as far as that goes.  I do not want to be simple-minded or foolish or suggest <Col N="336" /> for one minute that we here will come up with anything which will radically change things.  Nonetheless, we should put in our bit and hope that something can come out of it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Order of Business in general, may I ask the Acting Leader of the House if there has been any change in relation to Senator O'Keeffe's request for a debate on the banking system?  It seems to have vanished and I am wondering whether the whole idea has been forgotten about.</P>
      <P>Finally, I hope my colleagues in Fianna Fáil will enjoy the contest this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, condemn the appalling atrocity which occurred yesterday &mdash; the latest in a long line of horrific events in Northern Ireland.  Even if we do not have a full debate, we should have the opportunity to make statements on the present position in Northern Ireland and on possible solutions and I ask the Acting Leader to facilitate us next week, or very soon.  I have said before it is the victims, the families, the bereaved, who are so open and willing to forgive while the people of violence &mdash; particularly the men of violence &mdash; continue in their misguided efforts to arrive at their solution to the problem.  They have to realise there are no winners.  I agree with my colleague in asking the Acting Leader for a debate, or at least statements, on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am a little disappointed at the shortening of today's sitting like Senator Doyle, I understand the reason for it: it is in the national interest and not simply a matter of a party convenience.  Since it concerns us all, will those who think of him today, a little prayer for Albert say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share my colleagues' views on the urgency for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The accumulation of horrors in the last few days has made an impact even on the most apathetic of southern. consciences.  Senator Upton is right that what we say here may have limited effect but the whole point is our sense of priorities; we should be dropping everything <Col N="337" /> else to give expression to our opinions on the importance of this question.  May I suggest to the Acting Leader that a day next week, perhaps Thursday, might be suitable?  What will give it added urgency and added significance is that by then we will have a new Government and a new Taoiseach whose views on Northern Ireland are not very well known at the moment.  There are all kinds of things which would make a debate very significant at the earliest opportunity next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers who called for a debate on Northern Ireland because it is important if this House is to have any relevance at all.  I and many others have been calling for a debate for the last eight months at least and we have been told such a debate would exacerbate the situation.  It is impossible to see how the situation could be further exacerbated.  Statements are made every day of the week from the barrel of a gun.  We must be allowed to make statements in this House.</P>
      <P>I know you would not allow me to make a speech, a Chathaoirligh, but as a member of the Church of Ireland, may I say how very much the balanced but passionate comments of Cardinal Daly have been appreciated by our community, North and South?  Echoing what Senator Keogh said, it is the grossest impertinence and blasphemy for the UFF to use the word &ldquo;Teebane&rdquo; in their statement. I absolutely deplore that.  It is outrageous and cannot be tolerated.  I hope the Acting Leader will be able to give us a specific date for a debate on the North but I suppose we must also deal with the practical realities of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>On a somewhat lighter note, is it correct that a Member of this House voted twice yesterday on different sides of the Bill and, if this luxury was afforded, may I be permitted to have it as well because there are occasions on which I would like to equivocate with my vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  Perhaps I could have a ruling in private from your good self.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>May I agree with the sentiments expressed by all sides of the House in relation to the absolutely horrific events that are taking place in Northern Ireland and call on the Acting Leader to initiate a debate on Northern Ireland at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>
      <P>What is happening in Northern Ireland at the moment is inconceivable.  The depth of barbarity to which they have sunk is absolutely horrendous.  Those of us who live a distance from those tragic events cannot comprehend the conditions in which the people in Northern Ireland are living.  Sides have become polarised to such an extent that the game appears to be which side will kill the most.  It is high time we took this seriously.  Whatever contribution this House can make we have to make it our priority and ensure that we are making an effort to solve the tragic events that are taking place there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I came on the scene of a shooting at Belleek on my way from Enniskillen and saw a grusome sight.  I have attended a number of funerals of murdered people in the North.  I would certainly welcome a debate on Northern Ireland, but honestly, I do not know what good such a debate will do.  I have met both sides and I have done quite a lot of business with many people in the North over the years.  On a business level they are very nice people but when they get into their various ghettoes they become savages.  I do not know how we would talk to people with that mentality.</P>
      <P>I agree with Cardinal Daly when he said that until we get all the subversives to sit down at a table we will not have peace.  How we are going to achieve that I do not know.  Is there anybody who could use their influence to try to get people to sit down and talk?  If not, this very sad situation will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a <Col N="339" /> discussion on unemployment.  As one who has been self-employed for many years and has created an environment in which there are over 200 people employed in my own village, I feel I could make a contribution on how jobs could be created.  It amuses and fascinates me to hear so many people speaking about talks on unemployment.  At a meeting I attended in Sligo, not one person at the top table created a job for themselves. They were all in State employment.  It is the people who create jobs, and can create jobs, who should be listened to and not those in State jobs telling others what to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not having a debate.  Because of the barbarous acts in the North, I am allowing an element of flexibility on the Order of Business, but I ask Senators, if possible, to speed up things so that we can conclude the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my revulsion at what happened in Northern Ireland over the past few weeks and sympathise particularly with the majority of people on both sides of the community, who are sometimes tarnished by events there.  Most people in Northern Ireland are very concerned because of their immediacy to the problems and we should empathise with them. I would like to add my voice to the calls for a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Would the Acting Leader consider a debate on the Law Reform Commission consultation paper on the civil law of defamation, an area in which you, a Cathaoirligh, are very interested?  In fact, you gave what I would refer to as half a commitment before Christmas to have a debate on this issue and I ask the Acting Leader if he would consider having such a debate in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expressions of outrage and sympathy and I would also like to join with my colleagues on this side of the House in supporting the call for a debate on the Northern Ireland <Col N="340" /> situation.  As someone who comes from a Border county, I feel it is incumbent on me, like my colleague, Senator Farrell to express my views.  Over the past few weeks and months opinions have been expressed in this House which would reflect, I would like to think those of the community at large.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there are three attitudes to Northern Ireland now on this island.  There is the attitude of those who live there, there is what you would call the attitude of those of us who live along the Border counties and there is the attitude of those further south.  I would like to ask that perhaps this House, apart from its ritual and very important expressions of outrage whenever events such as those in the past few days take place in the North, would also perhaps attempt to make some contribution to helping to solve the political problem that is at the heart of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear my distinguished colleagues on the other side of the House crying &ldquo;shame&rdquo; and &ldquo;lock them up&rdquo; when Senator Farrell supported the expressions of hope made by Cardinal Daly yesterday because at the end of the day when all the fighting, all the bombing and all the killing is done ther must be discussion and dialogue.  I believe it is how we get to that point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not with gunmen, not with murderers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is how we are misinterpreted whenever people like me make this comment, coming from a Border county with deep roots in Northern Ireland on both sides of the community. Ultimately the people of this island must sit down and talk together. We can agree and disagree as to how that is arrived at but ultimately we must sit down and talk.  I believe this House could have some role to play, albeit a limited role.  I ask how many Members of this House go to the North?  How many Members of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.  So does <Col N="341" /> Senator Murphy whom you deliberately misinterpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>How many Members consciously have dialogue with both sides of the community in Northern Ireland?  I ask that in this House some formula may be arrived at, apart from the regular debates we have, important as they are, that we might have a more tangible contribution to make in the exchanging of views across the divide.  Senator Farrell made the point, and I will stand firmly on it, that there must be dialogue at the end of the day.  This is a political problem, not a military problem, not a sectarian problem.  It is essentially a political problem that must be worked at between the people on this island and between Britain and Ireland.  I make that plea in the context of those who make statements about Northern Ireland.  After all the essential denunciations of outrages such as that in Teebane and elsewhere, we should never forget at the end of the day we must have dialogue to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated very positively with the words of condemnation and sympathy on the events in recent days and weeks in Northern Ireland.  We should be conscious of the danger that the escalation of violence there in recent weeks may lead us to a state of civil war.  For that reason a debate in this House, if it could contribute in some small way, would do a good job to help to alleviate the problem in Northern Ireland.  I would again ask that we have such a debate at an early date.  I would also like, a Chathaoirligh, to ask the Acting Leader if we could have an early debate on the very serious matter of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my support in condemning the barbaric and atrocious acts in Northern Ireland in the past few months and to ask for a debate. I would also like to wish our Fianna Fáil colleagues well this afternoon in their deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="342" />
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just say how much we appreciate the good wishes for the election of our new leader this afternoon. I suppose there is a lot to be said for Senator Ó Foighil when he commented there is a conversion on that side and we are very glad of that emerging from the Fine Gael side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Now to the Order of Business, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to be associated with the concern expressed here this morning about events in the North and I would like to put on record my deep feelings particularly for the families of those people who have been affected by the tragedy that is Northern Ireland.  A debate on Northern Ireland in this House is very important. However, in having that debate we should be very careful about the type of language used so that we do not add further to the misery that is already part and parcel of the lives of the people in Northern Ireland.  It is my view that as a result of the political vacuum that exists there at the moment intrinsic evil has emerged and it is incumbent on all persons involved in the political process and otherwise to sit down together in the hope that they will bring peace to that part of our country.</P>
      <P>May I also ask the Acting Leader of the House if it is his intention, given that unemployment is a major factor in this country today, to allow a debate on the Culliton report.  Perhaps he would combine the debate with the debate on the Culliton report and let us have an early date for a discussion on that topic.  It impinges on all our lives and it is important that this House should be seen to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton has mentioned the banks.  My campaign has gone on all through the last session and the previous one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>And we are with you all the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>You will notice we are <Col N="343" /> getting a lot of fax sheets from the banks in recent months.  I would say, therefore, it is appropriate, now that the budget is out of the way, that people in this House should be given an opportunity to address again what is in our view and the view of most of the people here a contributing factor to the unemployment situation.  I urge the Acting Leader very strongly to allow the House to discuss the banks issue at a very early date.  In fact, when you are talking about reform of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator ask the Acting Leader a question, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking this question: given that we have had so many people speaking on the reform of the Seanad, given that a number of contributors have suggested we should have statements here which would not require the presence of Ministers, perhaps some of these reforms should be brought in at a very early stage so that issues such as the banks and others could be debated as early as possible.</P>
      <P>In the last session the Leader of the House was asked a number of questions about Bills that were to come before this House.  Can he give us an idea at this stage what Bills are likely to be on the agenda for this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been under the impression, a Chathaoirligh, that you did not allow speeches on the Order of Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear, Senator, the barbarous acts in the North warranted a certain degree of flexibility. I assure you I hope to revert to a tougher role in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will not be unduly tough with me when you do revert back because I will not be making a speech this morning.  Sadly I do not think anything we say in this House on the horrific events in the North of Ireland will make one jot of difference.  I join <Col N="344" /> with the other speakers in condemning the terrible tragedies of the last few days.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to confirm that the Second Stage of the Electoral (No. 2) Bill being taken today will not be finished today.  I support other speakers who called for a debate on unemployment; on that occasion we might address ourselves to the extent to which the traditional political parties in this country have totally failed to make any impact on our three great tragedies &mdash; unemployment, emigration and the North of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in the condemnation of attrocities taking place in the North.  As has been said, there is very little we can do here but when people talk about the possibility of political dialogue in the North I do not believe we should consent to talk to those who perpetrated the murders yesterday and the murders in Teebane. These people are thugs, cowards, murderers; there is no word to condemn them sufficiently and they are not in any way political; they are pure and utter murderers.  Under no circumstances should they be brought into political dialogue. Anybody who thinks these people will endeavour to advance the cause of peace in the North are whistling in the wind.  It will not happen.</P>
      <P>We are this morning making expressions of sympathy and of horror, and the press as usual do not see fit to be here.  The fact that the press are not represented here is a disgrace about which the Cathaoirleach should complain. This is a House of the Oireachtas and the people have the right to a report of the proceedings.  It is not the first time that the Press Gallery has been vacant but it should be the last time and I ask the Cathaoirleach to take up that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with other Senators in appealing to the Acting Leader to have a debate on Northern Ireland.  We should also have a debate on the banks.  I was delighted to get the information note from the Irish <Col N="345" /> Banks Information Officer and going through the various rates being offered, found&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been listening for some months to Members asking for a debate on the North.  Like many in the South, I am far removed from the carnage but I remind Senator Mooney that many urban councils and county councils have twinned with districts in the North, and my area is one of them.  We have reached a point with this carnage similar to the Mau Mau in the fifties in terms of frightening, murdering butchery, savagery and lack of Christian respect and mercy.</P>
      <P>The two major items on our agenda at the moment are unemployment and the North of Ireland which is tottering on the brink of civil war which would have a tremendous effect on the whole country. I appreciate that unemployment is a very serious matter but in the present circumstances as the northern situation worsens daily, for me it is top of the priority list as it must be for all who wish for peace, and for a united country where people can live together and not be implicated in or witness the carnage we had yesterday.</P>

      <P>As this is the first occasion I have been in the Seanad since your election to the prestigious position of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, I would like to wish you a very happy and fruitful term of office.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate, with amendments, the law relating to the election of Members to Dáil Éireann.  It deals comprehensively with all aspects of Dáil elections extending from the registration of electors through the nomination of candidates, the taking of the poll and the counting of the votes, to election petitions and electoral offences.  If the Oireachtas sees fit to enact the measure it will mean that, for the first time, the entire law in relation to Dáil elections will be contained in a single statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing law on the conduct of Dáil elections is contained in 14 different pieces of legislation, the earliest of which dates back to 1923.  In addition, legislation relating to the questioning of a <Col N="347" /> Dáil election is contained in a number of British enactments, the earliest of which is dated 1852.  These enactments were continued in operation for Dáil and Seanad elections and referenda by the Electoral Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>The 1923 Act, which was one of the earliest enactments of the new State, provided the basic law on the registration of electors and the conduct of Dáil and Seanad elections and referenda.  The law in relation to Seanad elections and referenda was replaced by separate codes in later decades but the law relating to Dáil elections and the registration of electors continued in place virtually intact until the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1963. That Act partly replaced the Dáil electoral law contained in the 1923 Act, in the process repealing and amending large segments of the Act, but leaving intact a considerable number of its provisions.  In the period since 1963, the Electoral Act, 1963, has itself been the subject of a substantial number of amendments.</P>
    <P>The law governing the prevention of electoral abuses is contained in a separate enactment &mdash; the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  That Act was designed to consolidate and amend the then existing law relating to corrupt and illegal practices and other electoral abuses at parliamentary elections.  Some of the provisions of the Act were applied to presidential elections and to Seanad university elections on the enactment of separate electoral codes for these elections in 1937.  Like the other principal enactments relating to Dáil elections, the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, has been extensively amended over the years.</P>
    <P>The sheer number of statutes relating to Dáil elections and the extensive amendment of the principal enactments have left the law in a very fragmented state.  It is, in fact, in danger of becoming the preserve of the experts and the specialists.  This would be particularly inappropriate in the case of the electoral code which is of direct and immediate relevance to all citizens.</P>
    <P>The law relating to the questioning of Dáil elections is contained in six 19th <Col N="348" /> century Acts, the earliest dating back to 1852.  While the law has been adapted, it is not entirely suitable for elections under our system of proportional representation. Most of the provisions had their origin in the period which preceded the secret ballot.  They were designed for a system of limited suffrage at its evolutionary stages, and related to a period in which the safeguards against electoral malpractice were not as well developed and defined as in modern electoral law.  This is evidenced by the large number of election petitions which were a feature of the last century.</P>
    <P>Under the existing provisions there are two separate statutory procedures for questioning a Dáil election.  The first is by appointment of election commissioners, following a joint address of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to investigate allegations of widespread corrupt practices at elections.  The second procedure is by petition to the High Court.  Until 1868, Parliament itself had responsibility for dealing with the questioning of elections and the investigations of allegations of electoral corruption.  In that year, responsibility for the trial of election petitions was transferred to the courts but the earlier provision for the involvement of Parliament was retained.</P>
    <P>The 19th century provisions for questioning the results of Dáil elections are repealed by this Bill and are replaced by a modern procedure involving the hearing of Dáil election petitions by the High Court.  The procedure contained in the Bill is similar to the existing provisions relating to local and European elections petitions which were enacted in 1974 and 1977, respectively.</P>
    <P>The law relating to the registration of electors is contained principally in Part III of the Electoral Act, 1963, and in detailed regulations made under that Act.  However, separate provisions in relation to the registration of electors for Euro elections are to be found in the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977. The Electoral Act, 1985, extended the Dáil franchise to British citizens and established the new category of presidential electors which comprises Irish <Col N="349" /> citizens only.  The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, provides for the registration as electors of diplomats posted abroad, and their spouses, and for the registration of disabled electors as special voters.  Thus, like Dáil electoral law generally, the law relating to the registration of electors has been extensively amended over the years and is fragmented and difficult to follow.  The existing law is being repealed and replaced by a comprehensive code contained in Part II of and the Second Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it will be of benefit to all that basic law relating to the election of our national Parliament should be spelt out in a logical manner in a single comprehensive piece of legislation which is accessible and meaningful to participants, administrators, the legal profession, the media and the public generally.  This Bill will bring that about.</P>
    <P>The Bill is essentially a Dáil electoral measure.  While it contains certain references to the codes relating to presidential, Seanad, European and local elections and referenda, these references arise either as a direct consequence of changes being made by the present Bill or in order to apply to those other electoral codes provisions which are regarded as of sufficient importance or urgency to be applied now rather than await legislation relating to the specific code involved. This Bill does not purport to consolidate those other codes or to amend them in any comprehensive way.  This, in so far as it may be necessary, will be a matter for another occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to refer to the changes in substance proposed in the Bill and, where they are not self-evident, to indicate the reasons for the proposals.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the registration of electors are contained in Part II and the Second Schedule.  In this area, quite extensive changes are proposed, changes which represent a distillation of experience gained in the operation of the system over many years, as well as suggestions for improvement made by Members of the Oireachtas, local authorities and others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> We all complain about the standard of the register and, in many cases, not without good cause.  In fairness, I would like to put it on record that the standard is by no means as deficient as is sometimes suggested.  The only systematic inquiry into the accuracy of the register, that I am aware of, was carried out by the ERSI.  Their report, entitled &ldquo;A statistical analysis of the Irish electoral register and its use for population estimation and sample surveys&rdquo;, published in 1986, shows that our register compares not unfavourably with the standard elsewhere. The report concluded that &ldquo;It has certain deficiencies which we have documented but, for most research purposes, these are neither as serious nor as widespread as anecdotal evidence might suggest&rdquo;. However, there is no room for complacency and we must seek ways of securing substantial improvement.  The changes I am proposing will provide the framework for significant advance.</P>
    <P>A new and shorter time-scale for preparing the register will be introduced. One of the problems with the present timetable is that some of the information in the register is already seven months out of date by the time the final register is published.  Another is that the time for scrutiny of the draft register by public representatives and the public generally spans the Christmas holidays.  Under existing law, work on the draft register commences in mid-September, the draft register is published on 1 December and the period from 1 December to 15 January is allowed for the display of the draft and the submission of claims for correction.  The revision court sittings have to be completed by 28 February and the register of electors is published on 1 April, coming into force on 15 April.</P>
    <P>Under the new timescale, the qualifying date will be 1 September and the draft will be published on 1 November. Claims for correction may be made up to 25 November.  Revision court hearings will be completed by 23 December and the register will be published on 1 February. The new date for the coming into force of the register will be 15 February.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for the <Col N="351" /> publication of a supplement containing the names of qualified electors omitted from the register.  Unfortunately we are all too famliar with instances where persons who may have been on the register for decades find themselves omitted for no apparent reason.  We can undertand and sympatise with the anger and frustration of people who find themselves in this postion, particularly as there is no effective redress.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers have constantly impressed on local authorities the need for absolute care in drawing up the register, and particularly in ensuring that no qualified elector is excluded.  I know that local authorities do their best in this regard and, as I have said, research has shown that the accuracy of the register here compares not unfavourably with the standard elsewhere.  Each year, my Department and the local authorities conduct a substantial publicity campaign advising people to check that they are included in the draft register.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill and Part II of the Second Schedule set out a procedure under which a person incorrectly excluded from the register can have his or her name added by means of a supplement. On discovering the omission, the person concerned can apply to the local authority which will carry out the necessary inquiries, the county registrar will rule on the application, the applicant will be notified and on the occurrence of an election or referendum, a supplement to the register containing the person's name and the names of other successful applicants will be published.</P>
    <P>The criterion in every case will be that the person must have been eligible for inclusion in the register for the area in question on the appropriate qualifying date.</P>
    <P>Registration in respect of more than one address will be specifically prohibited by the Bill and it is made clear that inquiries by the registration authority and county registrar for this purpose may extend beyond their functional area. While the Constitution and the electoral law make it clear that a person may vote <Col N="352" /> only once at an election, the existing law in relation to the registration of electors does not specifically provide that a person may not be registered more than once. In a Supreme Court judgment on a case taken by students at Waterford Regional Technical College, it was held that existing law does not prohibit plural registration as an elector and that the county registrar is not entitled to require information about the registration of a person on the register for any other constituency.</P>
    <P>Prior to this judgment, electors were registered on the basis that a person was entitled to be registered once only at the place at which he or she was ordinarily resident.  Registration authorities and county registrars operated on the basis that they had the right and duty to inquire whether a person who wished to be registered for the registration area might already be registered, or applying to be registered somewhere else in the country.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court ruling must be accepted as an authoritative statement of existing law but it is not an interpretation of a constitutional provision or a statement of any constitutional or other fundamental right.  The court has simply clarified the meaning of the existing provision in the law.  It does not preclude amendment of the law which, under the Constitution, is a matter for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes it clear that a person may be registered once only as an elector. Where, <i>prima facie</i>, the person may have a claim to be registered in respect of more than one address, he or she may exercise an option.  In effect, the Bill will restore the position to what it was assumed to be before the Supreme Court ruling.</P>
    <P>Gardaí will have the option of registering as postal voters or as ordinary electors. Under existing law, a member of the Garda Síochána who is registered as an elector is entered in the postal voters list and may vote only by post.  Following requests by the Garda representative associations, section 14 provides that each garda will have the right to opt for registration as a postal voter, in which case he may vote by post only, or for <Col N="353" /> registration as an ordinary elector, in which case he may vote in person at the polling station for his locality.</P>
    <P>The possibility of publishing a list of additions and deletions rather than a full draft register each year is provided for. It has been represented that there would be advantages in publishing a list of proposed additions and proposed deletions rather than a full draft register each year. This would make it possible to see proposed changes at a glance and it should help cut down the cost of handling and printing.  Section 16 enables the arrangement to be introduced on an experimental basis in selected areas.  If successful, the arrangement could then be extended generally.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer may, in future, meet three-quarters of the cost of preparing the register rather than one-half as at present.  Under existing law, the cost of preparing and publishing the register of electors is borne equally by registration authorities and the Exchequer.  This principle of shared costs will continue but under section 20 the proportion of costs borne by the Exchequer may be increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. Provision is also included in this section to allow the Minister to impose penalties on registration authorities for inaccuracies in the register or for delays in the preparation and publication where these are attributable to the registration authority.</P>
    <P>The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, introduced a system which enables disabled electors to vote in their own home.  Under the special voting arrangement, a presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána conveys a ballot paper to the elector at his or her home.  While the system is expensive and cumbersome to operate, it is an important facility for housebound electors and will be continued in force by section 17.</P>
    <P>Existing law requires an applicant for entry on the special voters list to produce a medical certificate each year certifying the nature and extent of his or her physical illness or physical disability and indicating that the applicant is of sound mind <Col N="354" /> and understanding and capable of comprehending the act of voting.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that the requirement in relation to &ldquo;sound mind&rdquo; may give offence to some disabled persons and that the requirement of an annual medical certificate seems superfluous and could cause inconvenience and, possibly, expense to the electors concerned.  The opportunity is, therefore, being taken to remove the &ldquo;sound mind&rdquo; requirement altogether and to provide that a medical certificate will be required only in the case of first application.  Exceptionally, registration authorities will be empowered to require a fresh certificate, where they consider it necessary to do so, for example, if the special voter goes to live in a different registration area.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates, with some amendments, the law relating to the registration of political parties which was first introduced in the Electoral Act, 1963.  The working of the provision has been improved to give greater clarity and, in particular, the role of the appeal board has been clarified.</P>
    <P>Under existing law &ldquo;any doubt, dispute or question&rdquo; may be referred to an appeal board consisting of a judge of the High Court, the Chairman of the Dáil and the Chairman of the Seanad.  There is some doubt as to what this provision may mean in practice.  For example, what would constitute &ldquo;a doubt, dispute or question&rdquo; and who may refer such a matter to the appeal board, and in what circumstances?</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the registrar, who is the Clerk of the Dáil, will publish his proposed ruling on any application made to him in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and any person aggrieved by the proposed ruling may appeal to the appeal board.  Each appeal must be accompanied by a deposit of £500 which will normally be refunded but may be forfeited if the appeal board consider the appeal frivolous or vexatious.</P>
    <P>Specific power is given to the registrar to terminate the registration of a party if it has ceased to operate as such or is <Col N="355" /> otherwise no longer entitled to be registered. There is provision for appeal to the appeal board against a decision of the registrar in this regard.</P>
    <P>Certain changes are proposed affecting the position of the candidate at a Dáil election.  Of these, the most important is the proposal that the deposit be increased from £100 to £500.  As the House is aware, the fixture of £100 was fixed in 1923 and has remained unaltered.  I understand that today's equivalent of £100 in 1923 would be over £3,000.  While the deposit is being increased to a more realistic level, I do not consider it appropriate to increase it to a level which would reflect, in full, the change in money values over the past 70 years.  As a corollary, to the deposit increase, the threshold for refund of a deposit will be reduced from one third to one quarter of the quota.</P>
    <P>From the practical point of view, I think there can be no question about the necessity for a deposit, fixed at a reasonable level, or some other mechanism to provide a deterrent to frivolous candidates at an election.  In a praliamentary democracy, a general election represents the most fundamental exercise of the democratic power of the people. By means of the election, the people determine the composition of the Parliament which will represent them, and the Government which will administer the affairs of the nation, over a period of up to five years.  In an ideal situation, every candidate should be genuinely seeking election, prepared to undertake the obligations which a parliamentry mandate will confer, and prepared to play a full part in the business of Parliament, should that question arise.  The electors should be allowed make their decisions without the distraction of nonrelevant candidates.</P>
    <P>Our arrangements for nomination of candidates are probably the most open of any electoral system.  Quite literally, any Irish citizen, irrespective of place of birth or residence, irrespective of any contact whatsoever with the constituency or the country, can nominate himself or <Col N="356" /> herself as a candidate or be nominated by just one elector.  It does not require a very fertile imagination to picture the confusion which could be caused at an election by swamping the ballot paper with the names of large numbers of candidates who are not serious about the election at a relatively small total cost.  It may be objected that this has not happened to any great extent, and that is true, but we should not wait for it to happen.  Prudence requires that sensible arrangements should be in force.</P>
    <P>The free postage arrangement for the election address of candidates is retained under the Bill.  However, there have been suggestions from various sources for changes in the arrangements in this regard and, to enable these to be developed, the Minister will have power to modify the existing arrangements, following consultation with interested parties and with the approval of both Houses.</P>
    <P>A candidate who contests two polls on the same day will be entitled to include material in relation to each poll in his election address.  A candidate who contests more than one constituency will be allowed free postage in one constituency only.</P>
    <P>There will be minor changes in the requirements in relation to ballot papers. It is the general practice nowadays to give each candidate exactly the same amount of space on the ballot paper.  The Bill will make this a mandatory requirement.  The candidate's first name and surname will be printed in capitals rather than in ordinary type as at present.  The requirement that the surname and party name, or the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; as appropriate, should be in large block capitals is retained.</P>
    <P>The practice has grown up in some areas, particularly in urban areas, of stationing large groups of canvassers outside polling stations in a last minute effort to influence voters.  For some people this is part of the colour and excitement of the election process and is accepted as such.  For other electors, however, having to run the gauntlet in this way is a cause of some anxiety.  From the point of view <Col N="357" /> of candidates and parties this last minute canvassing makes no sense.  Far from influencing people, it is quite likely to antagonise them and to damage rather than improve a candidate's prospects.</P>
    <P>To my mind the elector is entitled to go in peace to the polling station and cast his vote calmly and without pressure. Section 147 of the Bill will prohibit all political activity in the vicinity of a polling station for the duration of the poll and for half an hour before and after.  The prohibition will apply to congregating, canvassing in any form, display of posters and use of loud speakers.  The prohibition will apply at all elections and the penalties will be quite severe.</P>
    <P>Under section 147 the prohibition will apply to any place within 50 metres of the curtilage of a polling station.  Having regard to the different kinds of location in which polling stations are situated, this seems to me to be a reasonable distance. I am, however, receptive to suggestions on this point.</P>
    <P>In regard to procedures in the polling station itself, no change of substance is proposed.  However, the opportunity has been taken to amend the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, to provide that an elector employed by the local returning officer in connection with a presidential election may be authorised to vote at an alternative polling station.  This will make good an omission in the presidential elections law which, unlike the other electoral codes, has no such provision at present.</P>
    <P>The law providing for assistance to electors in casting their votes is retained without change.  A blind or incapacitated elector may be assisted by a companion or by the presiding officer.  At present an illiterate elector may be assisted only by the presiding officer.  Senators may well have views on the distinction between the categories and I look forward to hearing them.</P>
    <P>Parts XVIII and XIX, respectively, restate existing law on arrangements for the counting of the votes and restate the counting rules under our system of proportional representation.  Two technical amendments in the counting rules will be <Col N="358" /> of interest.  The returning officer will be empowered to note on the ballot paper concerned his ruling on any &ldquo;doubtful&rdquo; ballot paper which is allowed as valid. This will ensure that the same papers do not come up for adjudication again at a later stage in the count, or on a recount. Their validity will be dealt with once and for all at the commencement of the count. The returning officer cannot, of course, interfere with any mark placed on the ballot paper by the elector.  The provision will complement the provision in existing law which allows the returning officer to mark &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; on any ballot paper he rules to be invalid.</P>
    <P>In section 122 the rule on the exclusion of two or more candidates together is clarified.  The present rule in this regard is very restrictive.  It creates the situation where the returning officer has to eliminate possibly three or four candidates individually even though they may have only a handful of votes between them. The new provision is less restrictive and, in effect, will make it possible to eliminate a number of candidates together if it is clear that none of them can secure enough transfers to save the deposit.  The change will be helpful to returning officers and should help speed up the count.</P>
    <P>I have already touched on the question of election petitions.  As I indicated, existing law, which dates from the latter half of the last century, provides for two separate procedures &mdash; one involving investigation by election commissioners and the other a petition tried by two judges of the High Court.  Both procedures are archaic and cumbersome and not really adapted to suit our proportional representation system.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals all the old statutes and sets out a new procedure under which Dáil election petitions will be tried by the High Court.  The new procedure is modelled on that which applies in relation to European Parliament elections and which worked satisfactorily in the petition relating to the constituency of Leinster at the 1989 European elections. Under the new procedure a petition may be presented by any elector on <Col N="359" /> any grounds likely to have affected the result of the election in the constituency, including non-eligibility of a candidate, electoral offences, obstruction of the election, mistakes or irregularity in the conduct of the election.  A deposit of £5,000 must be lodged as security for costs.  The petition will be tried by the High Court with right of appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>Litigation to question the result of a Dáil election is fortunately quite rare. There has been only one such petition since the foundation of the State.  This arose in the constituency of East Mayo following the 1973 general election, where a candidate sought, unsuccessfully, to have the result of the election in the constituency set aside on a number of techical grounds.  Even though petitions are rare events it is appropriate that there should be an effective and efficient statutory procedure for dealing with them.</P>
    <P>In relation to referendum petitions, section 170 provides that a petition questioning the result may only be presented with the leave of the High Court.  This is to ensure that changes in the Constitution, which have been approved by the people and may be urgent, cannot be held up by a person presenting a frivolous petition.  Before giving leave to present a petition the High Court must be satisfied that there are good <i>prima facie</i> grounds. Such leave has to be sought within ten days of the provisional results of the referendum being published.</P>
    <P>Section 174 provides that a review of the Euro constituencies must be carried out before 1 December 1993.  This will mean that the review will be related to the population figures ascertained at the census taken in April 1991 and that any changes decided on can be in place in good time for the next European elections, which will be held in June 1994. Future revisions will be carried out at ten yearly intervals, that is, in the interval between the publication of census figures and the holding of a Euro election.</P>
    <P>The existing provision in the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, required <Col N="360" /> a review to be carried out by December 1989.  In June of that year representatives had been elected to the Parliament for a period of five years and the available population figures, based on the 1986 census, were substantially out of date.  It did not seem very sensible to carry out a revision in those circumstances and the Government decided to await the new census and have any changes in place for the next Euro elections in 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 167 provides for a moratorium on the taking of opinion polls in the seven days immediately preceding the polling day at an election or referendum.  This provision was included in the Bill in response to concern about the effect on voting which opinion polls can have in the run-up to an election or referendum. This concern cuts across party lines and, indeed, across national boundaries.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the introduction of this provision implies no criticism whatsoever of the competence or integrity of the conductors of opinion polls.  Indeed, I am happy to say that our experience in this country has shown these to be of the highest order.  Neither is the provision intended to detract from the value of opinion polls themselves in the formation and development of policy and in providing a channel of communication between policy makers and the population generally.</P>
    <P>The net point which I am inviting the Seanad to address is whether opinion polls in the days immediately preceding an election or referendum can have consequences detrimental to the genuine expression of the democratic will of the people.  Not surprisingly, the provision has attracted considerable attention, particularly from persons involved in market research and the media.  In addition to the public debate some individuals and organisations have been good enough to furnish their views directly and I would like to express my appreciation of this.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Bill there has been a significant change in the perception of opinion polls.  Originally the view was fairly widely held that opinion polls are neutral in effect and simply offer <Col N="361" /> a snapshot of opinion at a given moment. Of course they provide a snapshot of opinion, but that is only part of the story. It is now generally recognised that polls have a significant effect on the manner in which electors vote and this was, in fact, confirmed by a poll published last June. Polls can and do produce a bandwagon effect.  They provide the necessary information for tactical voting and vote management, practices which could be held to distort the genuine expression of the peoples' choice.  They contribute significantly to the hype at election time. They put pressure on electors, candidates and parties and, to an extent, tend to set the agenda for the election, sometimes diverting the debate from the real issues to less relevant matters.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, a general election constitutes the fundamental exercise of the democratic will of the people and we should so arrange matters that the individual elector is supreme.  It is his or her privilege &mdash; and duty &mdash; to decide between the competing policies, programmes and personnel.  It is important that he or she should make up his or her own mind on issues considered important and should not be stampeded into a particular course because of what the polls say.  It is important, too, that the elector's choice should represent genuine conviction and not represent a second guess based on what the polls are saying or the interpretation of them by sophisticated party managers.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that opinion polls in the days preceding the statutory polling day are not conducive to the free and independent exercise of the franchise by the individual elector and that there should be appropriate regulation of polls during this period.</P>
    <P>The provision contained in the Bill has been framed in a particular way and the approach adopted has obvious merit. That is not to say there may not be other approaches which would achieve the desired objective, perhaps equally effectively. I am sure Senators from all sides of the House will have useful and constructive suggestions to offer in this regard.  I would like to assure the House <Col N="362" /> that such suggestions will receive very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this introductory statement I have touched on all the proposed substantive changes which will be of special interest to Members of the Oireachtas.  I would like to draw attention to the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill which sets out in some detail the contents of the different Parts of the Bill and its Schedules.  Should Senators wish me to expand on any particular aspect of the Bill, I will be happy to do so in concluding.</P>
    <P>In my view, this is a good, constructive, worthwhile and timely Bill.  I look forward to a useful and positive debate and I would like to assure Senators that if they have improvements to suggest which are sensible and appropriate they will not find me unreceptive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first time I have seen him here as Minister for the Environment and I wish him every good luck in his new portfolio.  I hope we will be dealing with him for the lifetime of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, I welcome this Bill.  It is a piece of tidying up legislation that is long overdue.  Indeed, last February I raised the registration of voters on the Adjournment, and the then Minister for the Environment was in the House.  In that debate the then Minister promised to bring in amending legislation that would regularise the situation as a result of problems raised in the court case taken by students in Waterford who were seeking registration.  The interpretation of the courts left questions as to whether they could be registered in two different places.  At the time the returning officer from my constituency happened to hold the view that people could only be registered in one place, that if they were students they had to be registered where they were students, not within the constituency. That was the context in which I raised that matter.  As I said, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I believe it tightens up a lot of legislation going back over a long number of years.  It is a Bill <Col N="363" /> of 176 sections, covering 122 pages.  I welcome the provisions which bring in this system of registration and give a choice.  For those who live in rural constituencies, remote from the centres of population, the fact that people can opt to be registered where they wish is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises the deposit for candidates in a general election from £100 to £500.  I would even go further and increase that to £1,000.  As the Minister clearly pointed out, today's equivalent of £100 in 1923 would be over £3,000.  We should be talking about at least £1,000 deposit.</P>
    <P>In the first general election I contested in 1977 a candidate put his name on the ballot paper.  He first went to the wrong county to register, he had to take a taxi back to the county where he should have registered, he paid his £100 and then went home.  He never contested the election, never stood at a church gate, never canvassed a vote and he did not even vote himself on the day of the election. However, his namesake who had been a Deputy for that constituency for a long number of years &mdash; and his family before him &mdash; lost his seat because of the confusion. I agree with the Minister that frivolous candidates should be dealt with. There could be a large number of candidates on a ballot paper and I would opt for the higher deposit figure of £1,000.</P>
    <P>As regards electioneering activity, I think that at times we have all seen situations outside polling booths which, to say the least, are undesirable, where one almost had to run the gauntlet to get in to vote.  That should be dealt with.  I am not so sure how practical it is to keep people a distance from a polling box, but this is something we will have to go into in greater detail and examine it at greater length.  I agree with the sentiments expressed in that section.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the special voters register.  It was a tragedy that people had to get a certificate to say they were of sound mind before they could get on the special voters register.  It was a sad reflection on the legislators who put that <Col N="364" /> requirement into the Bill and I welcome the fact that it is being removed in this legislation.  I also welcome the fact that gardaí are being given the option of being on the postal voters list or being registered as a private voter.  That is long overdue and is another aspect we welcome.</P>
    <P>The one issue the Bill has not dealt with &mdash; and I think it is a great pity &mdash; is votes for emigrants.  I am not one who suggests that people who emigrated 20 or 25 years ago should have the right to vote.  I am talking about people who have emigrated last year or the year before, who have gone to England, America or Germany for two to three years and who intend to come back.  They should have the right to vote.  I do not think, in this day of new technology of faxes, telexes and so on, that it is impossible to give them the right to vote.  One of the arguments we heard in the past was that because there were only three week's notice given before a general election that would not be possible, but I do not believe in this age of technology and telecommunications, that is an issue.</P>
    <P>People &mdash; and God knows we have many of them from the west &mdash; through no fault of their own have to emigrate and they are being deprived of what I see as their constitutional right to cast their vote.  I would ask the Minister when replying to deal with this issue.  I genuinely believe that people who emigrate for two to three years should have the right to cast their vote in a general election. That is a very important right for them.</P>
    <P>This Bill fails to deal with a number of changes which are required in the Seanad election system, and I respectfully suggest that these issues should be dealt with.  There are a number of anomalies in the present Seanad election system and this would be an ideal opportunity for the Minister, either by bringing in Government amendments or accepting amendments from the floor, to deal with this situation.  Take, for example, a Seanad by-election.  Even though a candidate may be clearly elected on the first count, with in excess of 50 per cent of the votes, <Col N="365" /> an order of preference must be decided for every other candidate in the race. That is utterly stupid.  I suggest that this is an opportunity to amend that.  When Dáil election legislation was updated in 1963, the Seanad election legislation was not.  This is a glorious opportunity to do that now.</P>
    <P>Candidates in a Dáil election can demand a complete recount.  A Seanad candidate cannot do that; he can demand only a recount of the last count.  That is another area where legislation should be brought up to date and regularised. There is also the situation, for example, that if the required number of candidates are not on a Seanad panel the Taoiseach of the day, whoever he is, has the right to nominate a candidate.  That happened in the last Seanad election on the Agricultural Panel because there were not sufficient candidates.  The Chair will be quite familiar with what I am talking about.  I am not sure but I think if the candidate got one vote that was the maximum.  He was put in there to fill the numbers.  That is a crazy situation and should not be allowed to continue.  That section of the legislation should be amended. There are a number of other areas there with regard to the Seanad electoral system which I think should be examined and brought up to date.</P>
    <P>The whole subject of opinion polls will have to be seriously examined.  While I can see merit in what the Minister is trying to do in the Bill, I believe that in the last seven days of a campaign opinion polls are not going to change people's opinions one way or the other.  While scientific opinion polls cannot be taken within seven days of an election, there is nothing to stop local radio or local newspapers from carrying out a poll.  We must bring all under one umbrella: either opinion polls can be held or not.  There is no point in debarring the people who carry out scientific opinion polls while, at the same time, we allow a local radio station to carry out an opinion poll by way of a phone-in or with questions angled in certain directions.</P>
    <P>I remember that in the 1981 general election in my own constituency a local <Col N="366" /> clergyman got the idea of running a lottery on the results of the election and he proceeded to print the cards.  You paid your 50p and you said what vote each candidate would get.  I happened to be defeated by 200 votes in that general election and I have no doubt that lottery contributed in a very large degree to my defeat because of the opinion given on the cards which were in circulation.  I certainly would question whether that should be allowed.  I hear my colleague saying here that I should have bought more of them, but it did not work that way.</P>
    <P>The one point I want to make with regard to opinion polls is that, whatever we do, it should be the one law for all &mdash; either they can be held or they cannot.  I have an open mind about it, but I would question as to whether people's minds can be changed in the last few days of an election compaign.  I do not see, on the one hand, how we can present scientifically carried out opinion polls and, on the other hand, allow a local radio station to carry out a poll.  I hope the Minister will deal with that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most interesting sections for Members of both Houses is that dealing with registration of voters. That is one area where we have to welcome the changes introduced.  As I understand the Bill, it allows for the registration of voters up to the date the poll is called, the date the election is declared.  We are talking about 21 to 28 days prior to a general election.  Every practising politician knows that very often it is during the canvass on the campaign that one discovers people are not registered.  I would suggest again that in this day of new technology that time limit could be substantially reduced.  I would say that up to within seven days of the taking of a poll one's name could be added to the supplement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of introducing a supplement, because we have all come across the situation &mdash; I do not think it has ever been done deliberately &mdash; of finding two or three people taken off the register, people who perhaps have been on it for 20 years.  Very often it is a case <Col N="367" /> of omission or because of a typing error that those people have been deprived of the right to be on the register.  Nothing can be done about it.  I welcome the changes that have been introduced here, but I would say in all sincerity that the time-span should be reduced.  I do not see the difference between having seven days or indeed the date the election is declared. We should accept amendments to the draft register within seven days of polling.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I was a little bit worried about when I was listening to the Minister, and I was in contact with the Department of the Environment yesterday on the matter.  My interpretation on reading the Bill was that it left flexibility for additions to or deletions from the register.  We should insist on a register being published each year.  The Bill is a little loose in that regard in that it does not specify a register should be published each year.  It leaves room for a local authority to say &ldquo;We will publish a register every five years and in between we will have additions and deletions.&rdquo;  That is not on.  It is not a businesslike way of approaching this matter.  We should insist on a a register being published annually and by all means have the supplements to it.  That is the way to approach this matter; any other way would be failing in our duty.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill I would like to deal with is in regard to the distribution of surpluses in a general election.  Here we have it left to the discretion of the returning officers to decide on the distribution of surpluses.  In Dáil elections unlike Seanad elections it is left to the discretion of the returning officers, whereas in a Seanad election if there is a surplus the first thing that is done is to distribute it; but not so in a Dáil election. When we are reviewing legislation there should be in the Bill an option for a candidate to demand a surplus to be distributed if he so wishes.  That is not enshrined in the Bill; again, this is left to the discretion of the returning officer. I know the Minister of State, whom I <Col N="368" /> welcome here, would appreciate that, while the distribution of a surplus may not affect the overall result in an election, it could certainly affect the geographic location of candidates elected.  I have seen the situation in Roscommon and East Galway where, much to the amusement of journalists etc., counsel's opinion was sought.  The media got it all wrong because they did not realise why they were there.  Counsel was brought in because the quota was being changed. The returning officer on the day decided that once he had set the quota he would not change it, but having discovered a substantial number of spoiled votes later, the quota had to be changed.  Setting the quota is an area that should be dealt with in this Bill.  If spoiled votes are discovered the quota must be changed.  If a candidate in a general election wishes a surplus to be distributed that should be done before anybody is eliminated but that does not happen at present nor is it envisaged under the Bill.  A candidate in a general election should have the right to demand that his surplus be distributed.</P>
    <P>During a particular general election I felt very strongly that a surplus should be distributed but the returning officer said he had decided during a previous general election not to distribute a surplus and he stood by that precedent.  It was cruel justice as far as I was concerned. However, I believe in democracy and in the fact that justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done. I appeal to the Minister to accept or introduce an amendment to regularise that situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  There are a number of aspects which could be improved for example with regard to Seanad elections, the distribution of surpluses, the quota etc.  However my major problem with this legislation is related to votes for emigrants.  It is a pity we have not taken this opportunity in this very comprehensive legislation to deal with the issue of votes for emigrants.</P>
    <P>In the west a big percentage of the population has emigrated.  I am not talking about giving votes to emigrants who have been gone for 20, 30 or 40 years; I <Col N="369" /> am talking about giving votes to emigrants who have been gone for two to three years.  They should have their right to go to the embassy on the day of a general election and cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation and I sincerely hope the Minister will take on board some of the points I raised.  This is not contentious legislation and it would be a great pity to miss the opportunity to take on board some of the suggestions I have made.  I hope the Minister will deal with them in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I know he has a personal interest in this Bill because I heard him speak very stongly in another forum on many procedures covered in this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is overdue in many respects. It states existing law in a language much more clearly understood today and it also includes important changes, such as improvements in the system of maintaining an accurate register, changes in relation to the special voters, the amount of candidates' deposits, the proposed prohibition of canvassing in the vicinity of polling stations and taking opinion polls within seven days of polling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of an accurate and up to date register invites a great deal of criticism in many parts of the country. In Kerry a system is operated which is generally accepted by all political parties, and is highly satisfactory.  Kerry County Council and the urban councils of Tralee, Killamey and Listowel appoint enumerators on a temporary basis, and they are paid according to the efficiency of their work.  These people are chosen because of their integrity and intimate knowledge of the area to which they are assigned.  However, I am aware that this is not the practice everywhere.  In some cases, the local authority place the responsibility on rent collectors who may also be the nominal collectors of service charges, where they exist.  I say &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; because frequently people pay their charges by post or personally drop them into the council offices.  In these cases <Col N="370" /> there is no direct contact between prospective voters and collectors.  In these circumstances, it is impossible to see how it would be known that young people had reached the age of 18 or that new people had occupied a particular house.</P>
    <P>It is not a valid argument to say that everybody has an opportunity to check the draft register.  The truth is that very few avail of the opportunity to do so, even though it is well publicised.  It is not easy for the average person to find his or her name on the register.</P>
    <P>This is the first comprehensive Bill relating to Dáil elections in the history of the State.  The Bill, which contains 176 sections and four Schedules, amends and consolidates in a single piece of legislation all the law relating to Dáil elections. This makes possible the repeal of about 20 existing statutes, including some which date back to the middle of the last century.  The Electoral Act, 1923, which has formed the basis of Dáil elections since the foundation of the State, is among those being repealed.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with all aspects of Dáil elections from the registration of electors to the nomination of candidates, from the poll and the counting of the vote to election petitions and electoral offences. The purpose of the Bill is (a) to consolidate the Dáil elections law; (b) to express the law in clear and simple terms; and (c) to effect certain desirable amendments. The Bill involves a total restatement and modernisation of the existing law.  The Electoral Act lies at the very basis of our democracy.  It is highly desirable that this branch of the law should be set out in a single Act expressed in simple terms and available to all.  It is wrong that it should be scattered throughout a number of statutes and be in danger of becoming the preserve of experts and specialists.  If only for this reason, the present Bill is very welcome.</P>
    <P>There are significant amendments in the Bill which will go a long way towards improving electoral procedures.  Some of the more important changes are contained in the part of the Bill dealing with the registration of electors.  A new and <Col N="371" /> shorter timescale for preparing the register will be introduced.  Under it, the time allowed for preparing and publishing the register will be reduced from seven to five months.  This is a worthwhile change because one of the criticisms heard at present is that some of the information contained in the register is seven months out of date before it is even published. The new timetable will also mean that the time for checking the draft register by the general public will no longer be during the Christmas holidays.  Provision is made for the publication of a supplement containing the names of qualified electors omitted from the register.  It is always a source of annoyance and anger when people who have been on the register for years find themselves omitted for no apparent reason.  The Bill will give such people an opportunity to have their names restored to the register.  In providing this facility we must be careful not to undermine the status of the permanent register.  We must ensure that there is no abuse and that every application for inclusion in the supplement is fully checked out.</P>
    <P>The procedure in relation to the supplement, which is set out in the Second Schedule, seems to meet these requirements. I would like to see the procedure teased out in more detail on Committee Stage to ensure that on the one hand, it includes all necessary safeguards and, on the other, that it is not unduly complicated.</P>
    <P>Registration in respect of more than one address is specifically prohibited and it is made clear that inquiries by the registration authority and county registrar may be extended beyond their functional area.  As the Minister indicated, this arises from the ruling of the Supreme Court on the case taken by the students of Waterford Regional Technical College. The Supreme Court is the appropriate body to rule on the interpretation of any provision in our law and its ruling must be and is, of course, accepted.  That said, the ruling of the court in this case came as a surprise to most people involved in electoral matters.  Prior to the ruling it <Col N="372" /> was generally accepted that a person was entitled to be registered once and once only.  To allow multiple registration would be to open up all sorts of possibilities and it is correct the Oireachtas should now close this loophole.</P>
    <P>The possibility of publishing a list of additions and deletions rather than the full draft register each year is provided for.  This arrangement has certain advantages. It will mean the changes proposed in the register could be seen at a glance and that printing and handling costs might be reduced.  However, there may be different views among the people actually engaged on registration work and it is correct that the system be tried out on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer may, in future, meet three-quarters of the cost of preparing the register rather than one-half as at present.  Justice would seem to require that this change be made.  After all, the register is used at local government elections only once in every five years while it is used virtually every year for national polls of one kind or another.  I would like to think any savings in local authority funds under the arrangement would be devoted to improving the field work which is vital to the accuracy of the register.</P>
    <P>The requirement that applicants for inclusion in the special voters list must be certified to be of sound mind is removed. So also is the requirement to submit a medical certificate each year.  These changes will be welcomed by everybody, in particular by disabled persons, some of whom regard the requirement in relation to sound mind to be most offensive. I can understand why the Minister, the former Deputy Boland, considered it appropriate to write these conditions into the special voting scheme originally but with the benefit of six years experience of the operation of the scheme it is clear these conditions can now be safely dropped.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution this morning referred to the fact that an elector may be assisted only by the presiding officer.  This led to abuse over the years. It is something that should be looked at. <Col N="373" /> In most cases, they are accompanied by a friend or a member of the family.  It is most embarrassing because it possibly brings to light for the first time that the person is illiterate whereas if he were accompanied by a family friend or somebody very close to him this would not arise.  I ask the Minister to look at this aspect.</P>
    <P>Free postage for candidates was also mentioned in the Minister's contribution. The existing law gives candidates in general elections the right to send one letter free of postage to each elector on the register.  The Bill continues this arrangement but it enables the Minister to vary it should this be considered desirable. The Minister can only do so following consultation with interested parties and with the approval of both Houses.  Free postage is a useful facility for a candidate. It makes sure his message reaches every elector although there are mixed views among the elected representatives about the real value of the facility given, in particular, the high cost to the Exchequer which is involved.  Some take the view that a leaflet delivered to each household might serve the purpose just as well.  The provision in the Bill will enable the question to be teased out by all parties involved and, hopefully, an appropriate and acceptable arrangement will be put in place.</P>
    <P>The deposit required will be increased from £100 to £500 but will be refunded if the candidate's votes exceed one-quarter rather than one-third of the quota.  The purpose of the deposit is to discourage frivolous candidates.  Our arrangements for the nomination of candidates are probably the most open of any electoral system.  Any Irish citizen wherever he was born or wherever he may live is entitled to nominate himself as a candidate or be nominated by just one elector for the constituency.  Clearly some measure is necessary to safeguard against the possibility of the ballot paper being swamped by large numbers of non-serious candidates.</P>
    <P>In 1923 a deposit of £100 was a substantial amount, worth over £3,000 in present values.  It is clearly time the <Col N="374" /> deposit was brought up to a more realistic level.  There are, of course, other ways of discouraging non-serious candidates.  We could, for example, confine to registered political parties the right to nominate which I understand is the tendency in many democracies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is unlikely that such an arrangement would find favour here and the traditional method of paying a deposit fixed at a reasonable level is likely to be more acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Bill will also put a stop to the hassle which takes place outside some polling stations, especially in city areas and large urban areas.  Some parties and candidates have made it a practice to station a large number of canvassers at the entrance to polling stations.  These canvassers make a last minute effort to influence voters by pressing leaflets on them and urging them not to forget a particular candidate.  Most people take this in their stride but some regard it as a serious nuisance or even a form of intimidation.  It is difficult to see what parties or candidates can hope to gain from this sort of activity which is more likely to antagonise electors rather than win their support.  The Bill, quite rightly, will forbid this kind of activity and it will be possible for an elector to go in peace to his polling station and cast his vote without pressure and hassle.  The question arises whether it is enough to forbid this activity within 50 metres of the polling station.  It may well be desirable to extend the ban to perhaps 100 or 200 metres.  This can be looked at on Committee Stage when the views of all sides of the House can be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An updated procedure for questioning Dáil elections by way of election petition to the High Court is provided for and the earlier British statutes are being repealed. Legal proceedings to question the results of elections are, fortunately, very rare but we cannot afford to ignore the possibility.  Under our system of election, results can be very close indeed.  We can all recall the position at the European <Col N="375" /> elections in the constituency of Leinster in the 1989 elections.  In my own constituency of North Kerry, things also ran very tight in the 1987 general election.  It is right that we should have a simple, clear, up-to-date procedure for dealing with this matter.  It is proper, too, that we should repeal as many outdated British statutes as possible.  After 70 years of self-government, it is ironic that much of our activity should still be governed by legislation enacted by the previous regime.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister and the Government have many serious matters to attend to and time is always at a premium.  I suggest that wherever a suitable opportunity arises, advantage should be taken to replace old outdated legislation with modern, comprehensive measures.  The present Bill sets a good headline in this regard which I hope will be followed in other areas of legislation.</P>
    <P>The provision of the Bill which has attracted most attention is the proposal to regulate the taking of opinion polls in the week before polling day.  This proposal was included because of concern about the effects polls can have on how electors vote.  There can be no doubt there is serious concern and questioning in this regard.  It is found among elected representatives at all levels and among the public.  Questions were raised about the role and influence of opinion polls in the divorce referendum and the presidential election campaign.  I understand many other democracies have given consideration to the influence of opinion polls.  Some have decided to introduce regulatory provisions, others have not, but all have taken the view that there are questions to be answered.</P>
    <P>It has been interesting to follow correspondence in this matter in the newspapers since the provision was first published last year.  Originally there seemed to be a view that polls were simply a snapshot of public opinion at a particular time, that they were entirely neutral and harmless and did not affect the course of an election or referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> That view would now find very few supporters. It is now quite clear that polls affect how people vote and this was confirmed by a poll taken last June.  The question to be decided is whether the influence which polls have is a legitimate one.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of a general election is to provide a Government which will administer the affairs of the nation for the coming four or five years.  Each of the contestant parties put forward their policies, programmes and invite the electorate to choose between them.  The proposals of the different parties are examined, re-examined, analysed, criticised, argued and counter-argued in the media and elsewhere.  This is right and proper and is the very essence of the democratic process.  In a sense the elector is like a member of a jury.  It is his right and indeed his duty to consider all the evidence, all the arguments, and then make his judgment.  That is the nub of the matter.  It must be the elector's own judgment and he must not be swayed or stampeded by what opinion polls may say about how people intend to vote.</P>
    <P>The influence of opinion polls is not a free and independent exercise of the franchise by an individual elector.  This is the reason it is desirable that the taking of these polls in the days immediately preceding an election should be covered by law.  If I have a criticism of the proposal in the Bill it is that it does not go far enough.  There is much to be said for having the prohibition apply not just for the final week but throughout the entire election campaign, in particular in relation to a general election.</P>
    <P>It may be outside the scope of the present Bill but there is fairly substantial all-party support for a fundamental reappraisal of our electoral system, in particular in relation to multi-member constituencies.  I look forward to having the Minister back to us in the near future with a measure addressing this wider question.</P>
    <P>This Bill is essentially a consolidation measure with a number of important <Col N="377" /> improvements and constructive, worthwhile measures.  It deserves to be supported. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill demonstrates the unacceptably slow pace, the snail-pace of legislation through the Oireachtas.  On 7 June last, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, was reported in the press as saying that he hoped to bring this legislation into the Dáil before it rose for the summer recess, and that it was expected to be adopted in the autumn session.  It just makes one wonder about the seriousness <Col N="378" /> of the intention to bring about parliamentary reform when we think of all the other Bills that are still hanging fire.</P>
      <P>Eventually when they are passed into law their implementation is correspondingly very slow.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of any legislation which will improve the electoral process and help people to vote in an informed way at referenda as well as general elections. The whole purpose of politics should be to encourage maximum participation especially at a time of intense cynicism about politics and politicians.  It will be interesting to see the percentage turnout in the next election in view of the events of the past few months.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision that a candidate is no longer required to have an election agent.  That is a modernising measure.  There should be better Exchequer support for the registration process and the specific prohibition of more than one address.  All that is very welcome, as is the prohibition on canvassing at polling stations in a totally unnecessary and unpleasant way. Whether this can be implemented in the specific measure laid out in the Bill is another matter.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that other matters were not touched upon.  The order of candidates on a ballot paper might well have been totally redesigned by lot so as to obviate the advantage gained by random alphabetical preference.  Political scientists agree that a candidate with a name like &ldquo;Abbot&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Ahern&rdquo;, if I may give that example, has a distinct electoral advantage which may stand to him for life over someone with a name like Woolworth or Woodsworth.</P>

      <P>It has been my singular good fortune that in all the elections I ever contested &mdash; whether Seanad Éireann, the UCC governing body, university Senate, and they must add up over the past 15 to 20 years to a total of 18 or 20 overall &mdash; there was never a single Murphy on any of those ballot papers, <Col N="379" /> let alone a John A. Murphy.  There is someone looking after me.</P>
      <P>A matter which western democracy should consider &mdash; and I agree that this is only a consolidation measure &mdash; is whether, like the Australians, we should exercise a compulsory dimension to voting and the imposition of a fine for not voting.  I am sorry that this measure did not touch on the funding of political parties.  That still remains unreformed. There are no controls in our electoral process over the amount spent by parties on general elections.  It seems to be a topsy-turvy sense of values that this Bill and the Minister's speech worries so much about the alleged adverse effect of opinion polls on the one hand and takes no account of the gross disproportion that may be introduced by the spending of vast sums of money from hidden sources to influence the outcome.</P>
      <P>There are some provisions I specifically welcome: for example, and this has been said by previous speakers, the abolition of the declaration of the sound mind requirement which was heretofore necessary in the case of disabled electors.  I am glad it has been repealed.  It was insulting. One could argue that it was not that politicians needed to be protected from electors of unsound mind but rather the other way round.  It might be no harm to introduce a sound mind criterion for holders of office at the highest level.  Perhaps every Cabinet Minister should have a mental examination in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the question of registration of political parties, the registrar should give serious consideration to the question of excluding a political party which espouses violence as the fundamental means of implementing its policies.  That is the very antithesis of democracy.  A political party cannot at once be a legitimate, political parliamentary party exercising the freedom available to it under democracy and, at the same time, be a front, a mouthpiece for a violent organisation.  In a way it debars itself.  Any party which espouses violence really excludes itself from the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section which deals with a <Col N="380" /> contingency provision for British citizens. That prompts me to comment that residence should be the primary qualification for the franchise.  Thomas Davis in the first issue of <i>The Nation</i> newspaper in 1843 defined residence as the primary qualification for nationality.  He said it does not matter what race or religion you are, or whether you came yesterday, the stranger within the gate as well as the Milesian of a thousand years, should all be deemed Irish.</P>
    <P>In my estimation, the prime qualification for voting is if you really live in this country, if what the Government do is of primary concern to you, if you pay your taxes and if you can claim to be a resident citizen or even a resident who is not technically a citizen and whether a person is black, or British or Irish, if they are living and working in Ireland they should have the vote.</P>
    <P>Conversely, I would accept the logic of the other side of that argument.  I cannot see how you can give the parliamentary vote on the same level as resident citizens to people who are not living, working and paying their taxes in the country.  I know it is unfashionable to say that at the moment, it is the fashionable cant to talk about giving emigrants the vote, but I think the fundamental principle is no representation without taxation, to invert a famous phrase.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that Senator Naughten went willingly with the proposal to raise the electoral deposit from £100 to £500.  To me this smacked of a suspicious bipartisan consensus keeping out people who do not have party backing. I was amazed the Minister even had the nerve to say he has considered a higher deterrent, but perhaps £3,000 was a bit much.  In my view, £500 is a bit much.  The whole presumption that you should have any deposit at all is a highly debatable one.  Who is to say which candidate is a frivolous candidate?  This discouraging frivolous candidates is a relic of 19th century lingering patneralism, the feeling that somehow you really cannot give the vote to every Tom, Dick and Harry, you cannot have every class of people sitting in Parliament, you must <Col N="381" /> try to keep out the lower orders as much as possible.  Why should it be presumed that because a person cannot scrape together £100 he is a frivolous candidate? There could be an unemployed, very intelligent, very well educated man or woman representing a small group in their area who could not put together £500.  I think this is, in its own way, a diminution of every person's democratic righ to stand for Parliament.</P>
    <P>Why should it only be the poor and the impecunious who are frivilous?  There are many rich people who have stood for Dáil and Seanad elections who would measure up to any criterion of frivolity.  I thought the section of the Minister's speech dealing with this matter was typically patronising. It would make more sense perhaps &mdash; and this is not my original suggestion &mdash; and be fairer if instead of requiring a £500 deposit, you required a candidate to have 500 signatures.  Any person who can produce 500 signatures must be deemed a serious candidate, even if that person does not have the money.  I leave that section without any wish to pursue it further except to aay that to me it smacks of a patronising attitude that people who have not a bob in their pockets cannot be seriously considered as good parliamentary material.</P>
    <P>I move to my greatest objection to the Bill, and the one which will make me vote against the Second Stage, that is, the outrageous section which proposes to limit the opinion polls within seven days of an election.  Let me read the specific clause.  Section 167 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>...&ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; means a systematic inquiry conducted by means of questioning a sample of persons considered to be representative of the population of the State or any part thereof for the purpose of ascertaining the likely opinions of the population of the State as a whole or part thereof on matters relating to any election or referendum including the manner in which the population of the State or part thereof may vote in such election or referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> (2) An opinion poll shall not be taken, or caused to be taken, on any of the 7 days immediately preceding the polling day at an election or referendum.</P>
    <P>And it threatens horrendous fines and penalties for doing this.  The definition as I have read it out surely must include all kinds of taking of opinions.  The section talks about the State or a portion thereof, and it certainly must include radio polls, television polls, local radio samplings, person in the street samplings etc.  These could all be construed as opinion polls. To say these are to be banned for seven days before an election seems to be a monstrous interference with peoples' democratic rights and freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to examples from other countries.  I think it was the last speaker who said, in a vague way, that there are good precedents for this in other countries, the implication being that we are simply going to keep in step with other countries.  The opposite is the case.  There is perhaps only one example of an opinion poll which I consider deleterious and harmful to the electoral process, and that is the taking of exit polls in a country like the United States of America where there are three time zones and where some citizens have not yet voted by the time they read the exit poll results in another part of the United States.  That is not a good idea.  But even there and it is interesting that it should be allowed there because it seems that any move in the United States to prohibit the taking of exit polls would meet with a storm of protest on the grounds that it is such a fundamental restriction on freedom of expression.  Contrary to what Senator Foley was saying, everywhere else the pattern is totally opposed to the line we are now proposing to take and it is misleading to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>In Portugal, France and Spain, for example, there is a ban on the publication of polls immediately prior to election day; the publication but not the taking of polls.  There are minor controls in Australia, which apply to the broadcast <Col N="383" /> media only, and in Germany on the day of election.  It is worth noting that in two countries as different as Belgium and Turkey the banning of opinion polls was declared unconstitutional in Turkey in 1981 and in Belgium in 1985 and that there is no ban now in those countries. Even more striking is that we are proposing to take this anti-democratic measure at a time when countries recently released from dictatorial servitude are encouraging opinion polls to make the citizens better informed.  I am referring in particular to the election for the Russian Presidency last year when the citizens had wide access to a range of opinion polls.  We are proposing to ban the taking of these polls at a time when Eastern Europe, waking from its nightmare of servitude, is encouraging the clarification which is involved in these polls.</P>
    <P>Nearer home, and part of a jurisdiction to which we all subscribe, the Council of Europe in 1983 considered this question and set up a parliamentary committee to report to it on the whole question of the taking of polls and it studied evidence from European and international experts and its decision was that the &ldquo;objective publication of genuine opinion polls did not have a strong and discernible influence on result&rdquo;.  There was some glib talk here today that the idea of an opinion poll as a snapshot is now discounted and everyone accepts that it has a casual effect on the results, but this is by no means so.  In any case, the Council of Europe was prepared to say that the publication of such polls did not have an influence on the result.  They did not agree there was any need for controls or harmonisation between different countries but emphasised the need for such opinion polls to be above board and to observe codes of conduct and so on.  As the Minister admitted in his speech, there is no implication that the people involved in marketing research do not adhere to such codes of conduct.  The foreign models invoked all run counter to the tendency we now propose to express in this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> What was the motivation of the people who drafted the section?  Is it fundamentally a bureaucratic dislike of an independent source of opinion, a politician's dislike of a media outside their control which is in competition to some extent with what they are saying in the last seven days of an election campaign? Is it a mentality like the one I referred to on the question of increasing electoral deposits, is it that lingering paternalism that voters are somehow children who must be protected from information which may not do them good?  Is it the &ldquo;Daddy knows best&rdquo; mentality?  Why should it be wrong for voters to be influenced by opinion polls in the last seven days and yet be exposed to the full blast of politicians making extravagant promises, tendentious allegations?  Why should they not be banned in the last seven days?</P>

      <P>Senator Naughten made the point that you cannot ban the marketing research surveys on the one hand and keep radio and television opinions open on the other.  The section in the Bill is comprehensive, it envisages a total ban on opinion polls.  I would go further and say that you cannot ban opinion polls and allow politicians to dominate the influencing of citizens' minds in the last seven days.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was circulated in June 1991, Deputy Flynn, the then Minister, gave as a reason for this anti-democratic proposal that people needed a time of quite reflection, if you please, before voting day.  The present Minister has the gall in his speech to say disapprovingly &mdash; and here is the paternalism again&mdash;&ldquo;Opinion polls contribute significantly to the type at election time&rdquo;.  Who causes most of the hype at election time?</P>
      <P>Opinion polls are a model of decorum and restraint at election time in contrast to the hubbub at the hustings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June I believed this proposal was daft, to use somebody else's word, as well as dangerous and I looked forward to the deletion of the section before the Bill was presented to the Dáil or Seanad.  When I <Col N="385" /> saw the section was not being dropped I looked forward a least to a convincing explanation on the part of the Minister but in his speech I find nothing convincing, in fact the opposite.  He says that this provision was included in the Bill in response to concern about the effect on voting which opinion polls can have. Where did that concern come from?  I am not aware of a single political scientist in the country or a single expert in the electoral process who has published anything which suggests that opinion polls are detrimental to the democratic process. Whose concern is this?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, the provision has attracted considerable attention particularly from persons involved in market research and the media.</P>
    <P>Is there a snide implication here that people involved in market research have an axe to grind and that they are manipulating the opposition to this clause in the Bill?</P>
    <P>In an article by Jack Jones, a highly respected market research analyst, in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 8 June he pointed out that the market research industry derives only 2 per cent of its income from political polling, that is over the general range of activity, and from pre-election polling the market research industry derives only 0.3 per cent of its income.  They have no axe to grind.  I do not like to suggest from that the contrary implication.  Of course there is a possibility that as long as you have uncontrolled donations by anonymous sources to political parties, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a political party would use funds thus in its control to bribe market researchers to influence polls in a particular way.  Perhaps that is outlandish but it is the only way I can see market research being adversely influenced.</P>
    <P>The most hilarious section in the Minister's explanation is where he talks about polls contributing to hype at election time.  If these opinion polls are deemed to be bad for the electoral process and for democracy, why limit their banning <Col N="386" /> to seven days before polling day?  Why not 14 or 21 days?  What is so magical about seven?  If they are bad for people, why are they not bad for people all the time?  The minute there is bureaucratic interference you run up against interference with peoples' rights that you cannot set days and dates to.  You will have to ban all discussion on TV and radio, and ban politicians as well.  It is not what the polls say, it is what the pols say that is often objectionable to the electorate, and politicians as well as pollsters can manipulate public opinion in the seven days leading up to an election. Politicians as well as pollsters can slant information and colour the way a person votes.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of all that, even if we accept that the polls have a causal effect on the way people vote, so what?  That is their right.  The people have every right to see the way trends are developing in the last few days of the election.  Under a PR STV system of voting, for example, they have every right to know that their second and further preferences will not be wasted and if there is something in the polls in the last seven days which will help them in this regard they are entitled to that information.  They are entitled to an independent source of assessing public opinion.  They are entitled to see how policies are affecting the electorate in the last few days.  It is gross and unacceptable interference on the part of politicians to try and prevent people having this information.</P>
    <P>It is not for politicians to say to what extent the electorate are influenced by polls, or even if they are totally influenced by them.  Of course they are not. When a voter goes to the polls, who is to break down the motivations and the factors that account for the way that voter marks the ballot paper?  There are all kinds of things.  There is the personality factor.  There is the local factor.  Some people have a high-minded approach that they want to elect a Government at all costs, and so they vote for the party representative they think is best for Government. There are all kinds of factors involved.  It is absurd to talk about polls <Col N="387" /> having a predominant influence on the way they vote.</P>
    <P>I think this is an extraordinary proposal and the Minister's speech is absolutely unconvincing in that respect.  Above and beyond all that &mdash; I am speaking as a lay person but I hope there will be a constitutional challenge &mdash; it seems that there is a <i>prime facie</i> case for arguing that this section is unconstitutional.  Article 40.6.1ºi of the Constitution guarantees the rights of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  There is a long modification of that about public order and so on, but no one would seriously argue there is any question of public order being at risk because of the taking of opinion polls.</P>
    <P>There are two fundamental principles being infringed here: one, the right of the citizens to maximum information and, two, the right of the freedom of the press and the media &mdash; both freedoms seem to be incorporated in that one subsection. One may argue that people will have enough information even if the taking of opinion polls is banned, that may be so, but the taking away of an existing right, and the taking away of an existing measure of freedom of expression, in itself constitutes a constitutional infringement on people's rights to express fully their convictions and opinions.  By reducing the information they have been accustomed to, it dilutes the quality of their democracy.  Assuming that the Government will not withdraw this section either here or in Dáil Éireann, I will be astonished if this legislation does not run into trouble in the courts.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I submit that such a section is totally at odds with the promise of open Government which was part of the original Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme and the Taoiseach elect &mdash; if I may anticipate the verdict by an hour or so &mdash; has declared himself as being very firmly in favour of open Government.  Surely the style of electioneering and the rules for electioneering should be similarly open and unrestricted.  I regard this section in particular as defective, badly researched and <Col N="388" /> I have no option but to vote against Second Stage and encourage my colleagues to do likewise.</P>

      <P>This comprehensive Bill is very welcome in that it consolidates in one piece of legislation all the law relating to elections.  Any Bill that repeals 20 statutes is extremely comprehensive.  We tend not to change electoral Acts and we sometimes fall into traps which are set outside the Houses of the Oireachtas because our legislation is not kept up-to-date in national or international terms. There are parts of the Bill which bring up-to-date and address many of the problems which have been contributing to public disquiet and have created problems for those who have stood for elections and for the electorate.  The single biggest problem that has confronted the electorate over the past number of years has been the method by which the electoral register is set up, maintained and changed.  There is not a politician, a member of a political party or anybody supporting a candidate at any election, apart from the Seanad elections, who has not come across a large number of people who have been left off voting registers. Not alone have the names of new electors not been entered, but in many cases, electors who have resided at the same address for many years have been taken off the register.  Of course, the local authority is the responsible body but it is extremely difficult to find out who is ultimately responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a country where democracy is of paramount importance and where the system of Government is subscribed to by 99 per cent of the people, nothing worse could happen than having your name taken off the register.  Any method that can change the system of the registration of electors to make it more up-to-date and keep it simple, is of paramount importance.  That is the kernel of this Bill.  The current system of producing a register, and a draft register and timing the publication of the draft register, has created problems in that the draft register has to be checked when people are on <Col N="389" /> holidays.  This makes it extremely difficult to do a proper check.</P>
    <P>On the recent local election campaign, I had 200 queries about the register in my own area.  I went to the county council officers recently to find that about 160 of those had been dealt with, but there were still 40 outstanding.  It is desirable that the courts of appeal should be used more than they have been in the past and that people who are interested in politics should go to the courts when they are held, because if they do at least they will have some input into what changes, additions or deletions are made.  Sometimes the people who criticise most are the very people who do not attend these revision courts.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections in the Bill which will simplify additions and deletions.  A draft register is a very good idea and it will reduce the problems associated with going through the draft register and the transferal of detail from the draft to the full register.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the Exchequer may pay 75 per cent of the cost of preparing the register instead of 50 per cent as at present.  I sincerely hope that &ldquo;may&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;will&rdquo; because too often we see &ldquo;may&rdquo; used and it is not changed to &ldquo;will&rdquo;.  I am not sure if we will have to change the wording to ensure that the money is available to the people preparing the register.  Under existing law the cost of preparing and publishing the register of electors is borne equally by registration authorities and the Exchequer.  This principle of shared costs will continue but under section 20 the proportion of costs borne by the Exchequer may be increased.  I hope on Committee Stage that provision in section 20 will be changed to &ldquo;will be increased from 50 to 75 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned that provision is to be made in the Bill to ensure that if there are inaccuracies in the register penalties can be placed on the registration authority. The legislation would have to be very specific about what is meant by inaccuracies and what extent of inaccuracy is to be liable for punishment by what degree of penalty.  The imposition of <Col N="390" /> penalties on the basis of a vague word like &ldquo;inaccuracies&rdquo; will not stand up.</P>
    <P>The sections dealing with special voters are a most welcome change in the legislation. The situation regarding special voters' rights to vote was addressed in legislation not so long ago &mdash; in the Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Act, 1986.  It is important that people not physically capable of getting to a polling booth should have the means to vote.  A number of these housebound people take a deep interest in national politics and in the past felt left outside the political system because they could not exercise their right to vote.</P>
    <P>The least that could be said of the previous legislation was that it was insensitive in that certificates had to be presented each time somebody wanted to vote.  The change taking place whereby initial certification of medical disability will suffice unless there is a complete change in the medical condition is more sensitive than the previous provision.</P>
    <P>The question of a supplement rather than a draft register is a very good idea. I am not sure of the intention regarding registration at more than one address.  It will be specifically prohibited by the Bill; it has been made clear that inquiries by the registration authority in county registers for this purpose may extend beyond their functional area.  This would seem as if a person who is registered in more than one place is <i>de facto</i> being put into an illegal situation, whereas somebody living in one place and on a register elsewhere could be in this position because they have not been taken off a register. Unless I am mistaken this could mean that every elector will now have to check the registers in every part of the country to ensure they are not on another register since it is illegal to be on more than one register.</P>
    <P>I would like to have clarification on that issue because I do not see how a person could ensure they are not on more than one register.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying, he might explain what is meant by this, or how a person can discover whether they are on two <Col N="391" /> registers.  I always thought one could be on any number of registers but could only vote in one place.  If people wanted to vote twice or three times in the past I do not think the matter of dual or triple registration made any difference to them. There have always been people ready to avail of an opportunity to vote twice or three times.</P>

      <P>Gardaí now will have the option of registering as postal voters or as ordinary electors.  That section is an excellent addition because gardaí by virtue of their duties, can often be living away from the area in which they are registered.  I would also like to see that section widened to include people working away long term from the area in which they are registered. Because of the mobility of labour at present and the difficulty of getting work in one's own locality, a number of Irish people work away from home and the numbers are sufficient to merit the option of a postal vote.  This issue comes up at every election and it should be addressed.  I am not sure what criteria could be used but someone working away from home for periods of three or four months on contract or whatever should have the option of a postal vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy raised the subject of opinion polls.  They do not reflect the totality of people's thinking because the opinion poll answer is based on a certain question and sometimes that question is not the one put to the elector at the polling station, namely, are you going to vote for A, B, C or D?  That is a very simple question but most polls do not ask it.  They couch their questions in a totally different form.  As to the constitutionality of abolishing opinion polls in the last seven days before elections, Senator Murphy is flying a kite there.  I do not <Col N="392" /> think he is serious when he says it is going to create a constitutional problem.  I cannot see where he gets this idea about the possible unconstitutionality of the measure.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with the section of the Bill in which it is suggested that activity around polling booths should be abolished. I never thought it did anybody any good except the printers.  By polling day every constituent has received a canvas card.  They have been approached individually and collectively.  On election day I have seen up to 100 people around polling stations, a useless exercise and an intimidating one for some people.</P>
    <P>However, there should be no banning of candidates from appearing outside polling booths.  If candidates appear outside a polling booth they are there for one reason and this should not give rise to intimidation.  It seems that a candidate's presence outside a polling booth would be banned under this section of the Bill which is not what the Bill was meant to do.  The presence of candidates outside a polling booth, especially in their own area, is not going to influence many voters but the candidate has a right to be there and I hope the Bill will be amended accordingly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of assistance to electors, I am glad to see the retention of the provision whereby a blind or incapacitated person can be assisted by a companion or by the presiding officer and an illiterate elector may be assisted only by the presiding officer.  I wonder why a distinction is made between incapacitated, blind and illiterate persons? An illiterate person is incapacitated where voting is concerned; therefore if a blind or otherwise incapacitated person is allowed bring a companion to vote for them, an illiterate person should have the same right.  Illiteracy is a handicap and the educational system has not succeeded in correcting this problem.</P>
    <P>The review of the Euro-constituencies to be carried out before 1993 will take into account the changes in population. In one sense this is a good idea but in another sense it might mean that the preponderance of MEPs would come from <Col N="393" /> the areas of densest population.  Because of our present peripherality problems areas of low density population probably need more representation in Europe than do the areas of high population.  Problems of peripherality are more evident in the low population centres &mdash; not alone in this country but in other countries&mdash; and we should not just change the Euro-constituencies in terms of population without taking this fact into account. People on the north-western and southwestern seaboard particularly should have maximum representation in Europe, otherwise the urban mentality will prevail and we will not achieve the desired social equity.  The only way to achieve that is to ensure reasonable representation based not only on population but on the problems of particular areas.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill with major consequences for certain areas.  This House should welcome the fact that it includes much that voters and potential politicians have been requesting for some time.  Raising the deposit figure from £100 to £500 does reflect monetary increases to a certain degree.  However, I see value in Senator Murphy's point that, instead of placing a monetary value on the credibility of a person, a numerical guarantee could be used &mdash; 500 voters could sign a petition to say a certain person was a person of standing and would be a useful member of an elected body.  There is value in that, because as Senator Murphy and others have said, £500 in today's terms is not a large amount but it does inhibit people on very low incomes, whether wage or social welfare payments from standing for certain elections.</P>

      <P>The deposit is an inhibiting factor and I do not think that a person who has not got £500 is not a fit and proper person to stand for election.  It is not a matter I would be prepared to vote against, but it is less than democratic to put a monetary value on a person's suitability for election.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure about the question of free postage, at present each candidate is allowed one free envelope to each elector. If a candidate contests two polls on the same day he is entitled to include material for both elections in the one envelope in one constituency only but a candidate who contests more than one constituency will be allowed free postage in one constituency only.  There is an anomaly there.  If he is entitled to stand in two constituencies, why should he not be entitled to free postage in the two constituencies?  This situation has not arisen in Dáil elections in the past; I do not know of anybody who stood in two constituencies.  While people have stood in two elections on the same day, they have not been in two constituencies; I am thinking of Euro elections and national elections.  We are talking about a modification here where people will be able to send out not envelopes but election addresses.  I have not gone into the details of that section but there seems to be an anomaly which I am sure will be teased out as the Bill goes through Committee and remaining Stages.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am sure a few minor changes will have to be made to ensure that it will not be challenged in the courts.</P>

      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed although, broadly speaking, it is not exceptional.  It seems to be a tidying up job of a whole series of Acts which were passed over the last 100 years or more, many dating from before the foundation of the State.  In relation to the register, many proposals are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Large numbers of people feel offended and frustrated when at election time, they discover their names are not on the register. It is intensely irritating and nothing much can be done about it once the register is published.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the proposals to restrict the capacity of people to be registered at more than one address, which is relevant to a number of groups of people, particularly students at third level institutions. Up to 35,000 third level students in this country live away from home; and most of these are concentrated into a small number of centres and, indeed, within those centres they are again concentrated into a few areas.  Most of the students in Dublin, I suspect, live in the constituency of Dublin south-east, primarily because of the location of University College Dublin, within or on its borders and the location of Trinity College as well.  In that constituency the students' vote would be immensely powerful.  The raw figure of 35,000 would be enough to elect four TDs.  Under this Bill these people will be disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>I presume some of these people will vote.  Some will go so far as to travel to places like Donegal and Kerry in buses graciously supplied by certain political organisations who like to ensure that these people cast their votes.  If some type of agreement could be reached between the various parties and the appropriate figures totted up, they could spare themselves transportation expenses and let the net gain of votes, as it were, for the various candidates travel down.  The probable disenfranchising of students by this development is a matter of considerable disappointment.  This Bill will ensure that students cannot vote in a block again &mdash; a very important restriction of the democratic rights of students.  During their student phase people often feel very strongly about issues and would have the right of every other citizen to express themselves at the ballot box if this restriction were not imposed.  I wonder if the Minister would agree to allow students a postal vote or to come up with some <Col N="396" /> arrangement to avoid the restrictions they are now faced with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>People may be worried because students tend to vote in a more radical manner than the rest of the population, and that may be a matter for concern.</P>
      <P>On the question of frivolous candidates and the need for a deposit, I do not have problems with that.  There is a tendency for some people to put their names on a ballot paper as a way of mocking the system and of drawing attention to themselves. That is not good for democracy. I share the concerns expressed by Senator Lanigan about people in poor circumstances who might be restricted from genuinely contesting elections because of the deposit.  However, there is a clear need for a restriction to prevent people trying to make a mockery of the whole process.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Bill makes no mention of votes for the Irish emigrant community.  I understand a commitment was given in the <i>Programme for Econmic and Social Progress</i>, or was it in the Programme for Government, that votes be provided for emigrants and this would be a golden opportunity to signal that the intentions of the Government were well founded in this regard; emigrants as far as this Bill is concerned are conspicuous by their absence, and that is much to be regretted.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provisions for special voters, the improvements proposed are largely to be welcomed.  At the same time it is difficult to understand the need for a special returning officer and a garda to be present when disabled people cast their votes.  There seems no logical reason disabled people should not be able to vote in precisely the same way as members of the Garda or the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restrictions on activities outside polling stations is for the most part to be welcomed as they may prevent politicians and supporters from behaving in a ridiculous manner.  I have often felt that the <Col N="397" /> nearer the election the more disturbed, incoherent and unreasonable the candidate; the nearer the election, the worse it gets and it reaches a crescendo on polling day where totally futile exercises are engaged in by politicians of every description.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to visualise anyone other than the purely eccentric elements of Irish life making their way to the polling station without any idea as to who they are going to vote for.  It is stretching the imagination to the ridiculous to think of large numbers of people making their way to polling stations and scratching their heads trying to decide to whom they are going to give their No. 1.  That is really pushing it.  This went on, however, we have all been part of it and if you stand back for two seconds you can see it was daft, useless and a waste of time and money.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to mention about the regulation that no canvassing activity can take place within 50 metres of the polling station.  This provision also restricts the use of loudspeakers to within 50 metres of the polling station.  I wonder if the more imaginative and well resourced parties will purchase some loudspeaking equipment which will be able to transcend the 50 metre barrier and bombard the people in an oral assault as they make their way to the polling station.  Could the Minister clarify the position there?  Will we see a return to the fine old traditions of church gate meetings, like those held when I was a youngster with the various factions addressing the crowd through a loud hailer?  Will we have a modernised version of that in times to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the restrictions imposed in section 147 will prevent various parties from providing transportation for constituents who need it taking into account the fact that in order to provide this transportation a certain amount of information had to be collected.  I am not particularly worried about this myself <Col N="398" /> because the party to which I belong in Dublin do not provide transport to any great extent primarily for financial reasons.</P>
    <P>I would also share the concern of Senator Lanigan about the rights of candidates to stand within the 50 metre perimeter of polling stations.  I think it is nice for people going into polling stations to have a look at the candidate and it is even nicer for the candidate to have a look at people going in and out.  You would get a fair idea whether or not they voted for you from the way they look at you.  It is not so much the way they look at you as the body language and so on.  It certainly is very telling when you see a good friend, a person with whom you occasionally drink a bottle of stout in the local saloon bar, sprinting past you on polling day with an earnestness and a gush.  It does concentrate the mind and gives rise to the greatest degree of concern about the assurances and expressions of goodwill about your hopes of success and all that. However, these are minor things and are not of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>What is of importance, however, is the question of the taking of opinion polls, or rather the ban on the taking of opinion polls to which I am very much opposed as a restriction on freedom.  In many ways it is a facing back towards the dark ages, where all sorts of tomfoolery and codology can be put about which will have the effect of creating false impressions and of enhancing the capacity for propaganda, misleading statements, misleading impressions and so on to be used.  The opinion polls are of course based on scientific theory and method.  They spell out the realities as they are on the day the opinion poll is taken.  I do not accept that opinion polls seriously influence opinion.  I certainly do not accept that they seriously influence opinion in the last week of an election.  My own guess, for what it is worth, is that opinion has settled a week before the election.  For the most part that has happened, barring remarkable developments over the last few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point of concern which I want to mention specifically in relation to the provisions of section 167 regarding opinion polls.  If I read it correctly, this section defines an opinion poll as wide enough to actually make illegal a normal political canvass, a function of which is manifestly for the purpose of ascertaining the likely opinions of the population of the constituency. As I read that section, it seems to me that a canvass which is conducted on any sort of a coherent basis could be classified as an opinon poll, because what is a canvass other than an attempt to ascertain the way people will vote?  Is that not the first objective?  In rural areas you do not have to do that.  You know already what way they are likely to vote &mdash; at least some of them though maybe things have changed since I left west Clare.  To be fair to the Minister, he has a wider experience of these matters than I.  But there are certain types of persons whose voting is clearcut and will not change.  In a canvass it seems to me the one of the first things anybody will try to do is to establish how people are going to vote, and then a certain message is given.  If I am not making a mistake, in the earlier days of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey's disdain and disregard for opinion polls&mdash; in many ways he had a point &mdash; he always, if I remember correctly, put great emphasis on what the Fianna Fáil canvassers were bringing back by way of information <Col N="400" /> in relation to the Fianna Fáil vote holding and so on.  All he was saying was that the Fianna Fáil canvassers were quite good at carrying out opinon polls and, in effect, that is what they were doing.  I would not dispute that with the Taoiseach at all.  My experience of the Fianna Fáil canvassers is they are quite sharp at figuring out trends.  They may not express them in the same lingo as MRBI or IMS do, but they certainly have quite a good grasp of it. The poll is structured very systematically. I would suggest that the conducting of such a canvass, in effect an opinion poll could be considered to be at variance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are a number of items in the Minister's speech in relation to opinion polls that I want to raise with him.  First of all, he talks about our people being concerned about the effects of opinion polls.  I have not seen very much of that concern.  The only people who seem to be concerned or bothered about opinion polls are politicians and to some extent the people who conduct them.</P>
      <P>The second suggestion made is that opinion polls influence the way people vote.  I am of the view that there is a very poor understanding of the various factors which lead people to vote in one way or another and that opinion polls are a very small factor in a whole range of factors. Certainly, there has not been any evidence produced by the Minister of the importance of opinion polls.  The Minister said it was generally recognised that opinion polls are influential.  By whom? One of the leading opinion poll conductors in this country, Mr. Jack Jones, wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> shortly after this Bill was published in which he produced quite an amount of evidence suggesting that they were not influential. In particular the Minister referred to a poll which was published last June and which showed the influence of polling. Where was that poll published, by whom was it conducted and how in the name of goodness can the Minister conclude on the basis of simply one poll that opinon polls are influential in terms of how people cast their votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that at all.  I genuinely <Col N="401" /> feel that if opinion polls are banned then we are moving back into the area where it will be much easier to mislead people and to get involved in all sorts of codology.  Another advantage of opinion polls is that they clarify the significance of the various issues for the public.  One other reason why I am strongly in favour of opinion polls is that if they are abandoned or banned, then I believe that will discriminate against smaller parties who have not the capacity to carry out the systematic-type canvass which the larger parties have both the money and the expertise to do.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to mention.  There is the question of who can be present at the counting of votes.  My understanding of it is that neither the candidate nor the election agent is included as a person who may attend at the counting of votes as described in section 113 (2).  Of course, it is possible to have the candidate or the agent present at the discretion of the returning officer.  I would like to see the entitlement of candidates and of their election agents spelled out in rather more detail than being at the discretion of the returning officer.  The same comments apply to sections 125 and 153.</P>
    <P>In relation to entitlements to challenge a Dáil election, some of the details of how a Dáil election may be challenged are spelt out in the Third Schedule. Section 132 provides that a Dáil election may be challenged in accordance with the provisions of the Third Schedule.  It is conceivable that an argument could be made that the effect of that section is only that the Director of Public Prosecutions may take an electoral petition, though obviously it is clear from the tone of the Bill that that is not the intention.  I raise that question in the hope it can be clarified and that we can have some details on what the situation is.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part XIV, I am rather disappointed that there is not any clarification in relation to the voting patterns which emerged when the Dáil elections and the European elections were held on the same day in June 1989.  In those elections, I am sure everyone here is well <Col N="402" /> aware, some people started voting for their party on a one, two, three basis in the Dáil election; then went on to vote for the same party in the European election on the basis of four, five and six. There were subsequent court cases in relation particularly to the European election as it was conducted in Leinster, the decisions of returning officers and so on.  My understanding of the court judgment in relation to that matter was that it did not clearly reach a decision as to whether the four, five or six votings would in effect be taken as one, two and three.  I understand further that some returning officers interpreted the four, five and six voting pattern as in effect being spoiled and other returning officers interpreted the same voting patterns on the second paper as being a valid expression of the preferences of the voter.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing some clarification in relation to the rules of how elections should be conducted where two elections are held on the same day.</P>
    <P>Another area I wish to refer to is the provision relating to the adjudication on doubtful ballot papers.  Under section 117, if I am reading it correctly, candidates or their agents are not permitted to handle ballot papers.  Some may say that is a reasonable provision.  However, I envisage difficulties arising in regard to disputed votes where there may be an argument about whether the seal is on the ballot paper.  The resolution of that argument might be facilitated by allowing the agents of the candidates, or the candidates, to look at the ballot paper and get involved in the argument, based on the evidence available at the count.  I suggest the Minister consider introducing an amendment which would allow the returning officer the capacity to permit that if he deemed it desirable or reasonable.</P>
    <P>Section 105, which deals with regulations regarding personation and so on, provides that a personation agent must undertake in writing to prove that the applicant has committed personation before the presiding officer orders an <Col N="403" /> arrest.  That appears unworkable in practice. If the person making the complaint has to do so in writing I would think that all but the more dull of the double, treble or 25-time voters would have left the polling station while that was taking place.  I suggest that the requirement for making the complaint in writing be abandoned.</P>
    <P>Section 101, as I understand it, requires the elector to show the ballot paper when it has been completed and folded.  There is a requirement that the ballot paper be shown to the returning officer prior to it being deposited in the ballot box.  That, in many ways, is a worthy enough requirement.  The difficulty I see with it, particularly in urban polling stations where there is a tremendous rush in the last hour before polling concludes, is that a very difficult and unpleasant traffic jam may be created if this requirement is enforced.  The returning officer, in addition to having to issue ballot papers, mark them and ensure they have the seal on them and so on, will have to inspect ballot papers prior to them being deposited in the ballot box. That is a small technical point and I hope the Minister will look at it.  Does he accept that in some polling stations at the close of poll it would create difficulties?</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about the number of agents allowed.  It appears that the returning officer is given absolute discretion as to the number of agents he may permit.  I would prefer to see a requirement that the returning officer allow a minimum number of agents for each candidate, because if returning officers become difficult candidates may run into very awkward situations.  That would be a way around the problem rather than leaving the matter at the discretion of the returning officer.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the conducting of by-elections and so on.  It might be useful if a provision was included in the Bill to allow for the holding of by-elections on the same day if there are two vacancies in the one constituency.  My understanding is that if there are two vacancies <Col N="404" /> in the same constituency the requirements are that two separate elections be held.  There may be very good political reasons on the part of one side or other of the political divide why that should be done, but it would be more in keeping with the notion of proportionality that if there were two or more vacancies in the same constituency the by-elections should be held on the same day rather than holding two separate elections.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point in relation to the format of the ballot paper.  This refers to the new requirement that people who are voting are obliged to show the ballot paper to the returning officer prior to depositing it in the ballot box.  I would like to see that provision deleted.  If it is not deleted, then the instructions on the ballot paper should be a good deal larger than at present.  That should be considered.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 25 (10), I must confess to being confused.  My puzzlement arises in regard to appeals by political parties which the Registrar of political parties feels no longer have a valid reason for being on the register. The procedure, as I understand it, is that the Registrar will announce that he intends to remove a party from the list. Then there will be time to appeal against this but, if I am not making a mistake, section 25 (4) says that where a party is registered then the appeal is not effective against them.  I must confess to being puzzled by that and I wish the Minister would clarify the situation.  I certainly have no objection to the general intent of that section, but it has confused me.</P>
    <P>Finally, a Cathaoirligh, I want to mention this business of the provision for An Post.  The Government are paying the postage for one letter to be sent to each elector on behalf of each party or of candidates who are not members of a party and so on.  A number of difficulties have arisen in relation to this over the years.  One of them is that in latter times An Post have become quite difficult and they have adhered very much to the letter of the law.  What that has amounted to is that when litters are addressed to &ldquo;The Resident&rdquo; as distinct from Mr. Smith, <Col N="405" /> then An Post have refused to deliver that mail.  That creates a considerable disadvantage for small parties who are under-resourced, and it certainly creates an enormous disadvantage for independent non-party candidates who may have a valid case to argue and a valid case to put before the electorate.  If An Post would deliver letters which are addressed to &ldquo;The Resident&rdquo; it is quite easy using modern computer technology to put together labels on that basis. However, it is rather expensive to put them together on the basis of addressing letters to, say, Mr. John Smith.  That is something that should be reconsidered in relation to this Bill.  I would like to see that provision clarified.</P>
    <P>I am not too concerned about the restriction in the Bill which means that, if an individual is standing as a candidate in more than one constituency, then the capacity to do a mail shot is restricted simply to one constituency.  I think in many ways that might be a sensible provision, because it will prevent somebody from abusing that provision in order to do a mail shot to the whole country.  This might have a certain marketing value for somebody in a certain set of circumstances who decides to use the letter of the law as a way of advertising either themselves or some product or to use that provision as a cheap way of doing a mail shot to the whole country.</P>
    <P>My overwhelming concerns about the provisions of this Bill are primarily directed to the provisions which restrict the conducting of opinion polls.  That is the very regrettable introduction.  I can see no scientific, reasonable or coherent basis for it and I sincerely hope the Minister will reconsider it.  I was pleased to hear him, in his introductory speech this morning, take a very open-minded attitude to this legislation and say that he was open to suggestion.  I sincerely hope that he will reconsider the restriction in relation to opinion polls.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see the Minister take this open-minded attitude, especially on this Bill, because the reality is that, more than any other which comes before this House, everybody here is <Col N="406" /> experienced in it.  In many ways, everybody here is a sort of an expert on elections, and certainly that could not be said about most other Bills which come here. There is fine expertise in many areas, but I do not think you will get the same level of uniform, well-balanced expertise on any topic which would compare with the levels of knowledge and understanding which Members of this House have in relation to the conducting of elections, participating in them and, to a lesser extent, the law &mdash; certainly the nitty-gritty of the practicalities of the law in relation to how elections are conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill. It is very timely and appropriate and comes before us at a time when there are no elections and when we can give it careful consideration.  There are some points I would like to make on it.</P>
      <P>As an ex-rate collector and one who had for a number of years played a part in compiling the register, I can say it was always a very difficult job.  No matter how well you seemed to do it, there was always somebody left off.  Indeed, I remember on one occasion that a workman for the late Eugene Kilbride was left off the register.  It was the first register I did.  Luckily, it concerned the party I supported or I would possibly have been ostracised.  It was no fault of mine; it was a typographical error.  I am very pleased now provision will be made whereby, if someone is left off the register, they can now go to the secretary of the county council and county registrar, make a claim and have their name on the supplementary list to allow them to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am not sure about the timescale. I would like to see it fixed at around three weeks.  People do not look up the register until there is an election or a referendum in the offing, then they start to check it up.  If you are left off a register a year after an election or something like that, there is not much point in putting everybody to the trouble and expense of ensuring that a name is on a supplementary list that might never be used. I would like to see a timescale there of a month to three weeks, preferably three <Col N="407" /> weeks &mdash; not for everybody, but for people who have been resident in the area for years.  You may have someone coming into an area and I do not think it would be possible to have them on a supplementary register.  However, if they had changed house and had come a long distance to live in the area permanently and worked in the area, provision should be made to put them on the supplementary register on the short timescale. It is not fair that they should be disenfranchised.  Long-time residents who have been taken off accidently and those who come permanently to work in an area and who will be resident there for the foreseeable time should also be entitled to get on the supplementary list.</P>
    <P>As regards the short timescale for preparing the register, I am in favour of it, but I would like to see a slight extension of the time.  I would like it extended from 1 August rather than 1 September.  I say that because that is sheep dipping time and one of the busiest times of the year for the council.</P>
    <P>The new date for the coming into force of the register will be 15 February.  I would prefer 1 March.  Those of us who have experience working on rural councils know they are busy times for the council.  They do not normally take on extra staff for such jobs but try to fit it in with their ordinary work.  For that reason I would like to see the time limit extended at both ends.</P>
    <P>As regards registration in respect of more than one address, this is not new, but unfortunately the case brought by the students of Waterford Regional Technical College put a different complexion on that.  I am glad that has been straightened out because it was unfair to expect a secretary of a county council to check that people had only one address.  This Bill makes it crystal clear that a voter cannot have two votes or vote in two places.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that gardaí will have the option of being registered as postal voters or as ordinary electors.  That is long overdue.  Most gardaí are resident in the area where they work and are as <Col N="408" /> entitled to be on the register as any other citizen.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that additions and deletions to the draft register may in future be published in the form of a supplement. That would save local authorities a lot of money and make the register much easier to check.  It would also ensure a more accurate register.</P>
    <P>Some people have been critical of the increase in the deposit by candidates from £100 to £500.  If every candidate was given a grant of £100 towards their election campaign and that was now being increased to £500, we would say that £100 in 1923 would be worth £3,000 today and that an increase of £400 was paltry.  Such hypocrisy annoys me.  An increase from £100 to £500 in this day and age is not outlandish.  Anyone going forward for election today knows he will spend the best part of £4,000 to £5,000, and that is when he is a member of a party; an independent candidate will spend even more than that.  If we did not have to put down a deposit a few smart Alecs in a pub some night, who were under the weather, could put some Johnny forward for election.  I agree with Senator Lanigan that one should have 500 signatories on one's nomination. There must be some way to stop fellows making a joke of an election.  An election is a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the increase from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for councils, but it should be 90 per cent.  Local government elections are only held every five years but there could be three or four general elections during the same period.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that and see if the figure could be raised to 90 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted with the provisions relating to activities at polling stations.  It <Col N="409" /> had become nearly impossible for people to get into polling stations to vote without election leaflets being pushed into their hands, etc. and there were problems with litter as a result, and, at the end of the day, I do not think it resulted in anyone getting one extra vote.  Candidates should canvass properly, from door to door.</P>
    <P>In North Sligo we have a very good arrangement.  On the evening of an election, members of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil go up and down the roads taking down posters within an hour of the ballot closing.  It is disgraceful to see posters particularly those of non-party candidates who talk about the environment, left up on poles long after the election. Every party should be just given one eight by four poster which should be taken down that night.  I would welcome that.  In general, the practice of putting posters on poles should be prohibited. They look dreadful.  Circuses take down their posters immediately the show is over and they should be congratulated for doing so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is very worthwhile. I ask the Minister to consider the points I made.</P>

      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the Bill.  On the last occasion I spoke on a Private Members' motion about the possibility of the Government signing the Council of Europe charter on local self-government the Minister misinterpreted and misconstrued a number of things I said and became extremely irate towards the end of the debate, accusing me of looking for more money for local authorities, which I had not done as I know the cake is limited.  However, as the Minister is leaving now I will not continue with those remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that in his opening remarks he made it clear he was open-minded about certain aspects of the Bill. I hope it is about all aspects of the Bill because, as Senator Upton said, there are very few Bills where every Member of this House and of the Dáil is in a position to make valid, genuine and <Col N="410" /> meaningful comments and contributions. We would not be here were it not for the fact that we had stood in an election so we have views about the good and bad factors and how things can be improved. I hope the Minister will be open to accepting amendments.  He was always open-minded in his capacity as Minister for Health.  He was able to defend his viewpoint and take on board the views of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Murphy, about the slow pace at which legislation goes through this Chamber and how little progress is made.  One could say in defence of this Bill that there are 176 sections plus Schedules so it is a very complex legislation which I am sure took the officials and the Minister a long time to assemble.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is simplifying what was a very complex area and bringing together all legislation pertaining to it in a form which is easy to understand.  The area of legislating for elections is an extremely important one because on it a great deal of our democratic institutions depend.  It is important that we should do everything we can to ensure that elections are fair and we should encourage as many people as possible to vote.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the poll in so many elections has reduced.  We should be concerned about that matter and I have views on it.  It is not only the scandals and unfortunate incidents which have taken place.  We know from opinion polls the poor esteem in which politicians are held. That, undoubedly, is a contributing factor but it also has a lot to do with the fact that politicians tend&mdash;I am referring to those in political parties&mdash;to feel that once they are elected they do not have to go to the voters again for five or six years.  This is one of the fundamental reasons we do not have a higher turnout at elections.  If we had a participative democracy it would be a different situation but that is not what politicians <Col N="411" /> seem to want.  Once they are elected they want to get on with it and take decisions without referring to the people.  That is one of the reasons I have been encouraging the concept of local self government. However, that is not what we are here to discuss today.</P>
    <P>The people decide who they want to represent them.  Power resides with the people as is stated in our Constitution. The people decide that they wish to give over some of that power to persons to represent them and to take decisions for them.  The first place they do that is at local level, whether it be a town commissioner, an urban district council, local county council or city council.  It may be decided that those institutions are not appropriate and that it may be more meaningful, efficient and worthwhile for the county councils to hand over certain powers to a higher body, in this instance it would be the Dáil, and from there the national government handing over certain power to the European Parliament. That is the way I see it.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there is reference to the register of presidential, Dáil and European electors.  I am asking that in any instance where we refer to those we put the local electors, then the government electors and then the European electors. It is only symbolic but it underlines my thinking with regard to the importance of the various stages.  This is the way it is done in many other European countries. I am talking particularly about Switzerland where the local cantons and communes are considered to be of great importance and are fundamental to the way their system of government operates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the register, I agree with the Minister's comments that while people complain bitterly &mdash; as we probably do as politicians &mdash; about the inaccuracies in the voters' register I am inclined to believe what the ESRI report found, that in fact, the register compares <Col N="412" /> not unfavourably with standards elsewhere. In many instances, people are left off the register through no fault of those whose job it is to compile it.  Needless to say, my experience extends only to Dublin Corporation, but I know we have approximately 360,000 names on our register and that as few as 25 to 30 names which should have been on the register were left off.  That is commendable, and great credit is due to those whose job it is to compile the register.  What happens is that people think they are on the register but have not assisted in any way the various overtures made to them by the local authority when they send out their inspectors to compile the voters' register. People imagine that because they are on the register they will automatically be on the register forever, and they do not understand the obligation there is to try to have the register as accurate as possible.</P>
    <P>The process in Dublin Corporation is that inspectors go out and knock on doors and leave various forms, etc.  They make two visits.  They do not take a person off the register in the first year because they have not been able to ascertain that they live in a particular house.  They give them the benefit of the doubt in the first year but if in the following year the same thing happens, the form is not returned and they cannot get any information about whether a person is living in that place, despite consulting with neighbours and doing everything they can to establish if they are living there &mdash; that person is taken off the register.</P>
    <P>It is important that the register is accurate. Admittedly the worst thing is to have somebody excluded from the register who should be on it, but it is also important, as far as possible, to ensure that names are not on the register if those people have long since died, gone abroad or whatever it might be.  We all know of instances where people were involved in personation.  There is an obligation on the compilers of the register to remove <Col N="413" /> the names of people about whom they have no evidence of residence.</P>
    <P>There may be a problem about the new arrangements in Part II of the Bill regarding the drawing up of the register, particularly with regard to the supplement to the register.  In principle, it is a very good idea and one which I wholeheartedly support.  The difficulty is&mdash;and I am sure Senators will agree&mdash;that no matter how much we urge the public to consult the draft register and despite the publicity campaign undertaken by the Minister's Department, people tend not to check if they are on the register until there is an election in the offing.  Then they hope they are on the register and they rush out to check on it.  The difficulty here is that, under the new arrangements, it will be too late to do so at that stage. I do not think it would be realistic to leave it until seven days before the election. There has to be reasonable time to allow the necessary arrangements to be put in place.</P>
    <P>If the public perceive that they can get on to a supplementary register at any time, they may neglect to take the trouble to check if they are on the draft register when it is published.  I suppose that is only human nature.  That is something that should be carefully monitored and if it appears that what I say is true, perhaps the question of a supplementary register should be reconsidered at a future date.</P>
    <P>According to the legislation, electors lists will be drawn up for a trial period. On reflection, I believe it would be very difficult for a large local authority such as Dublin Corporation to operate such a system.  It might be all right in the case of a constituency where there was a very low turnover of voters from one year to the next, but in Dublin Corporation there is a higher than average turnover and the present arrangement of the draft register is more suitable in the circumstances.  I do not think the Minister intends to make guinea pigs of us, so to speak, in trying this out.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (2) (c) of the Bill refers to <Col N="414" /> persons not being entitled to be registered. Is it to be interpreted that the registration authority would need positive evidence that the person concerned had died or moved before including them on List C?  That could result in many people being on the register who should not be included.</P>
    <P>In Part I of the Second Schedule, the date specified in the Bill for the various stages in the preparation of the register could present difficulties for certain local authorities.  We commence house-to-house inspections at the end of August and each year we employ 65 or 70 temporary inspectors for a period of eight weeks to do this job.  Under the new arrangements, this work must be done in a period of about four weeks if we are to comply with the dates as set down.  It will result in quite a lot of pressure.  It is not always that easy to get people to take on these duties.  What it will mean is that we will have to take on 120 or 130 persons to carry out this work over a period of only four weeks.  This could lead to difficulties. However, I suppose these are points I should more properly raise at a later stage.</P>
    <P>A section of the Bill about which I feel extremely strong is that which provides that each candidate will have the same amount of space on the ballot paper. While I go along with that, what I have always taken grave exception to &mdash; and will continue to do so until the situation is rectified &mdash; is that, the candidate's first name and surname will be printed in capitals rather than in ordinary letters and that the requirment that the surname and party name or the expression &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;, as appropriate, should be in large block capitals is retained.  I find the expression &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo; to be extremely offensive and I object strenuously to people using it.  I find it extremely offensive to people of other religions that they are lumped in as non-Catholics, as though Catholics were the only true Church and everybody else is non-Catholic. I take exactly the same exception to <Col N="415" /> being lumped in as non-party.  It has a negative sort of connotation.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;. We are referred to by everybody in this House as &ldquo;Independents&rdquo;.  Why can that title not be permitted on the ballot paper? Why will the Minister not allow candidates to have a blank after their name if they do not wish to be a member of a party?  It is most offensive that they should have to say they are non-party as though a party is sacrosanct but we are non-party.  It is a negative attitude towards people who do not wish to be aligned to a party.  In this country parties dominate, they control everything.  Even on the ballot paper we have to let people know that we are not part of one of the respected, long-standing, highly regarded parties.  I certainly do not like &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; and I do not accept it.  I ask the Minister to consider this and allow us the privilege of a blank after our name if that is the best he can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here.  I realise he has other pressing business to attend to and I will try not to detain him too long.  I wish him well in his choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My question concerns the need for the Minister for the Environment to make provision for a northern access from the new motorway by-pass to the town of Kilcullen, County Kildare.  I am anxious to bring to the Minister's attention the very deep feelings of the community in Kilcullen about what is seen by them as <Col N="416" /> neglect of their town and about the way legitimate demands for adequate road and sewerage services appear to be ignored.  It is important to outline the background to the call by the people of Kilcullen for the provision of adequate access to the north and south of the town, although I imagine the Minister is well aware of the history.</P>
    <P>In January 1991, in a letter to the Secretary of Kildare County Council I asked for clarification in relation to access into and out of Kilcullen and asked if the council had any plans to meet public demand for access from the north.  I received a routine reply then stating that my representations would be investigated at the earliest possible date and that was that.  On 7 February, with a member of Kilcullen Community Development, a body representative of all shades of opinion in Kilcullen, I met members of the county council senior engineering staff.  The minutes of that meeting indicated that if it was possible &ldquo;to prove need&rdquo; a scheme could be brought forward. A member of the engineering staff indicated that there was no objection to the proposal on safety or engineering grounds and that they would prepare a scheme if directed to do so by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Following that meeting the members of Kildare County Council were approached to have the access made an objective of the County Kildare fourth revision of the county development plan which is now in the course of preparation. On 29 April 1991 the members of the county council resolved unanimously, &ldquo;that Kildare County Council provide access for the Kilcullen by-pass to serve Kilcullen, Athgarvan and Twomilehouse&rdquo;. That resolution was communicated to the Secretary of the Department of the Environment on 6 May 1991 by the County Secretary.</P>
    <P>In my view it seems extraordinary, contrary to equity and to local democracy that a unanimous resolution of a local authority can appear to be disregarded <Col N="417" /> by officers of the council and by the regulating Department.  Since then the members of Kilcullen Community Development met Deputy Flynn, when he was the Minister for the Environment, and the present Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon. No one can, at this stage, be in any doubt about the determination of the people of Kilcullen to secure their rights. In fact, they feel so deeply about this matter that the Minister should be advised that they have said publicly they will run a link-road candidate in the event of a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, said in the Dáil last week that the facility sought by the people of Kilcullen could only be provided in the event of Kildare County Council preparing a motorway scheme in respect of such access and that evidence on all aspects of the proposal would have to be presented at a public local inquiry.  My question to the Minister is, can he confirm that under section 4 of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 he is. empowered to instruct the county council to prepare a scheme for a motorway?  In any event I am sure the Minister, and his Department, are in a very strong position to recommend, or advise Kildare County Council to carry on.  The cost would be minimal, relative to the total cost of the motorway project.  All that is required is the provision of a ramp, or ramps, to an existing motorway bridge, structure No. 13 on the motorway map.  The cost has been estimated at £100,000.  The contractors have suggested that two ramps could be provided for £160,000.  Such is the commitment of the people of Kilcullen to this project that they are prepared to buy the land and dedicate it to the county council, although, in my view, nobody should be asked to do that, least of all a local community.</P>
    <P>The area of Kilcullen, Twomilehouse and Athgarvan serviced by this junction has already been designated an area of development within the county and I do not know of any other town which is not <Col N="418" /> serviced at either end by access roads off a motorway.  In my view it is simply a matter of equity that Kilcullen receive the same facility &mdash; nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <P>There are 58 traders in Kilcullen employing 250 people.  There are excellent pubs, restaurants and business premises in the town.  It is the centre of the bloodstock industry and it has the potential to become an important tourist centre.  If these businesses are not easily accessible they will die and already some of them are for sale.  Only this week Irish Rubber, the biggest employer in the town, went into liquidation with the loss of 75 jobs.</P>
    <P>Kilcullen has a very active and effective development association, Kilcullen Community Development, and the town has the capacity to grow and develop both residentially, commercially and as a tourist centre, but it will not do so if traffic from the north must go through Naas, eight miles away, to get to it, and unless adequate sewerage facilities are provided. A planning application for a housing development for 34 houses has been turned down because of lack of sewerage facilities.  A preliminary report on that rests somewhere in the Department of the Environment and, in the meantime, Kilcullen is being held back and the River Liffey is being polluted.  It is not acceptable that a community should suffer in this way in this age.  Kilcullen is being consigned to becoming a rural open sewer with no future.</P>
    <P>I appeal directly to the Minister to intervene to do what he can to give the people and the traders of Kilcullen their basic entitlements so that the undoubted energy within the community can be directed to developing and promoting the town of Kilcullen and not to campaigning for its rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Dardis for raising this issue.  As he pointed out, the <Col N="419" /> Kilcullen link motorway which will connect Newbridge by-pass to the N9 south of Kilcullen is being constructed in accordance with the motorway scheme prepared by Kildare County Council and confirmed in 1989 by the Minister for the Environment.  That scheme did not provide for a northern access to the town of Kilcullen.  Senator Dardis suggested that I should direct the local authority to prepare a motorway scheme but it would be totally inappropriate for the Minister to direct any local authority to propose a motorway scheme having regard to the Minister's function in determining motorway schemes generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> The position now is that the question of providing a further access to the motorway would only arise in the event of Kildare County Council preparing a motorway scheme in respect of such an access, the presentation of evidence on all aspects of the proposal at the resulting public local inquiry and than a determination by me of the motorway scheme. Having regard to my quasi-judicial functions in relation to motorway schemes, it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to go into any further details.</P>
