      <P>I have notice from Senator Eoin Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The decision of the Minister for Energy to grant a licence for the felling of 323 trees in Tomnafinnoge Wood, Coolattin Estate, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hugh Byrne of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline his proposals on the proposed national coastal park for South Wexford.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The need for the Minister for Health to provide funds for the provision of permanent residential accommodation for the old and infirm of Wexford town and surrounding area.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify, in the light of recent reports, the interpretation by his Department of the requirement that recipients of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit be genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the coal ban to Bray town and its environs.</P>

    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take effective steps to prevent the immediate closure of United Meat Packers.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Eoin Ryan, Byrne, Doyle, Brendan Ryan, Ross and Raftery as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Eoin Ryan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Byrne, Doyle, Brendan Ryan, Ross and Raftery may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take all Stages of Item No. 1, Land Bond Bill, 1991, to 6 p.m. and to have a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. it is proposed to take Item No. 18, the Independent motion No. 44 and from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.  Item No. 12 &mdash; State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1992.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed the Order of Business through the Whips but I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could indicate when the all-day debate on the subject matter of Motion 44, which will be the second half of the Private Members' motion this evening, will be held, given that the Supreme Court judgment has now issued and given also the important developments in relation to the Maastricht Protocol that we hear through the media in recent times.  I would be very keen that we would have a definite commitment to debate this most important topic and to ensure that this House has on the record the views of all parties and of those who do not subscribe to a political view and, indeed, the views of members who would differ on this matter on both sides of this issue.  Before we proceed with the Order of Business today we must clearly indicate when that debate will take place because as far as I am concerned it is relatively urgent.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Leader to indicate when we will have the promised debate on Greencore.  That is a very important and topical issue and one of the main concerns of the Seanad is in responding to matters that affect the people.  Therefore, I think that needs urgent debate also.</P>
      <P>In this spirit of goodwill and indeed <i>entente cordiale,</i> I wish the former Taoiseach the best of luck this afternoon in Cheltenham and I hope Flashing Steel and all the other Irish contenders bring home the honours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, perhaps I should ask if the former Taoiseach's horse is going to win and, if it is, I certainly hope the Leader will let us know in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that Cheltenham is not on the Order of Business for today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We all regret that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if we are going to have statements on the matters contained <Col N="1236" /> in the judgment of the Supreme Court which was given last week.  I am very anxious that this House should have the opportunity to have this debate and indeed that we should try to lead opinion on this matter.</P>
      <P>May I also ask what is the present situation in relation to the proposed debate on banking.  I think this debate has been given a new degree of urgency arising from the problems which are at present being manifest in the banking world.</P>
      <P>Os rud é go bhfuil an tseachtain seo ainmnithe mar Seachtain na Gaeilge, is mian liom a iarraidh ar an Chathaoirleach an mbeidh díospóireacht faoi leith againn as Gaeilge faoi mar a bhí againn anuraidh, nó an bhfuil aon smaoineamh aige chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sa Teach seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Leader of the House.  The first is: can he indicate to us a definite date on which Item No. 6 will be taken, that is, the Culliton report on industrial policy.  We have raised this matter on a number of occasions here and we have been promised a debate on it.  It is important that the Leader would indicate to us today when that debate can take place.</P>
      <P>The second matter I want to refer to has already been referred to by Senator Upton.  It is to request the Leader to set a firm date for a discussion on the banks and financial institutions.  I am attaching particular importance to this today because currently there are two matters related to this scheme which are causing major concern.  The limited industrial action taken by certain bank staffs is being dealt with by an attitude that would be more appropriate to the Victorian era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will understand we do not want speeches on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not develop that point further, a Chathaoirligh.  The second matter, which is one of acute concern, relates to United Meat Packers. The employment of several hundred <Col N="1237" /> employees is at risk.  There is a serious level of financial uncertainty as far as suppliers of animals to these industries are concerned.  Both problems are caused by the attitude adopted by the financial institutions.</P>
      <P>I want to say it reflects poorly on the relevance of this House if we are unable to deal with matters of such serious concern as and when they arise.  Therefore, I am asking the Leader to treat these issues as very serious and to provide the earliest possible opportunity for a debate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise two queries, one touching on a point raised by Senator Howard.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House if he can arrange at the earliest possible date a debate on agriculture having regard to the fact that in the midlands where a significant part of the agricultural husbandry is the finishing of cattle for the factories, there is no place to sell fat cattle at present.  It is causing extreme concern. Over the years the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food were always held responsible.  I should like to know where the Government and where the new Minister for Agriculture and Food stand.  What message has he for farmers who have from ten to 70 or even 100 heavy fat cattle ready for slaughter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want speeches on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most serious situation and I ask for the earliest possible opportunity to put the case for these people on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to Item No. 7 on the Order Paper.  In the very first European Bill here we were given an undertaking that we would have an opportunity of reviewing the operations of the European Community every six months.  I see from Item No. 7 here that the 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th and the 36th half-yearly reports have not yet been discussed. Over the past year, when there was such movement in European policy and European union, we have not had <Col N="1238" /> adequate opportunity to reflect on, to study and to speak on the developments in the Community.  That is a disgrace.  We must get our priorities right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making a speech.  Will he put his question to the Leader, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I am only asking when we can have an early debate, not only on the European situation but also on the cattle trade in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House, and indeed the entire House, to support the case being put to the banks to save United Meat Packers on the grounds that an advertisement was put in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> on 22 February encouraging farmers to put their cattle into that factory and now those farmers cannot be paid.  That is a very serious situation and is much wider than the jobs that are at stake.  Many small farmers will go to the wall if the banks do not come up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making a speech.  If he puts his query to the Leader I am sure he will respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I much appreciate your latitude and your assistance, a Chathaoirligh. I am sure you understand fully the gravity of the matter and I ask for your help and co-operation.  I hope we will be totally united in putting forward a case on behalf of the company in regard to the application to the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on the whole question of equal opportunity for women in the workplace. The reason I am asking is that arising from the conference last week there was the disturbing survey which showed that 40 per cent of the women surveyed did not feel they had access to equal opportunities in their workplace, that six out of ten of them reported they did not know of any policy on sexual harassment in the <Col N="1239" /> workplace, and that three out of four women were not aware of any health and safety provisions for pregnant workers. In the light of the Maastricht Summit and the fact that there is only a very small proportion of women in the workforce, it is essential&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making a speech.  Could she please direct her query to the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the whole question of women in the workplace and of equal opportunity should be debated in this House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask two questions.  First, has the Leader any further information about the date on which the Taoiseach will make his very welcome appearance in this House?  The Leader gave an undertaking that this would happen and he said he would give further information about the date.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I ask the Leader if he will request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to convey the concern of the Irish people about the fate of Raoul Wallenberg arising from two simple facts.  First, there is the adoption of a further report by the European Parliament which indicates specific dates in 1980 and 1986 when Wallenberg received treatment from named Soviet personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We got it debated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ruling that it is not appropriate to the Order of Business; will the Senator ask a further question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the two Adjournment debates on this and the general framework of the question regarding a foreign affairs committee where these matters could perhaps more appropriately be discussed, could this concern be made clear to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1240" />
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I welcome the fact that banking status is being extended to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In saying that I am very conscious of the fact that it is a desirable move, given that there will be no more competition on the ground <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Associated Banks. On that subject, I again exhort the Leader of the House as soon as possible to allow us the opportunity to debate the operation of the banking system in this country.</P>
      <P>May I also use the opportunity to ask the Leader of the House if it is his intention to allow a debate on professional fees?  We have seen over recent months that we are now quickly arriving at a situation where it will not be possible for us, as a country and as a Government, to afford investigations into matters of public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate in that we are bringing in reforms of the Seanad and it should be possible under these reforms to be allowed to make statements in this House.  The public regard it as an obscenity that the cost of the Greencore investigation to date has been over £1 million.  That matter needs to be redressed. I say to the Leader of the House that, given the fact that everybody else, whether it be teachers or whoever are subject to a review of pay and conditions, the time has now come in this House to call for a review body to be set up to investigate and to set fees appropriate to the functions pertaining to these professionals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask when legislation is proposed to be introduced to extend the jurisdiction of the Castletownbere Harbour Commissioner?  I make the point because at this stage there are about 20 &ldquo;Klondikers&rdquo; or large factory ships from Eastern Europe in the harbour and there is a large loss of revenue to the area.  I understand that legislation is to be agreed; it is not contentious.  I ask the Leader of the <Col N="1241" /> House when will it be introduced, either in the Dáil, or preferably in this House? Such legislation should be introduced quickly in view of the loss of revenue to the Castletownbere Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the call for a debate on the banks, and more specifically the banks in relation to United Meat Packers.  There are 900 full-time jobs at stake, 600 part-time jobs, and only £4 million, I gather involved from the banks to save this company. In addition, if it closes there will be no competition for beef and less for lamb.  There are over 100,000 farmers involved in that situation and I cannot understand why we could not have a debate today on the Adjournment on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my ruling on that.  I would deal with it on another day, as I indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me preface what I am going to say by telling you that I was in America about two weeks ago and I met a third generation Irishman whose name was Fallon, from south Roscommon within ten miles of Athlone. When he asked me if I knew any Senators from that part of Ireland he was thrilled when I told him the Speaker of the Seanad was from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be thrilled also if the Senator would ask the Leader of the House a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could get on with matters more pertinent to the House, I would like to take up the point made by Senator Raftery.  United Meat Packers are in Mayo.  There is a massive impact on jobs in the west and in Wexford, about 900 jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say I have ruled other speakers out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, but this is a critical issue.  If the Government put a fraction of the effort they put into <Col N="1242" /> the Goodman empire into this one, this industry could be saved.  There is a massive input needed there and it is a matter the Leader of the House should take up with the relevant Ministers.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I called for a debate in this House sometime ago in relation to aspects of mining.  Again, I ask the Leader of the House to consider a debate in this area.  Specifically, I am talking about mining proposals in west Mayo. I am in favour of mining as a general principle, but there is massive conflict between a national policy and allowing mining interests to go into high amenity areas.  There is very strong opposition in high amenity areas like Croach Patrick. It could be the subject of a national debate and I ask the Leader of the House to so arrange a debate.</P>
      <P>Finally, the sooner we can have the debate on the industrial policy review, the Culliton report, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Cheannaire cén uair a bheadh sé i gceist aige go mbeadh díospóireacht faoi chúrsaí an iarthair.  I would like to ask the Leader when there will be a debate on regional disparities, particularly the problems facing the west and the way in which western regions are effectively discriminated against in development policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask two short questions.  First, may I ask the Leader if it is possible in the near future to have a debate in the House on the Leader programme.  It is an aspect of rural development that is new.  This House could help play a major part in possible developments which might take place within the programme, as announced recently by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, when will it be possible for the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice to come together and deal with the state of anarchy throughout the country where caravans are parked in every nook and cranny of every road. We are building roads and spending millions on road development, but you <Col N="1243" /> cannot shift a caravan.  I am not talking about poor itinerants; I am talking about traders who are taking over the highways and byways of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that matter might be relevant to a Bill which we will have soon, the Roads Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope it does come up.  Last week was National Tree Week.  If one looks at the roads throughout the country one finds many of these trees are being used as clothes lines by itinerant traders, not poor itinerants. They are using as clothes lines the new oak trees, the broad-leaved trees that have been planted all over the country. It is about time the anarchy associated with these people was addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader to have the debates on agriculture and on the banks as previous speakers have requested.  I will not elaborate and make a speech, but I wonder if we could have a debate on broadcasting policy, especially in regard to television.  I am referring to that disgraceful &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme last night where a man was tried by television.  It was very unfair to his family.  I would like to know how much that programme cost the people of Ireland.  It was a disgrace and it warrants a debate.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Senator Kiely in condemning out of hand the absolutely appalling and deplorable programme that appeared on our television last night. It was nothing short of an absolute disgrace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>When something like that appears on our television screen we in this House have a responsibility to express our abhorrence that the national television station should sink to such depths by providing that type of coverage. It is absolutely appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On the debate on the Supreme Court decision, I would ask the Opposition leaders to agree to a debate in two weeks time.  At that stage we will have the wording of the amendment to the Protocol.  The Taoiseach suggested this morning on the Order of Business in the Dáil that he would have that amendment in writing.  In the interest of a full debate on every aspect of the Supreme Court decision, I think we would wait for that wording.

      <P>I am stating here that in two weeks' time we will have a debate on all aspects but in particular the wording of the amendment to the Maastricht Protocol on which, I am sure, many Senators would like to have a say.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Greencore debate, I suggest that we have such a debate on Thursday of next week, subject to agreement between the Whips.  That would include some of the issues raised here today by Senators, in particular the matter of professional fees.  Such a debate would give an opportunity to those who wish to express their opinion.</P>
      <P>On Item No. 6, the Industrial Policy Review Group report, the Culliton report, I suggest that, with the agreement of the Whips, we have such a debate in two weeks time.  I suggest also a full day's debate for that item.  It is a most important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the banks dispute, because of the industrial action pending, perhaps now is not the time for us to have such a debate.  However, I am extremely keen to have such a debate.  The role of the banks was raised with the Minister by many Members this morning.  The new <Col N="1245" /> Bill announced today will give us an opportunity perhaps of making some comments on that matter.</P>
    <P>The question of United Meat Packers was raised here today.  Senator Staunton put forward a view that has been expressed by Members of the Opposition in the Dáil.  I want to say that there is total Government commitment to make sure that United Meat Packers are kept open.  Over 900 jobs and 600 part time jobs are involved; indeed, the whole western economy would be affected if anything happened to that company. From the latter part of last week the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food&mdash; the whole weight of Government&mdash;have endeavoured to ensure that the banks come up with the right decision.  It may well be that the decision will not be just based on the £4 million needed for a short term solution to the problem.  It may well be that these discussions will lead to a solution in the long term interests of the company.  I am sure everybody in this House would wish for a successful outcome to these discussions.  Hopefully, we will have news on that before the day is out.</P>
    <P>It might be possible to have a debate on agriculture in a couple of weeks time. The new Minister for Agriculture and Food has made it quite clear that he would be delighted to come to this House to give his views on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman asked if it would be possible to have a debate on legislation concerning the equality of opportunity and status of women.  I met today with the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen. He is quoted today, and he confirmed to me, and that he will be bringing new ideas on that issue to Government.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will discuss in this House Government proposals on the matter mentioned by Senator Jackman.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator O'Donovan I am pleased to say the Minister confirmed to me today that within a month he will introduce legislation to extend the jurisdiction of Castletownbere Harbour <Col N="1246" /> Commissioner and we look forward to that perhaps being initiated in this House.  Senators Lanigan and O'Cúiv mentioned the Leader programme.  I am sure we can arrange for that debate in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Last night I watched the programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; with disdain and dismay.  For the past couple of months Senator Manning has been asking for a debate on public broadcasting and, having seen last night's programme, I think we should bring that debate forward as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In essence the Bill now before the House provides for nothing more than the tidying-up of matters in the wake of the redemption of land bonds in April, 1989. It is technical legislation which is necessary as a consequence of the Government decision at that time to redeem all outstanding land bonds for cash.  Land bonds were State-guaranteed stocks&mdash;guaranteed as to payment of interest and redemption at par&mdash;which were used by the Land Commission to purchase land in order to carry out the land settlement policy of successive Government over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was empowered to create those bonds and, over the years, some 25 series of those bonds were issued.  Each series of bonds carried a fixed rate of interest payable to the holders twice a year by the Central Bank, until redemption.  The rate of interest chosen related effectively to commercial <Col N="1247" /> rates of interest at the time each land bond series was being created.  Redemption of the bonds did not take place on a given date, as is the usual practice in the case of Government stocks, but depended on the results of an annual random draw.  If a particular bond number came up that bond was redeemed. In this fashion, bonds with a nominal value of some £40 million were redeemed in the years leading up to 1989.</P>
    <P>The process of land purchase by the Land Commission would involve, normally, the payment to the seller of the land of the purchase price in land bonds. On redistribution of such land to other persons, the usual arrangement was for payment to be made to the Land Commission by way of annuities.  Those annuities were paid into a fund called the land bond fund and, from 1933 onwards, when legislation providing for halving of annuities was introduced, an equivalent amount was also paid into the fund by the Exchequer on an annual basis.  These moneys, together with any other income that might accrue to the fund, were used to service the land bonds, that is, to pay the annual dividends thereon as well as to provide a sinking fund or resource to meet the cost of redeeming those land bonds whose numbers came up in the annual draw.</P>
    <P>Following on the decision by the Government, referred to earlier, to redeem all outstanding land bonds the <i>raison d'être</i> of the land bond fund as well as another related fund, the guarantee fund, disappeared.  However, although existing legislation provided for the redemption of land bonds, it did not provide for the circumstances where the funds central to the administrative arrangements for land bonds thus became redundant.  Hence the need for this Bill, whose main purpose is the abolition of the land bond fund and the guarantee fund.  The sections of the Bill which deal with these aspects and the arrangements to be made in respect of moneys, in, or due to, the funds, are sections 4, 5 and 6.</P>
    <P>As well as the provisions relating to <Col N="1248" /> the land bond fund and the guarantee fund already referred to, section 3 of this Bill makes a provision in respect of a third related fund called the costs fund. This fund was created to reimburse vendors of land for certain expenses incurred in selling their land to the Land Commission. Existing legislation provides that such costs are payable in land bonds only so it is necessary to amend the legislation to provide for payment of costs in cash &mdash; now that all land bonds themselves have been redeemed for cash.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill makes provision for arrangements in relation to what are known as &ldquo;unregistered&rdquo; land bonds. When all land bonds were redeemed in 1989, some £1.8 million were classified as &ldquo;unregistered&rdquo;.  That meant that they had set aside for eventual registration in the names of persons from whom the Land Commission had acquired lands pending clearance of title to the lands in question.  The moneys in respect of those bonds&mdash;the bonds were replaced by cash on their redemption in 1989&mdash;are held in trust and will earn deposit interest in a special account in the Central Bank up to the time when matters to title are settled and the moneys due to claimants are paid over.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 7 of the Bill deals with cottage purchase annuities.  These are annual payments due to local authorities and made by persons who have purchased cottages from the authorities. However, legislation provides that these annuities must be collected by the Land Commission in circumstances where the cottage owners are also paying land purchase annuities to the commission.  The Land Commission is legally bound to pay the local authorities the full collectable cottage purchase annuity even under circumstances where annuities are in arrears.  The guarantee fund, in turn, is liable for these amounts to the Land Commission.  Since the guarantee fund is being dissolved, however, new arrangements have to be made in respect of the cottage purchase annuities.</P>
    <P>The most satisfactory solution to the problem is to waive the annuities which total less than £2,500 per annum and are <Col N="1249" /> falling every year.  However, this is only a partial solution since an obligation remains on the Land Commission to continue to pay the annual amounts due to the local authorities.  Therefore, to resolve the matter fully, arrangements will be made for the Exchequer to pay over the redemption values of the cottage purchase annuities to the local authorities, thus releasing the Land Commission from its obligations.  This will cost about £25,000.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil debate on this Bill on 10 December last, there were many interesting contributions from Deputies on a wide range of land-related matters.  However, it has to be said that this Bill is not concerned with the issue of the abolition of the Land Commission or matters of land policy, land usage and a land authority&mdash;all subjects which arose in the course of the Dáil debate on this Bill.  Even if it were the intention that the Land Commission should continue to operate, this Land Bond Bill would still be necessary in order to resolve certain technical issues outstanding in the wake of the redemption of land bonds in 1989. Therefore, the issue of the Land Commission and related land matters are not germane to this Bill.  Rather, Deputies and Senators have ample scope, now that debate on the Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill has been resumed, to give full vent to such matters in their proper context.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the waiving of cottage purchase annuities provided for in section 7 of the Bill should not be associated with the separate issue of land purchase annuities, in particular, the arrears issue. A departmental working group has been established to look at this very serious issue which involves debts owing to the State in excess of £5 million.  The amounts involved in cottage purchase annuities, on the other hand, are very small&mdash; nearly all are under £20 per annum&mdash; and one must, therefore, compare like with like if one raises the question of land purchase annuities in this regard.  Many of these latter annuities, similar in amount to cottage purchase annuities, have been already writen off: 77,000 in <Col N="1250" /> the early eighties and some 70,000 since 1989, leaving about 46,000 accounts outstanding. Tackling the problem of land purchase annuity arrears will be a job initially for the working group I have referred to and is not a matter relevant to the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In summary, it only remains for me to emphasise the stand-alone nature of this Bill which, as I have already said, is essentially technical, non-controversial legislation which becomes necessary as a consequence of the redemption of outstanding land bonds in 1989.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to this House to talk to us about this issue.  As he said it is a technical Bill but nevertheless it is a rather important one.  Land bonds have been a sore point with farmers for a long time, particularly farmers who had their land acquired compulsorily by the Land Commission and were paid in what I would regard as a very unfair way in the form of land bonds.</P>
      <P>I am not sorry to see the end of land bonds.  Not only were farmers who sold their land to the Land Commission dissatisfied but we find that farmers who got land through the Land Commission are quite dissatisfied.  Many of them are in arrears with annuities and it is causing serious hardship.  It is estimated that about 2,000 farmers have extremely high repayments which they are not able to meet.  A smaller number have a less serious problem but overall about 14,000 farmers have difficulty one way or another in meeting these annuities.</P>
      <P>The problem arises mainly with those farmers who acquired land in the late seventies or early eighties when land prices were very high and interest rates were in excess of 18 per cent.  Annuities on the land acquired are now running at about £180 per acre.  Given the present farming difficulties they are unable to meet these repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem has to be faced because farmers are not able to pay and they are not able to sell the land because land <Col N="1251" /> prices have collapsed.  There is the additional problem that many of these farmers acquired land before significant changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  For instance, the introduction of milk quotas caused a very severe problem for many of them who depend on milk for the main part of their income.  The outlook for farmers, due to the proposed reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, are very gloomy indeed.</P>
    <P>The IFA estimate there is about £5.4 million in arrears due to the Land Commission as a result of the income crisis on many small and medium-sized farms.  In view of the extreme hardship on many of these farmers, the Government should take a serious look at trying to solve the problem.  It will not be in anybody's interest, neither the Government's nor the taxpayers, if these people are just driven out of business.  It will create further rural depopulation.  The Minister should try to solve the problem for these unfortunate people.  They were advised at the time to develop, to invest in their land and produce more.  Through no fault of their own, policies have changed significantly in the meantime.  Land prices have collapsed.  They acquired the land at a time when interest rates were exceedingly high.  I urge the Minister to take positive steps to ensure the survival of up to 6,000 farmers who will certainly go out of business unless something is done to ease their problem.</P>
    <P>I have long felt we should have a land use policy&mdash;the Minister says this is not germane to the Land Commission or land policy but it is related to it in its own way.  We lack such a policy and, as a consequence, we are now suffering in all sorts of ways.  If we had a proper land use policy and a proper policy for agriculture, we would have been at a much higher level of development than we were when sugar, milk and cereal quotas were introduced. As a consequence we have suffered greatly, not only in rural Ireland but in the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, when it is disbanded should be replaced by some form of land authority that would bring order <Col N="1252" /> into how land is used and avoid a free-for-all, with land going to those who are not farmers or to foreigners who would introduce different methods of operation into this country.  I am not against some coming in but a wave of them would not be in our best interests.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the high price of land and falling income from land it is quite impossible&mdash;and has been for quite some time even when prices were good &mdash;for young people to purchase land, meet repayments and make a living from that land.  For that reason, we should have, as is the case in many countries, a system of long term land leasing.  We must have the highest level of land ownership in the Community.  In one sense that is desirable but in the sense that people cannot afford it, is not desirable and it is keeping young people out of farming.  As of consequence, we have the highest average age in our farming population of any country in the Community, and possibly in the world.</P>
    <P>If we look at our competitors and take an example outside the Community, in New Zealand they have what they call a share milking arrangement or a land leasing arrangement, where the owner of the land normally ceases to be an active dairy farmer at about the age of 50, at which point he retains ownership of the land but he can share the income with some young person who does the more physical work&mdash;perhaps the young person might own the cows&mdash;and in that way, in time, the young person would buy the land as well.  It is working extremely well and it is of interest to note that they got the idea from Irish people. Farmers from west Cork who went to New Zealand introduced procedures they had practised in west Cork.  The farmer moved his cows from one farm to another and leased land year after year and that system has been brought to a fine art in New Zealand.  The efficiency of New Zealand dairy farming today is very closely related to that system which kept young, active, vigorous young people coming into dairy farming at an early age, sharing in the profits and in the ownership and ultimately having total <Col N="1253" /> ownership of the dairying enterprise on the farm.  It is regrettable we did not go down that route.  We are paying a very high price for not doing so.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see section 7 in relation to the waiving of cottage purchase annuities. I know it was a pragmatic decision from the Department of Finance's point of view as it cost more to collect these annuities than they were worth.  The cottage owner endured hardship in getting together the few pounds to pay the land annuity.  It is a welcome step to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will also take into account the plight of those people who are trying to pay annuities when farm incomes are declining.  Through no fault of their own, they paid prices that were excessive for land at a time when interest rates were extremely high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill one is tempted to engage in a discourse on the Land Commission itself but because the Bill dealing with the dissolution of the Land Commission is before the Dáil there will be ample time to discuss the operation of the Land Commission. Suffice to say that people with small holdings were moved and were given a reasonable chance to eke out a good existence in places like Meath, Kildare and Cork.  Houses were built on these lands.  There were other benefits in that the land they were moved from was made available in what one would call reasonable holdings to those who were left behind.  The congestion in many parts of this country was relieved and, to that extent, I congratulate the Land Commission on a job well done over the years. The Bill is a technical one.  It aims to tidy up the area of land bonds following their redemption in 1989.  Now that the land bond fund and the guarantee fund must be wound up excess moneys there should accrue directly to the State.  We all welcome that.  It is important to state that even if that did not happen, if the Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill did not exist, this Bill would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When land was sold to the Land Commission the sellers normally received <Col N="1254" /> bonds in payment.  When these lands were subsequently allocated to new owners, payment to the Land Commission was usually made by means of annuities.  These annuities were paid into the land bond fund and the Exchequer made a matching contribution to this fund on an annual basis.  The total resources thus provided to the funds were used to pay dividends on the bonds and to provide a sinking fund to finance the annual land bond redemptions.  As a result of the redemption of land bonds in 1989, £80 million will accrue to the Exchequer.  This Bill provides the mechanism to do so and any reasonable person looking at the overall scenario will say that given the financial constraints under which any Minister for Finance operates, he would only be too happy to make use of such funds to generate economic activity within the country rather than having them lie dormant.  From that point of view this Bill is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I understand that a further £5 million is due to the Exchequer on an annual basis.  This is another figure that cannot be sneezed at and is something the Department of Finance would be very anxious to acquire annually.  A great deal of economic activity could be generated with such a sum of money.  A further £5 million are due in arrears.  Farmers purchased land in the seventies and borrowed at very high rates of interest &mdash; at one stage they were as high as 18 per cent.  The Opposition would know all about that.  When the Land Commission handed on this land they passed it on at the rate at which they purchased it and the rate of interest they had to pay to service the land.  The result is that many farmers today have difficulties as a result of acquiring land from the Land Commission at that time.</P>
    <P>There have been calls from the Opposition to write off money.  It has been suggested that the interest rate should be alleviated.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set up a review group to look at the servicing and collection of arrears.  While the Land Commission had no right to reduce the level of interest charged, I suggest that the Minister and <Col N="1255" /> the review group keep this in mind and they might see an opportunity to reduce the level of very high interest charged on some of these annuities.</P>
    <P>Many farmers find it exceedingly difficult to meet these annuities.  In fairness to many of them, they would be quite willing and are anxious to pay and if the interest rate were reduced by the review group they might be in a position to meet their bad debts.  By and large, people do not like to have debts like that hanging over them.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that because the cottage purchase annuity was written off the £5 million arrears should also be written off.  I do not think that is comparing like with like.  The cottage purchase annuity, amounted to only £2,500 per annum and there were only a few hundred accounts. It is not that easy to write it off given the times we are living in and the constraints under which we operate.  It behoves the Minister for Finance to bring in as much of that £5 million arrears as he can.</P>
    <P>We must remember the cost at which the land bonds and guarantee bonds were redeemed.  The land bonds were redeemed in 1989.  My understanding is that in 1989 it cost £76 million to redeem them.  That money had to be borrowed and the Government are still paying interest on that money.  It is reasonable to suggest that the £5 million that is expected in annuities every year to the Revenue Commissioners is spent in part payment of the interest on that £76 million. That is another area we have to look at.  If we do not collect that money, it means further borrowing by the Exchequer.  We had experience of borrowing in the past; thank God that era has now passed.  I agree with the Minister that it is incumbent on us to collect that money every year.</P>
    <P>The farmers are suffering hardship. With regard to the £5 million arrears to be collected, the review group can make recommendations to reduce the interest which will make it possible for farmers to pay their debts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy Gallagher, is present.  He comes from the north-west which is more or less on the same side of the island I come from.  He will be familiar with the problems that have arisen for some people who received land from the Land Commission, particularly during the seventies.</P>
      <P>A speech was delivered to us by the Minister for Finance.  We said, and Senator O'Keeffe accepted without question, that this was simply a Bill to tidy up matters in the wake of the redemption of the land bonds in 1989.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In the course of the Dáil debate on this Bill on 10 December last, there were many interesting contributions from Deputies on a wide range of land-related matters.  However, it has to be said that the Bill is not concerned with the issue of the abolition of the Land Commission or matters of land policy, land usage or land authority...</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill is not concerned with those matters but having read in the last day or two the entire Dáil debate on this Bill on 10 December, there were other relevant matters referred to during that debate. At the very least, I am disappointed the Minister avoided referring to the very important matters that were raised.  Perhaps the most important matter raised during that discussion on 10 December last and which was ignored by the Minister today, was the incapacity of many land owners to meet repayments on land allocated to them by the Land Commission. It is estimated that something like 2,000 farmers have a chronic problem with extremely high payments and high levels of arrears.  On top of this figure, a further 4,000 farmers have high annual payments and although no arrears may have yet arisen these people, with the recent drop in farm incomes, may soon find it difficult to continue to meet their repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IFA estimate that 14,000 farmers are encountering or will shortly encounter repayment difficulties, already 2,000 experience severe difficulty, 4,000, some <Col N="1257" /> difficulty and the remaining 8,000 on present indications will find themselves in difficulties before long.  Of the first two categories of 2,000 and 4,000, a number are forced at present to rely on social welfare payments.  Ironically, some who applied for social welfare payments were deemed ineligible; the land annuity was disallowed as a legitimate expense because they were not in a position to pay it.  I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to the plight of these disadvantaged farmers.</P>
    <P>The problem of high annuity repayments arose in relation to land that was distributed during the good years of the seventies and the early 1980s.  Confidence in agriculture was high at that time.  Many enthusiastic and enterprising farmers who received land from the Land Commission during this period were confident that this new addition to their holding would enable them to obtain a satisfactory livelihood. Deputy Gallagher will know precisely to what I am referring.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that buoyant situation no longer prevails and confidence in agriculture is now so low that I wonder if it will ever be possible to restore the confidence necessary to develop the types of farm I have referred to.  The next few years will be crucial; unless confidence and hope can be restored the fabric of rural Ireland will be threatened and destroyed possibly beyond the point of redemption.</P>
    <P>The land distribution which caused the greatest problems was the distribution of the seventies and early eighties, for a combination of reasons.  High interest rates of up to 18.5 per cent and high land prices pushed repayments as high as £180 per acre.  The IFA recently published a table based on a survey of seven separate farms which indicates the magnitude of the problem.  This table is relevant to my point.</P>
    <P>Case number one on this table is a 48 acre dry stock farm with an annuity of £1,960, estimated farm income of £3,000 and the annuity payable to the Land Commission amounts to 65.3 per cent of income.  Case number two is a 62 acre dry stock holding with an annual repayment <Col N="1258" /> of £1,980; estimated farm income is £4,500 and the percentage of income payable as annuity is 44 per cent.  The third case is an 96 acre dry stock farm &mdash; we are moving now into the 100 acre farm bracket which is now the minimum size viable for economic farming &mdash; with an annuity repayment of £2,340, farm income is £4,000 and annuity repayment as percentage of farm income amounts to 58.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Case number four is a 57 acre dairy farm.  It is recognised within the farming industry that dairying gives the best possible return.  Yet on this 57 acre farm the annual repayments are £3,000, farm income is £6,500, and the annuity as a percentage of farm income is 46 per cent. Case number six is a dairy farm of 75 acres.  With a reasonable amount of land one would expect this farm to survive with reasonable management.  Repayments are £2,160 per annum, estimated farm income is £4,000; annuity as a percentage of farm income is 54 per cent. The final case is a 61 acre dry stock farm with an annuity of £2,650, estimated farm income is £4,000 and the annuity as a percentage of farm income is just 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>These statistics illustrate the serious situation prevailing in relation to matters included in this Bill.  Why did the Minister choose not to refer to this important aspect of the matter when it was drawn to his attention during the Dáil debate on the Land Bond Bill on 10 December last?  Many of the farmers I am referring to acquired their land before the introduction of milk quotas which had a profoundly limiting effect on the capacity of many of them to meet their repayments. Proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and reduced prices which may arise from the new Common Agricultural Policy could render it impossible for many of these people to continue their repayments.</P>
    <P>It has come to light that the Department of Agriculture and Food are refusing to pay headage and other grants to farmers unable to repay their land annuities. I deplore this miserable attitude and I think Senator O'Keeffe referred to this <Col N="1259" /> matter.  Of all sections of the community, small and medium-sized farmers as the Minister and An Leas-Chathaoirleach will testify have always taken pride in their capacity to pay their way.  Finding themselves obliged to rely on social welfare payments and being refused badly needed grant and headage payments from the Department of Agriculture and Food because of their annuity arrears will undermine whatever remaining confidence they have in themselves and in their capacity to obtain a livelihood from farming.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there is now something like £5.4 billion owing in arrears to the Land Commission due entirely to the income crisis of many small and medium-sized farmers; they constitute all the problem cases.  These arrears can be expected to rise significantly in the year ahead.  Many farmers are experiencing extreme hardship and we are facing a problem that is not merely financial but a major social issue for rural Ireland.  The fact that these farmers received the land necessary to make them socially viable from the State places an onus on the Government to alleviate the problems they now face.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways to deal with this situation.  I am aware that a recommendation was made during the debate in the other House that a scheme similar to that which allowed the sale of local authority houses to their owners sometime ago could or should be considered for farmers in serious repayment difficulties; it would not have to apply in all cases.  This proposal is within the capacity of the Minister concerned and may be a suitable response to the problem.</P>
    <P>A buy-out arrangement at a much reduced price should also be considered. Many of the farmers concerned have been adversely affected by EC membership and national policies have diminished their incomes since they acquired the land.  Circumstances have changed dramatically since the seventies and we should move to meet present difficulties. A category of farmers should be acknowledged <Col N="1260" /> as hardship cases, qualifying for relief measures of some kind.  A solution to their problem is crucial to the very survival of the first two categories I referred to, the 2,000 farmers in serious difficulty and the 4,000 in moderate difficulty. If more farmers get into difficulty making re-payments due to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the social and economic costs are all too obvious.  Incomes have declined so much on Irish farms and particularly on the farms I referred to that finding a solution to this problem should be a major priority for the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe in his concluding remarks mentioned the obligation and duty of the Minister to collect these annuities for the Exchequer.  What price does one put on the survival of the small farmers concerned?  That is the real cost we should be estimating.  The fabric of rural Ireland is breaking down and the next few years will determine whether there is to be a vibrant rural society in many parts of this country.  The confidence of many small and medium sized farmers has been seriously undermined. I do not say this for political reasons but to state facts which I and people on the other side of the House are aware of. Over the next few years we must restore whatever confidence we can to the rural community.  If we could get over this immediate hump things may not be as bleak on the other side of the hill.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the green image of this country, but we have failed so far to exploit that image.  Perhaps, in the next five or ten years that image could be exploited to the economic benefit of rural Ireland especially but if the fabric of that rural society has disappeared by then, we may look back in despair at our failure now to respond to the present situation.</P>
    <P>As many as 6,000 people face a crisis if this proposed measure is enacted.  The Seanad would be failing in its duty if it did not highlight that difficulty and if it did not impress upon the Minister the need to take appropriate action where these cases are concerned.  In view of the seriousness of the situation I regard it as <Col N="1261" /> somewhat flippant of the Minister to refer to the Bill simply as a tidying up measure particularly since many of the issues I raised were brought to his attention in the other House.  This Minister knows of the problems I am talking about and I look forward with confidence to his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance here.  As the Minister for Finance said during his opening address we have before us technical, non-controversial legislation.  Most people would say that this legislation is desirable and nobody could be sorry to see the end of land bonds and everything that was associated with them over the years.  The point was made that land bonds should not be confused with the Land Commission; nevertheless the two are related. I am aware that legislation to abolish the Land Commission is going through the Dáil at present.</P>
      <P>No tears will be shed if land bonds pass into history; twice a year I have been in receipt of a large cheque for several pence from the Minister for Finance and I wonder at what cost I was given those few pence?  Even the stamp on the envelope would have cost more than the contents of the cheque.  It would have been wise of the Minister to offer me some small amount of capital for what I was receiving every year by way of land bond payment.  The amount of land acquired in my case must have been very small indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How equitable or constitutional was it in the first place to pay people by this method for land acquired?  I acknowledge the great work done by the Land Commission taking people out of congested districts and relocating them where land was available so that they were able to make a living under new circumstances but I dispute the way in which people were paid for land acquired.  I had a neighbour who in the days before farmer taxation was introduced received a notice to the effect that he was liable for income tax.  He told me he was going to take his land bonds up to the Minister and to the Revenue Commissioners, and demand <Col N="1262" /> that his land bonds be taken in payment for his tax because if the State could pay him in land bonds they could have them back in taxation.  He had a point.  It was inconsistent that he should have to raise cash to pay his tax but could not repay the State in what was, after all, the State's money.</P>
    <P>This method of buying land in some circumstances amounted to highway robbery. All of us would have to admit that unhappy stories have survived political influence or meddling in the way land was acquired and subsequently allocated. I hope these stories will fade into the mists of history.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to arrears in land purchase annuities.  I share the concerns already expressed about the 2,000 people now facing severe problems and the large number of others in some difficulty.  Those difficulties will increase and multiply.  I take the Minister's point that the problem should be tackled by a working group initially and that it is not relevant to the passage of the Bill.  Nevertheless this problem of arrears remains the single most important issue to be addressed here today.</P>
    <P>The collection of land purchase annuities has precipated personal tragedies.  All of us from rural areas will know of genuine cases where people living in considerable poverty are still asked to meet these arrears which reflect the high price of land in the late seventies and early eighties.  It is ironic that innovators, progressive people prepared to take on liabilities, are now paying the highest price in personal terms for decisions they made then, often with encouragement.  It should be the function of the State as it was with the original Land Commission to promote innovation and to give smaller farmers an opportunity of a decent living on holdings of a sufficient size.  I appeal to the Minister to look with sympathy at these arrears cases and to find some equitable way to release people from the economic tyranny they appear to have been subjected to, in some cases.</P>
    <P>The possible consequences of the Common Agricultural Policy reform and the negotiations have been raised and we <Col N="1263" /> must view all these developments with concern.  If there is an arrears problem at present that problem will worsen and the State must address it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Howard that it is intolerable that headage payments and other grants should be withheld from people in arrears with their purchase annuities.  If we reflect on the unhappy history of land ownership in Ireland and the consequences of landlordism, we must acknowledge in this respect that the State is a landlord.  An enlightened landlord would try to reach some arrangement with his or her tenant to extend or adjust a payment to allow for changing economic circumstances.  It would have been easy for someone at the beginning of the eighties when things were buoyant to undertake these payments but farm incomes have diminished considerably since then.  The State as landlord in this respect should adopt a more enlightened attitude to these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Wyndham Land Acts of the last century removed land from the landlords and vested it in the people of Ireland. The financial imposition on recipients of land was flexible and never constituted a serious financial burden on those who acquired land from the estates.  Now that we have our own Legislature it is incumbent on us to adopt a similarly enlightened attitude.</P>
    <P>One could propose certain alternatives as to what might be done.  One possibility is to capitalise the amount outstanding, to extend it over a long period and to reduce the annual payments so that they are not a huge burden.  I take the point that there are people who have paid these amounts in full at quite a considerable cost over the years and it would be inappropriate if people who were irresponsible about the matter should get off scotfree while those who had honoured their commitments pay a penalty.  I am sure that can be overcome.  The central point is that it would be preferable for the State to recover a percentage of what is due to it, rather than to recover nothing <Col N="1264" /> at all, which may happen if people are forced off the land.</P>
    <P>At the moment 11 people a day leave the land.  Given what we see happening in Europe, with the Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT negotiations, we must be fairly pessimistic about the way that figure will go in the future.  I make a direct appeal to the Minister on that point.  Where small farmers took an extra land to expand and took the risk, sometimes at the behest of people who were State agents, they should not be penalised.  Many of them are honourable people and they wish to reach some arrangement.  They wish to pay their debts and they must be afforded that opportunity.  The State, in as much as it is a landlord, must be a good landlord to those people.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill makes provision for arrangements in relation to what are known as the unregistered land bonds. When the bonds were redeemed in 1989 some £1.8 million was classified as unregistered.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill that relate to this matter.  We are just looking at the tip of the iceberg here, because if there were so many bonds unregistered, how much more land is not properly registered and how difficult is it for many people to prove title to the land?  The State can do some good in establishing who are the owners of this £1.8 million.  Frequently the onus is put on the people to prove the title but the State can assist in some of these matters, expedite them and make life easier for people by reducing administration.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the broader issue of a land policy.  I agree with the need for such a policy.  Over the years one of the great deficiencies in our agricultural policies has been the absence of a coherent land policy.  The way we will use our land in the future will change fundamentally, because of the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT.  We also have the matter of environmentally sensitive areas.  I welcome the new scheme which has been announced where farmers in certain areas will be rewarded for farming in a so-called environmentally friendly way.  We will see frequent <Col N="1265" /> developments along those lines, increasing forestry, and the whole question of set-aside.  We are moving into a new era where a new policy will be required.</P>
    <P>I support the view that share farming is an option which could be looked at in some detail.  It is one that has worked very well in other places.  The big question is how young innovative farmers are going to have access to the land.  It is obviously very much in the national interest that young farmers with energy and enthusiasm should have access to land and they should be assisted by whatever means the State can offer in this regard.</P>
    <P>One of the deficiencies in our land tenure system is that we do not have a tenant system.  There are very good historic reasons for that, but one of the great advantages of a tenant system is that if the operators of the land have capital that money is released.  They can devote it to farming rather than tying it up in land and property.  Efforts in this direction to allow young people get into farming would be welcome.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the milk quota, to a certain degree, excludes young people from getting into dairying.  The quota has become a valuable asset associated with the land and is making it extremely difficult for young farmers to become dairy farmers other than by inheritance.  We need some system to allow for some mobility.  That is not directly related to this Bill.  It is something we could discuss at a latter date, perhaps when we debate the abolition of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I would say good riddance to the land bonds.  Their passing will not be regretted. However we are facing profound changes in our agricultural society and we must meet them.  I am happy to support the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáilte roimh an Aire Stait go dtí an Teach.  I agree entirely with the Minister for Finance when he says this Bill will tidy up the existing situation. All of us who were in the auctioneering business when the Land Commission was buying land found the system difficult. While it was very good in some ways, <Col N="1266" /> as Senator Dardis said, it was highway robbery in others.  I was a witness many times in the Four Courts trying to prove that the Land Commission did not give a fair price for land, and I was successful in many cases.  People hated land bonds. They would get money if they sold the land direct but they never regarded the land bonds as money.  It would be absolutely foolish to put money into a bond for which there is no need now and have the Exchequer pay to service the account. I am pleased this system is going to be changed.</P>
      <P>I disagree with those who say there are fewer people in rural Ireland now. Anyone who grew up in the fifties, as I did, knows that there was dereliction in rural Ireland then.  When you look at rural Ireland today you see very good houses particularly in the west.  There are many group water schemes and regional water schemes.  Houses in rural areas have the same facilities as those in the cities. Talk about depopulation and so on it is not always right and it creates a very bad image.  The standard of living and services in rural Ireland is miles ahead of what you will get anywhere.</P>
      <P>The one change I would like to see to bring more people into rural Ireland, is a liberalisation of the planning laws. Recently I heard of a man whose son wanted to build a house on his land.  He was not allowed to build the house on a nice dry hill because it would spoil the scene.  We put through a section 4 motion in Sligo County Council unanimously and what do you think happened?  To use a phrase of the late George Colley, the &ldquo;well-heeled articulate&rdquo; group, An Taisce, and their friends, who are all in good jobs earning good money, objected. The man cannot build a house for his son on his own farm land.  This is what we should be taking about.  That is where injustices lie.</P>

      <P>This has already been referred to by other speakers.  I want to put on record the other side of the coin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because there is no sense in money lying dormant in a &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; fund &mdash; to use the new eighties word.  This fund is now redundant, there is no use for it, there is no point having it.  When the Land Commission Bill comes before this House much of what has been said by other speakers will have to be said again.  This is a very simple Bill to wind up an account that is no longer of any use.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a few simple points on this Bill.  My first introduction to land bonds was to hear my late mother talk about the 5 per cent land bonds that were issued after the then Department, in 1937 or 1938, compulsorily acquired a portion of the family farm.  Payment was made, just as the family were coming out of the effects of the economic war, with 5 per cent land bond stock.  Even the solicitors and the people defending the case would not accept the bonds as payment.  At best, one issue went as high as 16 per cent.  As far as the farming community to whom these bonds were paid, were concerned, they were never acceptable.  I am glad to see the end of them.  They have certainly outlived their usefulness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning the bonds had a very bad name.  They were non-negotiable in the thirties and the forties.  They contributed significantly to the low esteem in which the general public held the Land Commission and every Department involved in that work since the <Col N="1268" /> foundation of the State.  In the early seventies, in particular after 1974-75, when expectations for agriculture soared and agricultural land reached £3,000 per acre, many small farmers were offered portions of land at exorbitant prices. Granted, the Land Commission paid fairly high prices for that land but, in my own constituency many people were able to look ahead and ask how they could repay £150, £160 or £170 per acre in annuities.  Even at that time they realised that was not possible.  When the inspectors offered someone a parcel of land which would make a big difference to the economic viability of a holding, it was a temptation that thousands of small farmers succumbed to.  Now they are unable to meet the annuities.  We are back almost to a Clanrickard situation.</P>
    <P>The State is the landlord.  While they do not literally use a battering ram, they wield an illegal economic battering ram. They are depriving these small farmers of EC headage payments because if the annuities are not paid these small farmers will no longer benefit from the guarantees enjoyed since we joined the European Community.  Ministers must be ashamed of themselves because they are rolling back the clock 100 years.  The sorry mess of land agitation started in the 1880s and 1890s and history is repeating itself.  We get Irish solutions to Irish problems. Now, because small farmers on marginal incomes, with ten, 25 or 30 acres, who would otherwise qualify for the farmers' dole have not been able to repay the annuities, they are disqualified even from those benefits.  Even in Russia that kind of dictatorial system has collapsed.  Yet our Government can seemingly smile and have no compassion or understanding for anyone's future but their own.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not taking this debate because this subject comes within the realm of agriculture.  How can the Minister feel comfortable with the title of &ldquo;Minister feel Agriculture and Food&rdquo; when at least 12,000 farmers across the country are finding extreme difficulty surviving and providing for their families under this present system which has outlived its usefulness, <Col N="1269" /> which must be looked at and for which a solution must be found?  It is common knowledge that between 2,000 and 5,000 people are in severe difficulties and are deprived of what is left of State aid to agriculture.  At the same time there are very few buyers for the finished cattle on offer at marts today.  This spring, one would need to have a four leaf clover to get one's cattle into a factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the effect this Bill is having on the economic lives of the people.  How can the Minister ignore 2,000 farmers who have been refused benefits and 4,000 whose benefits are in the balance?  From figures supplied it is estimated that another 5,000 or 6,000 farmers will be in this situation before long.  The Minister has the power to do something about these lands bonds.  If the Government can take up now where the landlords of the last century left off, surely they can halve the annuities again as was done at least twice in the past century?</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the end of land bonds. They represented hardship, uncertainty and distrust to practically every person who was paid with them.  It was an unfortunate way to compensate farmers for land acquired compulsorily or even by agreement.  The farming community have never been fairly treated.  Bord na Móna compulsorily acquired hundreds of thousands of acres of boglands for as little as a half-a-crown &mdash; 2s. 6d &mdash; an acre and they now want to sell it back to farmers at the market value.  It is a queer country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have been very slow to defend themselves.  They have always allowed themselves to be browbeaten out of a misguided respect for authority and for Departments and Governments of the day.  Now is the time to cry halt.  I make a strong appeal to the Minister to look at the effect annuities are having on the relatively small number of farm families involved &mdash; only 5,000 to 6,000 &mdash; and see if anything can be done for them. <Col N="1270" /> Conacre this year is averaging between £50 and £75 an acre for top class land for tillage purposes.  How can this Government expect the poorest farmers to find £180 an acre if there is not an economic return on land?  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is no sale for certain categories of cattle &mdash; fat cattle &mdash; this spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister although Senator McDonald said he would prefer to see another Minister here.  I know he represents a city constituency but he has a rural background and I am sure he knows as much about land bonds as any Member of this House.</P>
      <P>Land bonds are Government stocks which were used by the Land Commission to acquire land.  A fixed rate of interest was paid annually on the bonds until redemption; there were no fixed redemption dates for land bonds.  Instead redemption was effected by means of an annual draw.  Previous Ministers have spoken about these land bonds and no one will be sorry that they have gone.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said he remembered getting some dividend every month, and that the stamp cost more than the dividend. Senator McDonald said land was acquired from his mother.  I own a bit of modest land in County Limerick, but it was not good enough for the Land Commission to bother with it.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees with this legislation and that the land bond system was unsatisfactory. Questions were raised as to how such land was acquired and distributed. It was suggested that there might have been political interference, and probably there was, but there might have been other influences too, which I would not like to mention.  However, I have grave suspicion about what influenced the acquisition and distribution of such land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the seventies and eighties the Land Commission acquired land at a high cost, and these holdings were eventually allocated to farmers in need of additional land.  Naturally the annuity to be paid had to reflect the price the Land Commission paid.  People who acquired land at the <Col N="1271" /> time find themselves today in an impossible position.  We are all too well aware of declining incomes from agriculture. It is difficult for any farmer to survive, without having to meet the repayments of loans from lending institutions.</P>
    <P>The ability of farmers to meet these high land annuities has been eroded because of a decline in farm incomes in recent years.  Many farmers are so far in arrears it is impossible for them to meet their commitments, given the present economic situation in farming.  Facing such difficulties are small farmers who received land from the Land Commission to extend their holdings and to improve their viability.  If a serious effort is not made to resolve land annuity problems many small farmers will have little option but to dispose of land to meet their commitments, which would have the effect of further eroding their viability and, ultimately, of forcing such families off the land.</P>
    <P>I know farmers who acquired land from the Land Commission and have paid their annuities in full but others, because of difficulties, are not able to pay their land annuities.  There are also farmers who do not make any effort to pay land annuities and they are acting irresponsibly.  I do not think it is fair to the farmers who make the effort that those who are irresponsible in this respect should get away with it.  This Government should be ashamed of themselves for the way they are treating small farmers. Previous Fianna Fáil Governments kept small farmers in business.  I say &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Governments&rdquo; because this is the first time Fianna Fáil have been involved in an arrangement with another party to form a Government.  Those small farmers voted Fianna Fáil into office year after year in the constituencies of Clare, Carlow, Laois-Offaly and in my constituency of West Limerick.</P>

    <P>The Bill is winding up legislation. While I welcome it and compliment the Minister, I would like him and the Government to focus on the problem of outstanding arrears and annuities for small farmers, especially the genuine small farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank all who contributed to the debate.  The part of the debate which I had an opportunity to listen to made sense to me, as I come from a small farm of about 30 acres, half of it on the side of a hill.  However we were not successful in getting land from the Land Commission to make our farm a viable unit.  I have some sympathy for the points made by Senators.</P>
      <P>The issue of farmers in difficulties, who are unable to pay the land purchase annuities, has been raised by a number of Senators and acknowledgment of this problem was made by the Minister, in the Dáil, during the debate on the Bill on 10 December 1991, when he confirmed that a committee in the Department of Agriculture and Food were looking at the issue of arrears of land purchase annuities.  I acknowledge that some farmers are having severe problems in relation to payment of annuities, but both sides of the issue will have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Keeffe mentioned that if the income due to the Exchequer from the annuities as a contribution to the servicing of borrowing which was incurred in order to redeem the land bonds is reduced, then the deficiency has to be made up from general taxation.  That would be generally understood.  This makes the problem much more difficult to resolve and it is something that we have to take account of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Annuities &mdash; the annual payments of <Col N="1273" /> interest and principle &mdash; are paid to the Land Commission for lands they allocated to individuals.  The rate of annuity and the period over which it is payable were determined by reference to the particular series of land bonds used to buy the land in the first instance.  As interest rates on the land bonds varied from zero per cent to 18.25 per cent, reflecting the prevailing level of interest rates generally, so did the corresponding annuity rates.  Thus, there were two sides to the coin of Land Commission transactions, the acquisition of land for which the commission usually paid in land bonds and, subsequently, the sale of that land for which payment was made to the commission by annuities.</P>
    <P>Until now the annuities have been paid into the land bond fund, the vehicle for servicing land bonds.  On the dissolution of the land bond fund, as provided for in section 5 of the Bill, the annuities will be paid to the Exchequer.  The Exchequer will use these annuities towards the servicing costs of the £76 million in general borrowing that was used to redeem all land bonds in 1989.  In calculating the savings that would arise from that redemption, a critical assumption made was that annuities would continue to flow to the Exchequer in future years.</P>
    <P>Farming organisations have raised the issue of land purchase annuities on a number of occasions recently.  Their claim is that annuities are too high and should be reduced.  In addressing this contention the following points are relevant. First, the amount involved on an annual basis is substantial.  Apart from annuity arrears of some £5.4 million at 1 January 1990, the amount due during 1990 was approximately £4.9 million or £10.3 million in total.  In the event, approximately £4.4 million out of this total was collected in 1990.  Second, the redemption by the Exchequer of some £76 million in land bonds in 1989 was financed by means of alternative Exchequer borrowing.  This borrowing has to be serviced and the annuities collectable each year form an important part &mdash; more than half &mdash; of such servicing. Third, farmers may at any time redeem <Col N="1274" /> their annuities, just as one might decide to repay an outstanding loan which has become relatively expensive, and replace it with a cheaper one.  This route has been taken by some farmers in the past. Fourth, it is recognised that a number of farmers have difficulties with arrears of land annuities.  In hardship cases every effort is made to come to a reasonable arrangement with the farmer.  Once lands are vested, that is, finally conveyed to the farmer, there is no legislative authority to reduce or restructure annuities.  Before that stage is reached the Land Commission could, and sometimes did, decide to reduce the price of the land to the allottee, thereby reducing the annuity. However, only some 6 per cent of farmers in arrears with annuities are on rates as high as 18 per cent which is the top rate, the bulk, about 67 per cent, being in the 10 to 15 per cent category.  Current interest on bank borrowings on a term loan is about 15 per cent.  Fifth, because of geographical location many farmers have benefited from a Government subsidy which entailed a reduction of 50 per cent on all or part of their annuity repayments. Sixth, no penalty charges are attached to arrears of annuities, unlike a normal commercial operation, and great difficulty is experienced in collecting annuities from farmers.  However, this is not a reason for their abolition but rather an argument for better and more effective collection.  A significant proportion of arrears &mdash; £1.7 million out of about £5.4 million &mdash; is owed by a relatively small number of individuals, 176 in all, or £10,000 from each.</P>
    <P>The abolition of small land purchase annuities which took place in 1989 was a once-off exercise designed to streamline arrangements for collecting land annuities by eliminating those small annuities the collection of which had become uneconomic. Under this arrangement all annuities under £10 per annum were written off and were, therefore, no longer payable by the farmers concerned.  The number of annuities involved was about 70,000 but they represented only about 5 per cent of the value of all annual collectable annuities.  The reduction in <Col N="1275" /> the value of collectable annuities was offset by staff and administrative savings.</P>
    <P>The two types of annuity had nothing in common except they were both collectable by the Land Commission.  The write-off of the cottage purchase annuities will cost only £25,000 and will result in administrative savings, whereas the write-off of the redemption value of all outstanding land purchase annuities will cost about £80 million.  As has already been indicated, a committee has been formed by the Department of Agriculture and Food to consider the matter of arrears of land purchase annuities. This, however, cannot be interpreted as a signal that concessions are on the way and so lead to a further increase in arrears.  It must be emphasised that the committee at all times will have to take account of the effect on the Exchequer of their proposals.  The write-off of the redemption value of all outstanding land purchase annuities would cost £80 million.</P>
    <P>The matter of proving land title in relation to unregistered bonds was raised during the debate.  When the Land Commission acquired a holding for which the price was payable in land bonds, the bonds were credited to an account in the Land Commission.  Dividends on the bonds were also credited to that account. When, in due course, the Judicial Commissioner or the Examiner of Titles, both officials appointed by the Land Commission, directed payments of bonds and accrued interest to the relevant claimants, the land bonds would then be registered in the claimants' names.  Prior to this registration the land bonds in question were classified as unregistered, that is, bonds allocated to sellers of land by the Land Commission but which were not yet registered in the sellers' names, pending clearance of title to the land. The Attorney General advised, when considering the question of redemption of all land bonds, that it was in order to redeem unregistered land bonds as well as registered ones, at par and replace them with cash, such moneys to be kept <Col N="1276" /> in trust for the claimants until such time as the matter of land title was settled.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, when redemption of all land bonds took place on 3 April 1989, the redemption proceeds of the unregistered bonds &mdash; some £1.8 million in total &mdash; and the accrued interest on those bonds were placed in an interest earning deposit account in the Central Bank. Thus, the unregistered land bonds were replaced by cash, awaiting distribution. Section 2 of the Bill provides for this procedure.  The phrase &ldquo;purchase money advanced by means of land bonds&rdquo; in section 2 (1) (a) refers to unregistered land bonds.  Most of the land purchase money has been awaiting distribution for a considerable time, some since the 1920s and 1930s.</P>
    <P>Locating the descendants, relatives, beneficiaries or the owner-occupiers of land acquired by the Land Commission can present great difficulties.  Documents relating to claims, wills and death certificates can form part of the evidence required to establish entitlement to the purchase money.  Power of distribution of land purchase moneys, formerly in the form of land bonds but now in cash, is vested in the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission who is a High Court Judge.  Much of the investigative work is carried out by an Examiner of Titles who, in addition to investigating titles to properties acquired by the Land Commission, must examine claims and entitlements to the purchase money before directing payment.  The funds awaiting payment belong to the vendors of the land.  They are held in trust by the State until it discharges its duties in distributing them to the persons entitled to same.</P>
    <P>The balance of land purchase money, which at 31 December 1990 had yet to be paid, was almost £4 million, involving approximately 2,000 estate accounts. This figure comprises the redemption proceeds of the unregistered land bonds already referred to, £1.8 million plus the interest which had accrued on this amount at the date of redemption and interest on the amounts earned on deposit in the Central Bank since that <Col N="1277" /> date.  The total amount paid during 1990 was almost £238,000 involving 62 estate accounts.</P>
    <P>Some 70 years ago it would not have been possible for our young State to fund out of current taxation the land redistribution programme which was such an integral part of our struggle for independence. Land bonds were the means employed to spread over many years the cost of such a massive programme.  In fact, the first series of bonds &mdash; the 4.5 per cent old bonds &mdash; carried a British Government guarantee as to redemption up to 18 December 2004.  It is now a matter of history that this guarantee is no longer necessary and the passing of this Bill seals and confirms our financial independence in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the attention it has given to this technical Bill and Senators for their contributions.  I should have said earlier that annuity rates varied from 3 per cent, and not 0 per cent as I may already have said, to about 18 per cent.  The Bill effectively brings to an end an historic period in the life of the State when the unique mechanism of land bonds was used as a means of promoting redistribution of land and in the interests of public policy.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank all Senators who contributed to the speedy passage of this tidying-up legislation.</P>

      <P>I have a couple of queries on this section.  I was interested and encouraged to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, informing the House that <Col N="1278" /> he is a small farmer's son.  If he had not outlined his experience, I would have commented adversely on the procession of Ministers while we were dealing with this very important legislation.  However, I am satisfied that we have a Minister dealing with Committee Stage who understands many of the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we are aware of the significant facts.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed about the difficulties being experienced by 2,000 landowners who received land from the Land Commission and who are now seriously in arrears with their repayments and a further 4,000 who are in some difficulty.  Section 7 provides the power to waive the annuity in respect of a cottage purchased under the Labourers Act, 1936.  The Minister indicated that a commission are examining the difficulties of those 6,000 small to medium-sized farmers who are experiencing difficulties in making their repayments.  He also made the point that the total involved, where cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936 are concerned, amounted to only £25,000.  However the Minister has seen fit to insert section 7 and the power to waive the annuities in respect of those cottages.</P>
      <P>Section 7 does not include the power to waive the repayments, or part of the repayments or annuities, of the 6,000 small to medium-sized farmers in difficulty. I believe section 7 is inadequate because it does not contain that provision. Will the Minister consider including a waiver dealing with those small to medium-sized holders who are in difficulty with the repayment of their annuities as well as the cottage owners under the Labourers Act, 1936?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to distinguish between the cottage annuity and the land bond annuity in that the amount of money involved in the cottage annuity is quite limited.  We must not lose sight <Col N="1279" /> of the fact that when the bonds were redeemed in 1989, they cost £76 million and somebody will have to pay the piper. That money was borrowed and the State is still paying interest on it.  At present, we receive £5 million annually in annuities under land bonds and a further £5 million is due in arrears.  What Senator Rory Kiely said is significant: some farmers have difficulty meeting those annuities because the land was transferred to them from the Land Commission when interest rates were as high as 18 per cent and the Land Commission had no option but to pass on the price to the farmers. It is understandable that some farmers are experiencing difficulties.  However, some of them are making no effort to meet their commitments in terms of land bond annuities and we must take note of that.</P>
      <P>As I said, £76 million was borrowed to pay for this land and interest is being paid on it.  We must remember that the £5 million being paid annually to the Exchequer is used as part payment on the interest on that £76 million.  This is a time of financial constraint; we are looking for money for the Exchequer which can be put into other areas which will encourage economic regeneration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister set up a review group to examine the high level of interest some farmers were forced to pay.  That group, unlike the Land Commission, might consider the possibility of rescheduling some annuities.</P>

I am referring to the genuine cases of approximately 2,000 people who are in serious difficulty and 4,000 who are in some difficulty.  They represent only a <Col N="1280" /> tiny fraction of the total number of people involved.  It is unfair to represent what I said as asking for a waiver in respect of £80 million.  I am not saying that.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that either.  I am saying that the interest on that sum has to be paid by the State and the £5 million accruing from land bond annuities is used as a part payment against that interest.  We cannot walk away from that fact.  We will have to borrow that money unless we collect it and we know what borrowing did for us in the past.</P>

      <P>There is a very human problem beneath the surface and I am endeavouring to find some means of easing it.  I am talking of genuine cases of severe hardship and we should not let this opportunity pass without inserting a safeguard.  The Minister said this is tidying-up legislation.  Rather, it is a bureaucratic, administrative approach to an overall problem that ignores the genuine hardship cases we have referred to.  If it is considered convenient for administrative reasons to insert a waiver in respect of cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936, I see no reason why we should not make a provision for the small number of farmers who are genuinely suffering hardship.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter between now and Report Stage.  Senator O'Keeffe's interjection to represent what I said as an attempt to write-off £80 million has not been helpful.  I am simply attempting to provide for those 2,000 farmers.</P>

      <P>Is cinnte go raibh iomad deacrachtaí againn an tseachtain seo caite, ag tosnú ar an moladh a cuireadh i láthair dúinn ag an Seanadóir Brendan Ryan, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir sé ionadh mór orm an tseachtain seo caite nach raibh taobh an Rialtais sásta labhairt ar an rún.  Tá súil agam go labhróidh an tAire Stáit anocht.</P>
      <P>I will have plenty of time in eight minutes to deal with the issues that I want to deal with and I would hope that we could keep away from the divisiveness which has been part and parcel of this debate since 1982.  I hope that we will address this issue in a positive way as parliamentarians seeking to resolve a legislative difficulty by legislative means. We should keep far away from name calling undermining authority and reputation and damaging activities which took place in 1982 and 1983.  As I said last week, many of us suffered badly from the lines we took at that time.</P>
      <P>At that time I was opposed to the amendment to the Constitution, and my position remains unchanged.  That does not mean that I grow horns or am any less caring about life born or unborn, than the next person.  A number of things have become clear over the last number of traumatic weeks during this extraordinary debate, which began when a 14 year old child, suffering from the most intrusive and traumatic type of sexual abuse, became pregnant.  As I said last week, the lesson for all of us to learn from that time was that were it not for the fact that she became pregnant the abuse she had suffered would never have become public, because her parents were not aware of the abuse until they became aware of her pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> I would like to make a number of simple points.  In any development that takes place as a furtherance of this debate, in any legislative manifestation of the views of the Oireachtas, we should make it absolutely clear that the right to travel outside the boundaries of the State for whatever reason should never be prevailed upon, should never be constrained, and that it should never be proper to hold somebody back who wishes to leave the State.  Any attempt to do otherwise is simply to move in the direction of a police state.  It is important to note that all sides of this debate accept that that would be regressive and unacceptable. There are many sides to this debate, but I think there is a consensus on the fact that the right to leave the State should be protected and we should underline that fact tonight.</P>
    <P>I also believe that every effort should be made to find consensus in this debate, every possible effort should be made to find an agreed way forward.  I welcome Senator Ryan's motion in as much as it attempts to find parliamentary consensus on moving forward.  I must say that I was particularly disappointed with the reports today from the Leader of the main Opposition in the other House who took issue with the Taoiseach because he had been given something verbally rather than in writing.  That kind of thing does nothing to enhance the debate or bring it to an acceptable level, and I regret that politicians are now beginning to find ways of political manoeuvring in this debate, which cannot be dealt with in that way. Let us be open, straight and direct.  Let us express our views.  Let us push our views as far as possible and then let us accept the democratic procedure.</P>
    <P>I note that Senator Hanafin is going to speak in this debate.  I imagine there are many things he would say with which I would take issue, but I will not take issue with one fact: his certainty, his directness and his commitment to the point of view he offers.  Nobody can take issue with him on that.  I might have a difference of opinion with him, but I certainly respect the honourable and direct way he makes <Col N="1284" /> his points, I wish that all the people who share his point of view would do the same thing.  I appeal to him and the others to avoid division on this issue and move away from moralising at and towards each other.</P>
    <P>Can we accept the good faith of people who are trying to find a resolution to an extraordinary problem?  Can we accept that at the end of the day such consensus will demand movement, compromise and political judgment from all sides, and that that becomes a priority?</P>
    <P>Whatever legislative initiatives are put into place, whatever legislation is enacted, I ask that they reflect a compassionate approach on the part of the State towards the difficulties that victims of sexual abuse find themselves in time and time again.  That is a real issue.  This is not a black and white debate.  Anybody who presents it as such is being less than honest in view of the extraordinary complexities and difficulties which we have been trying to resolve over the last short period of time.  This issue will need to be addressed in a context of compassion, of a caring and responsible legislature and it should not be driven by the so-called morality of a small group.  It should reflect the views, the honestly held opinions, the cares and the responsibility of all sections of our society.</P>
    <P>I have one final point to make.  I started by saying that the right to travel should be protected because any attempt to curtail the right to travel is simply a progression into a police state.  Similarly, I would say that the right to information on any particular subject should never be restricted, that people have a right to know, that people have a right to access to information in order to make the best decision.  Whatever that information is, it should not be restricted in any way.  I hope that whatever points are made in the discussion here tonight or in other places, we should hold sacred the right of people in difficulties to seek all the information available to allow them to make the best decision, taking into consideration all aspects of the problem, be they physical, mental, academic, moral or whatever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> I hope there will be a greater participation by the Government side tonight and that the Minister will make a contribution.  I make four simple points: the right to travel, the hope that there will be a consensus and no division in dealing with this problem, the right to information and the need to address this in a compassionate, caring and responsible way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge and thank the previous speaker, Senator O'Toole, for the kind remarks he made about me.  I hope the debate for however long it lasts in the coming months will continue in the same spirit, without rancour, bitterness or unkind words.  There is no necessity for it.  Certainly, there will be nothing unkind said on our side and we will respect the sincerity of the other person's point of view at all times.  I hope it will continue in that spirit.</P>
      <P>There are some points I would like to make and to put on record.  It is proper that, again, I should mention that Article 40.3.3º was adopted by a two to one majority by the people in the 1983 referendum. It is beyond dispute that those who voted for this amendment intended to prevent legalised abortion being introduced into the State.  Indeed, the overwhelming majority on both sides of the debate were opposed to abortion and this was pointed out in this House and by many media commentators at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment as universally understood by all sides was to give constitutional backing to the right to life of the unborn, so that neither the Oireachtas nor the courts could legalise abortion without reference to the people. The amendment itself was drafted by the Government of the day, presumably in the office of the then Attorney General. The pro-life movement had no input whatsoever in the drafting of the amendment. It was not consulted in any way about the text, nor was it shown the text before its publication.  However, after careful study the pro-life movement welcomed the form of words produced by the Government and believed that it <Col N="1286" /> adequately met the objectives of the amendment.</P>
    <P>In particular the amendment stated in positive terms the right to life of the unborn and undertook to defend that right, consistent of course with upholding the established constitutional rights of the mother.  The amendment also left unaffected medical practices in regard to life-threatening conditions requiring medical treatment which might have the undesirable result of ending the unborn life.</P>
    <P>This amendment inserted in Article 40 protected the right to life before birth in the same way that the right to life of the citizen was also protected.  It was an appropriate form of words and was widely welcomed.  Although another Government proposed an alternative form of words, a formula which would have allowed the Oireachtas to legalise abortion, the original amendment was approved by a large majority in both Houses and by the people in a subsequent referendum.</P>
    <P>This amendment has stood for nine years without challenge.  None of the unfortunate consequences forecast at the time has been realised.  It became an accepted part of our Constitution, reflecting a value deeply felt by the Irish people.  After nine years, however, the clear objective of the amendment and the clear consensus of the people have been defeated by a Supreme Court judgment. The extraordinary circumstances where by the recent distressing case came to the attention of the Attorney General, and ultimately to the Supreme Court, could not have been anticipated by either side; nor did either side contemplate that the amendment might ever be interpreted as conferring a right to abortion in the case of a perceived threat to the mother's life through suicide.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that the Supreme Court decision has effectively introduced legalised abortion and on grounds that could lead to quite widespread abortion. One obvious reason is that it would clearly be impossible to sustain a prosecution against someone arguing he had acted in good faith in believing a suicide <Col N="1287" /> threat constituted a substantial risk to the mother's life.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be gained by simply disagreeing with the Supreme Court; it has the last word on the matter.  Nor can the position be restored by legislation since legislation would have to be in line with the Supreme Court decision.  The most any legislation could do would be to try to set limits to say that abortion could only be carried out up to, say, 12 weeks; or to prescribe that, say two psychiatrists had to verify the reality of the threat of suicide.  Even then such limiting legislation would inevitably have to be referred to the court for a test of its constitutionality in the light of last week's permissive finding.  Whatever the outcome, the country would still be faced with the situation that abortion had been legalised in direct opposition to the manifest intention of the people in enacting the amendment and to the overwhelming desire of people on both sides of that debate.</P>
    <P>Removing the amendment is not the answer.  Article 40.3.3º contains a wholly desirable and proper safeguard for the right to life before birth.  This is a necessary safeguard in a world where the trend has been for so long against upholding the rights of the most vulnerable and defenceless.  The right answer is not the deletion of the amendment as proposed in the motion but rather strengthening it. The solution is to amend the Constitution so as the restore the position to what we believed it to be before the recent judgment, to bring the Constitution in line with the intentions of those who voted for the amendment in 1983.  This can be done by a simple addition to the present text of Article 40.3.3º.  The drafting of this addition would, of course, be a matter for Government, but it would simply add a prohibition of intentional abortion to the existing positive statement of the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>I believe there would be now widespread support for such a move.  Many people are appalled at the implications of the recent judgment and they should be given the opportunity to restore the <Col N="1288" /> protection against abortion which they wished to insert in the Constitution.  Support for such a referendum would come not only from all those who supported the amendment in 1983, but also from very many who voted against the measure but who never dreamt it would be interpreted in such a way as to permit abortion.</P>
    <P>Abortion is, of course, a divisive issue because it forces us to examine our fundamental values and how we wish these to be reflected in our laws.  This is not just an Irish experience.  Every country has its abortion debates and the issue has to be addressed again, perhaps in every decade, as old arguments resurface and a new generation seeks to define its values.  It is an appropriate subject for decision by the people and it is a strength of our democracy that the opportunity to consult the people is available.  I believe that the people should be given the opportunity to make the law harmonise with their clear wishes.  A referendum on these lines is an essential and straightforward solution.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is worth emphasising that, while I and my colleagues in the pro-life movement reject abortion, our quarrel is never with the individual who feels driven to consider it as a solution or who wishes to travel for whatever reason.  It is rather with those who believe that the intentional ending of unborn life can never be the right answer to a human problem or in any circumstances an acceptable option.  While rejecting firmly the idea of providing assistance to obtain abortion, we fully support the availability of counselling services to assist women in crisis pregnancy situations.  Such counselling services already exist on a nationwide basis provided by marvellous organisations staffed by wonderful people.  The organisations I have in mind are Life and Cura.  Information on these services is widely available and may be found in almost every church in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the debate was initiated last week the Supreme Court has made its judgment and that has lent a considerable degree of clarity to the <Col N="1289" /> issues about which speakers last week were only in a position to speculate.  Since last week the debate has moved on and it now looks as if the Government are going to adopt a holding position which they hope will allow them to satisfy our European partners and to allow the Maastricht Summit to be ratified.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals in this matter are still fraught with a lot of difficulties. The new Protocol will require the agreement of all the European member states.  This raises the possibility that other member countries may also seek to renegotiate parts of the Treaty for reasons which relate specifically to problems which exist in those countries and which have nothing to do with the matters which have been debated so vigorously in this country over the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>There is also the legal opinion that the present Protocol as leaked may not even guarantee the right of travel because of certain legal considerations.  I am not a lawyer and I am not in a position to make a definitive statement on that; I simply refer to opinions which have been published in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> by Richard Humphreys, in particular that the changes proposed by the Government do not allow obtaining of information about abortion facilities in other countries while it is clear that the proposals the Government are now bringing forward will allow people to travel to avail of those facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that very difficult to understand and it certainly seems to me to be fraught with danger in as much as there is a provision which will allow people to travel to foreign countries to obtain a service about which they do not appear to be entitled to obtain any information until such time as they get to that country. That is particularly difficult in an Irish context, where it appears that quite large numbers of Irish women leave this country to have abortions over a very short period and in a manner in which they want to conceal the fact that they have left the country at all.  In those circumstances the fact that these women are not entitled to information about the <Col N="1290" /> facilities they are about to avail of is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I must compliment Senator Hanafin on the easy, calm tone which characterised his address here this evening.  The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution has created an inordinate amount of trouble and it is difficult to understand why people who insisted on the introduction of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution should now again appear to be suggesting that we have another amendment of the Constitution.  Those people who supported the introduction of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did so &mdash; and I hope I am being fair to them when I say this &mdash; because they did not trust elected representatives.  I think that is a fair comment.  They got their way, and look where we are now.  Very clearly, by their standards, they seemed to get the whole thing wrong.  I find it difficult to understand why these people, or at least some of them, should now appear again to be very anxious to have another referendum foisted on the country. I believe that if such a referendum did take place it would liberate very unpleasant forces, and I believe it is in the national interest that those forces should be kept in check.</P>
    <P>At the time of the 1983 referendum the Labour Party opposed the pressure groups who wanted to introduce that amendment.  Indeed, the late Frank Cluskey was perhaps the only party leader, certainly he was one of the very small minority of politicians at that time &mdash; who did not succumb to the pressure which was being exerted on politicans of all shades of opinion.  The Labour Party in those days got very little thanks for the position they took.  Indeed, some members of the party who had to contest elections were subjected to a form of abuse which was disgraceful by any standards. I do not want to see a repetition of those types of events, nor for that matter do I want to get engaged in rancorous exchanges.  I am very pleased, therefore, to observe the tone Senator Hanafin took this evening.</P>
    <P>I have no great problem supporting calls for the deletion of Article 40.3.3º of <Col N="1291" /> the Constitution.  My party, the Labour Party, opposed the insertion of those provisions in the Constitution in the first place.  However, I believe that a debate on a referendum to make such a deletion would give rise to a great deal of difficulty. Accordingly, I am pleased that the proposers of the motion are suggesting that, if such a deletion takes place, then it should take place only after party agreement.  I would certainly share that view.  It is desirable that such changes should take place only after all party agreement.  If all party agreement were not obtained we would then be in for a very unpleasant replay of the ugly debate which took place in 1983.  I would have very serious doubts as to the outcome of another referendum designed to remove those provisions from the Constitution if it were to take place in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that there is an immediate and very serious problem facing the Government in the form of the necessity to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. This question should take precedence over a referendum which would be designed to remove or delete the provisions of Article 40.3.3º from the Constitution. The Government have no alternative now but to address this matter and they are forced to address it in political terms in a relatively short space of time &mdash; a few months.</P>
    <P>The Government are at present in the process of attempting to formulate an amendment to the Protocol which could be inserted as an adjunct to the Treaty. There are still a number of difficulties facing the Government in relation to getting such an amendment agreed.  I would suggest that perhaps the best way out of the immediate problem may be to include a clause in the Protocol which would allow for freedom to travel and the right to information on services lawfully available in EC countries where somebody is travelling to avail of those services.  I support the provision of a comprehensive counselling, advice and support service for all women in a pregnancy crisis situation. That is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> It is a great pity that some women are, in effect, abandoned in such a crisis.  It is widely believed that many women seek abortions because of the absence of adequate information and advice to women during the early stages of pregnancy. Indeed, the maintenance of ignorance and perhaps even the cultivation of a climate of ignorance in the area of sexual behaviour has been an important factor in the genesis of conditions which result in approximately 5,000 Irish women going to Britain each year to procure abortions.</P>
    <P>I also join in the appeals for a calm and sensible debate.  I am confident that my party will not seek to exploit any political opportunities arising from this serious issue.</P>

      <P>We are faced with a very difficult and detailed discussion on the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment.  When this motion was put down last week, we did not have the benefit of that judgment.  I would point out that to push this motion to a vote this evening would be unhelpful in the context of the debate.  I do not see any need for it at this stage.  Given that there are five judgments involved and given the implications for the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, we need time for reflection and discussion with great sensitivity being shown on all sides.  It is clear this evening that everybody is approaching this subject with those values.  To push this to a vote here tonight would not be a helpful way forward given the excellent conciliatory tones adopted by everybody this evening.</P>

      <P>The judgment raises many issues which need to be discussed in a <Col N="1293" /> mature, sensible and Christian way. Because the pro-life faction adopted one side of the argument, the implication is that if you are not on that side you are anti-life.  I reject that implication on a personal level and on behalf of everybody who would like to have a consensus on this issue.  The title &ldquo;pro life&rdquo; is somewhat misleading in that regard and in regard to the right to life of a young person in a very difficult pregnancy, no matter how that pregnancy occurred. Seeking to ensure that the mother is guaranteed her right to life is also pro-life.</P>
      <P>We have to deal with the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.  There has been a great deal of discussion at Government level about the wording of an amendment to that Protocol.  It is not clear whether amending the Protocol is the best possible solution to this difficult problem.  It is my view that the removal of the Protocol in its entirety is the best, cleanest and most sensible course to adopt, because the Protocol was inserted as a consequence of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  Our understanding of what that amendment to our Constitution meant has been fundamentally altered. The Supreme Court judgments negate the reason for the Protocol.  It is on that basis that I believe the best way forward is to remove the Protocol in its entirety from the Maastricht Treaty which, in large measure, is a separate issue and raises very important economic issues. The majority of the population fully support that Treaty but it would not be helpful if the debate centred on the Protocol. That danger exists.  There are other ways for us to handle this issue.  The resolution of this problem rests with the legislators.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the best way forward is to delete the Protocol from the Maastricht Treaty.  I do not believe that any of our European partners would have any difficulty with that.  It would not impinge on any of the other 11 member states in the EC nor would it prevent them raising other issues.  It would be a clean and fair way of dealing with it and it would be in our national interest to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of issues I want to <Col N="1294" /> deal with this evening.  The first is the right to travel.  As a citizen of Europe as well as a citizen of this country, I have the right to travel, and that right is enshrined in European law.  People seeking to leave this country should not be prohibited from doing so.  In other words, they should not be restricted under the Constitution or under Irish law from travelling to any EC country.  The legislators must move quickly to establish the right to travel.  There are no grounds on which to restrict the right of travel and I do not think that Irish people want that.  That point must be clarified.  The right to travel should not be restricted under any legislation.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to Senator Hanafin.  He spoke about the right to information.  As citizens of Ireland and Europe, the right to information is an essential ingredient in freedom of expression, freedom of belonging to the sort of country and community we live in.  It is not in the interest of people on any side of this debate to restrict that sort of information.  If a proper information service were available giving information on abortion and its consequences, my guess is that rather than being a factor in people deciding to terminate a pregnancy, it might cause them to decide against that course of action.  The reality is that many of these people who leave the country are young and immature and no matter what counselling they might get in the United Kingdom they would find it next to impossible to change their minds and return home without having fulfilled their intention of terminating pregnancy.  In many instances, some of the young people involved would have raised money to finance their journey through borrowing from friends and, as a result, would nearly feel obliged to carry through the termination of pregnancy. That is something those who call themselves &ldquo;pro life&rdquo; should consider.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Senator Hanafin, he dealt very calmly and objectively with the argument he put forward this evening but it was a little mischievous to suggest, as he did, that all the information is available in this country.  It is not, and that is the <Col N="1295" /> reality.  It is unhelpful to mislead on that point.  The right to information and the right to travel are sacrosanct and should, unquestionably, be available in any future action we might take.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not in any way support abortion.  I would be totally and utterly opposed to that course of action for my family.  However, people should have the right to make that judgment for themselves and should have available to them the best possible counselling and information regarding the consequences of continuing with a pregnancy or terminating it.</P>
    <P>Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution has not produced the result that was intended and a way forward must be found.  The best way forward is to get a consensus, sensibly and sensitively, on this issue.  I appeal to all sides of the debate to allow time for calm deliberation.  That is what we need.  We do not want sudden reactions to a given situation.  The issue of whether Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution should be removed in its entirety or, if amended, in what way it should be amended needs long and detailed discussion.</P>
    <P>I believe in the right to choose.  I do not believe that I as an individual or as a parent have the right to enforce my views on any one.  I do not believe the Constitution or legislation should force people to do things in a certain way. The right to choose in such matters is a fundamental right.  A reasonable and realistic outcome would be if the right to travel, the right to information and the right of choice was the consensus view that emerged from this very difficult and sensitive debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the complex judgments of the five Supreme Court judges it is obvious <Col N="1296" /> why Fine Gael tabled an amendment proposing to defer detailed discussion of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution until Members had the opportunity of studying the full text.  We welcome the proposed full day's debate on the issue in two weeks time.  That will give us an opportunity to study the full text of the judgment as well as the proposed wording of the amendment to the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty by inserting a right to travel for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Though we appreciate Private Members' time, it is inadequate to debate something which has consequences for us in relation to our Constitution and EC membership in this way and it was with that in mind that the amendment was put forward by Fine Gael.  We are aware now of the complications and difficulties associated with discussing it because the most learned lawyers are still debating the issue.  One has only to look at the newspapers every day to see the prolonged, protracted, differing interpretations of the five judgments and the additional problem of the Maastricht Protocol.</P>
    <P>The action that is needed is as follows: first, we need legislation to define the scope of the circumstances in which following the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, abortion is legal.  In other words, there is a need to define the terms under which conditional abortion might be lawful, for example, the length of time of the pregnancy and the limit of the time when abortions may take place.  All of these issues are extremely important and must be spelled out.</P>
    <P>Second, we need either constitutional or legislative action to put beyond any doubt the right of every citizen to travel freely.  In today's world, the right to travel should be an inalienable human right, not one which can be conferred or taken away by the Constitution or the courts other than in cases where persons have been convicted of criminal acts in this jurisdiction or have been released on bail.</P>
    <P>Third, we must resolve any doubts about possible interference by the Maastricht <Col N="1297" /> Protocol in the right to liberty of our citizens.  The need for consensus is obvious to all political parties.  In this House it is essential.  Senators debating this issue last week did not have the opportunity to read through the lengthy deliberations of the five judgments.  The contributions made by Senators were excellent but Senators were at a disadvantage in that regard.  That is the reason why the amendment was put down.</P>
    <P>The immediate issue regarding the Maastricht Treaty is of major concern to not just the Irish public but to Members of the European Parliament.  Legal advisers are working day and night and are on radio and television from Brussels giving their views.  The other 11 member states are deliberating and advising because they will have to be taken into account when we are dealing with the wording of the proposed amendment to the Protocol.  The fact that international attention has been focused on this controversy will surely concentrate the Government's mind to convince our fellow EC members of the need to support any proposed change to or amendment of the Protocol.  It is interesting that the Protocol has as much legal force as if it were part of the main body of the Treaty. People must be aware of that.</P>
    <P>We must realise that although we are an island, we are part of Europe.  We must grow up as a nation and realise that we are in a time of change.  The cold, clinical, civil laws under the Maastricht Treaty will decide our fate in the future. If we have moral dilemmas we must separate them from the laws that we will accept when we vote in the Maastricht referendum. From now on we must be an adult nation.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome has been in force since 1957.  This new Treaty could last for 30 years or more.  We are not voting for something that will fizzle out but for something that will last our lifetime and longer.  We must be conscious of what the Maastricht Treaty means and the importance of the Protocol.  Any wording to amend it must be copperfastened.  Our <Col N="1298" /> conscience must solve our moral dilemmas.</P>
    <P>We are Catholics &mdash; Senator Norris can speak for his religion and other Senators likewise &mdash; but we must be adult enough to face up to our consciences when it comes to divorce, contraception and abortion.  Why must we always look to the State for support?  No civilised country wishes to provide abortion on demand.  This is not what we are looking for or what we will have as a result of the judgments.  It is an Irish problem but we must find a solution to it in a European context.</P>
    <P>This is a time of change.  We must have patience; and there must be a slow, painstaking and logical debate.  We cannot sweep our problems under the carpet or shirk our responsibilities.  The facts are that at least 5,000 girls and women &mdash; some of whom do not give their names and addresses &mdash; go to England for abortions.  We cannot say that if they take the boat or plane to England and have abortions that is all right.  Either it is wrong or it is right.</P>
    <P>We must educate, counsel and support women who are lonely and isolated. Women in other EC countries who are considering an abortion are counselled and they often think twice about what will be a very tragic decision for them.  We must have a counselling service, support and advice for women in crisis pregnancy situations where the pressure on women is enormous &mdash; the secrecy of the pregnancy, deciding to have an abortion, feeling guilty, leaving the country, and perhaps returning with psychological problems for the rest of their lives.  We must provide counselling services for these women.  I await with interest the judgment from the Supreme Court on 24 March.  A decision was made six months ago but reserved judgment will be given in relation to counselling, support and advice services.</P>
    <P>Members of the European Parliament have already tabled a resolution stating that nothing in this Protocol shall be taken to restrict in any member state the right of free movement within the Community to obtain services lawfully <Col N="1299" /> provided in the Community or the obtaining of information in relation to such services.  That is why we were loth to discuss these issues before the full debate tomorrow fortnight when we will have that judgment.  We will also know the wording of the amendment to the Maastricht Protocol.  We will have further time to study the lengthy Supreme Court deliberations which are extremely complicated and difficult.</P>
    <P>We are now part of Europe.  We will have to face issues like this.  Once we sign the Maastricht Treaty, we must take responsibility for our own morals and deal with them, through our own consciences and we must not expect to be counselled and taken by the hand like children when we make decisions.  We must grow up.</P>
    <P>This issue &mdash; and it is unfortunate that it was the trauma of a 14 year old which prompted it &mdash; has caused the people to take their responsibilities seriously in relation to what will be a secular society within the 12 EC countries.  I hope there will be consensus on this issue which caused such division in 1983.  If a referendum is necessary Fine Gael will not shirk their responsibility.  We will be a responsible party.  We will support whatever steps are taken to resolve this problem once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority decisions of the Supreme Court held that where &ldquo;it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother [e.g. by a threat of self destruction] which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy, that such termination is permissible, having regard to the true interpretation of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.&rdquo;&mdash;Judge Finlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of this test to the present case was based on the following facts: a 14 year old girl alleged that she had been raped.  Judge Hederman pointed out that there was no evidence in this case to prove this and that it remained an allegation.  No forensic or medical evidence <Col N="1300" /> was called in the case.  The other judges did not discuss the issue of rape <i>per se</i> but were clearly influenced by the allegation, on several occasions she &ldquo;coldly expressed a desire to solve matters by ending her life&rdquo;, and a clinical psychologist, a member of my own profession, assessed her emotional condition and concluded that she was &ldquo;capable of such an act&rdquo;, and I do not doubt for a moment that she was if she found herself in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The major implication of these judgments is that abortion in the above circumstances is now legally permitted in Ireland, on the basis of the constitutional rights of the mother expressed in Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>The level of proof required, as exemplified in the present case, is not strict. In fact, any threat of suicide made by a pregnant women in the presence of a psychologist would have to be taken seriously and would <i>prima facie</i> entitle her to obtain an abortion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In such cases there is no time or age limit whatsoever.  There is no reason suggested in the judgments that the same principles could not be applied to a woman who was eight or nine months pregnant. In this respect, Ireland now has the most permissive abortion law in the world. That, for me, is a sad thing.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now embarked on the path that has led to abortion on demand in many other countries.  In Roe <i>v</i> Wade in the USA in 1973, a 14 year old girl alleged she had been raped.  She eventually won a so-called right to have an abortion, a right which has since been invoked in the USA to justify millions of abortions in the past 20 years.  She later confessed that she had not in fact been raped, but the floodgates have been opened.  I wonder will history repeat itself in this country?</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision, is I believe, open to several fundamental criticisms on a number of points.  First, the judgment failed to recognise the radical distinction between a miscarriage which is a consequence of necessary medical or surgical treatment of a pathological condition in the mother, but which is not the purpose of that treatment, and <Col N="1301" /> a miscarriage which is deliberately procured for non-medical reasons.  Article 40.3.3º was intended to permit the former &mdash; which are not abortions in the medical sense, but not the latter.  The judges simply assumed, without any discussion, that the Constitution permitted abortion in some cases.</P>
    <P>Second, continuing the confusion, they held that a &ldquo;real and substantial risk&rdquo; to the life of the mother was sufficient to justify taking the life of the unborn.  This criterion might well be appropriate in deciding whether to undertake a medical or surgical treatment of a pathological condition which might cause harm to the unborn, but it is, I believe, completely inappropriate as a justification for a direct abortion.</P>
    <P>Third, there are no cases in which it is medically necessary to deliberately terminate the life of the foetus in order to save the life of the mother.  No medical evidence whatsoever was called to address this or indeed any other aspect of the case.</P>
    <P>Fourth, any such termination would in any case be contrary to the equal rights specified in Article 40.3.3º.  To deliberately destroy one right in order to vindicate another &ldquo;equal&rdquo; right is unjustifiable and fundamentally wrong in principle.</P>
    <P>Fifth the qualifying test stated by the court can be seen to be misguided from the circumstances to which it was applied. The judges took no account of the normal medical practice whereby potential suicide cases can be treated until the danger is passed.  I have frequently established that people were suicidal and people are admitted to psychiatric hospitals in Ireland on the basis that they will feel better after medical treatment in six, eight or ten weeks time or however long it takes.  But these judges merely assumed that it would be impractical to prevent the suicide if the mother had decided on it.  The threat of suicide was held to be a substantial threat to the life of the mother.  Be that as it may; it is clearly not a threat to her right to life. The distinction is very important.  Her right to life is primarily a right of self-preservation <Col N="1302" /> and her right to the means to sustain her life is a corollary of that right.  A threat of suicide by the mother is in breach of her duty to seek to preserve her own life, and that of her unborn child. Her right to life is in fact founded on this duty and the right is forfeited if the duty is not fulfilled.  Suicide is not, therefore, a threat to her right to life, but it is an attack on the right to life of the unborn. It amounts to her saying &ldquo;You kill the baby or I will kill myself.&rdquo;  I believe the judges mistakenly took the possibility of suicide to be a threat to the mother's right to life and then proceeded to &ldquo;vindicate&rdquo; that right at the expense of the right of the unborn.</P>
    <P>Sixth, invoking a rule of constitutional interpretation invented in 1973, which bases the interpretation of constitutional rights on the judges' perception of the &ldquo;prevailing ideas&rdquo; on these issues, Judge Finlay agreed with the other judges in arriving at a decision which flies in the face of the clearly expressed decision of the people.  This approach is itself unconstitutional in that it denies the right of the people, clearly set out in Article 6 of the Constitution &ldquo;in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good&rdquo;.  As there is no appeal from the Supreme Court, the resulting impasse is a serious constitutional crisis which undermines the authority and standing of the Courts.</P>
    <P>In spite of the very liberal approach of the court to abortion in these circumstances, the court saw fit, by a narrow 3-2 majority, to retain for the purpose of Irish law the power to prohibit travel abroad for abortions not covered by the circumstances which I have outlined. They did not deal with the question of EC law.  This restriction was not envisaged or desired by the proponents of the amendment or by anyone else in 1983, and it is not desired now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>A real difficulty arises for the Oireachtas in legislation in the aftermath of this case.  Since the case was <Col N="1303" /> decided on the basis of the mother's constitutional right to life, it would be unconstitutional for the Oireachtas to attempt to enact legislation which was more restrictive of the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to abortion than the standard adopted by the court namely, a threat of suicide accepted by one psychologist, not even a second opinion is required.</P>
      <P>Leaving the matter in the hands of the Oireachtas is not a solution, therefore, first, because the Oireachtas does not have the power to overrule or modify the effects of the Supreme Court judgment, and second, because any restrictive solution arrived at by the Oireachtas would be wide open to further relaxation arising from pressure from the pro-abortion lobby.</P>
      <P>The only way in which the people can restore the situation to what everyone supposed it to have been after the eighth amendment, is to add to Article 40.3.3º a clear-cut wording spelling out the prohibition on abortion and the provision for necessary medical treatments.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Protocol will remain a necessity, but it might have to be amended to ensure that it refers to the new protection to be provided in the Constitution and to deal with the question of travel.  Ideally, however, it should simply protect all fundamental rights recognised in the Constitution.  There is no reason in principle that the law of an essentially economic treaty should be allowed to take precedence over fundamental rights which are described as &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo; in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote a passage from a pastoral letter for Lent called &ldquo;Christian Integrity &mdash; Does it Matter?&rdquo; by His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Desmond Connell.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are entrusted with power by the community for the sake of the common good.  Integrity clearly excludes the abuse of political power for private advantage but as the European experience of this century amply <Col N="1304" /> shows, the most serious corruption of power is not to be found in abuse of that kind but in the pursuit of policies that diminish or destroy respect for the dignity of the person.  This form of abuse has occurred, not just under Nazi and Communist rule, but in the democracies as well, as, for example, in the spread of permissive legislation on abortion.  The welfare of our society is very much in the hands of politicians. The task to which they dedicate themselves is one of the noblest but it imposes upon them a special moral responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am glad His Grace regards our function as one of the noblest.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Those whose office obliges them to speak in the name of Christ on matters of public morality will not go unheard by politicians who find in the knowledge of Christ the source of their personal integrity.</P>
    <P>These judges, by this particular action and judgment, have, in fact, spat in the face of Christ.</P>

      <P>I am pleased Senator Lydon withdrew that appalling remark, but in the heat of the moment we all make mistakes in what we say.</P>
      <P>I abhor abortion and I think most people abhor it even when it is a legal option.  Taking into consideration the case of this unfortunate 14 year old girl and her parents I cannot say if I found my daughter at that age pregnant as a result of rape that I would not do as they did.  If most Irish parents were honest and imagined themselves in that predicament, even though they may be opposed to abortion I doubt if they would not take the course of action these parents took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased abortion was illegal in Ireland, but I was uneasy about the amendment and the debate that accompanied it in 1983.  Neither SPUC nor FLAC nor the Church had confidence in the politicians of this country. If they had confidence in us they would not require this amendment to be inserted into the Constitution.  What we have got at the end of the day, as Senator Lydon mentioned, is the most permissive abortion legislation in the democratic world, thanks to a pressure group and <Col N="1306" /> due to the irresponsibility of Church leaders who would not listen to the Attorney General or the Taoiseach of the day who warned specifically that the wording of that amendment could place us in this dilemma.  It was not intended but that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Cullen, I object to the term &ldquo;pro life&rdquo;.  It is offensive to imply that we are not all pro life which is what that title does; anybody who disagreed with the pro life campaign of 1983 was automatically branded as pro-abortion, an outrageous assumption.  We have produced our own brand of Irish Ayatollahs and this is the result.</P>
    <P>We must now consider what to do about the Protocol in the Maastricht Treaty.  As Senator Cullen said, the cleanest solution would be to withdraw that Protocol altogether and, after calm deliberate debate, see what we can do about legislation at home.  I regret that our present figure for abortion is higher than that of Holland who have the most permissive abortion legislation in the EC. Our figure is based only on those who record themselves as Irish when they go to Britain for an abortion.  No doubt a large number of unfortunate women give addresses of friends and relatives in Britain and, consequently, the abortion figure is probably much higher.  The abortion rate, I understand, is about 1.8 per cent lower in Holland per 1,000 women than it is in Ireland and their rate is dropping.</P>
    <P>No woman wants to have an abortion. Abortion conflicts the maternal instinct and it is only in desperation that people turn to such a remedy.  The Dutch abortion figure is dropping because they provide education, information and contraception.  We seem to want it both ways.  We do not give sex education to young children or adequate information to young married couples and we make it difficult for young people to have access to contraception.  It is not a function of State to legislate for morality.  That is the function of parents and Church in as far as they want to get involved.  It is ridiculous to think we can legislate for morality and a cop-out for parents to call on <Col N="1307" /> the Government to decide at what age contraceptives should be made available. The results of this misconception of the State's function are staring us in the face.</P>
    <P>Apart from today's problems it is time we took a look at problems which may face us tomorrow if not later tonight.  I do not think anybody is considering the possible implications of experiments being carried out at present in reproductive physiology.  We have no legislation to deal with artificial insemination, <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, super ovulation, embryo implantation, embryo splitting or cloning, embryo banks or embryo research.  If we were as concerned about life as we profess to be we should now be seeking a Community-wide code of ethics on all these issues.  If we do not, people &mdash; Irish and otherwise &mdash; will naturally drift to the country with the most permissive legislation in this regard.  We should be trying as a nation to achieve a standard code of ethics on these issues throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about a couple with twins who had experienced difficulty in having a family. The wife has been treated with super ovulation and eight ova were produced, fertilised <i>in vitro</i> and three were implanted.  Two of the ova developed successfully and two children were born. The parents were photographed with two beautiful children but the problem was that five embryos remained in storage. The couple declared they did not want them; they did not want more than two children.  What would happen in Ireland in that situation?  We do not know because we have no legislation for it.  The law in Britain provides that if parents do not want embryos they may donate them anonymously to couples who want them or else they must be destroyed within a certain number of hours.  No experimentations is allowed on such embryos.</P>
    <P>Further to that there is now the possibility &mdash; and it has happened already &mdash; that identical twins or split embryos, may be born at different times.  One was already born 18 months after the other. That development gives rise to the possibility <Col N="1308" /> of embryo banks where chancers with catalogues of beautiful children could approach childless couples and offer them a carbon copy of a living child with a high IQ and so on and at a huge price.  What are we doing about that?  We are not giving it a thought.  We have locked ourselves into the consequences of 1983's nonsense which now gives us the most permissive abortion legislation in the democratic world, thanks to the outrageous activities of a pressure group. I hope we will learn a lesson from it and that pressure groups will never again be allowed to blackmail politicians into producing legislation which could have this kind of result.</P>

      <P>I thank all speakers whatever their point of view who contributed to this debate.  I have made a careful note of all points made and many were good points.  I undertake to the House now to pass on those remarks for the consideration of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to put on the record my personal sympathy and that of the Government for the family involved in the tragic case referred to in the motion before the House.  Following the Supreme Court decision given on 26 February, the Government issued a statement which, among other things, said &ldquo;that any further comment on the wider implications of the case must await an analysis of the reasons which will be given <Col N="1309" /> in the court's judgment in due course&rdquo;. These reasons are now set out in the judgment of the court delivered on the 5 March 1992 and the Government's position in the matter at this early stage was explained to the other House yesterday by the Taoiseach.  His statement will give my contribution here tonight.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the judgments of the Supreme Court which number five in total have raised a number of complex issues that will need careful consideration by the Government.  It is vital, he said, that these issues be treated with insight and care so that their precise implications can be fully understood and considered. Because of the constitutional, political, humanitarian and other questions involved, he said this process will inevitably take time and it would be irresponsible to attempt to come up with instant solutions or suggestions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to consultations he proposed to have with Opposition party leaders and he assured the House that when those consultations are complete and all the implications of the judgments have been fully and carefully examined the Government will be able to announce their proposals to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was also able to inform the House that the Government are committed to seeking to have the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty amended with a view to removing the effect it would appear to have on the right of our citizens to travel abroad in certain cases.  He has already set in train the preliminary procedures necessary to achieve such a change.  The consultations with Opposition leaders which I have mentioned began yesterday and the Taoiseach has promised to keep in touch with them as work on the examination of the implications of the judgment continues.</P>
    <P>I agree that the better approach as indicated in the amendment to the motion is for the House to defer detailed discussion on Article 40.3.3º, until such time as all Members have had an opportunity to study in depth the Supreme Court's judgments.  The Government for their part must also have a full opportunity <Col N="1310" /> to analyse the issues involved, to to engage in consultations and to decide what further proposals it should bring forward to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I urge the House to support the amendment as I and the Government think it is the proper response to make at this time.</P>

      <P>I apologise for my intemperate outburst a few moments ago; I do not like becoming excessively heated in this House.  It is not the way to deal with issues and I apologise to you and the House.  I want to be calm and restrained and to say to those who disagree with me on this issue that they should be a little sensitive about wrapping the term &ldquo;pro life&rdquo; about themselves.</P>
      <P>I will try to confine my remarks to what Senator Hanafin said because at all times in this debate he has been extremely balanced, fair and restrained in his comments which cannot be said for everybody in this debate.  To claim that only one side of a disagreement like this is pro life is a hurtful assertion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim a monopoly on virtue but I deeply resent any suggestion that because I disagree with people on either the merits of the constitutional amendment or the Article of the Constitution we are debating or any related issue that I am not pro life.  I have developed a high regard for Members of the Oireachtas in the 11 years I have been here.  I came in with almost a contempt for politicians.  My opinion of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas is higher now than it was when I came in 11 years ago with a somewhat simplistic view.  Members of the Oireachtas are all pro life and everybody, in ways that I sometimes disagree with passionately, works in that direction.  Occasions when extraordinarily offensive language is used are noted because they are so rare and when they happen all of us respond.  I have memories of occasional remarks made by various people in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> It is unfortunate that the young girl in question was described as allegedly raped because I understand sexual intercourse with an underage person is, by definition, statutory rape and that whoever was involved in the act of intercourse whether consensual or not is guilty of rape.  Anybody irresponsible enough to engage in sexual acitvities with a minor is committing an enormous breach of trust and perpetrating a profound invasion of a child's physical integrity and, therefore, the proper description of that action is rape.  We can argue about the circumstances of the rape but sexual intercourse with a minor is legally classified as statutory rape and, therefore, all of us should be of one view on that.</P>
    <P>I expressed my view on some of the extreme remarks made about the Supreme Court decision.  Some people do not appreciate that the Supreme Court have to deal with the Constitution as it is and there is no room in the Constitution for a fudge on hard questions.  Their Lordships explained that in an issue involving conflicts of rights they cannot shrug their shoulders, hold their hands up and say &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot decide&rdquo;. Their job is to decide where we leave it unclear and in Article 40.3.3º as they interpret it there was a clear conflict of rights and tragically, that conflict of rights was not unforeseen.  Without being pedantic about it it was foreseen by the Attorney General before this amendment was passed; he warned the then Government that this amendment was ambiguous.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions' statement caused considerable controversy at the time.  I quote from column 523 of the Official Report of the Seanad of 4 May 1983 in which Senator Mary Robinson quoted the Attorney General as saying that the Director of Public Prosecutions envisaged certain difficulties in the enforcement of section 58 of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861 under which abortion is banned in this country.  The Director of Public Prosecutions implied that it would be difficult to prosecute under certain circumstances <Col N="1312" /> if the amendment were passed so we were warned.  I do not say that to gloat but simply to advise all of us to be careful with difficult issues not to make a situation worse by ignoring the advice of people who do not have a hidden agenda or vested interests and who are trying to advise us as dispassionately as they can about what should be done.</P>
    <P>At column 538 of the same debate on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, Senator Robinson talked about the possibility of third party injunctions being brought under this amendment perhaps to prevent the pregnant woman from going outside the country. We were warned about the possibility of people being injuncted.  I mention this not to gloat but to remind the House that we should be very careful.  We should not allow ourselves to be pushed into positions which make life worse.</P>
    <P>I want to address the suggestion that Article 40.3.3º should be amended to prevent what Senator Hanafin, in a very restrained and balanced comment and a very fair argument from his position, called intentional abortion.  The difficulty is that we cannot mix Church law and civil law.  My understanding of civil law is that the known indirect consequences of an action are as culpable as its direct consequences.  The problem is that in the eyes of the church a pregnancy can be indirectly terminated but in civil law, that is as much an abortion as the case where a pregnancy is directly terminated.  It is impossible to write civil law which will give full force to the views of Senator Hanafin and at the same time maintain the position on life-threatening situations where, in the church's view, the termination of a pregnancy is an indirect consequence.  The distinction is impossible to make in civil law.  Furthermore, it is possible to argue &mdash; and some eminent lawyers have done so &mdash; that even those situations are illegal under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.  It is impossible to provide the type of prohibition that some people on the other side want.  In their excessive zeal to copperfasten the situation, which in my view <Col N="1313" /> is impossible to copperfasten, we have the opposite to what they wished at the time.  I have to say they were warned that this could be the consequence of their actions and that is why this amendment is still a matter of considerable disquiet.</P>
    <P>The position of the minority churches is far too easily dismissed in this argument. The truth is that all the Protestant churches admit to the possibility of abortion under certain circumstances.  While it is possible to dismiss all those arguments, the one thing we should not do is to ignore them and pretend they were not made.  If people want to say I think they are wrong and that I am going to ignore them, that is fine.  To insert into the Constitution a clause which flies in the face of the accepted views of at least 25 per cent of the population of this island, and to have that advocated by people who strongly advocate the retention of the clauses in the Constitution which indirectly claim some jurisdiction over Northern Ireland, is logically inconsistent, whatever about the moral position of those who advocate it.  If the intent of the original amendment was offensive to members of the minority religion the even more extreme Roman Catholic intent of the proposed amendment to the amendment is doubly so.  Those who advocate it are obliged morally, not necesarily to agree with the argument, but to say that they are so sure they are right on this issue that they are going to ignore the views of the minority religion on this island.  I believe they are wrong.  I have always believed that this amendment was unhelpful and the position is getting worse.</P>
    <P>A number of very good statements have been made by various Members of this House about the need to keep a degree of restraint on this issue, about the need not to use highly emotional language. The only slightly emotional comment I will make tonight is that over the last month, I was very annoyed to hear a German MP describing us as barbarians.</P>

      <P>Coming from a German that was a bit rich.  I say that in the knowledge that I will be accused of all sorts of things, but, with their history, they can leave the rest of us alone and avoid giving us lectures about our degree of civilisation.</P>
      <P>I believe, as I have always believed, that even after the Supreme Court judgment, we do not need this amendment. Many of those who disagree with me are sincere in their views but I would invite them to address this question: what do they really want?  They apparently want the absolute right to travel outside this island to do something they believe is fundamentally and morally wrong.  I do not understand that.  If I agreed with them about the heinous nature of abortion &mdash; that it is equivalent to murder in every case &mdash; then I would agree there is a logic to preventing people leaving.  If it is less obvious then what we accept are the complexities of this issue.  It is not a simple issue.  If it were as clear cut as some people say, then you could not possibly permit people to leave the State to do it.  If on the other hand, there are many nuances, then we ought to address the problem and not try to adopt a sense of moral superiority simply by not allowing it to happen here.</P>
      <P>I said last week I could make no sense of the amendment to this motion.  On the understanding that we do not want a division on this very delicate and sensitive issue, and that the amendment will not be pressed, I propose to withdraw the motion so that we can continue to discuss this issue in the calm and reasonably responsible fashion that the vast majority of the Members of this House have shown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution arises from the application from Waterford Harbour Commissioners <Col N="1316" /> that borrowings of up to £10 million over 15 years in connection with the Belview harbour development plan be guaranteed by the State.  Waterford harbour is one of Ireland's premier commercial ports.  It is one of the key ports on which our commercial harbours policy is based.  The principal objectives of this policy in the medium term are (a) to offset the effects of Ireland's peripheral location so that our exporters and importers competitive disadvantages can be maintained; and (b) to ensure that Ireland has sufficient port facilities to meet the anticipated increase in trade expected following the completion of the Single Market.</P>
      <P>These objectives are being pursued principally through an investment in commercial ports of approximately £69 million in the years 1989 to 1993.  This investment is funded in part by the EC through the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  The programme is assisting projects at the key ports of Cork, Dublin, Rosslare and Waterford, and at other important local ports.  The Waterford project is the largest single port project in this programme.  These measures, when implemented, could have the effect of winning back some of the substantial Republic of Ireland traffic that has moved to Northern Ireland ports.</P>
      <P>Waterford harbour handles more than 30 per cent of Ireland's lo/lo &mdash; lift-on/lift off &mdash; container traffic.  Containerised traffic through the port of Waterford has more than doubled in recent years reaching 130,000 TEUs (unit of measurement of container traffic TEU &mdash; 20-foot equivalent unit) in 1991 and this throughput is set to increase dramatically in the coming years &mdash; throughput in 2005 is estimated at 275,000 TUEs but this cannot be achieved at the present terminal which has a design capacity of 80,000 TUEs, and the number of containers going through at present is 130,000.  From that you can see that the existing facilities are under tremendous pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To cater for the projected dramatic <Col N="1317" /> increase in container throughput the Waterford Harbour Commissioners are about to embark on a major lo-lo harbour development plan at Belview, County Kilkenny &mdash; four miles down-river from Waterford &mdash; at a cost in excess of £20 million.  The location is just opposite Cheekpoint.  The plan comprises major capital dredging, the construction of a 450 metre container wharf, container cranes, container compounds, stockpile areas, internal roads, railway sidings, access road and other ancillary works. Full planning permission has been obtained by Waterford Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In addition, the commissioners have advised me that the long term viability of the project is dependent on larger vessels and scheduled services, unhindered by tidal conditions, operating into Waterford. To achieve this the depth of water on the bars at Cheekpoint and Duncannon must be increased to a design depth of minus six metres Ordnance Datum.  Expert advice received by the commissioners was that the construction of four groynes on the south side of the river would present the most cost effective solution, with least impact on the environment.  The groynes, when constructed, will enable the harbour accommodate ships of 20,000 tonnes at all stages of the tide as against 12,000 tonnes at present.  An application from Waterford Harbour Commissioners for a foreshore licence in respect of the construction of the groynes is under consideration in my Department at present and will be processed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the National Development Plan and in the Operational Programme on Peripherality for expenditure by Waterford Harbour Commissioners of £15 million between now and 1993 on the provision of the harbour element of the facilities, and EC aid totalling £7.5 million has been approved in principle towards the cost. Prospects are good that the rail &mdash; £1.36 <Col N="1318" /> million &mdash; and road &mdash; £3 million &mdash; links to Belview will also qualify for EC aid under the road and rail elements of the Operational Programme on Peripherality. EC aid totalling £958,000 towards the cost of the project has already been paid to the commissioners. In addition and as an exceptional measure, State grant assistance of £200,000 was paid to Waterford Harbour Commissioners in 1990 in respect of expenditure already incurred on the project. Commercial borrowings totalling £705,500 in respect of essential preliminary works have been drawn down by the commissioners with my approval and that of the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 120 of the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Belview project is justified &mdash; the present lo-lo container terminal has a design capacity of 80,000 TEUs; in 1991 it handled 130,000 TEUs. Because the existing terminal is being over-utilised, there is a very real danger that the wharf will be undermined to such an extent that it will have to be taken out of commission.  Due to lack of capacity, traffic is being forced away from Waterford and the service to customers is being adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The Belview lo-lo container terminal, when operational, will reduce by one hour sailing time between Waterford harbour and the UK and continental ports, will enable three ships to be worked simultaneously, will have flexible working arrangements &mdash; 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 364 days per year &mdash; which will result in a quicker ship turnaround time and thus will reduce costs to users. The lo-lo handling capacity of Waterford port will increase to 320,000 TEUs per annum.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners are confident that the new container terminal at Belview will be completed and operational within 16 months from the date of commencement of the wharf construction.</P>
    <P>While essential preliminary works, e.g. capital dredging, have been undertaken, <Col N="1319" /> actual construction works have not commenced as yet.  In 1991 Waterford Harbour Commissioners invited tenders for the wharf construction &mdash; £7.5 million &mdash; and crane acquisition &mdash; £3.7 million. While the commissioners have issued letters of intent to the successful tenderers &mdash; Ascon for the wharf and Davy Morris UK Limited for the crane &mdash; the contracts have not been awarded as yet as certain necessary formalities have not been completed.  The financial package for the project still has to be finalised and the commissioners have not as yet executed an agreement with Bell Lines Limited &mdash; the intended main user of Belview &mdash; whereby Bells will effectively undertake to service commercial borrowings of up to £10 million by the commissioners.  The final draft of the agreement, as approved by my Department, was forwarded to Waterford Harbour Commissioners on 9 March 1992. Hopefully, the agreement duly executed by the commissioners and Bells will be returned at an early date for formal endorsement of my consent.</P>
    <P>The draft agreement provides that Bell Lines will provide sufficient income to the commissioners to enable the interest and capital cost of borrowings up to a maximum of £8.5 million for a one crane operation and £10 million for a two crane operation to be discharged over 15 years; in addition harbour rates in respect of guaranteed minimum throughputs will be paid by Bells to the commissioners. These harbour rates will be increased annually in line with or related to the increase in the CPI.  In return Bells will have priority though not exclusive use of the Belview container terminal.</P>
    <P>Thus it can be seen that the agreement will underwrite all the outgoings on the borrowings which Waterford Harbour Commissioners could not have undertaken out of their own income of approximately £1.5 million per annum.  If traffic falls off for reasons other than <i>force majeure</i> or if Bells decide not to continue <Col N="1320" /> using Waterford, they would still be legally bound to meet the capital and interest repayments.  Without the agreement Waterford Harbour Commissioners would not be in a position to undertake the project on their own because of their present financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the agreement also provides that Bells will continue to enjoy the use of the existing container terminal, the Frank Cassin Wharf.  Of importance here is the fact that the management and operational structures currently in place at the Frank Cassin Wharf and which have been so successful, will continue.  Once Bells transfer their operations to Belview, the Frank Cassin Wharf will be available to other container operators and both Waterford Harbour Commissioners and Bells are anxious to attract such operators to this wharf.</P>
    <P>The original proposal was that the project, apart from any EC aid secured, would be funded jointly by Waterford Harbour Commissioners and Bells.  The financing arrangement concluded by both parties was not acceptable to the EIB or lending institutions at home.  Attempts by the commissioners to secure borrowings without a State guarantee for all or part of the proposed borrowings were unsuccessful. The Harbours Acts do not provide for borrowings by harbour authorities to be guaranteed by the State. In the absence of such a provision in the Acts a guarantee can only be provided under the State Guarantee Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>Bell Lines have been associated with Waterford harbour since the 1960s and have spearheaded the drive to make lo-lo more cost effective nationally. During all that time Bell Lines have achieved all the projected growth figures they have given Waterford Harbour Commissioners and they have also fully honoured all their financial obligations to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The financial viability of Waterford Harbour Commissioners is heavily dependent on Bells continued association <Col N="1321" /> with the port.  Ownership of the Belview site is vested in Waterford Harbour Commissioners; likewise, ownership of the new wharf, cranes and on-shore facilities will be vested in the commissioners.  Bells will be required to pay harbour rates to the commissioners and the Bell operation will continue to be subject to full compliance with the by-laws of the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The established policy is that each harbour authority, including Waterford, should be operated as a commercial undertaking and should be financially self-supporting.  Harbour authorities should conduct their affairs so as to ensure that revenues are not less than sufficient to remunerate capital and repay borrowings.  The proposal now before the House is that the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, be amended so that borrowings by Waterford Harbour Commissioners can be guaranteed by the State.  This exceptional measure is warranted, in view of the significance of Waterford port, its impressive track record, and its unique place in efficient lo-lo development, which, of course, is crucial to the development of our exports.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to recommend that borrowings of £10 million by Waterford Harbour Commissioners be guaranteed by the State because of the scale of the Belview project &mdash; total investment will amount to in excess of £20 million.  The project is important from the point of view of improvements to overall access transport infrastructure.  It will reduce by one hour the sailing time between Waterford harbour and UK and continental ports and thus reduce costs to importers and exporters.  I am satisfied that without such a guarantee the project will not proceed.  The Government will only be called upon to honour the guarantee in the event that Bells fail to meet their commitments to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Belview harbour development plan is being strongly supported for EC aid &mdash; EC aid of £7.5 million has already <Col N="1322" /> been approved in principle and further EC aid is under consideration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am strongly of the view that the national advantage dictates the development of Waterford port.  This view has been confirmed by an independent evaluation recently commissioned by my Department on the financial aspects of the project.</P>
    <P>The project is now ready to go.  The Dáil has given it total and unanimous approval and will welcome the start of the project as early as possible.  We understand that the project can be completed and up and running by the end of next year.  This is a tremendous development when you consider all the new facilities which are being provided in Belview.</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows the site &mdash; I see some Senators here who would know it very well &mdash; will know that the location is an excellent one.  It will make a huge difference to Waterford port and will very greatly increase and improve our access to the Single Market, to Europe and, of course, to the UK.  If this guarantee is accepted by the House tonight, it would be my intention to arrange for the signature of the guarantee tomorrow.  Once that is done, Waterford Harbour Commissioners will be in a position to award contracts valued at £11.2 million for which they have already had tenders.</P>
    <P>They are finalising their negotiations with the European Investment Bank in connection with the £10 million borrowings. Once these are finalised, details will have to be forwarded to us and the borrowing will have to be sanctioned by me, as Minister for the Marine, and by the Minister for Finance in accordance with the 1946 Harbours Act.  In tandem with this the guarantee would be signed by the Department of Finance.  We can move immediately and directly into operation and the project can go ahead in a very short time span if this motion is approved by the House tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion, although it is controversial in a certain sense.  In recent years the Government got their fingers burnt in many areas of semi-State activity by providing letters of comfort and through State guarantees.  A principle has recently been adopted by the Government that, for the future, State investments are to be in viable projects which can stand, on their own merits, without letters of comfort or State guarantees in the background.</P>
      <P>This proposal is unusual in the context of stated Government policy.  We on this side of the House support this proposal. At the end of his speech the Minister stated very bluntly that, in his view and in the view of the Department, without a Government guarantee, this project would not exist.  This is the rough cutting edge.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that various loan applications were made, presumably to lending institutions in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, and were all unsuccessful because the State guarantee did not obtain.  The project, in an Irish context, is very large.  Waterford has been one of the most successful harbour developments in Ireland.  Dublin port, in terms of activities, has had a death wish because traffic is turning to other ports on the east coast including ports in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The container traffic development in Waterford has been most successful and Bells have participated very successfully in it.  This is evidenced by the extent of container traffic in the Republic going through Waterford, namely, in excess of 30 per cent of traffic.  Assessments for the year 2005, which is not as distant as it seems, only 12½ years from now &mdash; indicate that we are going to see a doubling of estimated capacity.  This plan allows additional berthage loading of three vessels at the same time, increasing the capacity of ships which can be handled from 12,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes, and we are looking at this against a background of substantial European Community <Col N="1324" /> funds coming in.  It is Hobson's Choice, given that there is a crucial need to expand the size of the port facilities and that there is a commercial entity like Bells who are prepared to do the task effectively.  We are left with no option.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that while the commissioners have issued letters of intent to successful tenders, contracts have not been awarded because certain necessary formalities have not been completed. A financial package for the project still has to be finalised and &mdash; I find this a little controversial &mdash; the commissioners have not yet executed an agreement with Bell Lines, the intended main user of Belview, where Bells will effectively undertake to service commercial borrowings of up to £10 million by the commissioners.  I wonder if in a sense this measure before the House is not a little premature.  It seems to be commercially very unusual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my viewpoint and I am entitled to express it.  It is a little premature, in the sense that this is a commercial company with a commercial interest in this project.  This project seems to be at a very advanced stage and apparently there is not yet an agreement with the people who are going to use this facility commercially.  I would have thought there should have been agreement before this matter came before the Oireachtas for resolution.  Having said that, and on broad principle, I am unhappy about the State guarantees, but taking horses for courses and looking at this particular issue, the facts we are faced with are supportive of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike my colleague on the other side, who is entitled to his opinion, may I say that I fully support what the Minister is doing here this evening and I think we should get this measure through the House so as that the maximum progress may be made in the <Col N="1325" /> minimum time.  My only disappointment is that it happens to be at the Kilkenny-Waterford side of the river and I live on the Wexford side.  However, I expect it to yield some benefits for the people of Wexford.</P>
      <P>Waterford harbour and its commercial viability go back a long way.  In fact, I think I am the only one living overlooking Waterford Harbour, I live under the shadow of the Hook lighthouse, the oldest lighthouse in Europe.  I was kept awake many nights by the beam of light crossing the window every three seconds. As far back as the seventh century monks on the Hook Point lit bushfires to warn shipping entering Waterford harbour. The Hook lighthouse was built in the 11th century.  I am putting these points before the House because it is important to show that for many generations, indeed centuries, Waterford harbour has been the commercial lifeblood of that area.</P>
      <P>It became famous, of course, with the arrival of the Normans in 1170 at Baginbun. I am sure not too many know the origin of the expressions &ldquo;by hook or by crook&rdquo;.  Arriving with the Normans in May 1170 came Strongbow, whose name was Richard FitzGilbert de Clare. Strongbow went from Baginbun to Waterford.  He said he was going to take Waterford &ldquo;by Hook or by Crook&rdquo;&mdash; Crook is a small village at the other side of the river.  My colleague, Senator Cullen, will be well aware of that.  Strongbow did take Waterford by &ldquo;Hook or by Crook&rdquo;, and his payment was marriage to Aoife McMurrough.  That is a little bit of history that will help to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I want all to bear in mind how important Waterford harbour has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going briefly through the Minister's speech, I accept wholeheartedly that Waterford harbour is one of Ireland's premier commercial ports.  That is mainly because of its proximity to Europe.  It is <Col N="1326" /> essential to develop Waterford harbour because of our peripheral location.  In the past the south-east has not fared as well as it might have done.  I am delighted to see now that the Government are guaranteeing a loan.  I accept what the Minister said, that if the loan were not guaranteed it is quite possible this project would fall.</P>
    <P>The Waterford project is the largest port project in the programme.  While I accept this fully, and I am very pleased about it, it concerns me to note that New Ross port is only just up river and I sincerely hope the viability of New Ross port will not be affected by this project. While saying that, I repeat that I totally support this project.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it is intended to win back some of the substantial Republic of Ireland traffic that moved to Northern Ireland ports.  I ask the Minister to examine why the cost of shipping in the south-east, through Rosslare and through Waterford, is so much greater than through Larne.  I know, and I am sure other Senators from the south-east will know, that industries with an export capacity have lost out because of this.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to take a very careful look at this.</P>
    <P>I am obviously concerned about the effect this project might have on New Ross.  I want to make specific mention of the four groynes on the south side of the river which the Minister mentioned in his speech and about which the New Ross Harbour Commissioners are concerned. There is no question of an objection, but we want to be sure that the groynes that will be put in place will not affect the shipping lane to New Ross, which is already hampered by both the Barrow bridge and the Pink Rock, two items I will mention very shortly.</P>
    <P>I notice that the rail and road links to Belview will also qualify for EC aid and I am anxious to know if the Barrow railway bridge will qualify for aid.  I will put the House in the picture regarding the Barrow bridge.  The opening span has to <Col N="1327" /> open every time a ship goes up river to New Ross and back.  The opening span is very narrow.  Many times in the fairly recent past we have had collisions with the structure, and in the past year CIE spent £1 million making repairs.  The obvious answer is to widen the span.  I am anxious to know if some of the aid mentioned here could help CIE to widen the span on the Barrow bridge and so remove one of the bottlenecks to New Ross port.  I hope the Minister will respond to that.  Like Waterford, New Ross has grown substantially in the past. Both ports have operated closely together even though they are within 16 miles of one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, but you will understand that I live close to this area and I want to ensure that both New Ross and Waterford can prosper together.  The tonnage through New Ross has grown from 852,000 tonnes in 1986 to 954,000 in 1991.  I want to see that continue.  I want the Minister to assure me that New Ross will not be affected to the detriment of the port by the obvious success of Waterford.</P>
      <P>Because of pressure being put on me by the Acting Chairman I will now close. I would like to say to the Minister again that we are delighted to see this kind of activity in the south east.  It will benefit Wexford, with the new road to Waterford and with the ferry across the river.  I am pleading with the Minister to ensure that New Ross port will continue to prosper, because it is indispensable to the economic viability of New Ross town.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the motion and congratulate Waterford on this development, which <Col N="1328" /> will cost in excess of £20 million.  It is a very important development in that we must recognise that the extension and development of our trade with the EC and worldwide is bound up with the growth in our economy.  I would like to congratulate Waterford in their initiative and wish them well.  I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to another port which is expanding quite dramatically.  I refer of course to the port of Foynes, in which I am sure the Acting Chairman will have considerable interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In designating Foynes as a local rather than a commercial port, I believe the Government have effectively downgraded its status which will seriously inhibit its development I would like to take this opportunity of discussing it with the new Minister.  I call on him to immediately reverse the decision of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Operational Programme on Peripherality the Government clearly state that the strategy will be to promote investment in commercial ports like Waterford rather than in the local ports, in which category Foynes is designated. In fact, Foynes has not been selected by <Col N="1329" /> the Government for priority investment. This is a big disappointment to us in Limerick.  As a member of Foynes Harbour Trustees I am very disappointed with the decision of the report on peripherality in regard to this.  It states that &ldquo;development of these key ports is designed to ensure that services and facilities available to Irish exporters are upgraded so that they do not suffer any further competitive disadvantage in relation to their European counterparts, particularly in the areas of access transport&rdquo;. Foynes is not designated as a key port and is excluded from this.  That infers that Foynes will suffer further competitive disadvantage in relation to its European counterparts.</P>
    <P>The report also states that &ldquo;in order to improve the efficiency of those key ports it will be part of the development strategy to discourage the tendency towards the fragmentation of routes and services&rdquo;.  I do not accept that the improvement of ports such as Foynes will lead to fragmentation of routes and services.  Foynes should develop in unison with all the other commercial ports.  It has the facility to do so.  It draws its cargo from all parts of Ireland, from Donegal to Louth to Dublin.  I believe it should be designated as a commercial port, should receive the same attention and the same development, and have a much broader role than just an internal commercial port.  In the interests of my colleagues from Kilkenny and Waterford, I will now sit down.  I am serious about this matter and I hope to take up the issue with the Minister at a later stage.  Thank you very much for your indulgence, Sir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, as somebody from the City of Waterford and born and reared there, I am anxious to get in on this debate.  With regard to the Minister's appointment, I am personally delighted that somebody of his calibre will look after the Department of the Marine. With no disrespect to his predecessors, I believe that a new, visionary, effective <Col N="1330" /> and decision-making approach is needed in the interests of what we are discussing here this evening and in the interests of our fishing industry in particular.  I have already noted the activities of the Minister in this area.  The keen interest he has already shown is lifting the hearts of many people directly involved in marine matters, and particularly in the fishing industry.  I want to put that on record.  I do not in any way mean to be patronising. I mean it most genuinely.  We look forward to working with the Minister.</P>
      <P>Obviously the State Guarantees Act we are discussing this evening is an essential ingredient for the construction of the new facility in Waterford.  I am in a unique position in being from the city: I live next door to the existing terminal and I know how noisy it is.  My family have been directly involved in the port of Waterford since the turn of the century and are still actively involved in shipping &mdash; not in the Bell Ferry Shipping Company, I might add, so there is no conflict of interest when I speak here this evening.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, this project has been on hand now for practically 12 months.  It has taken some time to get to the position where the State Guarantees Act, 1954, would be amended to facilitate this very important project.  In economic terms &mdash; and what we are talking about this evening is from the point of view of the island of Ireland and not just the Republic of Ireland &mdash; this port will be a great boost to all companies exporting lo-lo traffic from this country.  It is clear that even to put a TEU on a train from Belfast to Waterford, have it loaded and brought to the port of Rotterdam is faster, more efficient and more cost effective than it is by going through the land-bridge through the UK, whether you go through Northern Ireland or the port of Dublin.  That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here in terms of improving the efficiency of the Irish economy. One of the greatest problems we have is the cost of transport out of this country <Col N="1331" /> and anything that can help exporters reduce those costs can, unquestionably, help to increase employment in this country. That is why facilities like those we are talking about here this evening are such an essential ingredient in an overall national economic strategy that benefits not just Waterford or the south-east but has a national impact on the wellbeing of the economy.  I hope the delays in getting this legislation through for this project will not hinder any other projects.  It is essential that we have an efficiency level second to none, with less bureaucracy, to expedite matters of this kind which can have a huge impact on how we do business in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, quite rightly, outlined the importance of this port.  I want to reassure him and the other Senators who have spoken that it is not just a question that we are realising existing potential in this new development.  It is already clearly established that we are now over 50 per cent in excess of the existing capacity of the Frank Cassin wharf with traffic already being deferred. The potential for this port will be realisable long before we reach the year 2005. When the Government signed the agreement with the EC establishing Waterford as the key lo-lo port to Europe, they recognised that it was not just something for Waterford or the south-east but that it was a strategic decision taken in the interests of the development of this country. This is the consistent view that should be taken, rather than being parochial when Ministers are appointed from different counties and seeking to disadvantage other areas for no other reason than the assumption that it is good business or good politics to be seen to be pushing something, whether it is commercially viable or not.  We need to get away from that attitude.</P>
    <P>I believe this project will give rise to a fresh new approach.  I have no doubt this port within a very short space of time will be in need of further expansion.  I ask the <Col N="1332" /> Minister and his Department not to see this development as an end in itself.  This should be the beginning of a strategic development.  In the south-east, based in Rosslare, we have the passenger terminal for Europe and for the UK out of this country.  It is clear that the parallel lo-lo development of the Waterford port at Belview brings to the south-east a degree of investment and recognition which in itself can meet many of the country's needs.  I want to see continued development in the south-east now that we have established on both fronts the key need for such projects to be developed further.</P>
    <P>I would also say to the Minister not to forget that Waterford is not just potentially a port for lo-lo traffic; there is also potential there &mdash; indeed it was part of the original outline plan &mdash; for bulk cargo.  This could be potentially facilitated in an expanded port development in that area.  If it is true that on lo-lo traffic we can achieve the efficiencies already demonstrated, then surely we should be able to do something similar with regard to bulk cargo traffic as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that when this draft order will be signed tomorrow we will be able to expedite the beginning of this project.  One of the Senators was concerned in regard to New Ross.  I do not see in this development any conflict or any diminution of the potential of New Ross port.  I believe it is unique in that it handles certain bulk cargoes very efficiently and the development of lo-lo traffic does not in any way conflict with the development of New Ross port.  As the need for cost effectiveness grows and greater volumes and larger ships are needed for us to be competitive on a European scale, both the inner port in Waterford and the inner port in New Ross may eventually find themselves, in regard to bulk cargo, located together downriver as an extension of this Belview project.  If that happens and if it brings benefit to both areas, let us not be afraid to face the challenge and those developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> I spoke earlier about the island of Ireland benefiting from this development. Infrastructural developments are also needed to ensure that that possibility is maximised by having a fast and efficient rail link right down the east coast to this port.  The rail tracks are already there, they run down the east coast but we need more investment in this line to make it more efficient for a faster delivery to this port area.</P>
    <P>I know my colleague from Kilkenny, Senator Lanigan, is anxious to speak on this matter.  I welcome the speed with which the Minister has dealt with this motion.  I look forward to the other developments on a broader front which the Minister will undoubtedly initiate in his Department and I also look forward to a very prosperous, active time in all areas of the marine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the Minister or the House.  However, there are a few matters I would like to raise, because County Kilkenny is also involved.  A number of points have to be covered &mdash; the local point of view, the regional point of view, the national point of view and the European point of view. If Ireland is to become a major participant in the EC we will have to take account of our peripherality, and that is by having direct access.  Mention has not been made of the fact that the Channel Tunnel will be opening very shortly.  If we do not have efficient transportation from Ireland directly to the mainland of Europe there is no point in talking about peripherality, because we will no longer be a nation of exporters but will be left totally on our own.  Unless we develop our communications we will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of this site took place as a result of a joint venture between the IDA and Kilkenny County Council many years ago.  The site became available as a result of that past co-operation.  I must give thanks to John Clancy, the new general manager of the Harbour Commissioners in Waterford, for the fantastic <Col N="1334" /> work on this project over the past number of years; but it should not be forgotten that Kilkenny County Council were involved in the planning and there were many problems associated with the site in terms of linkage to main roads and so on.</P>
    <P>There is mention of a £3 million road link to the Belview site.  That £3 million is being spent on a Euro-link between Waterford and New Ross and a small link from the Waterford-New Ross Euro-link down to the port; but unfortunately we have major problems associated with road linkage to that site.  The only one way you can get to Cork by road from that site is across the only bridge over the Suir and you have to go through Waterford city to get to Cork.  Therefore, if we are serious about access to that site by road, we are going to have to take into account that another bridge will have to be built across the Suir.  It is essential that there be co-operation from the Departments of the Marine, Environment and Finance to insist that there is a proper linkage from Kilkenny to Waterford and that as part of that development there will be a second bridge to give proper access to Cork from this new port facility.</P>
    <P>If this is going to be a Euro terminal for lo-lo transport there will have to be proper road access to the west from this port.  If you want to get to the west from this port at present you have to go into Waterford city and then across the worst road system in Ireland from New Ross. It is hazardous in the extreme for trucks used for lo-lo traffic.  If we are serious on this issue we also have to provide proper rail links from Dublin to Waterford and from Cork to this facility.  I am not making up difficulties, but I am suggesting that there are major difficulties to be overcome.</P>
    <P>The commercial aspects of this project have been mentioned.  Let it be said that the investment is not a direct investment; it is a guarantee that if everything went wrong the State would guarantee certain things.  The State is not going to <Col N="1335" /> pour good money after bad but will ensure we have one of the only ways we can get to Europe with a lo-lo facility.  It has to be here and the Government have to provide the State guarantee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staunton asked about the banks.  Regrettably the lending institutions were not prepared to provide the guarantees and make the borrowings available without a State guarantee.  The guarantee was required by the European <Col N="1336" /> Investment Bank and, at the end of the day, there was no other way for the project to go ahead.  I accept what has been said, but given the amount of money provided by way of EC grants together with the arrangements Bells made, etc., it was seen as a package which should have been accepted by the lending institutions. Regrettably that was not the case.</P>
    <P>I am confident that things will move quickly to complete the different elements.  Senator Byrne gave the history of Waterord port and I am very conscious of that.  One fact the Senator did not mention was that many merchant navy men went all around the world from Waterford port and if you look at Reginalds Tower you will see that they went to Canada and Newfoundland.  They were outgoing people.</P>

      <P>Senator Byrne was worried about the groynes and made a reasonable point.  We will watch that.  A foreshore licence is required and we will examine all aspects of the groynes.  They are intended to deepen the water harbour and will make a huge difference.  We will have to make sure that this project will not adversely affect New Ross.  The Senator can be assured of that.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the bridge and other links.  An application from the New Ross Harbour Commissioners for EC aid towards the cost of widening the spans of Barrow bridge would fall to be considered in the post-1993 programme. That is something we will follow up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville raised the question of Foynes.  I am quite familiar with that because on New Year's Day I was loading beef there for Russia.  There were great workers there who did a tremendous job. They would get money under the aid for local ports as Foynes is included in the programme for local ports.  A certain amount of money has been provided and <Col N="1337" /> no doubt development will continue there.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cullen and others for their welcome.  This is a tremendous project, especially if you realise that we can look forward to this 450 metre development with all the ancillary facilities.  It is a wonderful development.  It is very much part of the overall strategy of access to Europe and I accept what was said by several Senators in that regard.  Access to Europe is crucial for us.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the point made by Senator Cullen about the efficiency in Waterford port regarding lo-lo containers and the fact that so many people were coming from Belfast to Waterford for that service.  We are told that the new facilities should be ready by the end of next year, which is a tremendous development and one we would like to see go ahead urgently.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Lanigan, we need direct access.  Once the Channel tunnel is open we will be the only island nation in the Community and the EC must assist us.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful for all the contributions made.  I welcome the fact that Senators came here this evening to ensure that this motion would be passed. We can move on rapidly now to get the project under way.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State but I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is not here.  However, I am sure the Minister of State will pass on what I say to him.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1338" /> to rescind the decision of the Minister for Energy to grant a licence for the felling of 323 trees in Tomnafinnoge Wood, Coolattin Estate, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I know this part of the country extremely well and that is why I have a personal interest in it.  Many other people are also interested in it.  It is a very beautiful part of the country.  I have visited it over the past 20 years, and noticed even as late as last Sunday, how the beautiful forests are disappearing.  Other people fought against this.  My two colleagues, Deputies Jacob and Roche, have worked very hard to ensure that further erosion of the woods does not take place.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Energy at the time, Deputy Smith, stopped some of the tree felling.  It is a matter of great regret that recently a licence was granted to fell a further 323 trees.</P>
      <P>The reason people are so concerned was summed up very well for me when I visited there last Sunday.  I said to somebody that these woods are part of our heritage.  They have a very important place in our history and for future generations. I said that to grant a licence to cut down these trees is like telling somebody they can knock down a Georgian square.  One of the people with me said &ldquo;No, you are wrong.  It is like giving a licence to knock down the last Georgian square&rdquo;.  This is why I feel so strongly about it.  Tomnafinnoge Wood is the last original Irish oakwood and that point cannot be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has visited the area, I do not know if he has seen the beauty of it and the destruction of other parts of the wood.  I can arrange for him to see Tomnafinnoge Wood and also see all the other woods like Brow Wood.  He can then come back and tell us if he is happy with what has happened and with the way Bridgefarm Company are undertaking the felling and replanting of these trees.  This is not a personal thing.  I just believe the Minister, for one reason or another, is being told that something is <Col N="1339" /> happening and I am not too sure if he is getting the full story.  Tomnafinnoge Wood is the last remnant of the oak-woods once blanketing the Watson Wentworth estate which during the 17th and 18th Centuries comprise of virtually all of south Wicklow: 56,000 plantation acres or 37,000 hectares in all.  The property passed to Earl Fitzwilliam in 1782.  Estate documents survived and have been researched and published which provide a continuous and detailed record of native wood management in south Wicklow throughout the 18th Century. These estate records include coppice and scrub wood surveys at the beginning of the 17th Century.  The survey shows, and I quote their researcher, Melvyn Jones of Sheffield City Polytechnic, that the woods concentrated in Shillelagh and Rathdrum.</P>
    <P>Represented the remnants of a much more extensive woodland cover and had been cleared relatively recently.  A survey of 1656, for example, gave a figure of 5,609 plantation acres of woodland in Shillelagh alone... Besides the coppices and scrub woods there were also the famous Shillelagh oaks in the deer park at Coolattin, numbering 2,150 according to the survey of 1728, when they were described as &ldquo;the glory and ornament of the kingdom of Ireland&rdquo; and valued at £8,317.</P>
    <P>It has been established that Tomnafinnoge Wood, like all other former woods in this area, was managed by the &ldquo;coppicing with standards&rdquo; method. When a broadleafed tree is felled or falls over, it does not usually die but undergoes a remarkable regeneration.  Bereft of its branches, the root system channels all its energy into regrowth.  New shoots quickly sprout and grow straight and true towards the sunlight.  That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>I was there on Sunday and the trees that have been planted are not growing <Col N="1340" /> straight and true to the sunlight.  They are not fenced in as they should be.  Some of the area is used for deer hunting and the hunters sit on tall seats so that when the deer come out to graze they can shoot them.  The tops of many young trees that were planted have been eaten by deer. Their growth is stunted and the replanting programme, for example in Brow Wood, at this stage is becoming a farce.</P>
    <P>This type of growth results in a crop of many useful poles from a single stump. Coppicing harnesses this natural process to produce a regular supply of certain types of timber in various forms.  There is evidence that alder trees may have been coppiced in England as early as 3,000 B.C. and by the Middle Ages the technique of coppicing with standards was established.  In this system, standards such as oak or elm were allowed to mature alongside the coppiced wood.</P>
    <P>The Watson Wentworth estate records show that cutting cycles varied from 16 to 33 years with an average cycle of 25 years.  The Melvyn Jones study reports that each fall of underwood standards usually consisted of a large number of young trees, wavers of about 20 years of age, presumably saplings or single poles retained from coppice stools together with a small number of more mature trees grown on through a number of coppice cycles.  The wavers were thinned at later falls leaving a few selected trees to reach full maturity.  The proportion of wavers to black barks varied.  The 1748 scheme stipulated that in each fall 10 black barks and 50 wavers per plantation acre would be left.</P>
    <P>Hence we see that rather than using a system of felling and replanting, our forebears found it is much more economical and efficient to impose a system of coppicing on already existing woodland. Woods were felled particularly where the soil was good and desired for tillage but in the case of such a splendid wood as Tomnafinnoge, whose history is so well documented, we have living trees, reproducing trees, embodying an unbroken <Col N="1341" /> lineage extending deep into Ireland's past.  When we consider the long-lived results of these traditional silvicultural practices which include careful fencing and ditching to prevent animal intrusion and grazing in coppices it seems the present day experts in the Department of Energy should feel humbled that all they can come up with is a plan that would leave us with one tree out of ten by the year 2,000.</P>
    <P>Incidentally Brow Wood, known in the 18th Century as Thickson's Brow, was in 1728 just a scrub wood but it was converted into a coppice by the estate managers who noted that &ldquo;if well reserved and fenced will make as good a springe if not the best in Shillelagh&rdquo;.  By our century Brow Wood had developed into one of the finest oak woodlands in the area but it fell under the chainsaw a few years ago and under current management practices it has reverted to scrub status.</P>
    <P>The Department say they are happy with what has happened and that Bridgefarm Company will undertake to do the replanting very well.  In 1986, the Bridgefarm Company applied for planning permission to cut down trees in Brow Wood and stated:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to extract the specified trees which are fully mature.  All are shown on the attached list and constitute only approximately 25 per cent of the total number of trees in this particular area.  The remaining trees will be retained and interplanted with two year old oaks.  This should ensure that the character of the wood can be preserved which otherwise would not be possible if the mature trees began to rot and fall over...</P>
    <P>Our replanting programme at Coolattin is well on target.  We have succeeded in planting 200 acres in 1985...</P>
    <P>The Department of Botany in Trinity College carried out a private study and said that approximately 10 per cent is <Col N="1342" /> actually planted.  In other words, they have only planted 10 per cent of oak trees and the rest are evergreens.  They have not maintained the character of the woods: they have totally destroyed it.  In the past two weeks a private report was made by an expert on Coolattin Wood with Tomnafinnoge Wood obviously in mind.</P>
    <P>The report stated that any woodland can be looked at in terms of (1), commercial venture: (2) amenity; (3) ecological value, wildlife, etc.  The promotion of any of the above as a primary aim will result in a management difference in both types and intensity. On that basis valued judgments can vary enormously and should only be accepted when the context in which they are made is clear.  This contribution recognises that the whole woodlands are at least of unique amenity, historical and ecological value.</P>
    <P>As regard health and maturity, the report stated that the overwhelmining majority of the trees are in exceptional health.  Most are approaching or have reached maturity, a state in which an oak can remain for 100 years.  Very few display the classic signs of over-maturity such as shedding of limbs, cavities, die back in crown, epicormic growth, etc. From a wildlife point of view a much higher percentage of dying and dead trees would be preferable.  The author of the report said he saw few trees subject to wind blow and that those were in particular waterlogged areas.  With regard to danger to the public the report stated given the above, the charge of danger to the public is hard to sustain.  The report said that most of the oak would be more than acceptable in any Dublin park.  A tree is only dangerous if there is a target, for example, pedestrians, houses, etc. Given the probable frequency of visitors to this woodland in strong weather it must be assumed that the risk factor is very low.</P>
    <P>On planting and monitoring, the report said replanting is offered a mitigating or <Col N="1343" /> a minority measure in the event of the trees being felled.  It said that in the Brow Hill area replanting after the last felling the following is evident &mdash; no effective fencing, many young trees cropped by deer, elevated heights suggest deer are actually encouraged; (2) rampant invasion by laurel with no obvious attempt to clear it &mdash; some invasion by rhododendrons; (3) a very slow growth rate on most young trees suggesting a lack of weeding on a programmed basis; (4) intermingled and sporadic planting of conifer not obviously nursery trees &mdash; this suggests no clear policy on whether oak or conifer woodland is the preferred aim; (5) rabbits; and (6) invasion by willow and birch uncurtailed.  The report commented that if the replanting of Brow Hill is representative of the general attempt to replant, then a lack of confidence in the monitoring procedure and the success of replanting would be a reasonable stance.</P>
    <P>The report stated that in Scotland, on some sites attempts to regenerate oak forests after felling have failed due to a rise in the water table.  It is postulated that with the removal of the trees and the huge transpiration of water the soil has been left too water-logged for oak to grow.  It said the appearance of willow and birch on Brow Hill suggests this as a definite possibility at least worthy of investigation before felling permission is given.  The report said it makes sense to allow the woodlands remain and take advantage of periodic dry years to seed naturally.  Any deep drainage in the area would on the other hand, affect the mature trees.  The drying out of land after clear felling is associated with subtropical areas rather than wet temperature zones.</P>
    <P>The report said it is accepted that virtually no oak woodland in Britain or Ireland is natural.  However, many woodlands have evolved from the natural woodland and for this reason are of special ecological worth.  According to the report it is too simplistic to say they <Col N="1344" /> were planted as a crop and should be harvested as a crop.  The report stated that in Britain, woodlands are categorised as: (1) ancient, grown naturally since 1600; (2) ancient semi-natural woodlands, regenerating on ancient woodland sites; (3) recent semi-natural 130 years of natural succession; and (4) recent, planted and managed in the last 150 years.  It said that in ecological terms categories (1) and (2) cannot be recreated once they are destroyed.  Before felling permission is given, an investigation of historical documentation and ecological study should be made in determining the exact nature of these woodlands and the appropriate type and intensity of management.</P>
    <P>The report commented that many of the question raised are outside the field of a forester or any one profession.  Many developments of much less environmental impact now require an Environmental Impact Study.  They can be made at the discretion and direction of the Minister for the Environment.  Only an EIS would supply the information to make a balanced decision on this site.  It said the right to full explanation of an asset is curtailed on various grounds in many aspects of Irish business life, that Coolattin could be deemed a special case and the same criteria could be applied. The report said the owner could realise the value of this asset by selling the land and trees to the Office of Public Works or to a private foundation.  The price would be based on the real market value of the trees rather than a hypothetical valuation, long term lease of sale to the Office of Public Works or Wicklow County Council, or the sale lease of amenity use and control of woodlands to the above.  It said a tree preservation order excluding the above option may get around constitutional obstruction.</P>
    <P>Given the past record of the Bridgefarm Company I would have strong reservations about trusting them to do the work they say they will do.  The matter should be fully investigated.  I am amazed <Col N="1345" /> that this has happened.  The trees they have planted are <i>quercus robur</i>, an English oak.  The trees which were originally there were Irish oak which do much better on acid soil.  The <i>quercus robur</i> do not do well on acid soil.  The oaks they have planted are of such poor quality they will never regenerate into the kind of oak forest that is there at present.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to rescind this order and let people use this wood.  We talk about urban renewal but what about rural renewal?</P>
    <P>Visitors could come and look at the wildlife and life cycle of an original Irish oak wood.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the benefits that could accrue to the local population around Coolattin and Tinahealy.  All these trees are exported to Germany.  Fifteen miles of oak have been exported to that country; not one single full-time job has been created.</P>
    <P>If we were to set up a business and fell these trees in an orderly fashion we could manufacture very fine furniture. Recently Gay Byrne on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; had a programme on newly established Irish businesses.  What surprised me was the number of small furniture companies in Cork and other places who were exporting to Scandinavia, one of the most difficult markets in the world.  If we were to set up small furniture factories around Coolattin and use oakwood we could create many jobs and protect something that has been handed down from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government to stop the felling of these trees.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Molloy, is in America and that is why he cannot be here tonight.  As I said, it is not a personal thing.  I do not believe that the Minister, if he visited the site, would agree to what has happened and what could take place in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I <Col N="1346" /> want to make it clear that there is no disagreement that Tomnafinnoge Wood in Coolattin, County Wicklow, is without doubt a place of great interest and an outstanding local amenity.  It is the Minister for Energy's position that the rejuvenation and regeneration of this woodland requires active management, including felling.  Doing nothing is not an option if the woodland is to be preserved and developed for future generations. Simply leaving it as it is will result in further deterioration.</P>
      <P>The wood is a plantation which was laid down by man rather than a natural woodland and it has been downgraded over many decades.  This has come about in two ways.  First, the repeated selective harvesting of the better trees over a long period this century has left a residue of poorer quality, overmature trees.  Secondly, the advancing age of the trees, up to 250 years, has rendered them physically moribund, and indeed dangerous at times and will curtail the future lifespan of these trees.</P>
      <P>Natural regeneration has in places given rise to a considerable understory of immature trees, saplings and seedlings. These need to be released from overhead competition if they are to thrive and help to form the next mature generation.  The plan, which I will outline later, builds on this unique feature of this woodland. Remedial action is needed elsewhere too as for example, where rhododendron is growing in the wood and which, if not treated, will spread, thus eliminating other ground vegetation, preventing regeneration and making the area inaccessible.</P>
      <P>The objective in the programme which has been approved by the Minister for Energy who is at present in the United States, is to preserve and improve the woodland while recognising that individual trees have matured and will be felled and replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the decision to grant licence is that the areas were subject to a tree preservation order made by <Col N="1347" /> Wicklow County Council covering Coolattin. In 1985, the owners applied to the council to fell trees within the area known as Tomnafinnoge.  On 19 May 1987, Wicklow County Council granted a consent to fell under the tree preservation order and the owners subsequently gave formal notice to the Minister for Energy under the Forestry Acts of their intention to fell 2,137 trees at Tomnafinnoge in accordance with the council's consent. The Minister for Energy exercised his option to prohibit the felling to enable the proposal to be fully examined.</P>
    <P>There followed an extended period during which considerable field work was undertaken at Tomnafinnoge by the professional staff of the Forest Service of the Department of Energy.  Arising from this and following extensive discussion with the applicant and discussions with Wicklow County Council, a forestry management programme based on what is known as the group felling system was agreed.</P>
    <P>The objective of the programme is to achieve the regeneration and rejuvenation of Tomnafinnoge Wood with minimal disruption of landscape and amenity values.  It involves felling only over-mature trees over an extended period.  Younger trees, as I have already mentioned, will be left to form the next generation.  In addition, replanting with broadleaf trees will be undertaken where necessary so that the woodland is fully stocked with growing trees.</P>
    <P>It is essential to outline what exactly is involved in this programme, bearing in mind that while the overall plan has been agreed in principle its implementation will only be sanctioned by licence on an annual basis thus ensuring that each stage is satisfactorily completed before moving to the next.</P>
    <P>The group felling system involves cutting over-mature trees in scattered patches each covering less than 0.5 hectare, 1.2 acres, and replanting where the existing stock of younger trees is inadequate <Col N="1348" /> thus avoiding the sudden impact caused by clear-felling of an extensive area.  Regeneration of the whole wood is prolonged by extending the timing of the group removals.</P>
    <P>In the case of Tomnafinnoge, the whole area has been divided into three equal blocks and it is proposed that necessary felling be carried out in three separate phases.  If each phase is carried out in the shortest possible time the process will take at least ten years to cover the entire woodland.</P>
    <P>The first phase would be spread over a period of three years.  In year one, about two-fifths of the total number of over-mature trees in the first block will be removed in groups leaving the remainder. I wish to emphasise that only over-mature trees will be felled, the considerable under-story of younger trees and saplings will be preserved.  All areas not already fully stocked by natural regeneration will be replanted with broadleaf species, mainly oak.</P>
    <P>The whole process will be repeated in the second block in the following year. The third block will be treated similarly in the third year.  Felling will then cease for a year to ensure the replanted areas are properly established before the next cycle begins.  The final phase will start at the earliest, in year nine, and be spread over two years.</P>
    <P>At the end of this period about 10 per cent of the original mature trees will still remain together with all existing immature trees, young growth and the newly planted crop which will by then cover the remaining ground.  Suggestions that the wood will be devastated are without foundation.  References to the removal of 90 per cent of the trees refer only to the over-mature trees and ignore the significant numbers of younger trees. These will not be felled but will be specifically preserved.  These proposals are in full harmony with good forestry practice and, if agreed by the county council and implemented, will lead to a rejuvenation and regeneration of Tomnafinnoge <Col N="1349" /> Wood with a spread of trees of different ages and a more balanced growth cycle than is now the case.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that on 13 December 1991 the Minister for Energy issued a licence to the owners to fell 323 trees under the first phase of the management programme.  The prohibition order issued in 1987 remains in force in respect of all but these 323 trees.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy will monitor the silvicultural operations closely and will licence felling on an annual basis to ensure that essential felling is undertaken in a most sensitive way.  I expect the owners to deliver precisely on the requirements for each stage but if they do not no further felling will be allowed. In relation to work done elsewhere on the estate, inspections by the Forest Service also confirm that replanting and maintenance, while it may not look attractive now, is of an acceptable standard and will lead to the re-establishment of woodlands in those areas.</P>
    <P>The trees subject to the felling licence, as well as other trees, are covered by the tree preservation order issued by Wicklow County Council and may not be felled without a valid consent.  The 1987 consent which the owners have is not in accordance with the programme approved by the Minister for Energy and will require revision.  Any preservation of woodlands or individual trees for amenity or landscape purposes is the responsibility of the council.  It is now a matter for the council to take a decision in relation to its own order whether felling can go ahead.</P>
    <P>In a wider perspective, I wish to point out that the Minister for Energy is concerned at the adverse impact which this controversy over the harvesting of mature trees can have on his efforts to promote broadleaf planting generally in the country.  As I mentioned at the outset, Tomnafinnoge is a planted woodland and if the Minister's target for increased broadleaf planting can be achieved nationally, there is no reason <Col N="1350" /> Tomnafinnoge should be an isolated example of such planting in this country for future generations.  New and improved grant schemes have recently been announced by the Minister for Energy on behalf of the Government which specifically encourage increased planting of broadleaf trees throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay special tribute to Senator Ryan who has a personal interest in this matter and has given the House such a tremendous amount of detail in relation to the present position and the historical perspective.  I know that many Members of the House including the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, have taken a personal interest in this matter, and I know of the interest many other politicians and the public at large have in the famous Coolattin Woods.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asked for an immediate report on the matter last week and I expect he has that report by now or, if not, he will have it this week.  I will take what Senator Ryan said on board and will convey his feelings to the Minister for Energy.  It will then be for him to consider what has been said there tonight.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure this House that the limited felling recently approved by the Minister for Energy, is part of a wider and strictly controlled programme, which recognises the importance of Tomnafinnoge and aims to restore the woodland to the former excellence associated with the woodlands in this area in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  If that is control, I would not like to see it if it were out of control because in the first phase 323 trees will represent 90 per cent of the trees in ten years time.  That is the bottom line.  That is the end of Tomnafinnoge Wood.  Bridgefarm Limited on their record, cannot be trusted. Nobody can look at those woods and say <Col N="1351" /> those people can be trusted to do the job properly.  I ask the Minister to take on board the private study that has been done.  Would it be possible to carry out an environmental impact study before the woods are touched?</P>

I could not give a commitment on behalf of the Minister for Energy regarding these matters but I will convey to him the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan on behalf of the many people who are interested in the unique heritage in Coolattin.</P>
