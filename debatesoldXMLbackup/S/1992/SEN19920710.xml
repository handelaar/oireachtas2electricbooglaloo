      <P>I have notice from Senator Dardis that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take steps to prevent the spread of giant hogweed.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to assign additional gardaí at Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that the inquiry instituted into the case of the Tallaght Two 18 months ago be completed without delay and that the findings be made public.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Dardis, Ross and Costello suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Dardis's and Ross's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business are items 1 and 2.  It is proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that proceedings on Second Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, if not previously concluded will be brought to a conclusion at 12.45 p.m. with the Minister being called on to reply no later than 12.30 p.m. and that the Committee and Remaining Stages if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down from the Government.  The proceedings on the Second and Remaining Stages of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments include only amendments set down from the Government.</P>
      <P>I suspect, and hope, that as the day goes on enough time will be available for everybody to have their say on these two Bills.  On Tuesday night last I tried to extend the House for a short length of time to accommodate speakers as it was felt than that we needed more time.  Yesterday my judgement was proved to have been right.</P>

      <P>The Leader has a given a good example this morning of the iron fist in the velvet glove.  Clearly this type of arrangement is not acceptable.  It is a pity that coming to the end of the session the gullotine is being used with increasing ruthlessness.  I will not call a vote on this because that would take even further time from the debate but Fine Gael opposes these tactics.</P>

      <P>I sense that the Government side's hurry to take their holidays is the reason for all the guillotined motions we are dealing with.  These things should be dealt with reasonably.  I did not object to terminating the Housing Bill despite what the Leader of the House <Col N="1811" /> has indicated.  We have a serious difficulty with today's Bill because amendments will not now be taken and I oppose the Order of Business on that basis.  We made it clear to the Government three weeks ago that we felt the House should continue at least until the end of July which would allow for full discussion of the legislation.  It is too bad holiday arrangements of Fianna Fáil Members of the House dictate the taking of legislation.</P>

      <P>I am beginning to think that the Leader of the House is losing the run of himself.  We have the guillotine every day and it looks as if that practice will continue up to the recess.  It is a pity that the Leader resorts to guillotines.  If he had sense and let us talk this legislation out, it would not take much longer.  I imagine that by 6, 7 or 8 o'clock this evening the whole business would be completed.  It is a pity that he decides to use the big stick instead of letting people reach their own level and conclusions and I feel sure that would happen at an early hour this evening.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader inform the House how he got on during his meeting with people from the American Embassy yesterday? That matter is still of considerable concern to myself and to a number of people who have made representations to me.</P>
      <P>I was very disturbed to see reports in today's newspapers of an enormous chemical haul by the gardaí at Dublin Airport.  It is disturbing that large amounts of chemicals are being found and that we have a sort of subversive under the bed chemical industry working on the side producing dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader if time will be made available before the recess to debate item 9 on today's Order Paper. It is ironic that over the last three years of so many changes in the European Community that the House has not had an opportunity to debate any of them or to make an input there.  In view of the fact that there are so many fundamental changes in aid from the Common Agricultural Policy, it is desirable that the Minister should come to this House for a debate so that we can elucidate many of the problems facing farmers in their efforts to avail of the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>The Leader indicated some months ago that he would provide time for a debate on item 1, list No. 8 of the Supplementary Order Paper, dealing with the famine in Africa.  When will time be provided for such a debate?</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader if, at this stage, we could finalise Second Stage and leave Remaining Stages until the autumn?  We have the Green Paper on Education to debate and that is the obvious thing to do.  The Leader could grant that request so that the debate on the Green Paper could take place in the meantime.</P>

      <P>As regards holiday arrangements and without mentioning names, I am trying to achieve before the recess what I believe is a consensus of the views of the House.  I always try to reflect those views as I can.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, I can tell Senator Costello that I checked yesterday and on several pieces of legislation, in a House which is only a third of the size of the Dáil we have given longer hours and more days than the Dáil to the debate. It seems to me that in the Dáil they can readily get agreement on time allocations. I welcome the greater commitment of this House in regard to time given to debates.  Overall, this House has given more time than the Dáil to most Bills.  One loses on some days and one wins on others.  Yesterday it did not please me that the House closed down at about 12 o'clock.</P>
      <P>With regard to the drugs haul at the airport, I congratulate those involved and especially those on the intelligence side of the Garda.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton asked about my visit to the American Embassy.  I will report back to our Committee on Procedure and Privileges on that matter.  I expect some positive results from the meeting.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald asked about a debate on the famine in South Africa.  It will not be possible to have such a debate before the recess.  We will include it under topical debates.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 May 1930, during the passage through the Dáil of the Second Stage of the Vocational Education Bill, 1930, Professor John Marcus O'Sullivan, the Cumann na nGaedhael Minister for Education in the period 1926-1932 stated:</P>
      <P>One of the matters in which technical education in Ireland at present fails short of the requirements is that there is not sufficient relation between the system and the neighbourhood which it purports to serve.  The local connection is more necessary in this type of education than elsewhere. Hence, I agree with the views put forward by the special commission on technical education that local education committees should be retained.</P>
      <P>In a similar vein during the passage of the 1930 legislation, Professor Alton stated: &ldquo;The central idea of the Bill is the vocational committees&rdquo;.  Thus, with this single vision and guiding principle John Marcus O'Sullivan steered through the Dáil and Seanad this great monument to his memory, the Vocational Education Bill, 1930, one of the great landmarks of Irish education history.</P>
      <P>The 1930 Act and the 38 vocational education committees established under it have served this country, I think all will agree, very well over the past 62 years. The vision of those who framed that Act has been given the eloquent testimony of experience and its flexibility and far reaching features are recognised among its greatest virtues.  It is in that overall context, therefore, that I wish to pay special tribute to the vocational education committees of this country for the magnificent and splendid work they have done over the past 62 years in advancing and promoting all aspects of vocational and technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that same overall context that I deplore and condemn the undemocratic <Col N="1815" /> provisions in these Bills which seek to undermine and diminish the role, power and functions of local vocational education committees in Irish technical and technological education and to transfer many of these powers and functions to the bureaucratic arena of the Minister for Education and his officials.  All this flies in the face of the Government's alleged commitments to decentralisation and the principle of subsidiarity as enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.  At the core of these Bills is a mistrust of the democratic structures at ground level and a determination to undermine and diminish decision making powers which are not immediately and directly within the bureaucratic control of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991, represent a serious body blow to those striving to improve and enhance the role, functions and powers of local elected councils throughout this country.  The irony of this is the growing demand within the European community for devolving and decentralising the powers and functions of governments at all levels.  All our EC partners are striving hard to give new powers, functions and roles to local communities at town, city and county levels throughout the Community.  They are endeavouring and striving to build a Europe of the regions, yet, it seems to me that this Government are terrified and petrified of devolution and decentralisation. They want everything to be decided in Dublin by a Minister and a core of officials who they think know best for the country.</P>
    <P>As a vocational education committee member for many years I am deeply concerned about and suspicious of the blanket powers which the Minister for Education is being given by these Bills. These Bills are transferring the powers and functions of the local vocational education committees, of local representatives and local control to the Minister for Education.  Moreover, they are conferring on the Minister for Education <Col N="1816" /> a degree of control, authority and involvement in the regional technical colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges which the vocational education committees themselves never had.  Both Bills are riddled with references to the Minister for Education. The decision as to which colleges will come within the legislation will be a matter for the Minister for Education. The Minister can decide the names of the colleges, what courses of study are pursued in these colleges, and what bodies can validate those courses.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (c) states that, subject to such conditions as the Minister for Education may determine, the colleges can engage in research, consultancy and development work.  What has happened in these Bills to the concept of autonomy and academic freedom?  I am sure that the many pressure groups and organisations who promoted the idea of academic freedom and autonomy for these colleges will look in vain for such freedom and autonomy in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The IVEA, the umbrella organisation for vocational education in Ireland, is deeply concerned about many aspects of this legislation.  They have produced detailed and sensible documentation and recommendations in respect of this legislation and foremost among the issues of concern to them is the degree of bureaucracy and centralisation which these measures and provisions entail.  What is envisaged is not a freeing up of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges in order to allow them to develop, expand and grow to meet needs according to their means and the wishes of the consumers of education, but rather an attack on the democratic structures which are already in place and have served third level, technical and technological education in particular so well in this country over these past years.</P>
    <P>I think it is pertinent to ask the Minister for Education and the junior Minister the fundamental and crucial question, &ldquo;What role do they envisage for vocational education committees in the future?&rdquo;  I am forced to ask the Minister this question <Col N="1817" /> because of the publication in a pre-emptive fashion of these Bills just in advance of a rational and comprehensive discussion on the Green Paper in Education. There is a genuine fear among many vocational education committees throughout this country that their days are numbered and that this legislation is just another chipping away at their powers and functions until they are finally abolished.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, interesting to recall here today the historical context in which the present system of technical and technological education evolved.  An organised system of technical instruction did not develop in Ireland until the early years of this century, although a number of individual institutions were making contributions in this field from the second half of the 19th century.  The Samuelson Committee on Technical Education in Britain published their report in 1884 in which they pressed strongly for the expansion of technical education in Ireland with State support.</P>
    <P>The State's role in providing financial assistance to technical education was recognised for the first time in the Technical Instruction Act, 1889, which empowered local authorities to provide financial aid for such education out of local rates. In the event, only 12 of the 228 local authorities at the time which could have given grants for technical education did so.  The report of the Recess Committee in 1896 called for reform and recommended that technical education should be the responsibility of a new Government Department to be established to administer State aid to agriculture and industry.  The Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, laid the framework for a more organised local authority structure and it enabled the new county and borough councils to levy rates for the support of technical education.  Thus, at the turn of the century, we had the Local Government (Ireland) Act, the Recess Committee and the Technical Instruction Act.</P>
    <P>In 1922, technical education came under the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1818" /> and, in 1924, it became the responsibility of the newly established Department of Education.  A special commission on technical education was established in 1926 to inquire into and advise on the system of technical education in Saorstát Éireann in relation to the requirements of trade and industry.  They reported in 1927.  The main recommendations of that special commission formed the basis of the Vocational Act of 1930, a hallmark of legislation of which we can all be justly proud.</P>
    <P>The sixties saw a major thrust in the development of technical education with the publication of the Investment in Education Report in 1962 and Training of Technicians in Ireland in 1964.  In May 1963, the Minister for Education, Dr. Patrick Hillery, signalled the Government's intention to arrange with appropriate vocational education committees for the provision of a limited number of technical colleges with regional status.</P>
    <P>In September 1966, a steering committee on technical education was established, to advise the Minister generally on technical education in this country. The 1969 report of that committee formed the basis for the establishment, between 1970 and 1977, of the present framework and network of regional technical colleges.  That steering committee broadly defined the role of these colleges as being to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations, ranging from craft to professional level, notably engineering and science but also commercial, linguistic and other specialties.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay special tribute to all those who have been involved in the development and administration of our regional technical colleges, the academic and administrative staffs, the management boards and vocational education committees, for their tremendous work in promoting and advancing technical and technological education in this country over these past 22 years.  The form of words used in the 1930 Act, the flexibility inherent in them and the spirit, thrust and intent of that legislation, facilitated <Col N="1819" /> all the developments which have taken place since 1930.</P>
    <P>John Marcus O'Sullivan was a man larger than life.  He was a man of many interests which ran the gamut from carpentry and growing his own vegetables to his formal academic disciplines of philosophy and history.  He was a European in this country long before his time.  With a PhD from Heidelberg he was in a position to enjoy and appreciate the richness of our European heritage during his frequent travels in France and Germany.  It may be forgotten that he also served as Secretary of the Department of Finance. For that reason he must have been conscious, as he introduced the 1930 Act, that for education in this country to be of true benefit to the citizens, it must be strongly related to Ireland's social and economic needs.  He saw virtue in a capacity to convert ideas into action.</P>
    <P>In a recent important document published in June 1991 entitle <i>Reviews of National Policies for Education &mdash; Ireland,</i> the international examiners of the OECD state that Ireland may be geographically a small country with a small population but it ferments with comment and controversy.  While there may be good measures in this legislation, many of the provisions are bristling with controversy.  The Minister should take on board many of the comments and recommendations of the IVEA.  He should consider the matter further in the light of the publication of the Green Paper and introduce appropriate amendments and appropriate legislation which will enable the regional technical colleges to carry out their own research, development and consultancy work.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should provide the few extra million pounds which would make such a difference to each of the colleges which are bursting at the seams.  He should give us the wherewithal to expand, develop and continue the undoubted and splendid success achieved by the vocational education committees and the regional technical colleges over these past years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the items I wished to mention have already been discussed, some of them by Senator Kennedy.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I want to talk about the role of the colleges in the area of research and development.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have a very important and grossly underdeveloped potential to improve the technological capacity of Irish industry. Because of the colleges' close proximity to industry, through their association with apprenticeship and craft technician courses, they are in a unique position to understand and appreciate the day to day needs of industry to develop new products and processes.  They are in a special position to accelerate the transfer of technology into Irish industry.  They deal with the people who experience the day to day technological challenges of industry.</P>
      <P>This immediate hands-on awareness of industry's problems provides those who lecture in these colleges with a unique opportunity to be fully aware of the possibilities to improve production processes and to enhance quality control procedures. The capacity of Irish industry to advance and develop will centre around the ability of the industrial workforce to do the simple things right.  Japanese industry developed not because of the genesis of new ideas but because of a better application for existing ideas and technologies.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of this Bill, the role of the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology in technology transfer was restricted because of the legislation which established these bodies.  To the extent that this Bill has removed these restrictions, it is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The removal of these restrictions should help to develop industry in the hinterland of the regional technical colleges. There is some evidence already that this is taking place and there is potential for further developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the role of the colleges in industrial development and in the provision of a skilled workforce which will meet the needs of industry, it would be a great mistake to conclude that this is <Col N="1821" /> the only role of these colleges.  The fundamental role of these colleges is still an educational one.  We must never allow ourselves to fall into the trap of thinking their function is to produce human industrial robots.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by heavy statements from the bosses of some of these colleges who would have us believe that if we produce, nationally, large numbers of graduates with Japanese and American values and attitudes, all our problems will be solved.  I find it encouraging that so few Irish people take these zealots seriously; I hope no impressionable politician of any description will give them credence.  In essence, what they are suggesting is that Irish people should cease to be Irish, that we would transform ourselves into a hybrid between Japan and America.  I find that totally unacceptable. If these people want to take their case further, if they want to try and advance their opinions, let me invite them into the political process, get themselves nominated and put their names on the ballot paper.  I have no doubt as to the capacity and wisdom of the Irish people to give these people their answer.  In a way it is harmless enough to listen to these chaps sounding off, blowing their bugles, etc.  Maybe some of it is done to impress foreign industrialists who come here but I would not like to think that they would get much further or that too many people would take them seriously.</P>
    <P>Nobody could dispute that some rationalisation of the structures of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges was needed. The Dublin Institute of Technology colleges now provide courses for about 8,800 full-time students, 10,000 part-time students and 5,000 apprenticeship students.  They started on a very small and limited scale and over time have grown enormously.  They started with basic craft technician courses and they have now developed into full third level colleges providing courses up to degree level.</P>
    <P>All this development from very modest beginnings, has taken place under the guidance of the vocational education <Col N="1822" /> committees.  That is a very clear indication of the capacity of the vocational education committees to develop these colleges, to meet their needs and to allow them to expand.  All this was done under democratic control and it is a pity the Minister has decided to restrict this control and to a large extent, sideline elected representatives from having a say in the control of these colleges.</P>
    <P>This Bill confirms and consolidates the control of the Department of Education over these colleges.  This, of necessity, will change the ethos of the colleges.  It will change their links with their communities and inhibit their capacity to properly meet the needs of their communities.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions in relation to the governing bodies of these colleges are regrettable.  Members of the Oireachtas are barred from becoming members of the governing bodies of those colleges.  I am at a loss to see why.  Many Members of the Oireachtas would have a very useful role to play.  They would have a considerable understanding of the needs of the communities these colleges serve.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Education has just been published.  It is a basic discussion document covering all aspects of education.  It has taken many years to produce.  Almost immediately after the publication of that document, we now find three major education Bills being pushed through this House.  The two colleges Bills are fundamental to the development of technological education in this country and it is a pity these Bills are being rushed through this House.  We should have had the opportunity to consider the Green Paper and then consider these Bills in the context of that document.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of the colleges will be greatly diminished.  This is a move by the bureaucracy to get their hands on the colleges and control them, simply because some bureaucrats believe that politicians do not know what is best for them.  I reject that idea.</P>
    <P>Bureaucrats have a distrust and a disdain for the vocational education committee's and their role.  Anybody who <Col N="1823" /> looks at the history of the vocational education committees can have no doubt as to the valuable, vital role they have played over the years.  In addition to meeting the basic needs of large sections of the community for a technological education, the vocational education committee's have also shown considerable foresight and a capacity to develop, understand and expand.  That is clear from the manner in which the regional technical college's and, in particular the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges have developed.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Kennedy said about the questions hanging over the future of the vocational education committees.  I have grave doubts about their future.  I see this measure as the thin end of the wedge.  I am worried lest the vocational education committees go down the same road as the county committees of agriculture.  That would be regrettable because of the immense contribution the vocational education committees have made to the development of education and the effort they have made to meet the needs of communities to develop technological skills.</P>
    <P>There is not community in this country which has not been greatly enhanced by the role the vocational education committees have played over the years.  In small rural communities vocational education committee schools have done a tremendous amount of work.  When the vocational education committees changed and began to provide a full second level course to leaving certificate level, those colleges and schools were readily able to adapt.  Some of the best schools in this country are vocational education schools; some are here in Dublin.  There are also excellent schools in places like west Clare, where I come from, Kilrush and Kilmihill a very small community with an excellent vocational education school which, with very small resources and a limited number of teaching staff, produces excellent results.  The same is true of the vocational colleges in Dublin including the one in my own constituency in Clogher Road, Crumlin. <Col N="1824" /> They provide an excellent service for the communities they serve.  They have provided that service in good times and in bad.  There were times when they got very little encouragement from the bureaucrats or from many of the leaders of opinion in this country, but they carried on, did their best and provided a wonderful service without which this country would be very much the poorer.</P>
    <P>I regret the diminution of the role of the vocational education committee's under this Bill.  I am very concerned about where this Bill and the thinking processes behind it are taking us in relation to the future of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am uneasy about these Bills especially the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  Like many of my colleagues I find it extraordinary that these Bills are being debated so soon after the publication of the long awaited Green Paper on Education and before Members have an opportunity to study that document which is the Government's blueprint for the development of education over the next number of years.</P>
      <P>These Bills propose radical changes in education.  I had the opportunity of serving on vocational education committees and on the board of one of the regional colleges in the mid-fifties.  I have seen the evolution of vocational education.  I do not understand how the Department or the Minister can choose to disregard that evolution and propose drastic changes which will deprive the education system of a local input.  All the vocational education committees and the boards of the regional colleges have expressed grave foreboding about the direction this legislation is taking.  This is unfortunate.  I do not understand how the Minister can propose such radical legislation without at least asking for an input from the people who have been engaged full-time in providing a very comprehensive service that has served the country well over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest setback to the vocational education system possibly occurred when the TUI sought some years ago to have <Col N="1825" /> equality with secondary education.  The role of the vocational schools changed and they were brought into line with the ordinary secondary schools which up to then had been dealing with the humanities. That left a void in the mid-seventies which was taken up by the FÁS programmes. They are doing excellent work, but they purport to be turning out craftsmen in nine month part-time courses.  It was the tradition in this country, and in other countries, for people to serve their time and be apprenticed for three, four or five years.  I do not know if the FÁS experiment will, in the long term, prove to be of lasting effect.</P>
    <P>I am shocked the Government should introduce a Bill which would not endear itself to even one vocational education committee or to one of the boards of any of the regional colleges.</P>
    <P>There are 38 vocational education committees in the country.  They have established over 250 second level schools and 18 third level institutions.  They provide a range of adult education centres, outdoor education centres and other centres of learning.  They provide adult education courses for 130,000 people per annum, post-leaving certificate courses for 26,000 students, third level education for 28,000 students, education for 10,000 apprentices and a whole range of special education provision for those in special need, in all over 200,000 students.  In addition, they provide the ordinary second level courses for 70,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>Looking at that input into education it seems extraordinary that the people providing and manning that education system, the committees that supervise or plan it, the teachers and the board members on the various college boards all seem to be up in arms against this Bill. Does it not seem peculiar to the Minister and to the Department that these significant changes are not attractive to the people who are operating the present system?  I understand the Government and the Department of Education have not sought the advice of those people engaged in the public service and, furthermore, they have ignored the representations that have been made by <Col N="1826" /> some of those committees and some of the regional technical colleges boards. That is highhanded as is the guillotine on the discussion of these two very important Bills.</P>
    <P>In the final analaysis, this is a democracy. Many of my colleagues on the Government benches over the years have given excellent service in the development, and promotion of second and third level and of second chance education in every country.  I would ask them, whether this is not progress at too rapid a pace? Are they sure what is now being proposed will be a great improvement on what has evolved since the 1924 Act?  This is something on which only the members of the Government parties can satisfy themselves.</P>
    <P>Education is very important to the youth of this country.  The numbers registering as unemployed seem to be increasing. The least we can give to the youth of this country is a substantial education to qualify them to take up employment wherever they can find it, in our own country or in a unified Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very experienced politician.  The Minister of State is not only a politician with a sound record but he is the second generation in that tradition. How can any politician decide that service to the public should render one ineligible for service on governing bodies of these institutions?  In a democracy, that is extraordinary and it is no wonder the public has a warped perception of the work politicians do.  I was listening to a radio programme this morning on which people were not very supportive of the idea that the parliamentary holidays last for three months.  People seem to think that when the House is not sitting, politicians do nothing.  Most nights, when I get home I have to deal with many messages.  Last night I had to telephone a constituent at 11 p.m.  I did so because it would not have been possible for me to do it this morning.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister, with his own personal experience, bring into this House and subject to a guillotine, a Bill that excludes those involved in politics from having an input into education?  The <Col N="1827" /> agricultural committees were able to provide a specific service in local areas.  That kind of operation is going to be more important in the future.  For instance, if we need specific skills for any new industry, the lack of politician input will make it much harder to procure such services for industrialists or for potential workers.</P>
    <P>I am astounded that people in the Government parties who have given a long tradition of service on committees of education can now decide that it was all a huge mistake and that politicians must be kept off these governing bodies. I know from 35 years' experience just how much hard lobbying is needed to procure the extension of a school.  If the provision of services were left to the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works it would be 20 or 30 years before anything would be done.  No one can say that is not true.  If this new system is an improvement on what already exists I, for one, will be most surprised.  We waited years for the Green Paper on Education which was promised by three successive Ministers, yet we were not given an opportunity to study the proposals in that substantial document before these Bills were put through with indecent haste.</P>
    <P>I do not welcome this Bill, not because of its contents but because of the philosophy the Government are introducing into the education system, the lip service they pay to education and because they have ignored the experts in this field, the chairman and heads of the colleges across the country and in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who participated in the debate for their interesting and varied contributions. I would say to Senator McDonald that the fact that I am replying at this stage speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to note that there was a general welcome for these two important Bills.  All who spoke gave a welcome, although qualified in some cases, to the changes made in the Bills since they were <Col N="1828" /> initiated.  Many of these changes were the result of a wide ranging consultative process with all the interests concerned and represent a genuine effort to meet the legitimate concerns of these interests.</P>
    <P>In my remarks on Wednesday last at the commencement of Second Stage while outlining the provisions of the two Bills, I highlighted the more significant changes which were made either on Committee or Report Stages in the Dáil.  I was glad to note the extent to which these amendments found acceptance on all sides of both Houses and with the interested groups.  Senators will appreciate that with Bills of this nature which relate to a range of groups with often diverse, if not competing, concerns the changes made must, of necessity, seek to meet all interests.  Some changes suit some people and other changes suit others.  It is difficult to find someone who is satisfied with all the changes.</P>
    <P>In this process we have been interested in trying to arrive at a reasonable balance between autonomy and control, devolved authority and centralised administration and greater freedom for the institutions and the preservation of meaningful links with the vocational education committee system.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers, in addition to myself, paid well deserved tributes to the vocational education committees.  This, of course, is right and proper since these committees provide the framework and the base from which the colleges have grown to be the outstanding educational institutions they are today.  Third level education institutions of such calibre are invariably self-governing.  These Bills are basically providing a suitable framework for self-governance.  Inevitably some people say they are going too far while others say they are not going far enough. We are back to the question of balance which I have already mentioned.  I believe we have got it right particularly in the context of the continued involvement of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The governing bodies will be required to have regard to the statutory responsibilities of the vocational education committees. <Col N="1829" /> The vocational education committees will have the single largest representation on the governing bodies all of whose nominees could, at the discretion of the vocational education committees, be local elected representatives. The committees will have the power to select the organisations which will nominate five members to the governing bodies and they will have as strong role in the annual agreement of programmes and budgets.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the degree of support which was forthcoming for the general thrust and intent of these two important Bills.  The need to give greater autonomy to the institutions in their day-to-day operation, the statutory establishment of governing bodies and academic councils, the wide ranging of functions for the institutions, the firm foundation being given for involvement in research, consultancy and development work as well as the provisions relating to the exploitation of such work are among the progressive aspects of the Bills which were highlighted in the contributions to the debate.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Senator Jackman is not here today but in her very positive contribution she said it was important that the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology be properly established as third level institutions. She acknowledged that the Bills do this. She said, however, that she would have wished to see the title of the colleges changed.  I fully share the Senator's views of the colleges as multi-faceted institutions. I am not, however, convinced that her suggestion that the title of polytechnic be substituted for the existing title is the most appropriate route to follow at this time.</P>
    <P>She referred to the College of Art, Commerce and Technology as appropriate to the Limerick college.  I understand that other colleges have views as to what might be appropriate in their case. While I might have sympathy with the Senator's views on the matter, I am conscious of the lack of consensus and for that reason I favour the approach of consultation with interested parties with a <Col N="1830" /> view to changing the titles where appropriate and by order under the terms of section 3 (4) of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the time scale and said there was a lack of consultation. The time scale was also referred to by Senator Costello.  To put the question of rushing these Bills through the House into perspective, I would remind the House that the Bills were long heralded.  They were published in June 1991 and the Committee Stage began in December 1991.  I do not think, in all fairness, that this schedule can be called steamrolling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to lack of consultation &mdash; a point made strongly by Senators Raftery and Costello &mdash; I assure the House that all the Ministers involved in these Bills were available to listen to the views of interested parties with whom wide ranging discussions took place up to last week.  The concrete result of such discussions was the range of amendments introduced to deal with various concerns expressed by Deputies during Committee and Report Stages of the Bills in the Dáil, and by the IVEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IVEA had discussions on the Bills with successive Ministers for Education as well as with officials of the Department and their various submissions were carefully considered.  Most recently the Minister, Deputy Brennan, met their representative, on 6 May and again last week and I met their representatives in June, as was acknowledged by Senator Honan in her contribution.  A series of amendments were introduced to meet their concerns.  At their most recent <Col N="1831" /> meeting with the Minister, only one issue which was stated to be of fundamental importance was raised by the IVEA.  This related to the initiation of action on the inclusion of other institutions under the terms of the Bills.  Yet again, the Minister was prepared to meet their concerns and brought forward an appropriate amendment. Taking all of this into account I think the House will agree that allegations that no consultation took place are most unfair.</P>
    <P>With regard to the views expressed by many Senators including Senators Jackman, Honan, Costello, O'Reilly that the vocational education committees are not strongly represented, I would like to reiterate the position.  The vocational education committees have the largest representation on the governing body. They have power to nominate organisations requiring representation on the governing body.  They are joined with the Minister in initiating action in the inclusion under the Bills of new colleges or parts of colleges.  They have a strong role to play in programmes and budgets and the governing body will be required to have regard to the statutory responsibility of the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I believe these strong links are entirely appropriate and clearly demonstrate that the allegation that all the vocational education committee influence has been clinically removed is quite unfounded.  I have to say, however, that the Bills seek to give appropriate autonomy to these institutions.  This could not happen while leaving the current situation unchanged. It was necessary to strike the balance I have spoken about the necessary autonomy, the role of the Minister and the role of the vocational education committee. The Bills succeeded in striking an appropriate balance which I believe all parties wish to succeed.</P>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Honan expressed concern about the future role of vocational education committees.  By relieving vocational education committees of direct management of schools we are freeing them to play a more flexible <Col N="1832" /> and entrepreneurial role in relation to the wide range of functions envisaged for them in the Green Paper.  I cannot accept that the Green Paper downgrades the role of the vocational education committees in relation to the overall co-ordination of vocational education and training.  In fact, the proposals in the Green Paper envisage them playing a lead role with the other agencies and sectors concerned both at local and national level with the provision of vocational education training.  I wholeheartedly echo the concern expressed particularly by Senators Jackman, O'Toole and Conroy for the need to promote access to third level education and the special role of the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology in this regard.</P>
    <P>Recent action in relation to the third level grant scheme will mean that a significantly greater number of young people will receive support for third level education but the problems are not just those of financial support.  The crucial decisions that determine a young person's progression through the education system are taken early in their careers, in their approach to and success in education at first and second level and in the support they receive from their parents and the local community.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper describes a range of actions intended to increase the number of young people remaining in education until the end of second level and to encourage them to progress to third level programmes, including a direct link between third level institutions and selected schools and the designation of a staff member in institutions to oversee this.  Senators may have seen the recent advertisement for such a post for the new regional technical college in Tallaght. Support and access programmes for students at senior cycle and the possibility of providing priority access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds will be explored.  Early in their school careers the home-school Link programme and the curriculum in the junior cycle together with an emphasis on early identification of difficulties should also <Col N="1833" /> serve to encourage greater participation by young people at both second and third level.</P>
    <P>We have set ourselves ambitious but necessary targets of 90 per cent participation through second level by the end of the decade and by mid-decade of more than 45 per cent transferring to third level.  This compares to 20 per cent in 1980.  These strides are as a result of Government commitment to improving access to third level.</P>
    <P>I also note Senator Jackman's comment on the accommodation position in COACT.  I understand plans are afoot for major work on the college.  I have sympathy with her views on the benefit of a location in the heart of Limerick city and I very much hope this aspiration can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>With regard to her comment on the composition of the governing body in the Bills initiated by the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, I would remind the Senator that the original Bills envisaged only 15 ordinary members.  She also mentioned the question of providing for five elected local representatives on the governing body.  The Bills leave this matter entirely to the vocational education committees. The term used &ldquo;at least three should be members of a local authority&rdquo;, means that all six vocational education committee nominees can be local authority members.</P>
    <P>Senators McKenna, O'Toole and Conroy were also concerned at what they perceived as less involvement of local elected representatives.  I have already dealt with the role of the vocational education committees at some length.  This, together with the fact that all six vocational education committee nominees &mdash; that is one third of the governing body &mdash; could be elected representatives and bearing in mind the provision of section 6 (4) (b) for representation from vocational education committees in the region means I am satisfied that the Senators' concerns are catered for.  As a member of a local authority for 18 years, I certainly have at heart the interest of local representation and I would not be <Col N="1834" /> party to any Bill that would not cater for that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senators who remarked about the extent to which the regional technical colleges have been a significant factor in the development of the region which they serve.  This regional remit is enshrined in section 5 in the statement of the principal function of the colleges.  I have no doubt their contribution to regional development will be further enhanced through the provisions of these Bills.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole and Jackman raised the question of the use of the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; as against &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  I have sympathy with their views but there are two difficulties involved in this issue. First, our legal advice was to the effect that chairman was the correct term on the basis of a definition in the Interpretation Act, 1937.  Secondly, I am aware that many women object to the term &ldquo;chairperson.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the chairman to be designated by such title as the governing body may determine. I hope this will allow for a satisfactory outcome in all cases.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was rather critical of the fact that governing bodies could not borrow money without express approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1835" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is included in the section of the Bills dealing with the annual approval of programmes and budgets.  I think Senator O'Toole would accept that the borrowing of money over and above the authorised budget is a matter that should require approval.  Since the vocational education committee, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance are, in effect, the budgetary authority the necessary approval should come from these sources.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was also critical about the section in both Bills dealing with inspection.  This section provides for inspection by persons other than inspectors and officers of the Department.  It also provides for reporting to the Minister on other matters relating to the operation of the colleges.  I can think of instances where such a report would be necessary.  All in all, this is a good section and reflects the public nature of these institutions and the need for them to be publicly accountable.</P>
      <P>The point which Senator O'Toole raised about officers and servants is a technical one and I agree with it.  These terms are necessary because of the application of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980 to staff of the institutions.  Perhaps in other areas that can be looked at but because of the nature of this Bill we must apply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Costello and Keogh raised the question of degree-awarding powers for the Dublin Institute of Technology. As has been stated in the Dáil, it is fully intended that such functions would be given to the Dublin Institute of Technology and amendments to copperfasten this intention were introduced to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil.  However, it is my view that it is more appropriate that these powers be given when the institute has been established as the single unified structure it will be with the appointment of a president and governing body.  In the Dáil the Minister undertook that the necessary <Col N="1836" /> order to assign this function would be brought forward within a year of putting these Bills in place.</P>
    <P>In relation to graduates generally having a voice in Seanad elections, a matter raised by a number of Senators, my understanding is the that the necessary constitutional amendment was already made in 1979.  The legislative changes necessary are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank my good friend, Senator Honan, for her very kind remarks.  I understand her sincerely held fears about some of the changes these Bills will introduce.  I thank her for her welcome to the amendments which have been made since the Bills were initiated. I trust that the remarks I made earlier about striking a balance and outlining the continuing meaningful role for the vocational education committees will go a good way to allay her fears.</P>
    <P>In relation to a point the Senator raised about the composition of governing bodies, the position is that all of those mentioned in my address earlier, with the exception of the University of Dublin which is for the Dublin Institute of Technology only, will be on the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges. The provision excluding Members of the Oireachtas from public bodies is standard in more recent legislation but one which I agree should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Senators Honan, Ryan and O'Reilly questioned the chairman being appointed by the Minister.  This is the only nominee the Minister has to the governing bodies. This is not unreasonable out of 19 members in the regional technical colleges and 20 members in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The chairman's job largely is to regulate and conduct the business of the governing bodies.  It is the views, experience, expertise and interest of the members of the governing bodies generally that will determine institutional policy.  In addition, the governing body will be assisted by the academic council in the co-ordination, development and monitoring of the educational work of the institutions as well as in the protection and maintenance of academic standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> Senator Ryan mentioned the references to the Minister.  He will be aware that such reference were deleted in many places and now probably appear less often than in other third level Acts.  The Senator also referred to accommodation resources in the regional technical colleges as against the universities.  While over £64 million has been spent on capital projects in the colleges over the past ten years, it is accepted that there are many deficiencies still to be addressed.  I hope that the next few years will see further major investment to add to the projects already in hand or coming on-stream.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the new regional technical college in Tallaght due to open in September, the new college now under way in Bishop Street and the multi-purpose centres recently opened in a number of regional technical colleges.  The strengthening of central and support services in the colleges is also under way and new posts will be put in place in all the colleges.</P>
    <P>With regard to his point about the salary of college principals, the Senator will be aware that a claim is currently being dealt with at arbitration.  I agree with Senator Conroy that there is need to increase participation in third level. I dealt with this point earlier and the Government's commitment to this objective.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognise the importance of third level education and this is reflected in a number of recent initiatives.  In the last week we had the announcement of the increase in higher education grants and the increase for mature students and there were a number of announcements made over the last number of months.  Examples are the programme of expansion of student places, major capital development initiatives supported by the European Stuctural Fund and the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the importance of higher education. These initiatives are building on the active policy of the last 25 years to expand and diversify the sector.</P>
    <P>Numbers in third level education have <Col N="1838" /> expanded rapidly over the last quarter of a century from 21,000 students in 1965 to almost 70,000 students in 1990-91 increasing in 1991-92 to about 72,000 students.  Student intake in 1991-92 was close to 26,000, representing almost 40 per cent of the age group and with the additional places to be provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> participation is likely to increase in the medium-term to about 45 per cent of the age cohort.  About half the third level intake proceed to degree level programmes.</P>
    <P>These Bills are a further indication that the Government are fully committed to the development of higher education. This development and diversification is critical in offering the maximum opportunities to students with the capability to proceed to and benefit from third level education.  Also, the development of the higher education sector is critical to the nation's economic and social prosperity through the provision of graduates with the necessary qualifications and through the provision of consultancy, research and development support to industry.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this regard and those in the Bills generally are very comprehensive and do all that is necessary to give these institutions greater autonomy and freedom in the conduct of their day to day activities which is in keeping with the state of development they have reached and the potential they have to contribute to education, technology and economic development.</P>
    <P>Again I thank Senators for their very positive and interesting contributions.  I, accordingly, commend these Bills to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (4), line 52, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall change the name of the college to Regional Polytechnic in the title of the college and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned about the connotations of &ldquo;technical college&rdquo;, in Ireland and internationally.  In Ireland it is not really seen as the kind of third level institution that one would think of, such as the polytechnics in Britain or the hochschüle in Germany.  We believe that by changing the name to polytechnic we would give an enhanced status and a better image to these colleges that are <Col N="1840" /> now polytechnics in the sense of the word.  It would add to the status of these colleges and I would like to see this amendment included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's thinking on this matter.  Section 3 (4) of the Bill states that the Minister may, after consultation with the governing body, change the name by order.  The reason I think we should not push it at this stage and agree to include a word like &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; is that, first, there is no consensus on the matter.  While some people like this word others do not.  We should have more consultation with the governing bodies to see if we can settle on a name they can all live with.  For example &mdash; to mirror the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; I toyed with the name &ldquo;regional institute of technology&rdquo; to make the similarity between the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges more visible.</P>
      <P>In the Green Paper we referred to the future role of the regional technical colleges. During the next few months I would like a debate on a name.  It might be wise not to do so in this Bill, rather we should have consultations and discuss the matter in the context of the Green Paper to see if there is a consensus.  The Minister of the day could then change the name by order.  I am disposed to changing the name if there is consensus, if there is an obvious title and if that is the wish of the colleges.  I do not think it would be right to do it at this time because a consensus has not emerged as to what it should be.  It would not be fair at this time to impose the word &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; because there is no consensus among the colleges that that is what they want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister.  In relation to the title &ldquo;regional technical colleges&rdquo;, I do not believe the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; reflects the true nature of the work and functions of the colleges as defined in section 5 (1) of the Bill which states &ldquo;vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, <Col N="1841" /> industrial, social and cultural development of the State.&rdquo;  That covers a broad spectrum of professional, educational, scientific and technological developments in terms of the work of the new institutes or colleges.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that this matter was not discussed at an earlier stage because it could have been dealt with in the debate on the Green Paper which should have been published a long time ago. While I accept this is not the Minister's fault, he knows as well as I that according to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> not only were we supposed to have had a Green Paper and a White Paper by now, but the legislation was due to be enacted by the end of 1991. I have always said that we put the cart before the horse.</P>
      <P>In relation to the word &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo;, I am reminded of a story about the colours match between UCD and Trinity when the UCD students called the Trinity players &ldquo;Trinity scum&rdquo;.  Indeed, they used slightly stronger language than that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not sure if &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; is the correct word to use in this case but &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo; is not right either.  I hope the title of the new colleges&mdash;&ldquo;regional colleges&rdquo; might be appropriate &mdash; will reflect the functions enshrined in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the vocational education committee,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we suggest that the vocational education committee should be included in the list of those eligible to be corporate members of a college while it would make no difference to the college, the vocational education committees would be happier.  I cannot see why they should not be included.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 4 we seek to have FÁS and Eolas included.  Since, in addition to their traditional roles, these colleges will be involved in research, it would be appropriate to have Eolas included.  Also, and particularly in the Dublin Institute of Technology these colleges have traditionally dealt with apprentices.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology there are, I believe, 5,000 apprentices at this time and it would be appropriate to have Eolas representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too subscribe to amendment No. 3 which seeks to have the &ldquo;vocational education committee&rdquo; inserted in the section.  We tabled this amendment because each regional college will serve a number of local authority areas.  Consequently, the representation of any individual local authority will be diluted.  Section 6 (3) (b) states that the <Col N="1843" /> Minister may intervene and insist that not more than four of the six people to be nominated by the vocational education committee to be members of the governing body should be members of a local authority.</P>
      <P>Let us take the local authority in Sligo, where there is a regional technical college, as an example.  This college attracts students from Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Cavan, south Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that the parent local authority and vocational education committee are now going to have a very meagre representation on the governing body.</P>
      <P>This would be a useful amendment because it would ensure that the local authority have adequate representation. While this will be the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology, because the City of Dublin vocational education committee are the parent body and will nominate all six representatives, in the case of the regional technical colleges the Minister will be able to intervene with the result that there may be only one representative, or at most two, from the parent body.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the other amendments, FÁS and Eolas could be included under paragraph (f) which reads, &ldquo;such other persons as the governing body may appoint to be members,&rdquo; but that would not be satisfactory.  However, it is suggested in the Green Paper that FÁS should be given a different function, they should not be involved in the area of vocational training.  It has yet to be decided whether FAS should deal with the unemployed or be given an essential role in the area of vocational and technological <Col N="1844" /> training.  This is being decided in the context of the debate that has been initiated by the Minister.  I understand that a committee of the representatives of the Department of Labour and Education has been set-up to look into this specific matter but we do not know yet the outcome.  Once again we have been left in limbo.</P>
    <P>I do not know at this time whether I can support amendments Nos. 4 and 5; that will depend on the outcome of the discussions on the Green Paper in relation to the role of FÁS.  This is a serious matter and we are discussing it in a limbo.  I refer to a letter I received this morning from Sligo Vocational Education Committee &mdash; unfortunately I did not receive one from Athlone Vocational Committee but perhaps it will arrive in the post later.  I will quote from the motion unanimously passed by Sligo Vocational Education Committee:</P>
    <P>That proposed legislation for the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Regional Technical Colleges be deferred pending a comprehensive review and rationalisation of the legislative framework for all sectors of education in the context of the 1992 Green Paper entitled &ldquo;Education for a Changing World.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one example of the concern of people who have been dealing with education since 1930.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of those times when one has to prove that the Independent Senators are not necessarily part of the Opposition.  A few home truths need to be faced.  I find it difficult to understand why an authority or a committee set up under the 1930 Act to operate a second level institution should now take on board the task of running a third level institution.  I do not see why every board of management of every primary school in the catchment areas of these colleges should not be included also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see the reasoning behind these amendments.  I see nothing in them that will make the colleges more effective. <Col N="1845" /> There are many contradictions and difficulties involved.  The vocational education committees were set up in 1930 to run a second level structure.  If they were called local education committees, I would agree that they should have involvement at all levels of education, first, second and third level.  It is part of the continuing slight on first level education &mdash; the attitude is taken that they do not need to be involved in these matters. All the vocational schools in an area can be listed, to the exclusion of other bodies.</P>
    <P>I want to put my position very clearly on the line and I articulated this position on Second Stage.  I believe in the involvement of local public representatives at all levels of education, including primary level.  I made a submission to this effect some years ago to the New Ireland Forum and I will continue to hold that view. There is no intention of getting at local representatives in any way.  I do not accept that an existing committee should be part of the regional technical colleges, because that would not work.  There would be an immediate contradiction if this were done.  It defies logic that the people who draft these Bills believe that there is a custom and practice that Members of the Oireachtas are excluded from public bodies or committees.  That is a total nonsense.  Members of the Oireachtas are not excluded from vocational education committees but they could be excluded from the colleges on the basis that they are public bodies. For that reason it would not be possible to implement the amendment.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with the size of the committees.  I am not sure what the role of members of the college would be or what authority they would have.  As of now they have certain powers.  This amendment is an attempt to pull in a committee which were not set up to do this work.  If we want local representatives on these committees &mdash; and I support that idea &mdash; it should be done in an <i>ad hoc</i> way and not by pulling in a structure that already exists and assigning to it different duties.</P>
    <P>I do not see anybody rushing to make <Col N="1846" /> changes in the governing bodies of universities. These bodies deal with matters in a different way.  Public representatives may become members of governing bodies of universities, and I support such an arrangement.  However, it is unfair to exclude other areas of education from membership of the colleges while including the vocational education committees, thereby giving them a function which they were not set up to do.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with the focus on vocational or training courses.  It would be acceptable to include the bodies mentioned in a local education structure but not in the way proposed because it would be unworkable.  There is a very strong case to be made for including FÁS and Eolas, but there is an equally strong case to be made for the inclusion of primary schools.  How far should we extend membership? I feel that this proposal is going too far.</P>

      <P>I think Senator O'Toole is confusing the corporate body with the governing body.  We are talking about the corporate body and we are not pulling in every dog and devil.  We have listed in the corporate body the students and graduates of the college.  In my college, the corporate body includes the students and graduates &mdash; there are more than 30,000 graduates in the college.  We are just listing the members of the corporate body, nothing more and nothing less.  The vocational education bodies have been running third level institutions for quite some time and have built them up.  They have taken responsibility for them for the past ten years and in some cases almost 20 years.  Therefore, it is not unfair to ask that they be listed as members of the corporate body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  We are talking here about membership of the college, which is very much an honorary concept.  It does not confer duties or privileges.  It is a standard concept used by the universities. Our intention is to list those who are internally involved in a college, the graduates, students, staff, the <Col N="1847" /> academic council, the governing body and somebody they may wish to co-opt. It is to reflect the internal composition of a college, not to take on board all the legitimate external connections and linkages with the college.  For example, the amendments suggest the inclusion of FÁS and Eolas, but one could equally suggest the inclusion of regional tourism organisations in places such as Letter-kenny where there may be a closer link with tourism than with FÁS.  One could also suggest the inclusion of local agricultural committees in areas where there may be closer links with agriculture than with Eolas.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (f) states, &ldquo;such other persons as the governing body may appoint to be members&rdquo;.  It is just an honorary roll-call of those internally involved, without in any way being insulting or dismissive to those who are legitimately involved externally in the college.  If they wish to appoint any other person who might be associated with FÁS or Eolas, they could do so.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to accept the Minister's explanation on amendment No. 4 and I am prepared to withdraw it.  However, I think it is reasonable to ask that the vocational education committees, which have been part of the colleges since their foundation, be listed among the corporate members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable respect for the vocational education committees and for local public representatives. I spent some of my own career as a local public representative, so I have a healthy respect for the work they undertake and for the vocational education committees themselves.  They have undertaken magnificent work over many generations and we will be talking to them now under the umbrella of the Green Paper about their future role which I have no doubt will be equally distinguished.  If we included them on the list here it would spoil what is already a standard list in terms of univerisities, and <Col N="1848" /> would bring in those not directly involved on the floor of the college.</P>
      <P>Apart from the very practical difficulty I have of delaying this legislation, I share the Senator's sentiments.  It is not practical for me to include the provision at this stage.  That is not in any way being dismissive.  The vocational education committees have a very strong role in the future of the regional technical colleges. It is built into the legislation.  They will argue that it is not as strong as it used to be.  I accept that and I think they will accept that, on reflection.  The reason is that we have all agreed that the boards of these colleges should have more autonomy and power.  As I said many times, if we are to give more power to the boards, then by definition the Minister, the vocational education committees and, in other parts of the education system, the Churches have to give up that power and transfer some of it to the boards of the colleges.  Otherwise, giving power to the college boards would just be a lip service. I do not disagree with the sentiment but at this late stage it would be impractical to make that amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) to confer, grant or give diplomas, certificates or degrees including postgraduate degrees and honorary awards;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are keen that the colleges would have <Col N="1849" /> the right to confer degrees, certificates, diplomas and postgratuate and honorary degrees.  As the Bill is drafted they do not have this right.  They could only do so in association with the National Council for Educational Awards and with universities.  It would be better if they had this right conferred on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 6a are slightly different.  One amendment gives the power to grant degree awards and the other simply honorary awards in relation to the regional technical colleges.  The power conferring degrees should be given to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There is no element of doubt about that.  I also think it should be given to the regional technical colleges. We will now have an Institute of Technology and regional colleges.  The status of the certification of wards given will determine, to a large extent, the importance of the college in terms of educational professionalism.  If we provide only for diplomas and certificates, then we are lowering the status in the community, nationally, and internationally. If part of our role here is to assert the role of the regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, it is incumbent on us to ensure that they are given due recognition in the areas traditionally covered in educational, scientific, industrial and commercial terms.  We can only give them due recognition if we give them certification of a sufficiently high order.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that in these colleges there are many areas of specialist education which are not available elsewhere in the country.  That in itself should be recognised.  For example, environmental health is covered only in our colleges, not in the universities.  We have construction studies only in our colleges.  Architecture is shared, but there are areas that are specialist to our colleges and these should be recognised by right.  The only way properly to recognise them is to allow for the granting of full degree status.</P>
      <P>In relation to honorary awards, the status should be given to colleges to allow them to bestow an honorary award.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to give colleges their own diploma, certificate and degree-awarding status.  It is not practical at this stage to set up 11 new degree or diploma-awarding institutions at this stage.  That would be very difficult to handle.  The present arrangement is that the NCEA undertake these diploma, certificate and degree awards. That is working fairly well.  The Green Paper proposes a long discussion on the future of the regional technical colleges and whether they evolve in doing their own work in that area.</P>
      <P>I can ensure that the NCEA in awarding the degrees indicate clearly in the certificates or degrees the particular college from which the award comes.  Perhaps they can give more prominence in their award to the college from which the student graduated.  That might take account, from a visibility point of view, of the fact that the college itself has a legitimate role.  The existing arrangements are fairly satisfactory there and we should see how they progress.</P>
      <P>There are 11 such institutions now and if we allow all 11 to award degrees, certificates and diplomas, it would flood the place.  The NCEA are trying to ensure a common standard and quality control and to proceed in such a way that all of the students who come out of these 11 institutions have reached a certain standard. There is a quality assurance in the NCEA aspect of it.  We could discuss this down the road but not at this stage.</P>

      <P>I support the proposal made by Senator Raftery, which is in line with European conventions in this area. Senator Raftery might have included not just Northern Ireland, which may be a little emotive, but the European Community. All the discussions in this area at Council of Ministers level relate to interchange of staff and students, and there is a close connection between the courses in different education structures. There is no reason that our regional colleges could not have a working arrangement with third level colleges in, for instance, France, if that is appropriate. The Minister should take on board this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Department have had to deal in the last couple of weeks with verification of degrees from colleges in Northern Ireland; this is an ongoing process and I have had meetings in this regard.  This amendment proposes what is, in effect, a reality.  If the Minister cannot take the amendment on board perhaps he would, on Report Stage, include the European Community as opposed to Northern Ireland.  There is no reason Irish colleges cannot enter into arrangements with colleges in other countries.  It would be very much in line with European thinking.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the section is worded rather ambiguously, but I am advised that it clearly permits linkages with universities or other institutions outside <Col N="1853" /> the State.  The provision reads: &ldquo;to enter into arrangements with the National Council for Education Awards, with any university in the State or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time for the purpose of having degrees, diplomas or certificates awarded&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to clearly put on record that with ministerial agreement a college can enter into an arrangement with any university or other institution for these purposes. Legal people might argue with me about the wording, but my clear advice is that Northern Ireland is not excluded from this provision, neither is any other country or part of a country or state, provided there is ministerial agreement. Therefore it would be invidious to mention Northern Ireland while not mentioning other members of the European Community.  I am clearly advised that that is the legal interpretation of the section as drafted.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation but we all know that for the Minister to tell us what the Bill means and to put it on the record of the House is worth nothing.  If the matter is ever queried, it is not the record of the House that will be referred to but the legislation. The courts decide matters every day of the week according to legislation.  The language in the Bill is clear.  It states that a college may enter into any arrangement with any university in the State or with any other authority approved by the Minister.  That means that universities outside the State are excluded.  A simple way of dealing with this matter would be to accept the amendment or delete the words &ldquo;with any university in the State&rdquo;. People involved will take the view that these words are inserted for a reason.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (c), line 33, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These three amendments relate to the fact that the Minister may determine to enter into arrangements with limited liability companies to exploit any research, consultancy or development work undertaken by colleges either separately or jointly.  The conditions as stated here are to be laid down by the Minister alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is an important one.  It determines the future thrust of the colleges, how they are going to operate, what functions they are going to take on, what liaisons they are going to make, who they are going to link up with, <Col N="1855" /> whether they will establish companies, what research they will engage in and what consultancy or developmental work they will take on.  In other words, the future thrust of the regional colleges is encapsulated to a large extent in this section and because of its importance it should not be left to the decision of the Minister, but should also be done by order.</P>
    <P>By order requires, if we take it with the second amendment, No. 11, a restructuring of section 5 (c) to include this section so that the Minister would have to put his decision before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In other words, the Oireachtas would be responsible for further changes in relation to the development of the colleges.  Because of the importance of seeing how the colleges develop, it is proper and appropriate that this function should be taken away from the whim of the Minister and responsibility given to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment and I ask the Senator to withdraw it.  To me, this is democracy gone wild.  We are talking here about giving autonomy.  This section deals with arrangements for the National Council of Education Awards and with educational authorities for the purposes of having degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred, granted or given.  The idea that these decisions would have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas creates a new level of bureaucracy.  I have been through this debate with so many third level colleges.  They have to go through a sufficient number of hoops at the moment to get courses approved, sanctioned and validated and to put in another one would be absurd.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly approve of the direction of Senator Costello's amendment No. 11 requiring that there would be an affirmative process for orders but I would prefer if that came in at the later stage of the Bill where the Minister uses the negative process within 21 days; I referred to that on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is simply the validation of <Col N="1856" /> arrangements for courses, degrees, diplomas and certificates.  It does not refer to the future development of the colleges. If it did I would take Senator Costello's point but to me this section is simply an administrative function.  Nothing is more frustrating for progressive members of departments of colleges when they come up with an idea for a course diploma or degree or whatever, than to have to sell it to their own department, then to the governing body of the college, to the NCA and now a further element is proposed in the form of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is not in the best interests of the colleges and I cannot see how it might help their operation. Neither do I think that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have the expertise, knowledge or experience to make decisions as to what are appropriate degree, diploma or certificate courses at third level colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is not meant to be intrusive or to interfere in any way with legitimate research functions of institutions, nor is it aimed at including academic or proper professional research.  May I say to Senators that throughout this Bill I have reduced the role of the Minister.  I had a good meeting with the IVEA recently and indicated to them in a whole raft of sections throughout the entire Bill perhaps in a dozen areas that I had taken out the requirement for the permission and agreement of the Minister.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> for that and the arrangement with the vocational education committees was that the vocational education committees also gave some authority to the boards of management.  That arrangement between myself and the IVEA and the vocational education committees seemed to win favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had kept the requirement in this section for a good reason which may derive from my experience in a previous portfolio in communications and transport. Section 5 (d) and (e) says: &ldquo;including participation in limited liability companies.&rdquo; A campus company may engage in spectacular research or consultancy <Col N="1857" /> and get involved in international business. Suddenly there may be a spectacular collapse and, if so, the Minister will quickly be hauled before both Houses and asked what kind of procedures existed to ensure that taxpayers' money was not lost and what control did he have over subsidiary companies of universities and regional technical colleges. It would be legitimate for the Dáil and Seanad to ask a Minister to explain that and they would not be satisfied if the Minister of the day said that authority had been left completely with the governing body.</P>
    <P>One could not give a college governing body absolute power to decide on the exposure of taxpayers' money in such circumstances.  The requirement for the Minister's permission is retained to cover that area and the main aim of those sections is not to interfere with the colleges but to protect the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to do it by order and that would be cumbersome.  If in the middle of the summer one of the regional technical colleges had a major project for a couple of million pounds and wanted to get clearance on it.  It might be quicker for the Minister to give the clearance; laying the order before the Houses would slow down that process considerably.  My intention is to keep an eye on taxpayers' funds in the unlikely event that a well meaning ambitious campus company might lose the run of itself and cost the taxpayer a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>It is not a heavy-handed provision but an insurance fallback.  We have had experience in semi-State companies of subsidiary companies without proper reporting mechanisms.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that the requirement for an order here would be a little bureaucratic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity Senator O'Toole is not here.  We will repeat that when he comes in.  I disagree with him because in these amendments, I deliberately left out matters he referred to such as courses, diplomas and certificates. I am not asking for any of those <Col N="1858" /> to be covered by these two amendments. I was referring to other developmental areas which involve contacts with companies, sponsorship, with the business community, with matters somewhat divorced from mainline education.</P>
      <P>The major function of the regional colleges is to educate in areas of technical professionalism, towards certification by diplomas, certificates and, I hope, by degrees in the future.  I know the Minister has said that we must achieve a balance in this and not insist that every little project must be put before the Oireachtas.  A situation may arise whereby regional technical colleges may become a cheap area of research and development, where business can sponsor a project and where a greater proportion of the activities of the college may be outside the mainline function of the college.  In stringent times a Minister might decide that a college can get by by linking up with the business world, getting sponsorship for its courses from the construction or architectural industry or any of the commercial areas so that they will be funded essentially by private interests.  A college may become unduly influenced by economic linkage that might take place with the business community.  I am concerned about that and not with influencing the courses or the certification.  My amendment does not refer to that section, which is section 5 (a) in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I take on board what the Minister has said but there is need for further protection against colleges being funded by the private sector rather than the public sector where funds are Exchequer short in stringent times.</P>

      <P>In page 6, lines 28 to 30, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  The governing body of a college shall consist of 18 members (including the Director) one of whom (other than the Director) shall be elected to be chairman.</P>
      <P>(b)  The members of the governing body other than the chairman and the Director are referred to in this Act as ordinary members.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We would like to change the governing body from 17 to 18 members.  The chairperson would be elected from among the 18 people in question.  In other words, the governing body and not the Minister would appoint the chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the question of appointing the chairperson of the board.  I defended this vigorously in the Dáil on the basis that of a governing body of 19, the Minister would have one direct appointment only which in this case is the chairman.  The governing body would appoint the director who would be a key figure.  I felt that my stipulation was not unreasonable because, apart from being important regional institutions, these colleges are also national institutions and it is important to have a wide choice of chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this legislation to rule out the Minister deciding to appoint an existing member of the governing body as chairperson and any Minister would have to give that serious consideration. A change in numbers to facilitate that is not necessary.  The real issue is whether the chairperson is elected or the Minister makes the appointment.  It is one person out of 19 and the existing provision reflects the national role of these colleges as well as their regional role.  It is not unreasonable, nor is it an <Col N="1860" /> attempt on my part to put a ministerial hand on the colleges or to make them subject to political type appointments.</P>
    <P>Of the 19 members, the vocational education committee will have six appointments and there will be five other organisations on the nomination of the vocational education committee so the vocational education committee will be strongly represented on the governing body.  The only other role is an internal role for the staff and students.  The director is appointed by the governing body and will be a key figure in the day to day running of the college.  It is not unreasonable for national government responsible for providing the European and national funds for the colleges to have one representative, albeit the chairperson.</P>

      <P>Is that a threat or a promise?  People working together on a governing body would have a better idea of who they might work properly with as chairperson than the Minister in his office in Dublin.  We had an example recently of a board finding itself unable to work with a director appointed by the Minister. We would not like a series of those crises in colleges; we have enough of other problems without that.  I suggest that it would not take much from the Minister to leave it to the board to elect one of its number as chairperson.  I am not going to press the question of numbers but I will press the question of leaving it to the board to elect its own chairperson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All appointments so far of the governing body are to be made by the Minister; the Minister has a hand in all of the appointments.  First, the Minister makes the appointment of the ordinary members of the governing body with the recommendations of the vocational <Col N="1861" /> education committee, then approves the appointment of the director and now the Minister appoints the chairperson.  So, it is the Minister plus the other two on one hand and then the top person is chosen by the Minister.  The chairperson if so chosen will be seen as the Minister's person within the governing body, an infiltrator, surreptitiously representing the hand of the Minister.  The proposal is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Senator Raftery referred to some of the problems we have had by bringing outsiders into semi-State bodies.  In education terms, the Minister has had his hand on all the people who will constitute the governing body; that is the 17 ordinary members and the director and it seems unreasonable that a total outsider might be appointed as chairperson by the Minister without any role for the governing body or the vocational education committee in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider that the chairperson would be elected by the existing ordinary members and that it would be preferable to have the chairperson elected by his peers.</P>

      <P>The Minister is fond of saying one cannot have it both ways; this is a clear example of where he cannot have it both ways.  He cannot say one thing about the general principle of distancing himself from the board and, at the same time, run with this proposal.  I also want to make a distinction between the appointment of a chairperson and ministerial appointees to the board.  To say that instead of having ministerial appointees to the board that there is one appointee who has to be chairperson is not good enough.  This will create an anomaly in the education system.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke eloquently about the need for educational structures to elect their own chairpersons and he is at the point of insisting that that takes place at primary level.  It is also going to happen at post-primary level.  The vocational education committees operate in that way.  These colleges will be the only educational bodies I am aware of where the chairperson will be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> Can the Minister explain how he is moving in one direction at primary level where the board elect their chairperson, how we operate a similar system at second level where the vocational education committees elect their chairperson, while at third level it is done by ministerial appointment?  Why does the heavy hand of the Minister drop on this group and is it on this group only?</P>

      <P>I am glad to brief Senator O'Toole regularly on these matters to keep him up to date.  Senator Costello referred to ministerial involvement in the appointments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Where the Minister could reject a nominee.  There is good reason for this.  I put in a section to make sure of a proper gender balance on these boards.  I told the Dáil that I, and I am sure any successor of mine, would return the list to the various groups if it did not endeavour to have gender balance. The Minister would have no say in the name of the person appointed under these headings.</P>
      <P>Two students will be appointed; the Minister will have no say in their appointment. The Minister will have no say in the appointment of a person from the ICTU.  Two from the academic staff &mdash; the Minister would not pick the academic staff.  One from the non-academic staff &mdash; no Minister would get involved in that. Of the entire 19 members and the five organisations, the vocational education committees will decide if it is a local organisation and the local organisation will select a person.  The complete list goes on to the Minister to be rubber stamped from an overall national point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any of those organisations permitting any Minister to dictate to <Col N="1863" /> them who they should apoint to the governing body.  I reject the notion that the Minister has anything other than reserve powers and a rubber stamping role in the appointment of the 19 members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not see the vocational education committees, the staff, the students, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or the selected organisations letting any Minister tell them who they should appoint when they have the statutory duty to select the person themselves.  Save in the case of a national argument about policy, that reserve power would not be used and on the question of gender balance it is necessary to reserve power of refusal.  I hold to my line that the national representation is still one out of 19, even though I accept it is an important appointment.</P>
      <P>It may be possible, for example, occasionally to locate a major international educational figure who may be available because these are not only local and regional colleges; they are also national colleges.  Thus, it may be appropriate from time to time to appoint a chairperson of international stature who may be available to the Government or to the Minister of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that this did not happen anywhere else.  Under legislation the chairperson of Dublin City University, and of University College, Limerick is appointed by the Minister.  Both of those are fine third level institutions with excellent presidents.  The two chairpersons have shown wonderful leadership, so much so that they have attracted substantial private funding and the stature of the colleges has grown dramatically and rapidly.  Nobody would dispute the meteoric rise in stature of University College, Limerick and Dublin City University much of which is due to the national view of matters taken by their chairpersons who have led those universities forward.  I have the same <Col N="1864" /> hope and express the same wish for our regional technical colleges or whatever we eventually decide to call them.</P>
    <P>I challenge Senator O'Toole's allegation that my philosophy is being contradicted here.  It is not the same thing. A primary school or a secondary school is a local institution and it is legitimate to elect a chairperson in a local situation. These are national institutions, and for the national authority to have one, albeit an important nomination out of a total of 19 is entirely reasonable.</P>
    <P>It is important for us as national representatives not to take the view that democracy is the preserve of local democrats. People are elected to the Dáil, to the Seanad and some become Ministers through the democratic process, but when they try to exercise that democratic process, they are told that it is not democratic to do so.  This is the form of democracy we know; it is the one we built.  Why is it democratic for a vocational education committee to make an appointment and not for the Government of the day?  I argue here, as I have done in the other House, that it is democratic for the national Government to have a legitimate voice in the progress of these 11 fine colleges.  In time to come that small national input into regional colleges will have the effect of enhancing their stature. They have done well in the past and I wish them well in the future.</P>

I am not as familiar with Dublin City University but I take it from the Minister that it is going well and I am glad to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go back to the basic argument that people in the education business would probably be better at selecting a person who would know the requirements of education and with whom they could work.  These two new universities may have been lucky but we know, as the Minister knows, of a recent case where an institution did not have such luck with <Col N="1865" /> the chairperson appointed by a Minister. I am not sure what went wrong there.  I respectfully suggest that we are not going down the right road by having Ministerial appointments of chairpersons in these colleges.  In the traditional universities, and certainly in the college I work for, the Minister has a number of appointments but not that of chairperson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation the Minister described of somebody from outside coming in is the exception rather than the rule.  The danger is that the person brought in by a Minister from time to time &mdash; we do not know what is going to happen between Ministerial appointments &mdash; may be removed by him at any time.  There is no specified term of office. A new Minister may interfere by appointing a new chairman.  The danger is that someone who is an unknown quantity may be brought in from a totally different area with no previous contact with the regional college in question.  They may have experience of education but may not be knowledgeable about the needs of the area.  That could cause problems.  It was pointed out that in the past week the chairman of a certain body was asked to step down by the Minister because that person had lost the confidence of the board.  What happens if a person appointed by the Minister loses the confidence of the governing body?  Can they ask the Minister to remove that person? That is not referred to in the legislation. How do they operate if the chairperson is not in accord with the way they see the college being governed?</P>

The college graduates, people who know what is happening in the real world, and are part of it could provide a direct link from the workplace to the governing body and would bring <Col N="1867" /> their expertise, knowledge and experience to it.  This is an important amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 suggests a reduction from five to three in the size of the governing body.  Even having 18 members on the board makes it unwieldly. I have a very simple argument; the graduates, having come through the college, seen how it worked, gone into the workplace, can surely bring something of immense value to the college. That is the way it works in other third level institutions.  I do not understand why it was not included in this one also.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the concern of the two Independent NUI Senators to ensure that there is graduate representation on the governing body.  The section as it stands makes allowance for that.  Perhaps a more suitable course would have been to amend the list of organisations where the section reads: &ldquo;such organisations shall be representative of industry, agriculture, commerce, professions&rdquo; by the addition of the words &ldquo;and graduates of the college&rdquo;. The five persons included in paragraph (g) would then be nominated from such organisations by the vocational education committee.  Otherwise, we are talking about a very cumbersome exercise, as outlined in amendment 18, which I think is unworkable.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiments, I am sure that in whatever documentation the Minister will send to the vocational education committees, when they get down to considering organisations that would be represented, graduates could be mentioned.  I would not be in favour of the amendments as they stand.</P>

      <P>I am probably the only person here who has had experience <Col N="1868" /> of working on a governing body, on the NUI and on the Higher Education Authority. It is very useful for a college to be able to call on some of its graduates.  A much larger number were elected by our graduates than is proposed by Senator O'Toole in this amendment.  They have always been excellent contributors, coming from various backgrounds &mdash; teaching, the engineering profession, commerce, law and so on.  This is a very worthwhile proposal and I am happy to support it.</P>

These people are not my voters nor are they my members.  I have no connection with them, although I think they should have votes to these benches as well.  I would be open to that suggestion.  This formula has always been used in the other colleges and it was the graduates of the university who were elected.  It is a very clear, straightforward, neat reference.  I do not see the Minister's point, perhaps he sees something from a Fianna Fáil perspective which I do not.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the notion that graduates should have a say in the future of their colleges but I <Col N="1869" /> cannot accept the amendment because there are already 19 members on the board.</P>
      <P>It is more important at this stage to realise that these are not universities.  We do not know what will happen in the future or how they will evolve, but they are not universities.  There is a danger, given the university background of many Senators, that we might start thinking of them as universities and comparing what they do with what is done in UCC or UCG.  There is a need to include the professions, local commercial and agricultural organisations, industry, tourism, etc. on the governing bodies.  It is more important at this stage to have that spread than to include the graduates, even though they also have a legitimate role to play.  I do not think that we can fit them onto the boards given the spread we need to cover the other organisations.</P>
      <P>I am not sure about the logistics at this stage either, whether it would be possible to organise an election of graduates at an early date.  I think that might be difficult. Incidentally, I am told graduates are not represented on the governing bodies of the University of Limerick or Dublin City University.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy with the amendment. As a graduate of two universities, I enjoy my voting franchise when it comes to electing my representatives and anyone who graduates from a college, university or regional technical college, will always have a legitimate interest in the health and the welfare of that college.  I have to reject the amendment, however, because we have the governing bodies proposed and all the legitimate interests are very finely balanced.  It is something we could consider in the future but right now it would upset the balance that has been very hard fought for and negotiated.</P>

It would <Col N="1870" /> be easier for these colleges than for the traditional universities to operate this system because they have graduate lists. I do not wish to create dissent on the issue but I believe this facility should be avoided.  I will be looking out for my own future, but even I do not look 30 years ahead.  I do not see how anything in what I proposed that would copperfasten my position or get me any extra support.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the titles of these institutions.  Whether universities change in the direction of these colleges or vice versa, there will be a convergence of third level courses in the future; the colleges are likely to change their names to universities at some stage.</P>

She is asking for the appropriate gender balance in each individual group elected or nominated as members of the governing body under the relevant subsections.</P>

    <P>In making appointments to a governing body pursuant to subsection (4) of this section the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented and shall ensure an appropriate gender balance as determined <Col N="1871" /> by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, that is the first time legislation has imposed on the Minister a statutory duty to ensure gender balance on any board in the State.  That is a major step forward.  I insisted on that because that is a more practical way to handle the issue.  I argued also in the Dáil that to lay down that each individual group should have gender balance is too restrictive.

I told the Dáil that if, in my time as Minister, a list is send in which does not have that gender balance I will send it back.  I imagine, given the statutory duty, the Minister would have to send back such a list and insist on a list which had a appropriate gender balance. This will be a major step forward.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (6), between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) If a member of a governing body is absent from all meetings of the governing body for a period of six consecutive months he/she shall, unless his/her absence was due to illness or was approved by the governing body be disqualified at the expiration of such period from continuing to be a member os such body for the remainder of his/her term of office.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not sure about the wording of this amendment.  I thought the period I had included was four consecutive months. This would be the appropriate place in the Bill for an amendment reducing the allowable period of absence, although there is a reference to members of the governing body in the Second Schedule. The period of time could be shorter because, if somebody can be absent for a period of six consecutive months without any penalty he or she can be absent for most of the year, and each term of office of a member is only 12 months.  We should choose for the governing body people who have already indicated a commitment to the educational work for which they are nominated or selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have welcomed already the Minister's commitment to gender equity and gender balance, as outlined in various cases through the section.  On the day when the World Summit on Women is taking place in this city, it is totally unacceptable that once again we enshrine in legislation the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  That is offensive and unacceptable and it is out of character with the philosophy outlined by the Minister in his references to gender balance and gender equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that later on in the legislation it is stated that the governing body may decide what it is appropriate to call the person who chairs the meetings.  The Minister is giving the authority to the governing body to refer to the person who chairs the meetings by such title as is appropriate or they consider appropriate. That is simply passing the buck. The Minister is just refusing to grasp the nettle.  He is taking the word of the draftsperson in a way that is unacceptable. I am going to hang this around the Minister's neck if he tells me that the Interpretation Act does not allow him to change the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  I will certainly quote that back to him <i>ad nauseam</i> when this comes up.  If the Minister <Col N="1874" /> says he is sorry, he cannot delete the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; because the Interpretation Act contains that word, I would regard that a very poor response indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear about the many fine women who wanted to be called &ldquo;madam chairperson&rdquo;, who did not like to be called &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, or who wanted to be called &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  That is fine.  That is up to them.  I am not talking about those successful people who worked the system and came through it. I am talking about creating role models, both in written form and in real form.  By common consensus, the people advising governments and Departments in the area of gender balance and gender equity are opposed to the use of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. In the Minister's response perhaps he would indicate to me one advisory committee of Government on the gender area, who will support the use of the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  No such committee exists and if the fuddy-duddy draftspersons cannot get around that, it is time somebody grasped the nettle.</P>
    <P>This is an anachronism.  One part of this section refers to gender balance and gender equity and in another part of the same section we have enshrined in legislation the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; which is an outmoded, out-of-date term.</P>
    <P>I want to be clear on this.  Words mean different things at different stages of history. This is not just an attempt to make words mean something else.  We are talking about role models and acceptable language. This terminology is unacceptable to any of the groups who work or advise in this area and it is no longer relevant to 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague Senator O'Toole and remind the Minister that we managed to solve his problem in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, to the satisfaction of the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, where we did not use a term that would be offensive for the chair of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us reverse roles.  Imagine how all the men here who have chaired meetings <Col N="1875" /> of local authorities would feel if they were addressed at every meeting as &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo;. Imagine how uncomfortable they would feel, and how peculiar the term would sound to them.  Yet, somehow, all-male establishments, dominated by all-male thinking, can assume that because the term has grown into currency to encompass women it is acceptable.  It is a profoundly offensive use of language. Our language is riddled with profoundly offensive terminology.  The place to start to deal with this is the place where language is given its most precise meaning, which is in legislation, where words are supposed to have a very precise meaning, where terminology is supposed to have some precision.</P>
    <P>We are not involved with creative literature here although sometimes when one reads some of the subsections that parliamentary draftspeople put together one would be inclined to think it was more creative literature than serious legislation.  It is supposed to mean precisely what we want it to mean.  If we put the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; in legislation, what we are saying is the norm is &ldquo;man&rdquo; but we will allow it to encompass those who are not the norm.  The only way to reestablish a norm of gender equality is to cease using a term which is increasingly offensive and which is rarely used at any of the meetings of various bodies I have occasion to attend from time to time. Practically the only place it seems to be left current and untouched is in politics and it is time we got rid of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with this amendment.  In this House we have the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach and in the other House there is the Ceann Comhairle.  We avoid the problem quite nicely and we have done so for a long time.  I do not see why we could not do likewise in the Bill and introduce the term &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; if we want to find a neutral term.  We must address the point that it gives offence to have &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; as the only term specified in the legislation, irrespective of the gender of the person who will occupy the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> In the Electoral Bill, which we were discussing here last week, we found other offensive terms which the Minister concerned agreed to delete from the Bill. For example, the description of people as being of unsound mind, imbeciles and illiterate has been removed from legislation because it was seen as insensitive to the people so described.  In this case, we are on the one hand applauding the Minister for introducing the concept of gender equity this legislation and, on the other, the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; operates throughout.</P>
    <P>Nobody supports the view the Minister expressed.  Most women's organisations have expressed the preference for a neutral term or that there would not be a term associated with one gender.  The Minister should take that suggestion on board.  It would be a useful addendum to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the sentiments expressed but I have technical difficulties I think ensuring that there is gender equity in the composition of the governing body is more urgent and we have undertaken to do that in section 6 (5).  I thank the Senators for their support. As I said, this is the first time a statutory duty has been imposed on a Minister to ensure gender balance and gender equity on the boards of governing bodies.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the Green Paper on education has a very substantial section and a six point programme, which I have proposed for discussion, to achieve gender balance and gender equity throughout the education system.  This is urgently needed and very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer Senators to the Second Schedule which permits every governing body to call the person who chairs the board by such title as the governing body may determine.  What we can do is advise every regional technical college that they should take that section seriously and decide what they want to call the person who chairs their governing body; as I said, the legislation provides for the governing body to decide what to call that person but that does not go as far <Col N="1877" /> as Senators want.  The use of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; in the legislation is standard parliamentary drafting.</P>

      <P>This needs to be tackled at some juncture.  Having these two items in this Bill &mdash; the Second Schedule covers the point of the regional technical colleges having the authority to decide the title themselves &mdash; and the gender equity section is a step in the right direction.  I have never given Senator O'Toole a veto on what I say and I do not intend to do so today.</P>
      <P>Many a lawyer has argued what the Interpretation Act, 1937, means.  I am advised that it covers and affects all legislation enacted since then.  I said in the Dáil that I would welcome it if we were to amend that Act.  I have said that to my colleagues and I will continue to put that view forward.  I am not against what the Senator wants to do.  However.  I have a technical problem with the amendment. We could not just amend section 13; we would have to amend the legislation right across the board.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if women are agreed on what they want to be called, chairpersons, chair, cathaoirleach or chairman. I put forward very strong proposals on gender equity in the Green Paper and I anticipated the Green Paper by puting a gender equity section into this legislation. This might be the vehicle to discuss that matter and decide how to proceed in future legislation.  Once this Bill is passed, the governing bodies can proceed to call the person who chairs the board by any title they wish.  That is the essence of autonomy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister and I have been open in accepting the points he put forward.  The Minister mentioned the Interpretation Act.  I proposed a similar amendment to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and it was accepted; it is in legislation.  Therefore, the Minister cannot say there are problems with the Interpretation Act.  I do not care what advice the Minister is <Col N="1878" /> getting, the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; has been excluded and replaced by &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; in other legislation.</P>
      <P>It is true that there is no consensus as to what word should be used but there is consensus that the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; should not be used.  I ask the Minister to indicate any group who support the use of the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  It is completely wrong.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education paid for and supported a committee which looked at sexism and sex stereotyping in school textbooks.  They would not approve of the stereotype language enshrined in legislation.  It cannot be supported.  We could ask, what is in a name?  What is in a word?  I once held the view that &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; could mean man or women, but my views have since changed.</P>
      <P>On my first trip to the Labour Court a number of years ago I referred to the chairman as chairperson.  He said: &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. O'Toole, I would like to point out that I am not cathaoirleach, I am not chairperson, I am chairman. That is my title under the Act.&rdquo;  Every time I go there I have to refer to the person as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and it sticks in my gut.  In my view this wording is unacceptable and wrong by any standards and we should be progressive and change it.</P>

      <P>One of the logistics mentioned by the Minister was the Green Paper.  He said this would be a more appropriate forum to deal with it as there is reference to gender equity in the Green Paper.  We must point out that, to an extent, we have put the cart before the horse in presenting substantial education legislation before we have had an opportunity to debate the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should give example in this area. We can set up bodies to look into the question of gender discrimination and the need to ensure that structures are in place <Col N="1879" /> for gender equity.  We are legislators; we can enshrine the full range of gender equity in legislation and this would be an appropriate forum for doing so.  The real reason we cannot amend the legislation is that the Dáil rises today and there is <Col N="1880" /> no way the Dáil will sit next week to approve an amendment made by this House.  In other words, we are debating in a vacuum on this and other issues.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are related and may be discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (b), line 23, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of the vocational education committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here I propose to strengthen the position of the vocational education committee in relation to the governing body <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister.  If the governing body wilfully neglects to comply with any order, direction or regulation of the Minister he can take action against the body and arrange for its dissolution.  I want to include any order of the vocational education committee and in the second amendment that the Minister may not just in consultation with the vocational education committee but on the recommendations of the vocational education committee dissolve the governing body. The amendments strengthen the role of the vocational education committee in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to complying with an order of the vocational education committee as well as a direction or regulation of the Minister, there are sufficient powers given to the vocational education committee in the Bill.  For example, there are powers in relation to the various programmes, activities and budget of the regional colleges.  If in these important <Col N="1881" /> areas, the governing body does not conform with the wishes of the vocational education committee which is specifically responsible in relation to the colleges' budgets, activities and programmes, that would be a reason for sanction.  I ask the Minister to consider writing into the legislation those specific requirements so that the vocational education committees role will not be neglected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would provide that a governing body would be dissolved by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee, which I take to mean only on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  That would mean that the Minister would not have the authority to dissolve the governing body and, in effect, whether a governing body was dissolved would lie solely in the hands of the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 would provide for dissolution if an order of the vocational education committee was not complied with.  There are technical difficulties with that because there is no provision in the Bill for the vocational education committee to make an order in relation to a governing body.  If there is nothing in the Bill which says the vocational education committee can make an order, then I cannot put something into it which would provide for something to happen in the event of such an order being ignored.  I cannot accept that as it would be technically impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the recommendation of the vocational education committee, the dissolution of a governing body is an extremely serious matter.  As I said earlier, given that these are national as well as local institutions, I could not accept a situation where only the vocational education committee would be in a position to decide whether a governing body should be completely dismissed.  It would be a very rare occurrence and a very serious matter.  Given the seriousness of it and the national implications of dismissing an entire governing body, it is more appropriate that it should rest with <Col N="1882" /> the Minister of the day.  For that reason, I would not be disposed to accepting the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot argue about the amendment.  I read the Bill a couple of times but if the Minister says there is no provision in it for the vocational education committee to give a direction, I accept that.  His unwillingness to accept a process whereby a vocational education committee, which is a local body, would come to a conclusion and then recommend to the Minister to implement that conclusion, is a classic example of excessive centralisation.  If the problem is serious and fundamental enough to justify the dissolution of a governing body, it ought to be possible for a vocational education committee to come to that conclusion.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is effectively saying is that he does not believe he could trust the local vocational education committee to do what was necessary in the national interest or in the interests of education in the area and that he has to keep that power to himself.  Implicit in that is a presumption of superior knowledge at the centre over that in the locality which is, of course, the classic curse of centralisation &mdash; the presumption that there is an extra level of expertise at national level that does not exist locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know in the case of the regional technical college I work in that if there were such a serious issue the vocational education committee in Cork and the chief executive officer would be more capable of identifying the problem than the Department of Education.  I do not believe that there is such a reservoir of knowledge and expertise at the centre as to be able to make better, and more coherent intelligent judgments about Letterkenny regional technical college, Cork regional technical college, or Tralee regional technical college than could be made by the competent local body, the vocational education committee with the advice of the local chief executive officer. That is why it is right to sustain the local decision-making structure, and to bypass it is effectively to say that some sort <Col N="1883" /> of expertise exists at the centre that is better than exists locally.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The curse of this country is this presumption that centralised authority knows better than localised authority. There is no reason to believe that.  There is nothing from the experience of the State to suggest that any of the big Departments know better.  The local bodies may not meet everybody's criteria of efficiency but they are no less efficient than centralised authority.  They are just as likely to come to the right conclusions as centralised authority.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee ought to be the body to do the detailed investigation and to make recommendations. This proposal, though it was not the intention, is a classic example of centralising.  Interestingly enough, it seems to go against the spirit of a lot of what is in the Green Paper about devolution. The vocational education committee could do the job and recommend to the Minister, who could then carry out the recommendation if he wished, but here the Minister is saying that he or his officials know better than the local vocational education committee.  In most cases that would be quite untrue.</P>

      <P>To dissolve a governing body would be a very serious matter.  It is an unlikely event in any case, but it is important that the structure would be there to address such a situation.  The question of the involvement of more than one vocational education committee and some governing bodies is something that has to be considered.  The most fundamental point of all is that the vocational education committee would have the largest representation on the governing body.  It is highly unlikely that the vocational education committee would take a decision to effectively dissolve itself or dissolve the majority representation it would have on the governing body.  There is a fundamental point here.  We have to be conscious of the fact that it will not be an everyday occurrence.  I hope a governing body of any of these institutions will never have <Col N="1884" /> to be dissolved.  We have to appreciate the representation the vocational education committee have on a governing body and how it would work in the event of the dissolution of a governing body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator put it well.  It is a practical problem.  The vocational education committee would be asked to take a decision to dissolve a governing body on which they have six out of the 19 directly elected members and a further five nominated by nominating the organisations, that is, 11 directly and indirectly.  No vocational education committee will dissolve itself, as Senator Finneran put it.  The Senator is talking about a situation which is simply not acceptable; we would be asking the people who arguably are part of the problem to also be part of the solution.  It is not practical and that is why somebody else has to take the decision to dispose of the entire governing body.  Otherwise it is a self-policing system and it would not work in practice.  It would be meaningless.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 3 and 4, to delete &ldquo;appointed by the governing body&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to delete the word &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; as far as the academic council is concerned. My experience in my college, and it is the same in other colleges of the NUI, is that certain members of the academic council are <i>ex officio</i> members who are <Col N="1885" /> appointed to a certain post in college. The remaining members are elected by the <i>ex officio</i> members.  Given the wording that is here, we could not have the elections if the governing body is to appoint the academic council.  I would like to see the word &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 seeks to delete the word &ldquo;membership&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;number of members&rdquo;.  I do not feel very strongly about that, and I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 seeks to delete &ldquo;majority of&rdquo;.  If we had &ldquo;the members shall be holders of academic appointments within the college and at least one shall be a registered student of the college&rdquo;, I am afraid that would be contradictory, because I see a problem if we delete the word &ldquo;majority&rdquo;.  I had better withdraw that amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 seeks after &ldquo;college&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;elected by the academic staff&rdquo;.  I could support this amendment. I will press for this amendment to be accepted because it would be covered by the majority.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27, seeks in line 13, subsection 9, after &ldquo;college&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and elected by the student body&rdquo;.  The student representative would not be appointed by the Minister or by the governing body but would be elected by the student body.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 seeks to ensure that the remaining members would be nominated by the governing body.</P>
    <P>These amendments basically, are trying to give more democracy within the college and less dictation by the governing body as far as the composition of the academic council is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the appointment in section 10 (1) by the governing body does not contradict the idea of a selection procedure taking place; in other words, that the appointment only is made by the governing body but that the various categories can elect their representative. For example, a registered student would be selected by the student <Col N="1886" /> body.  Whatever regulations were made there would be provision for a democratic election process rather than simply having the academic council make a unilateral decision in relation to all the members and all the categories representing the academic council.  Can the Minister clarify the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is likely that certain academics would be <i>ex officio</i> members of the academic council and it is also important that different levels of organisational management within the institution be represented on the governing body or the academic council.  Therefore, it is necessary to have some sort of weighted representation.  Until Senator Raftery drew it to my attention, it had never crossed my mind that the governing body would pick those members of the academic staff and the student they deemed to be the appropriate representation to go on the academic council. The Minister should clarify that he does envisage some kind of election procedure to give representation to the academic staff and the student body.  It is important not just to have academic staff on the academic council but to make sure that at least some of those who are on the council have a representative capacity.  The student representative on the academic council should not be some sort of dog's-body nominated because the governing body approve of him or her. That person should be elected by the students to represent them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to student representation on governing bodies, the position is now that the students elect the president of the students' council and that person is then nominated by the Government.  That is my experience, gained from working on the governing body of University College, Cork.  That is quite acceptable to me but it would not be acceptable to me if the governing body or any body other than the students were to pick some student for representation on the academic council or governing body. Some members may have to be appointed <Col N="1887" /> by the governing body but if the Minister could give an assurance that at least a proportion of them would be elected by the staff and by the student body I would be happy not to press the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states that each college shall have an academic council appointed by the governing body and that each governing body may, by regulations made under the section, provide for the membership and terms of office of the academic council.  In the case of the student representative, in particular, if the governing body wanted to make regulations as to the way in which that student were to be selected they would certainly be able to do so.  If they wanted to provide for some electoral process for the students that could be done.</P>
      <P>I am interested in what Senator Raftery had to say about the NUI.  As I understand the charter of the NUI, the academic council is comprised of the president and the professors of the college, with lecturers co-opted by the president and the professors.  It is more of an assimilation system than one of open election.  By and large, the procedure involves academic staff who are responsible for the quality of the education in the establishment generally rather than being a system of elections in the traditional sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The academic council are not meant to be an alternative power centre within the institution.  The governing body are a highly representative and highly democratic body and to instal immediately under them a similar institution and to provide for elections to that institution would be a recipe for disaster.  The alternative power centre might be tucked in immediately under the main power centre, as it were.  That type of language is probably not entirely appropriate to regional technical colleges but the message is clear.  The role of the academic council is to protect the quality of the education in the establishment.  I would have total faith in a governing body who decide that certain members of their academic staff have a special role to play <Col N="1888" /> because of academic expertise, knowledge and experience and that it is not really appropriate for a college to throw itself open to pamphleteering, canvassing and elections in the traditional sense.  I do not think that is appropriate at that level of education.  It could be very awkward for the governing body if an openly elected academic council were to take a particular view of education that came into direct conflict with that of the governing body.  If Members reflect on the issue, they may realise that what we are aiming for is simply a quality control council, not an elected body with some kind of statutory power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that everybody and anybody from the college would be on the academic council.  What I am suggesting is that in the university system some members are members <i>ex officio</i> because of their appointments and in order to give a voice to junior staff these people should be co-opted after election, with the electorate being the present members of the academic council.  I think that would be a good way of doing it.  By no means are the academic council an alternative power structure to the governing body. They have totally different functions, some of which overlap.  The system has worked quite well.  Student representation on the academic council is a good idea.  Staff are not always aware of the kind of problems students have to face.  Certainly it is important for students to have a voice at governing body level but it is possibly also important that they have a voice at academic council level. The only way one could reasonably expect to have that function is for the students themselves to select the person they want to represent them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill gives autonomy to the governing body in so far as it is stated that they may by regulation decide the process of bringing people on to the academic council.  The draft of this legislation is an indication from the Minister that he has given great autonomy to the governing body.  It is a matter for the <Col N="1889" /> body themselves as to whether they set up structures for election.  That is not really a matter for this legislation, other than the provision of a framework by which the governing body can address the matter of the selection of people to the academic council.  The Minister is to be commended for allowing such autonomy to the governing body of these institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of the academic council of the Cork Regional Technical College but that has been in existence for a considerable number of years and several of their members are elected by the academic staff.  If the new governing body decide to dispense with those elections that will come as a considerable shock to the academic staff in Cork regional technical college and it will produce an immediate decision which will mean that the staff will decide not to participate in the academic council at all. They have got used to it, it has worked very well, and we have had no problems about alternatives.  Theoretically it is possible that somebody would think they were an alternative form of power structure, but since they do not have the capacity to spend a single penny, I do not think the academic council will be under any illusions as to where the power lies.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is on record as saying that he personally would prefer a system which did not involve elections.  I do not believe everybody should be elected to the academic council, but we now have the Minister for Education saying that he personally prefers &mdash; as I understood him &mdash; that there would be no elections.  If that becomes the norm, he is putting down a marker which will produce serious industrial relations problems in those regional technical colleges which currently have largely elective academic councils.</P>

In all those sections there are stipulations about inquiries and so on. There is a due process laid down which ensures that any such proposed dismissal is carried out with due regard to proper procedures and with proper regard to natural justice in giving the person involved an adequate opportunity to be heard.</P>

      <P>The reason for inserting the words &ldquo;and such persons shall not be used to replace academic staff&rdquo; is to ensure that part-time staff will not be used to replace fulltime academic staff.  We have seen the type of problems this has created in An Post and we do not want similar problems to arise in these new colleges.  I believe this amendment would safeguard that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Senator's sentiments but it would be wrong to restrict the flexibility of the management of the college in this area and I do not believe it is appropriate to make legislative provision for that type of detail.  The details of staffing arrangements are, of course, subject to negotiations which are going on all the time at national and local levels.  There are well established procedures and I accept the Senator's good faith in the matter, <Col N="1892" /> but it would not be wise to start legislating for the detail of when and where the staff could be allocated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It is an important point that no programmes, projects or activities to be engaged in by the college should result in any person being replaced and that it should not be used as a means where academic staff could find their positions being redundant.  Obviously, the new functions as outlined in section 5 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, indicate that there will be a wide range of activities undertaken by the college in terms of liaising with the business community, various projects, research and consultancy work, etc., and there could be a situation where a member of staff would no longer be necessary, dpending on work that might be contracted out or certain contracts entered into with the business community.  In that event this would no longer be necessary.  I hope this would not happen but it would be useful to have that phrase inserted in the legislation in case we come across some gung-ho director and governing body who simply goes down that particular road.  I believe this amendment is useful.</P>

      <P>I accept that we could not put constraints on colleges in relation to the appointment of part-time and contract staff and so on.  All third level institutions have very large numbers of these people.  What I want to safeguard against here is that this would not get to a point where permanent staff, by some creeping mechanism, would be replaced by part-time staff.  We have an example of it already in this country where a very important body has increasingly been replacing its permanent staff by part-time staff.  It is not good for the institution, it is not good for the morale of the staff and I do not want to see this creeping into the education sector.  Having said that, let me repeat, we could not function without part-time staff, we could not function without some contract staff at third level institutions, but I believe the <Col N="1893" /> essential core of permanent staff must be maintained.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) Existing procedures for conciliation and arbitration in the determination of pay and conditions shall not be changed other than by agreement of the recognised staff association and trade unions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My apologies for the late arrival of the amendments, but the House orders its business in such a way that one has to do these things from time to time.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment simply to invite the Minister to clarify on the record his intention that, in principle, the existing system of conciliation and arbitration which applies to the staff of the regional technical colleges, in so far as pay and conditions are concerned, will continue to operate.  Is it envisaged that it will continue to operate when their unions represent them in the future as they will then be officers of the college rather than officers of a vocational education committee? I am a member of the Teachers' Union of Ireland and this matter has been raised by them.  It needs to be clarified that there is no intention of departing unilaterally, and in this specific case, from conciliation and arbitration.  I know the Minister for Finance has great plans to reform the conciliation and arbitration scheme but that is a separate issue, one for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I would like the Minister to clarify that the existing procedures of conciliation and arbitration will continue until such time as they are subsumed into a new overall body.</P>

      <P>Do the Minister or the Government have any plans to get rid of this offensive terminology of &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo;?  It is an increasingly meaningless distinction.  There are employees of the college who are highly skilled and highly qualified who are classified as &ldquo;servants&rdquo; while other employees of the college who are far less skilled and qualified are classified as &ldquo;officers&rdquo;, simply because of their jobs.  It causes profound offence to the people who are highly skilled and highly qualified &mdash; in some cases with three years third level education &mdash; to be told they are &ldquo;servants&rdquo;, which is a particularly offensive phrase.</P>

      <Col N="1895" />&ldquo;Following consultation with&rdquo; is meaningless; if it said &ldquo;in consultation with&rdquo; I could accept it but they could come to any decision after &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a major decision as to what extent you provide for vetoes, as it were.  It is a standard provision which deals with existing staff.  It provides it so that the college can, after consulting with the trade unions, redistribute duties.  The amendment would provide that this could only be undertaken following the agreement of the unions as opposed to consultation, which would be very restrictive.  In effect it would be saying to the trade unions involved that their absolute agreement would be required. Without deciding which side has the veto, the requirement to consult is probably the better language given the relationship between management and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has a problem with the section. &ldquo;Following consultation&rdquo; is fairly weak phraseology because what follows is: &ldquo;Every such officer or servant shall be bound to perform the duties allocated&rdquo;. The Minister may have the merest consultation but, irrespective of what the decision may be between the positions and the perceptions of the Minister and the trade union, then the &ldquo;servants and officers&rdquo; are bound to perform the duty. There are no criteria listed as to whether those duties will be similar to those already undertaken by the staff, so it could result in their being redistributed or rearranged substantially differently from the way they had been before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand there could be very minor consultation and on the other very major redistribution or rearrangement.  I am not sure if the correct balance has been achieved.  It seems to shift in favour of the college having a very strong hand in the matter, but it seems to preclude individual employees or indeed their representative body, staff association or trade union from having a say.  This <Col N="1896" /> section may lead to enormous problems in the future when divisions occur and when head office staff as well as academic staff find themselves in new roles, which they had not envisaged, because of the amalgamation.  This would be true in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional colleges.</P>

      <P>I raise these matters which are always dismissed as unrealistic but it would be a great help to efficiency if, as well as having rules and regulations about when programmes should be submitted to the Minister, the Minister was to agree that we would also be bound by some commitment as to when he would give responses to these programmes.  It is very much a one-sided set of regulations where the college must produce a programme and a budget under a fixed schedule.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is the major source of funding and has a major role to play.  I spent six years on the board of management of the regional technical college in the days when subversives like myself were allowed on the governing bodies before the Minister decided to classify us with bankrupts and thieves.  In those days one of the problems was a long wait, in which the college and the vocational education committee operated in limbo for a while.  It would be a great help to decision-making if the Minister had put into this section some provision about &ldquo;a reasonable procedure&rdquo; as to when decisions would have to be taken.  As it stands there are no deadlines by which decisions must be made.  I do not see why he should claim the right to be as inefficient as he wishes when he expects a different performance from everybody else.</P>

I do not think it is as serious as the Senator suggests because the budget and the programmes will have an automatic starting date.  If they come in on 1 March they will start from a certain date, they will not just run on.

      <P>This is the most welcome provision in that whenever an officer of a vocational education committee is to be suspended, he or she may be paid salary, in contrast with the present position when they can be suspended for a period of years with no salary.  I may have missed something here but in the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill the phrase &ldquo;notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944&rdquo;, an officer of the institute is referred to.  In section 21 here it refers to an officer of a vocational education committee.  Where in the legislation am I to take it that an officer of the college is an officer of the vocational education committee for the purposes of this section of the Bill?  I understand that is the intention but I cannot understand why officers, members or staff of the college are not referred to in this Bill.  It refers to an officer of the vocational education committee rather than the staff of the colleges. I have not read the Bill as thoroughly as the Minister so I may have missed the reference to officers of the college or officers of a vocational education committee, being classified as officers of the vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow a student to be elected for a second year.

      <P>I would like to know why I am not fit to be on the governing body of Cork regional technical college where I spent most of my working life.  What is wrong with me that I cannot serve on it? Senator Norris is eligible to serve on the equivalent authority in Trinity College, Dublin; Senator Murphy is entitled to serve on the governing body of UCC and on the Senate of the National University of Ireland.  I am entitled to serve on the governing body of UCD, UCC or the Senate of the National University, but apparently I am not entitled to serve on a governing body where I work, where I might have something more to contribute. I am intrigued by this.</P>
      <P>The sequence of disqualifications in this section is profoundly offensive &mdash; I do not care whether it was the most convenient way to describe it &mdash; but to list three qualifications in paragraph 5 (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>(2) A person shall not be eligible to be a member of a governing body if that person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein, or</P>
      <P>(b)  is for the time being a member of the European Parliament, or</P>
      <P>(c)  is an undischarged bankrupt, or</P>
      <P>(d)  within the immediately preceding three years has, under the protection or procedure of a court, made a composition or arrangement with creditors, or</P>
      <P>(e)  within the immediately preceding five years, has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are there three anti-social activities, bankruptcy, being in jail, and being a Member of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament.  To say the least, that is insensitively drafted, it is illogical and <Col N="1902" /> meaningless.  I still want to know why UCC is so different from the Cork regional technical college that Senator Murphy can serve on its governing body but I cannot be on the Cork regional technical college governing body. Indeed, I could get myself elected by the graduates to the governing body of UCC. I think that provision was inserted because the Minister did not notice. Every time some such circumstances arises somebody in the parliamentary draftsman's office inserts this prohibition on Members of the Oireachtas.  It is time the Minister or somebody else sorted this out.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Raftery and Ryan.  It seems ridiculous to have these categories of people excluded. The juxtaposition of the various categories leaves a lot to be desired, but I do not think that there is any deliberate intention on the part of the draftsperson to exclude Members of the Oireachtas; it would appear to be a throwback to old legislation.  It is something that has not been adequately examined.  It is confused with membership of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>In a sense, it appears to have a new ministerial involvement in the regional technical colleges.  We must ensure that we delete the prohibition on Members of the Oireachtas because they will have a vested interest in the matter.  Of course, that is irrelevant to the real issue.  I would ask the Minister to delete those categories of elected representatives to the Houses of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament.  If local representatives can be members of governing bodies, prohibit somebody who has been elected to a national Parliament?  It is ridiculous. There is no justification for their exclusion.  The Minister should accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>Obviously this is not aimed at any particular Senators or Deputies; they have given very good <Col N="1903" /> service on boards at every level.  There is a clear policy issue here, not a personality issue, as to whether national legislators can take part in the activities of the boards of the colleges and semi-State companies.  It is a long established principle. Everybody has a different view on it.  As was rightly stated, this is a standard provision in the University of Limerick, DCU, and in the case of any Government or major institution which reports to the Oireachtas and comes under the authority or remit of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a public representative, I am not overly enthusiastic about an erosion of our opportunities.  Nevertheless there is a policy issue involved here, which is that legislators should not be directly involved in the management of institutions that report to the Oireachtas and we may need a longer and fuller debate on that. Perhaps that should be taken up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or somebody else.  I accept that this is now becoming standard practice in the <Col N="1904" /> case of a State body like the NCEA, the University College and the DCU.  It applies not only in the commercial world; it applies throughout the education system also.  It does not apply in the case of universities and so on; they were established under a 1908 Act; some were established under Charter, the Charter being reconfirmed under the 1908 Act, so it is a different legislative base.</P>
    <P>In modern times this seems to be the norm.  I would welcome a debate about that principle.  However, it does not apply only to education, it applies to the principle of whether legislators should be appointed to the board of, say, Bord Fáilte or any other such body.  It is a principle we, as legislators, need to debate in a broader forum, in a more determined way.  For example, should we be eligible to State appointments or not? It is a bigger issue than the provisions of this Bill.  I am merely adopting the standard approach until we resolve that issue.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;School&rdquo; is a new term here.  We have 11 individual regional colleges, one institute, directors of colleges and heads of schools.  All of the principals here have lost their former designation as such but the principal of the Crawford College of Art and the principal of the Cork School of Music do not become directors but heads of school.  What does that mean?  Does that change their terms of employment?  What are the salaries and conditions for heads of schools <i>visá-vis</i> the newly appointed directors of the colleges?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to explain the logic behind designating these institutions collectively as the Dublin Institute of Technolgy while getting himself involved in a complicated mess of schools in Cork in order to hold on to the definition of a Regional Technical College there?  The regional technical college, Cork incorporates a school of music, school of art and a large overcrowded regional technical college.  Logic would suggest that the situation in Cork is closer to an institute of technology as defined here than to a regional technical <Col N="1909" /> college as defined by the Regional Technical Colleges Bill: There is no appropriate place to discuss this matter because they are two different Bills and, therefore, I must use one or the other.  What are the criteria by which schools are amalgamated as a regional technical college rather than as an institute of technology, or is it all about lobbying the Minister?  I cannot see objective criteria here in terms of levels of complexity, levels of academic activity or numbers of students. It is meaningless to incorporate a school of music and a school of art, with separate existences, into an regional technical college and, in my view, to downgrade them in the process in order to avoid the logic of extending the definition of &ldquo;institute of technology&rdquo; beyond one place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology Bill deals with the establishment of a new institute comprising six colleges, an entirely logical coming together of these colleges into an institute of technology.  There are approximately 9,000 students in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  The Senator described the situation at the regional technical college in Cork and that is a separate institution.  I am not clear on whether the Senator suggests that I combine the regional technical colleges into an institute of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on whether it is the number of colleges, the number of students or the level of academic activity that leads the Minister to believe <Col N="1910" /> that in this case, six institutions should be combined into a new institution, whereas in Cork, three institutions are amalgamated into an existing institution. I would like to know the basis of this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of it is dictated by practicalities and working relationships. The Dublin Institute of Technology has been so described for ten or 15 years.  The concept of these six colleges working closely together and offering complementary and compatible courses has evolved over time and now fits.  The colleges are satisfied with it and the colleges taken together offer the broad range of technology &mdash; some of it ancillary that should be available in an institute of technology.  It was not a case of sitting down and trying to design an institute of technology.  In this case the Dublin Institute of Technology evolved and it makes sense to describe it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case, but we are addressing the Dublin Institute of Technology here and trying to get that formally established.  The other regional technical colleges around the country complicate the position in Cork; their situations are not the same.  There are 9,000 students in these six colleges who have been working closely together for a long time.  If a Cork institute of technology with schools attached to it were to emerge, then so be it.  That would have to be looked at and decided on separately.  It would not automatically follow the evolution of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is a separate issue and could be looked at another time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 3, after &ldquo;training&rdquo; to insert&ldquo;, including apprenticeship education,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We felt it was important to include the words &ldquo;including apprenticeship education&rdquo; because I understand that in the Dublin Institute of Technology there are about 5,000 apprentices.  So, given the contribution made by apprenticeship training, it would be appropriate to enter it in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken account of that. &ldquo;Apprenticeship&rdquo; is fully covered by the present provision in section 5 (1) of the Bill.  It states:</P>
      <P>the principal function of the institute, subject to the provision of this Act, will be to provide vocational and technical education and training.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the phrase &ldquo;vocational and technical education and training&rdquo; includes and fully covers apprenticeship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, my amendment in the Dáil requires governing bodies &mdash; and I agreed this with the vocational education committee Association &mdash; to have regard to the statutory responsibilities of the vocational education committees as applies to their functions under the 1930 and subsequent Acts.  There is a requirement on governing bodies to have regard to the vocational element of vocational education committees and I am satisfied that that covers it.  I resisted inclusion of the word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; in the Dáil and will do so again because the meaning of the word is changing so much here and throughout the European Community, <Col N="1912" /> that the word may not necessarily be suited to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on this matter because it was discussed at length in the Dáil and I understand that the Minister will not accept the amendment. We are trying to introduce the specific designation of apprenticeship education because that describes a large part of the work done by the six colleges that make up the Dublin Institute of Technology and to leave it out suggests that it may or may not be dealt with by the new institute.  There may be an argument for it to be dealt with at second level rather than third level colleges.  That is not being addressed.  The Green Paper is not clear on that.</P>
      <P>The only way one can ensure it is addressed by the institute is by putting it into this legislation.  There is a great deal of concern among the training agencies about the block release of apprentices for educational purposes and the educational input that goes into training.  We want to specifically refer to apprenticeships otherwise this could result in the educational content being diluted so that it would become training and its specific attachment to this institute would enhance the apprenticeship in the educational sphere.  That would be a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator is making but technical education and training are generally regarded as including apprenticeships. The only reason I am resisting the word is that its meaning is changing and will change dramatically over time; it is rather old-fashioned in that sense.  I am satisfied that the phrase &ldquo;technical education and training&rdquo;, combined with the statutory responsibility the governing body has with regard to the vocational education committees statutory duties, which includes technical education and training, achieves the same result the Senators <Col N="1913" /> want, and is better in terms of the wording of the Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 9 to 11, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) to confer, grant or give degrees, postgraduate degrees, diplomas, certificates and other educational or honorary awards&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a most substantial amendment. The Minister dwelt on this point to a degree, under the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  I do not want to take from the regional colleges in any way, but it is more important here in terms of the range of work, the variety of courses and the specialist areas of operation of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The inclusion of degrees as part of the award mechanism of the institute, whether they be primary, post-graduate or hononary degrees should be an essential part of the new institute, which will be the largest third level institution in the country. It would be a shame if, while we give it the status of being an institute and a statutory basis, we should at the same time deny it the one element that will confer that status on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international study group on technological education recommended that there should be a new institute with the power to confer awards.  That was the direction in which the Minister was advised to go.  Approximately 20 per cent of the awards are made in liaison with Trinity College at present and 20 per cent through the NCEA.  The other 60 per cent of diplomas and certificates in various courses are made by the institute <Col N="1914" /> itself.  Instead of having to rely on either the NCEA or Trinity College, the Institute, in its own area of speciality and professional expertise should now be allowed to confer its own degrees.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say there is provision under subsection (2) (a) for him to allow the change to take place. Let us not leave it like that.  Anything can happen in a year or two.  There may be a new Minister and new ideas might be discussed.  There have been three Ministers for Education within a short period.  Whatever good intentions the Minister may have at this time, this is the opportunity to put them in place.  This could be a feather in the Minister's cap. He would be remembered as the person who insisted that this legislation should confer on the new institute the ability to confer degrees, primary, post-graduate, or honorary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the difficulties of having all these new regional technical colleges awarding degrees.  There was a certain logic in that and I can accept that, but the same logic does not apply to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It has a long tradition of teaching to degree level and conducting research for Master's degrees and PhDs. What is the reason for denying them the authority to grant their own degrees?  The products of the Dublin Institute of Technology are well known nationally and internationally.  I fail to see why the Minister should not take this opportunity to accept this amendment to grant authority to the Dublin Institute of Technology to award their own degrees, as well as diplomas, certificates, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology will be given degree awarding powers and my target, subject to discussions, would be that within 12 months, we might be able to arrive at that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need that time because we are undertaking a major reorganisation of the <Col N="1915" /> Dublin Institute of Technology, the integration of the six colleges into a single structure, and putting in place a new governing body and academic council.  It is appropriate that, before we take that final step we should have an opportunity to consult with the new governing body and the academic council as to qualitative matters and, generally, how we might proceed.  I would like the new governing body and academic council to be part of that final feather in the cap of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>There is no other reason.  It is a pragmatic approach.  If we do all this work now, leave the authority to do it by order, set ourselves a 12 months target, it will not have to come back in legislation; the Minister can do it.  I do not see any reason I or any future Minister for Education would demur from this.</P>
    <P>The colleges have given very fine service and have turned out generations of highly qualified graduates of which I, and I am sure everybody else, can be proud. This would be the final accolade for the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There is no hidden agenda, it is simply a matter of getting all this work done and then, finally, giving the degree awarding powers, after we have had an opportunity to talk to the new governing body and academic council about matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly everything the Minister said agrees with our position that this should take place as quickly as possible.  The Minister says his timescale is 12 months.  I hate to say it but he may not be here as Minister for Education in 12 months time.  I am not suggesting that he would be demoted or anything like <Col N="1916" /> that, but there has been a considerable turnover in the job in the recent past.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the legislation that suggests a timescale, unfortunately. Indeed, there is not enough in the legislation to suggest that it is wholly at the behest of the Minister for Education, either; it requires the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  I would be worried that the Minister for Finance might ask the Minister for Education what it would cost to give this institute the power of conferring primary and post-graduate degrees by way of new laboratories, research facilities, etc.  The Minister for Finance might be reluctant coming up to the Estimates at the end of the year when finances are not in the best of order.</P>
      <P>All of what the Minister said in relation to having the governing body in existence and getting the show on the road does not balance out against the necessity of putting in place the substantial powers that should be conferred on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This is the substantial power the institute and all associated with it want.  They recognise the ability to confer a primary degree, to confer a higher degree, to confer an honorary degree as being, as the Minister put it, the feather in the cap of the institution; it would also be a feather in the cap of the Minister who gives the power.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything the Minister might say would convince me that this is not the time to do it.  Even at this late stage with less than an hour to go before the guillotine falls, I appeal to the Minister to allow this one amendment which would have a very substantial and a beneficial effect.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I raise this matter because of the potential risk to public health being caused by the spread of this weed.  In Latin it is called <i>heracleum mantegazzianum</i> and was introduced here as a Victorian garden plant.  The problem is that it has now spread to invade several river valleys and it is predicted that it will go on to invade waste ground.  The danger to public health arises because the sap of the plant contains phytotoxim which causes a type of burn and this renders human skin sensitive to ultra violet light so that the effect is like permanent sunburn.  People can become sensitive to sunlight for the rest of their life as a result of coming into contact with this plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the warning to sunbathers that they run the risk of getting skin cancer so there must be a similar risk associated with burns from giant hogweed.  Children are expecially vulnerable, particularly where they use the stalks of the plant as blow pipes.  I understand it is possible to be stung even through a T-shirt.  The worst affected areas are Dublin city and county, north Wicklow, parts of Kildare, Limerick city and county and I understand the Barrow <Col N="1920" /> Valley, Sligo and Galway are also affected.  I am also advised that part of the Newport river in Tipperary has been abandoned by the local angling club because of the weed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Department of Agriculture and Food have a very rigorous procedure for establishing the safety of chemicals used in agriculture. These chemicals would be dismissed out of hand if there was the slightest risk of causing cancer or even a risk of causing skin rash or dermatitis.  There is a conclusive case for taking action to eradicate giant hogweed.  There is widespread public concern about this plant.  It grows to a height of about 13 feet.  Angling clubs are also concerned and I understand the matter has been brought to the attention of various Government Departments by personnel of the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, has agreed to deal with this matter because I understand several people were reluctant to deal with it.  We must not allow the problem to be put on the long finger and be kicked around between different Government Departments and county councils.  Parts of Europe are seriously infested with giant hogweed which has formed blocks of several hectares of dense plants in certain areas.  It has been the subject of an international scientific conference and one botanist I have spoken to believes it will multiply in Ireland exponentially; in other words there will be a population explosion of the weed.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be entitled to argue that giant hogweed is not on the list of noxious weeds and, therefore, it is not within his power to control.  This is a more serious problem than treating the plant as a noxious weed and I urge him to intervene with whoever is responsible to eradicate this plant.  I recommend that a survey be carried out by his Department and the Central Fisheries Board or some other competent body to establish the extent of giant hogweed, where it is growing and its rate of spread.</P>
    <P>I also believe that it is possible to control this weed relatively cheaply.  Gly-phostate <Col N="1921" /> which is sold in this country under the trade name of &ldquo;Roundup&rdquo;' could be used to control giant hogweed. It is a safe chemical to use in waterways and it is safe for users.  It would be best to start at the highest point in a watercourse and working downstream because the weed is spread by the seeds being carried in flood water and deposited on river banks.  I heard earlier today that in Denmark it is being spread on the roofs of cars by people taking it home as a souvenir.  It is a very heavy seed and gets carried around the country in this way.  By spending a few thousand pounds on a chemical which could be sprayed by a knapsack sprayer, the hogweed could be kept under control.  This may be a matter for the Department of the Environment or the county councils, but I appeal to somebody somewhere to take responsibility for dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>I feel like St. Jude, the patron of hopeless cases.  I regret my reply will not be a satisfactory response to what is a very serious matter raised by Senator Dardis. It has been the subject of a buck-passing exercise between one Government Department and another.  I hope between Senator Dardis and myself that we will try to put the responsibility on some Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator was correct when he <Col N="1922" /> anticipated my reply; it is not a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food.  While it is not technically described as a noxious weed, nonetheless it is a weed that is a cause of considerable concern to the parents of children and to the public generally.  The fact that Senator Dardis has demonstrated that this weed is on the increase, is propagating on a regular basis in new areas, is a timely warning to all of us that we should take steps to have it eradicated. It is important from a public health point of view because children have been affected by it.  It has caused rashes and irritation of the skin and the eyes. Environmentally it is an objectionable weed and it creates a blot on the landscape.</P>
    <P>I propose to take up the matter with the Departments of the Environment and Health as we can no longer engage in a buck-passing exercise.  I would like some Department to be responsible and, in my view, it should be the responsibility of the Department of the Environment because the weed grows on the roadside and is not environmentally acceptable.  I propose to have immediate discussions with the Minister for the Environment whom I know will treat the matter seriously. Should Senator Dardis find it necessary to raise this matter again, I hope we will be able to say how the problem will be resolved.  I give a commitment to pin down, within the overall area of public administration, who is responsible for dealing with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of the need for the Minister for Justice to assign additional gardaí to Bray as a result of serious incidents in the town of Bray in recent weeks and months.  I am not referring <Col N="1923" /> to an isolated incident which happened this week.  Bray is an emergency case in terms of law and order, business, commerce and tourism.  The crime rate in Bray, which is alarmingly high, is obviously damaging the town in many ways.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the front page of this morning's <i>Bray People.</i> It reads, &ldquo;Handgun Drawn During Carnival&rdquo;. That most unfortunate incident occurred this week as a result of which four youths were detained, a handgun was found, at least one garda, perhaps two, were beaten up and some reports in newspapers have referred to at least 35 people being involved.  At the moment the numbers involved are still, unfortunately, unclear but we know this was a serious incident.  One of the problems is that there are not enough gardaí on the beat, especially when the Bray Festival is taking place, and many visitors come to Bray.  If this were an isolated incident I would not be asking the Minister for additional gardaí.  I am asking for more gardaí in Bray on a permanent basis because this type of incident has happened before and will happen again.</P>
      <P>I make this appeal to the Minister because the damage being done to the town of Bray as a result of these incidents is extremely serious in the long term.  The town is already suffering from an acute commercial crisis, severe unemployment and now endures a crime level and a level of violence which has, unfortunately, hit the headlines nationally and locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously Bray is dependent on tourism and commerce.  In terms of tourism, the incident last week is something to which we should respond immediately in order to reassure those who visit Bray, not only from Dublin, but from overseas. There are many foreign students in the town of Bray at present.  An incident such as this will inevitably reach people abroad and will discourage foreigners, as well as Irish people from coming to the town. We need to reassure people who are <Col N="1924" /> thinking of setting up commercial ventures in Bray or visiting Bray that immediate action is being taken because we are putting more gardaí on the beat since it has been proved in the past few years that the number of gradaí assigned permanently to Bray is insufficient to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>It is almost a ritual in this House to say this but I do not wish for one moment to criticise the gardaí in Bray or anywhere else.  In fact, the rate of crime detection in Bray is extremely good.  The problem is prevention.  Once crimes have been committed in Bray they are almost always detected, particularly the high profile cases.  That can give the town a bad name; we might be better off if they were never detected because then the town would not be highlighted.  It is essential that emphasis be put on crime prevention in a town that is increasingly assailed by the criminal fraternity.  Bray is vulnerable because it is on the DART line.  Criminals travel on the DART and make morning and afternoon raids.  There are many commuters resident in the town and their houses are vulnerable to be burgled as a result.  The Minister should be aware of the problem in Bray.  There may appear to be a relatively large Garda presence in the Bray area, but it must be remembered that they have to cover Shankill, Greystones, areas of Kilmacanogue as well as Bray town.</P>
    <P>My own informal soundings on this is that despite the fact that there may be at any one time what appears to be a large Garda presence in Bray with three community gardaí, one permanent summons server, one juvenile liaison officer and one warrant officer, if you take away the two members who are permanently assigned to the patrol car and the one in the station, the maximum number on the beat is one.  Therefore, in the town of Bray, with a population of nearly 30,000, there will only be one Garda on the beat at any particular time and in a town with a large population and with an unfortunate record, that is not good enough if we <Col N="1925" /> are serious about combating crime and making people feel safer in their beds.</P>
    <P>The key to the problem is prevention, not detection.  There must be a permanent Garda presence.  We have had crisis after crisis, gangs are able to roam the street unhindered because they know there are not enough gardaí in the area.</P>
    <P>What we saw this week, unfortunately, is the apex of a crisis which continues to surface in the town of Bray.  I raise the matter today because if nothing is done, if we do not have extra gardaí in the town, similar incidents will happen again and again.  It is no coincidence that this problem hit the national newspapers on several occasions this week.  It is not a local issue.  The town is getting a bad name and for the sake of the residents, the business community and everybody connected with Bray, immediate action is required to curb crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister fully appreciates the concerns expressed by Senator Ross regarding the incident which took place in Bray on Wednesday night.  In the course of his contribution the Senator mentioned incidents which have been taking place in the town over recent months and I will convey that concern to the Minister directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would like to commend the Garda Síochána for their response to the incident which occurred last Wednesday night.  As six people were arrested following the incident, two of whom are still in custody, and it is likely that prosecutions may follow, the Minister is reluctant to comment further at this stage.  Bray has a large local police presence with some 60 gardaí, an increase of three over this time last year.  Extra members in patrol cars are drafted in from outside the area to increase the Garda presence as and when additional resources are required.  The allocation of garda manpower is a matter for the <Col N="1926" /> Garda authorities.  They have informed the Minister that they keep the law and order situation in Bray under constant review and they are satisfied that the numbers and resources assigned to Bray at present are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Bray, like many other towns, has experienced difficulties like this from time to time.  Unfortunately, and regrettably, it is a small minority of people who engage in this type of activity and who give a bad name to a town generally.  I would be disappointed if a small minority of people in Bray, as indeed in any other town, might behave in a manner that would give the whole town a bad image and name.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the town of Bray on a personal basis.  I have been there on several occasions and I agree with Senator Ross that it is a town with excellent opportunities for increasing tourism and attracting industry.  It is an ideal location for the attraction of industry and it is regrettable that people behave in this fashion and put the prospects for further advancement of Bray in jeopardy by giving a name to the town that it does not deserve.  I can assure Senator Ross this evening that I will convey his remarks directly to the Minister for Justice and if there is need for further communication I am sure the Minister will communicate with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his reply and I know he understands the situation very well.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Justice to ensure that if the situation continues or incidents like this recur, that consideration be given to changing the emphasis from detection to prevention. The real problem, as I explained to the Minister of State, is that there is probably only one garda on the beat and the people of Bray would like to see more gardaí on the beat.  Perhaps the Minister of State would convey to the Minister for Justice that the people of Bray would appreciate <Col N="1927" /> it if more gardaí were on the beat at this critical time, while fully aware of the good work they are doing behind the scenes.</P>
