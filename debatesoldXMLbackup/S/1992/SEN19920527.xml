      <P>I have notice from Senator Ó Cuív that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to review the method of means testing social welfare applicants who live with their parents or who get casual part-time work.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to improve the facilities for the education of autistic children at James Connolly House, Blanchardstown, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify his recent statement in relation to his concern about the Government's ability to maintain their present level of social welfare schemes and funding.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Murphy of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to explain the involvement of <Col N="1690" /> military contingents in religious ceremonies.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Cuív, Upton and Murphy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ó Cuív's matter and Senator Upton's matter regarding facilities for the education of autistic children and they will be taken at the conclusion of business today.  Senators Upton and Murphy may give notice on another day of the other matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Last Friday I asked the Leader of the House if he could get some information for me of the Government's intentions on a particular piece of legislation. He promised me then that he would convey the feelings of all parties on this side of the House &mdash; and, I suspect, also the views of his partners in Government &mdash; on this matter and that he would come back with information.  I wonder if he has anything to add to that.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if it is proposed to take other promised items of Government legislation this session, especially the Family Planning Bill, and also if he can find out from the Government when the proposed White Paper on Marriage Breakdown will be published.  All of these have been promised before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate what I said last week about the need for the House to have a programme of legislation <Col N="1691" /> from the Leader to cover the period from now until the end of this session.  It is important that we have that in a structured way and I appeal to him to provide that programme.  I welcome the fact that we will have a special motion tomorrow afternoon, as was intended by the Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>In regard to the matters raised on the two minute sessions, I think there needs to be some form of reply, whether it comes from the appropriate Department or wherever.  There needs to be a record of a response in some way or other and I ask for that to be done.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to consider for the motion on Thursday of next week the question of the events in Northern Ireland in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, echo the concerns expressed by Senator O'Toole in relation to the need for some reply to be made to the items which are raised on the two minute statements.  That is very important. I would also like the Leader to clarify for us what criteria he is going to use when he is selecting items under this heading of topical items to be taken on Thursdays and indeed whether he is going to consult with the other parties in relation to what will and will not be taken under that heading.  Finally, may I ask the Leader what the present position is in relation to the Control of Dogs Bill being debated in this House.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when he proposes to order the special debate on the west of Ireland which he promised.  Some weeks ago he indicated that it could possibly be dealt with within the context of the debate on the Culliton report.  I subsequently indicated to him that that would be unsatisfactory as far as I was concerned and he gave me an undertaking to have a special debate on the issues being debated at the various meetings being convened by the bishops in the west.  I would like him to be explicit as to the day and week that debate will be taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the <Col N="1694" /> Leader when he proposes to have Item No. 44 on the Order Paper debated in the House?  The Leader is undoubtedly aware of the great significance of this motion which relates to the maintenance of the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital and the status of that hospital within the new Tallaght Hospital.  This is of extreme significance to a very large body of people. It would be an absolute disgrace if this House were not to properly address this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Manning and in relation to item No. 42, I am assured that it is still very much a part of the Government's programme along with the Family Planning Bill and the White Paper.  I sincerely hope that this House will get an opportunity even to initiate the type of legislation that is suggested.  I have no doubt that between now and the end of this year we will see that legislation coming to either House.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned a legislative programme.  I want to assure him that I will come back to him during the week on that.  We have an extensive legislation programme for this House in the coming months.  We will have to discuss with the Whips how far into the summer we intend to go.  I have had requests from several Ministers to ensure that their legislation would be dealt with between now and the summer recess.  I am sure the House would want to accommodate that.</P>
      <P>In regard to Standing Order 29A replies, I made a statement last week at the end of the two minute discussions that I would write to the said Ministers and Departments and seek a reply.  I want to assure the House that I have done that. I await the replies and will forward them to the Senators.</P>
      <P>With regard to the topical debate, I would have thought that the Whips and the leaders would discuss the type of issues.  Tomorrow's issue was suggested by Senator Doyle a few weeks ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from forgetting, I <Col N="1695" /> remembered her suggestion which is more important than anything else.  That is why I am delighted it is on the Order Paper this week.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have been informed by the Department of Finance that they will be forwarding a wording for a motion on a debate on the banks in the coming week.  I hope we will have that and Common Agricultural Policy, as our debates next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to the item on famine and regional policy, I would like to tell Senator Staunton that we will have a debate on regional policy outside of the Culliton report.  I have replied to that a couple of times.  We will formulate some wording that will meet the concerns the Senator has expressed.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Reilly, item No. 44 was dealt with last week on the Adjournment debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was fairly well debated on the last occasion.  Very briefly, it relates to the granting of votes to emigrants.  May I reiterate a few of the points which I made on the last occasion and in particular stress the fact that the voting rights which were to be given to Irish emigrants were to be given to those Irish emigrants who are also Irish citizens. It is not a <i>carte blanche</i> granting of votes to every Irish person who has left this country at any time.  The proposal limits the granting of votes to those Irish people who retain their Irish citizenship. When I was speaking on the last occasion I emphasised that we have obligations to our citizens.  We are delighted to pursue those obligations and to make a big deal out of defending our duties and defending the rights of our Irish citizens, as in the case of a person such as Brian Keenan who found himself in terrible circumstances in the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this amendment can be made to work.  There is a lot of goodwill around.  I am sorry the Minister was not in a position on the last occasion to give us some more definite indication of his views on the matter.  If I remember correctly, he did indicate that the Government had an open-minded attitude on it. I would think that this is an excellent opportunity for the Government to get down to brass tacks and put some firm proposals on the table in relation to how this proposal of granting votes to emigrants can be made a reality.  It also gives <Col N="1697" /> us the opportunity to do something definite and tangible for Irish emigrants after years of sentiment, goodwill and all this fuzzy loose stuff.  This is an opportunity to give them a real say in this country and it seems to me, to be in accord with the wishes of a very large number of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Upton is really saying is that we must lay some salve to our conscience for feeling guilty about emigrants.  I still maintain after a week's profound reflection that it is a nonsense to talk about admitting people to the franchise who have no responsibility for the country any more. That is what it boils down to.</P>
      <P>I have also done some research into the horrific dimensions of the problem, were it to be taken seriously, which I hope it is not by the Government.  I would refer the Seanad to a National Economic and Social Council publication of March 1991, No. 90, at pages 58 and 59, and an article called &ldquo;The Economic and Social Implications of Emigration&rdquo;.  In that article there is a very sober and very conservative attempt at estimating the number of Irish born people abroad. With respect to Senator Upton and not having the knowledge at my finger tips, I doubt very much if there are significant numbers of Irish born people abroad who are not also Irish citizens.  As I understand our category of Irish citizenship, it is very generous and very wide indeed.</P>
      <P>I found it quite difficult to find an answer to the question: how many Irish born people are there abroad?  We talk about our huge exodus and so on, and Harold Wilson used to boast that his constituency of Huyton had more Irish people than in the whole city of Dublin, but when you try to find out how many Irish people are actually abroad, it is quite difficult to find the information. That is why I have given the detailed reference of this NESC publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on net emigration, those who are abroad and have not come home again and so on, the most conservative estimate is that there are between 500,000 and 700,000 Irish born people in Britain.  The British Embassy itself has <Col N="1698" /> given me a top off the head guess of one million people in Britain.  I do not know how many of those are not Irish citizens, to come back to Senator Upton's point, but I would imagine extremely few.  That is the dimension of the problem in Britain alone.</P>
    <P>In the United States again the most conservative estimate is of 150,000 Irish born people.  I think that is way below the reality.  There must be many times 150,000 Irish born people in the United States.  Let us assume there are only 150,000.  The same NESC publication estimates that there is at least the same number worldwide &mdash; in Australia, etc. &mdash; we are talking <i>in toto</i> of at least 1 million possible electors and, if we are to take this proposition seriously, probably nearer to 2 million electors.  Here we are talking about the same electorate that already exists in the State.  How are you going to make fish of one section and flesh of the other?  Where do you draw the line?  As I said the last day, why should you say five years' residence abroad is the cut off point?</P>
    <P>One of the things that does not impress me about these amendments, among other things, is the failure of their movers to give us any idea of what they are talking about, any idea of how long they are going to suggest as a residence abroad period, a cut-off point and so on.  Clearly this has not been thought out at all.  I would suggest to both Fine Gael and Labour that they should challenge a division, that they should force a division on these amendments, and I would challenge the Government to react accordingly. Then perhaps we would know what they are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion on this on the last occasion.  I indicated that the Government are examining the question of voting rights for emigrants.  The matter is under active consideration and it may be expected that the Government's position will be made known at an early date. I have nothing further to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is <Col N="1699" /> really a non-reply.  I have listened to Senator Murphy with great interest.  In spite of the fact that the amendment from my own party runs contrary to what he is proposing, I think there is a great deal of logic and reason in the argument made by Senator Murphy.  If all parties are being honest with themselves I think we all realise that this proposal of votes for emigrants was born out of a sense of guilt which people had in his country in the face of the enormous haemorrhage of emigration and an inability to do anything about the problem itself.  There was a very popular sense that we could make some amends by giving these people a vote.</P>
      <P>As Senator Murphy and others have pointed out, even if with the best will in the world all parties here agreed in principle that for five or ten years Irish people who had emigrated should have a vote, the sheer logistics of that would make it virtually impossible.  It is difficult enough at present to keep track of postal votes.  Nonetheless, I think there is a very substantial problem here.  Our amendment is designed to draw attention to that problem.  We have a responsibility and there is a duty on us at least to recognise that virtually all of those who have emigrated have done so involuntarily and that very many may wish to come back to this country.</P>
      <P>What my party have proposed as an interim recognition of this problem &mdash; not a solution of it &mdash; is that this House be extended to 65 or 69 seats and that a certain number of those extra seats be given to our emigrants, elected through an electoral college.  This would be less cumbersome, there would not be the same time pressure, so our emigrants could avail of that.  This is something which exists in the French Senate: French people overseas are able to elect a certain number of members of the Senate.  This is not an off the top of the head solution or proposal; it is one of a number of proposals that should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that the proposal in the amendments, either that of Senator Upton or of Senator Naughten, if put to <Col N="1700" /> the test of practicality probably would not work, rather than add another unenforceable, unworkable piece of legislation why not accept the principle that this State should in some way recognise that the voice of our emigrants be given some sort of official statutory platform in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Let us then look to this House to see how that could be made possible.  In a time when we are all talking about the possibility of Seanad reform perhaps we could then look at some way of giving an effective voice to our emigrants through a new electoral college which would perhaps be organised on a regional basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because this was discussed last week at some length.  I think the suggestion put forward by Senator Manning is one that is worthy of being looked at.  I hope that will be the end of the discussion on what I think are really rather far-fetched amendments.  The Labour Party have singularly failed to really go into any detail on what they are suggesting or what its size is likely to be.  Senator Murphy has endeavoured to do that as far as possible by putting some figures on it, but I think this proposal would be unworkable.  I do not know how anybody could try to contact these people who would be eligible to vote.  It does not seem feasible.  It seems to be a little like the restrictions on the freedom of information. We always all knew it was going to be totally unenforceable.  I think this is somewhat the same.  This would be totally impractical; it simply could not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment designed to enable emigrants to be registered and to vote in elections here.  It is essentially an enabling amendment; the qualifications and the practicalities can be slotted in afterwards without difficulty. To some extent it is a test of principle, of whether we are serious about emigrants' voting.  It seems as if a large number of people are not serious about it which is fair enough because in the case of Senator Murphy his honesty <Col N="1701" /> is one of the qualities which has distinguished him in Irish life; that and his capacity to face up to hard choices.</P>
      <P>If we walk away from this suggestion then we walk away from the quasi sentimental notion that it would be nice to give emigrants votes.  This amendment would put that into practice; it would enable it to happen.  Practicalities can be filled in afterwards but it would get us down to the brass tacks of deciding if we are for or against it.  I am disappointed at the tone on this side of the House and at the desire here to walk away from that position in principle.</P>
      <P>I do not accept all these declarations of impracticality and so on.  Of course there will be practical difficulties but other countries have been able to face up to similar difficulties and resolve them. In the United States of America it is possible to vote from outside the country.</P>

      <P>If we have a high number of emigrants that is our problem and our failure.  The fact that there are large numbers of Irish emigrants is not sufficient reason to avoid our obligations to them. We indulge in sentiment about the great Irish and all they have done all over the world, but we cannot have it every way. We have had no hesitation on occasions in cynically exploiting the goodwill of those people towards Ireland, drawing them back for ethnic weekends, ethnic tours, ethnic holidays and so on.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for an acknowledgement of that goodwill in principle; the practicalities of how it would work can be slotted in afterwards. I ask those who are voting it down or who are against the idea of votes for emigrants to state their position in relation to the young people who have left this country in the last three or four years.</P>

We seem to be turning our backs on them and walking away. We do not discourage their sentiment towards Ireland nor the emigrants' remittances, as they were once called, although that phrase appears to have gone out of the language now.  When it comes to giving those people a say in how things are done here, we say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  When we say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that, we are also saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to real consideration for the welfare of emigrants, when they leave this country they do not count; they have no vote and in the last analysis, no say.</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt that over the years we have largely ignored our emigrants and there is a deep feeling of alienation and bitterness among them.  I had the privilege over the last few years of visiting many emigrant communities where I found this to be the case.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Manning's and Senator Murphy's reservations about the practicalities of implementing this amendment. The numbers elected by the Irish emigrants abroad would be sufficient to tilt the Dáil and Seanad in any given direction.  We must face up to this consequence; it may not be the most popular thing to say but many emigrants, particularly in America, take a romantic view of Irish nationalism and of the possibilities of reunification; the fourth green field is often mentioned.  As a Senator living close to the Border with Northern Ireland I would be concerned about an Oireachtas that would be influenced by a vote that could result in a certain type of nationalist from abroad being sent to this Parliament with an unrealistic perception of the set of relationships prevailing on this island and of the relationship between this island and Britain.  That possibility would have to be considered seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition my party put forward articulated here by Senator Manning that <Col N="1703" /> we give emigrants an input into the Seanad is a practical initiative that could be taken as a starting point.  It seems totally impractical to elect vast numbers of people to the Irish Parliament from outside the country.  The point has been raised about the difficulty of establishing a cut-off year, will it be five, ten or 15 years?  Who would be a suitable emigrant to vote?  The amendment is worthy because it recognises the frustrations and alienation of emigrants who left unwillingly. It merits consideration but it is impractical and we should use it to recommit ourselves to a more profound interest in the emigrant community through increased grants and support.</P>
    <P>We should go ahead with Fine Gael's proposition for Seanad representation for emigrants although it is fraught with danger.  I visited New York on a parliamentary delegation of which Senator Bennett was a member and she will also be acutely aware of the absurd perception of Irish politics and the Northern situation prevailing in Irish communities in New York, particularly around the Bronx.  I noticed then and during my previous summer there that the Northern question is seen in terms of baddies and goodies and the High Chapparal; it is believed that we have an enemy to get rid of.  It would be dangerous if people who were emotional about this matter were to send over similar representatives to this Parliament.</P>

      <P>I was the first elected representative to make a case for votes for emigrants a number of years ago. I made a conscious decision not to get involved in this debate because I have been through it many times but I have listened to such clap-trap this week and last week, revealing a lack of knowledge as to how the system works that I wonder are those speakers living on the same planet as myself?  We are within a month of the referendum on European Unity and we have just finished welcoming a delegation from Bavaria.  Let me remind the House that if we join the European Union before the end of this year we will <Col N="1704" /> be one of only two countries in the Union which does not make provision for votes for emigrants and the only country to make no voting provision for members living outside the State.  I have heard no argument here that could not be demolished if I were to take a couple of hours to do it.  To say that we have more emigrants than any other country is not correct.  Italy has far more emigrants than we do and Italy gives right of franchise to emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bavarian delegation were here half an hour ago, a Chathaoirligh. National newspapers in Bavaria during the German elections of the last 18 months featured full display advertisements for three consecutive days inviting citizens of West Germany &mdash; as it was at the time &mdash; to vote in their elections.  The Australian Government did likewise in the last few years and also the United States Government and none of these countries has any difficulty with the practice.</P>
      <P>Let me dismiss this nonsense about 30 or 40 million people voting in Irish elections.  This is an enabling amendment to allow votes for emigrants.  It does not say nor can it be interpreted to mean that everybody who sails out to sea will have a vote in elections here.</P>
      <P>Let me give some of the fail safe measures that other rational countries employ to make sure that we do not all go daft and allow 40 million people who left here 40 years ago to vote.  That is not intended by this proposal and was never mentioned by Senator Upton or by any of the people who support voting rights for emigrants.</P>
      <P>I heard a statement here last week by an Independent Member that the essence of democracy was no participation without taxation.  I never thought I would hear in a democratic Assembly that those who may not be liable for tax or who may be unemployed would not be entitled to participate.  That is the logic of that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> There is no reason why we should not do as the Danes do and insist that all emigrants with votes contribute tax.  That is their fail safe approach.  How do Italy deal with 55 or more million emigrants? Very simply.  If one wants to vote in Italy, one goes home to vote which cuts out millions of emigrants.  One has to be registered in Italy and in the parliament. In other countries one has to be registered at the local embassy and one must go there to vote.  Other countries insist that voting can only take place at home. The Spanish constitution contains three pages on voting procedures for emigrants. The Italian constitution also deals with the issue.</P>
    <P>It is not a constitutional matter in this country.  We can give votes to emigrants without making any change in the Constitution; it requires only a minor change in electoral law where it stipulates that a voter should be normally resident in a constituency.</P>
    <P>In this country at the moment, the legislation which denies emigrants a vote is being flouted by every political party at every election.  Every time a bus leaves Dublin to take a group of voters to Dingle, Ennis, Sligo or anywhere else, it is as much in breach of that law as if the people came back on a plane from Manchester.  I have listened to much nonsense over the past couple of weeks on this issue and I wish people would look into their hearts and become aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>If voting emigrants would overrun the Irish electorate, let us prevent that.  Let us restrict it as other countries do to a specified number of years following emigration; it could be for five, ten, one year or for a generation.  The US allows second generation people who have never lived in the country to vote at home.  To me that is nonsensical but the issue here is one of principle.  Do we allow emigrants to have a say in the running of the country that eventually excluded them from participation?  We excluded them from participation because we could not provide them with employment. These people did not choose to leave.  I do not know of any other country <Col N="1706" /> where the native diplomatic corps do not have a vote.  I now accept the Minister's indication that they do.</P>
    <P>Travellers abroad do not have a vote nor do people abroad on business.  If I happen to be on business out of my constituency or out of the country on 18 June, I cannot vote in the referendum. I put it to the Minister that no other European country applies these restrictions. That shows a lack of flexibility.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by Senator Upton can be addressed and dealt with and the principle agreed to.  A question of numbers can be dealt with by a restriction on years abroad or by a restriction in time. The numbers of possible voters can be dealt with by a restriction on travel, insisting that people come home to vote, or by allowing them to go to their embassy to vote and to register there and also in their own constituency.  It is not difficult to resolve these simple administrative matters.  Accepting this amendment would not enable 40 million additional people to vote in Irish elections.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for agreement on a principle.  After that we may decide on restraints on time, years, generations, on whether to insist on voters paying taxes here as Denmark does.  We could insist on people coming home to vote as Italy does, or restrict it to those not long out of the country as Belgium does.  I could go on and on but suffice to say that if we join the European Union we will be the only country in Europe making no provision for emigrant representation.</P>
    <P>I have made a survey of the voting arrangements made for emigrants in the 12 EC countries.  We are the country which shouts loudest about loving our emigrants, which makes the biggest deal about them and which does least for them.  We have a duty to give emigrants a voice in the democratic process, a voice which will also restrain us.  It would force us usefully to address the issue put so well by the previous speaker of the four green fields.  That political problem does not arise for people who have been out of this country for the past five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> I have spoken to emigrants in New York, as most of us in this House have who believe that the longer they are away, the clearer their view becomes; one deals with that by restricting votes to those most recently emigrated.  One proposal from an emigrants' group is that the restriction should be five years.  Another was that it should last for a generation and another was that voters should continue to pay tax here.  Another proposal provided for travelling home to vote.</P>
    <P>I have seen all these proposals and it is just not for people to dismiss them out of hand by talking about 40 million voters in an uninformed response to a sophisticated proposal to change this legislation.  The people who propose it here should take some time to look at ways in which it has worked in other countries and look at ways of ensuring that we are not overrun by 40 million people abroad but that we address the crucial issue of emigrant participation.</P>

      <P>In response to what Senator Upton said, it is not fair to say that those of us who oppose this motion are turning our back on our emigrants or that we are any less concerned about them than he or anybody else in this Chamber.  Our emigrants want a job in this country, not a vote; they want to be able to come back to live and to work here.  Senator Upton has not spelled out what he has in mind.  I have no idea of what the implications here might be. Senator Murphy gave us some idea of possible implications but I do not think that it would be practicable in our situation to implement this proposal.  Italy is having difficulty at the moment forming a Government which may well be because of the emigrant vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two principles at stake here.  The first is whether, under certain circumstances there should be vote for emigrants.  My party support that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it is incumbent on those proposing a radical legislative change to <Col N="1708" /> explain in some detail how it would operate. The amendments are blunt in their import and simply recommend votes for emigrants.  Senator O'Toole, in his usual calm, dispassionate way, spelled out some of the options available and some of the safeguards used elsewhere.  We could talk about this all day but the essential point is to decide if we are in favour of the principle.  Let the House divide on that and I am happy to support the principle.</P>
    <P>Those proposing this major change should get together to detail specific ways in which it might be enforced.  I would be happy to do that for Report Stage with Senators Upton and O'Toole.  We could compile a list of possible qualifications and fail safe measures.  I do not consider it a big deal that Italians can travel back to vote in elections.  That might favour well-heeled electors but others less well off would have no vote.  These implications need to be teased out and a proposal which spelled out the limits and so forth would facilitate rational, sensible debate rather than some of the extreme reactions we have witnessed here recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's distinction between the intention and the practical implementation of these amendments.  I have no difficulty with the principle.  Citizens have a right to vote. That is enshrined in the notion of citizenship and people who retain their citizenship, even though they may live abroad, should have the means to vote. I do not believe, despite anything that may have been said while I was engaged elsewhere, that there are 40 million citizens of Ireland resident outside the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as a result of the inflationary atmosphere in the Chamber. When I came back from a consultation I heard Senator O'Toole say it is claimed that there are 40 million Irish emigrants.  I <Col N="1709" /> know that 40 million people in the United States claim Irish descent but it has been diluted in most cases.  I understand the hesitations here and the perception, for example, that people who do not pay tax should not have a major say in determining policy in a state to which they do not contribute money.  This is the reverse of the old idea of no taxation without representation, for which there is something to be said.</P>
      <P>I do not favour general representation and I am not aware that anybody here has drawn an analogy with a constituency in which emigrant voting already clearly works.  We on the backbench here have good reason to know it; it is the University seats in Seanad Éireann.  We have not only a 32-County or a European constituency, we have a global constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not negligible.  It may be in the Senator's case but I spend much time dealing with the interests of voters from the United States of America, Australia and Canada.  There is a healthy number of people there who retain their votes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the North of Ireland a substantial number of people voting in Seanad elections are normally resident in the North, do not pay taxes to this State, claim citizenship here and it is one of the strengths of these seats that we are virtually, if not entirely, the only democratically elected element that draws its strengths from all 32 counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable energies have been expended debating this matter and a certain sharpness appears to have crept into the debate with regard to the number of emigrants, etc.  I was recently in Australia, in the United States of America and in Europe and everywhere I go, I meet emigrants in favour of voting rights who are not exclusively university educated. In Sydney a couple of months ago I was approached &mdash; and I was only there for about four days &mdash; by a group of people who have set up their own newspaper there, who identify strongly with Ireland and who were most anxious to <Col N="1710" /> have a vote in Irish elections.  I put to them the possibility that they might have two seats in Seanad Éireann and they did not regard that as sufficient.  In fact, I thought they were rather tactless in what they had to say about the powers and role of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy, with his charming intellectual honesty, combined with electoral indiscretion, has said exactly what they said.  They said they were rotten boroughs.  Of course you and I, a Chathaoirligh, know that they are not.</P>
      <P>Emigrant voting is a serious issue on which there is strong feeling particularly among people who have recently left Ireland.  What a criticism of our political system, that we are apparently terrified that so many people have emigrated that they might swamp constituencies.  Is this a real Government fear?  If so, what a commentary on the current health of Irish political and social life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of a fruitful experience in the Seanad University seats, I suggest that some consideration be given to making two or three seats here available to emigrants so that their voice might be heard.  That suggestion would resolve the problem of representation without taxation because this Upper House is precluded constitutionally from spending money.  Therefore, it could not be contended that elected people could spend the tax revenue of citizens fortunate enough to remain here.  There would be no requirement for people to travel back and university graduates at least are fairly literate and are able to sign the requisite documents and to return them by post. Why should there not be a postal ballot for two or three seats in the Seanad made available through embassies, consulates and so on in different parts of the world? This is perhaps a rather rough hewn suggestion but I make it to support Senator Manning's sensible suggestion. Many of us, not only on this side of the House, but in Fianna Fáil also feel that some modicum of representation should <Col N="1711" /> be given to emigrants and I think there would be substantial agreement that some machinery should be found to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning is right to say that the principle should be looked at first.  I am certain it would be agreed here and the Minister has given an undertaking that he will look at this matter which suggests that he is not against such a proposal.  After the principle was adopted I suggest to those considering amendments that they incorporate a suggestion that this House may be the most appropriate vehicle for affording representation to emigrants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that emigrants are not looking for a modicum of representation in Seanad Éireann; they are looking for substantial franchise in Dáil constituencies.  They are after real electoral influence and power.  It is a nice idea to think of giving them seats in Seanad Éireann but&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support the idea of representation in Seanad Éireann because it is a nice gesture.  It does not violate the basic principle which I articulated on the last day.  In fact, I demolished this case most effectively the last day and I do not want to go on and on about it.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am opposed to the principle that emigrants should be represented.  People who are not resident in the State, who are living and working in other countries should not have a substantial say in electing a Government and a Parliament in this country.  I am totally against that.  Most people would oppose it too except that votes for emigrants is the flavour of the month and people feel guilty about not supporting it and go on and on about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Manning dissenting from Senator Naughten's amendment.  It is a piquant situation that the Leader of Fine Gael in the House should disown the Fine Gael amendment <Col N="1712" /> on the Order Paper but it illustrates, since compliments are flying this afternoon, Senator Manning's integrity and honesty. Where the figure of 40 million came from God only knows.  As Senator Norris has suggested it probably is related to that inflated figure of the number of Americans who claim Irish descent but how it slipped into the category of possible voters I do not know.  As far as possible, I gave the figures suggested by NESC, of the number of emigrants now living abroad and they are horrific in terms of the problems they would present in giving emigrants the franchise.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said he could go on and on, but on a fine afternoon we are grateful he did not because when he is in full flight &mdash; the Senator's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling &mdash; it is a bit hard to take. He did not go into detail of what he was suggesting; he flung out fine rhetorical dashes from this country but he has not tabled an amendment.  Senator O'Toole did not put down any specific suggestions as to how we could give emigrants a vote. Like Senator Manning, I look forward to Report Stage when Senator O'Toole will, hopefully, give us more detailed figures.  In the meantime, I am more than ever convinced that the position I have taken is the right one.  I did not expect that we would spend so much time on these amendments, but I think it is right that we have done so.  This is the first time, in either House, that votes for emigrants have been given any kind of airing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting debate.  Is there any chance that the Opposition might agree to this in private? I am amused by the contribution of one Senator who appeared on our most popular television show recently discussing the issue of votes for emigrants.  He was more convincing today than he was on that show.  The consensus of opinion on the show was that representation from people who were living abroad for a number of years was unacceptable to the majority of people in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have experience in dealing with emigrants over the past 20 years or more.  When I was chairman of the local <Col N="1713" /> authority in Westmeath I visited emigrants in New York, Toronto and London to keep in touch with what was going on.  For the previous 20 years I spent approximately two weeks in every three months in cities and towns in the United Kingdom and I know the problems facing Irish emigrants.  During the past 12 months, a considerable number of those who emigrated in the past five years have returned; I would go so far as to say that possibly 40 per cent have returned.  Some people emigrated because they could not find employment here but others emigrated to gain experience.</P>
    <P>The information available on voting abroad by nationals of other countries suggests that the number of electors is small.  For example, in the United States, which has an open-ended system the number of overseas electors represents less than 1 per cent of the total electorate. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, the numbers are insignificant, well below 1 per cent &mdash; in the UK it is 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent in Germany.  Canada does not allow emigrants to vote.</P>
    <P>I would like the Government to give some recognition to emigrants right to vote; I understand they are considering that.  If someone has been living abroad for ten or 20 years in my view they are totally removed from what is happening here and what the new Ireland is all about.  The new Ireland is much different to that of 20 years ago.  It has been transformed.  There have been great progress and development here in recent years.  I was delighted to hear Senator Manning say he was in favour of not giving the well heeled emigrants the right&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or advantage to come home when our less fortunate brothers and sisters cannot afford it.  I remember touring Scotland and seeing massive signs and posters on the streets stating that if anyone wished to vote for a certain Donegal TD, buses and boats would be <Col N="1714" /> leaving at a certain time.  All we have to do is look at the masses of people who leave the city of Dublin to travel home at election time to vote.</P>
      <P>Everyone has a right to vote, but one has to be on the register for 12 months. Therefore, in a five year period the number of people involved would, be small, approximately 60,000 or 70,000 people.  If only 10,000 emigrants voted they could decide the destiny of 15 Dáil seats, a significant number, and could change a Government.  We were told that Italy gave its emigrants the vote.  Italy has the most unstable Government in the EC.</P>
      <P>I am totally in favour of our emigrants being given recognition &mdash; possibly in Seanad Éireann &mdash; but in relation to the Dáil, the right to vote is vitally important to those who will be living on this island and making their living here in the foreseeable future.  A change of Government can affect those resident in the Twenty-six Counties and hopefully in the long term &mdash; the Thirty-two Counties. Because of a lack of resources and other difficulties here, the might of PR and the propaganda machines in other countries could be used to give emigrants' a different view of this country.</P>
      <P>This is a sensitive issue, but, in principle, I support the Government giving favourable consideration to emigrants having a voice in Seanad Éireann.  There their views could be expressed and given national coverage as proceedings are televised and the press could give them the recognition they deserve.  However, I would only consider giving the vote to those who emigrated in the past five years because people who emigrated earlier will be out of touch with what is happening here.</P>

He said that he was in favour of the principle, but then he qualified that by saying the principle he is in favour of is supporting the Government on the matter.  I would be much happier if he said straight out that he is in favour of the principle of representation or votes for our emigrants qualified, as it undoubtedly will be, into a particular time frame, and a set of fail safe circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have not consulted with Senator Upton, but I am sure he will agree that if the Government could say today that they favoured the principle enshrined in the two amendments, and if they came back on Report Stage with their own set of ideas as to how this could be operated in practice, with all of the restrictions and so forth, we could have a meaningful debate.  At the moment we are debating this in a vacuum because we simply do not know the Government's view on the matter.  The Government are playing it both ways; they are saying that they are in favour of votes for emigrants, but not yet; therefore, there is not much point in debating this any further.  If the Government say they are in favour of the principle, let us wait until Report Stage and talk about it then, but if they are against it, we should end the debate now.</P>

      <P>Basically, I want to reiterate what Senator Manning has said in relation to details being added later.  If the Government are not in favour of the principle they should say so and at least we would know where we stand.  As far as we are concerned, this amendment was put forward to establish whether the Government are for or against giving votes to emigrants.  I accept that there may be a need to tidy up the details later and given that we are meant to be discussing this amendment with Senator Naughten's which provides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Precisely, and there is a provision in Senator Naughten's amendment to tidy up this whole matter.

      <P>Some Senators have said we are dealing here with a matter of principle.  This is not correct.  We are dealing with a specific amendment and the amendment is the only matter on which the Seanad can make a decision today.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to the reference to representations in the Seanad.  The Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with represenation in the Seanad.  This is a Dáil Electoral Bill and the amendment proposes to give votes to electors in Dáil elections; therefore, many of the points made are not strictly relevant.  In the absence of a number of Senators we covered all those points last week.  Representation for emigrants in the Oireachtas raises fundamental questions including constitutional qustions.  In fairness to emigrants and the resident population, any arrangement that might be decided on would have to recognise the difference between those who reside permanently in this country and those who, for whatever reason live abroad.  The difference relates not only to the representation-taxation question but to the entire circumstances of emigrants including jobs, wages, housing, health and welfare, the environment and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of whether we are for or against emigrant representation.  It is a question of what is possible within the constitutional, legal and practical constraints and what is appropriate and fair to emigrants of whatever duration as well as to the resident population.  The Government are giving the fundamental issue involved careful consideration and I hope their position will be made known shortly.  At this stage, I am not adopting a position either for or against emigrants voting.  In the circumstances, I ask the <Col N="1717" /> Seanad to reject these amendments and allow time for the Government to complete their consideration and adopt a position on the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 29, to delete &ldquo;national&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very straightforward and simple amendment.  We propose that the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; be deleted and substituted by the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;.  To some extent we have tabled this amendment to obtain clarification from the Minister in relation to why citizens in Ireland are referred to as &ldquo;a citizen of Ireland&rdquo; whereas for member states the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; is used.  Why is there a difference in the wording?  Would it not be better to use the same terminology in both cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 relates to the registration of European electors.  It provides that a person aged 18 or over who is normally resident in a constituency, who is a citizen of Ireland or a national of another member state of the EC, shall be registered as a European elector. The section repeats existing law without any change.  Amendment No. 11 provides for the substitution of the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; for &ldquo;national&rdquo;.  Section 2 of the Bill defines the term &ldquo;national of a Member State&rdquo; as having the meaning assigned to in the EC treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty establishing the European Community uses the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; throughout rather than the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;national&rdquo;, therefore, <Col N="1719" /> has a specific legal standing in the context of Community law which the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; does not have.  If we change over now and use the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; we could be introducing an element of uncertainty which could not be determined by reference to EC law.  No matter how complex the relevant law may be, the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; has an ascertainable meaning in the context of the European Community. The word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; does not appear to have such an ascertainable meaning.  Our domestic law must aim for certainty in so far as this may be possible. For this reason we must use the recognised word &ldquo;national&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; which may not have a precise meaning as an EC context.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 12 in the name of Senator Upton.  Amendment Nos. 12 and 13 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 34 to 46, and in page 18, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the rights of students to be registered in more than one constituency.  Essentially we are suggesting that subsection (1) be deleted. The effect of this would be to allow students to register in more than one constituency.  The practicalities of students being registered in just one constituency means that they will be confined to being allowed to register only in their home constituency.  In the case of students who are living in big cities such as Dublin, Cork, Galway or Limerick, in practice, even if they are on the register <Col N="1720" /> at an address this year, by the time the register becomes available in all probability they will have gone to live somewhere else.  They will have finished their courses or they will be located in some other part of the city.  The background to this relates to a constitutional case which was taken by a student in the Waterford Regional College some years ago which resulted in them being allowed to be registered at their college address and at their home address.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the introduction of this into law will, of course, mean that very large numbers of students will be disenfranchised.  On a fairly quick, crude estimate I reckon there are somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 students from outside the city living in Dublin while they are at college.  If these students want to vote they will have to travel by bus to Dingle or Donegal, if that is possible.  I imagine the capacity to get on those buses or whether the buses would be servicing those areas would be very much related to who they were likely to vote for when they got to Dingle or Donegal.  The vast majority of students will simply not be able to make the trip to their homes in the country and, accordingly, they will be disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>If you take the figure of 20,000 that is approximately three full quotas of votes, enough in practice to elect two or three TDs.  The reality also, particularly in relation to Dublin, is that students are not uniformly dispersed across the city. They are concentrated in the Rathmines area &mdash; I see Senator Manning paying a lot of attention as he had an electoral interest in that area not so long ago.  It does not particularly concern me and the area in which I am electorally interested but it arises in the south-east of Dublin where, in effect, both University College, Dublin and Trinity College are located &mdash; I think UCD is technically outside the area.</P>
    <P>Very large numbers of the students of Trinity College and University College, Dublin are resident in Dublin south-east. I hold the view that there would be in the order of 10,000 such students; in other words, you would have enough <Col N="1721" /> people there to elect a TD.  It would, in theory at least, be possible for students to put up a candidate for the Dáil and to get him or her elected given their numbers; that is, of course, if they all voted for that type of policy.  Perhaps things would not work our exactly like that in practice but certainly a very significant number of young people will be disenfranchised. That is very unfair and regrettable. It is particularly regrettable in relation to students who are constantly lobbying and who are concerned about getting a fair crack of the whip from the system.</P>
    <P>Despite all the lobbying by students and all the promises of support given by many people in relation to students' issues and problems, when you get down to brass tacks in effect the initiative has been taken to ensure that in practice quite large numbers of them will be disenfranchised or, alternatively, they will be presented with a hurdle of such size that it will be quite impractical for them to get over it.  I originally came from County Clare and when I was a student in UCD it was not a realistic possibility that on Wednesday or Thursday I would travel home to cast my vote.  Only the truly dedicated did that.  People in that situation will be excluded from the voting process, which is very unfair and regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Upton's amendment.  It is very regrettable that we will create the situation in this Bill which Senator Upton outlined. All our energies should go towards encouraging as many people as possible to vote.  It is particularly important to encourage young people to vote.  I know from talking to young people that they take it quite seriously and it gives them a considerable sense of responsibility when they know coming up to an election that they will vote.  We should be encouraging them to participate in electing a Government and bringing them into the system rather than freezing them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers are quite significant and it is unfair that we should expect students, whose parents are paying high fees for <Col N="1722" /> them to attend colleges, universities and other third level institutions, to return to where they originally lived if they want to vote.  I cannot see the objection to allowing people to be on the voters' register twice, provided that the penalties for voting twice are very high.  That is the way we should approach it.</P>
    <P>I hope there is no suggestion in this that because students tend to have more liberal views they might not always be seen to support the old Fianna Fáil. Senator Cassidy spoke about the new Ireland and the new Fianna Fáil, but we are not quite sure yet exactly what the new Fianna Fáil is or how liberal their views will be.  Will the Minister tell us if encouraging the highest possible participation is his objective?  Is it Government policy to facilitiate people in voting or to make it difficult for people to vote? That is really what it comes down to, that is the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused or perhaps Senator Upton is confused.  Students have a choice to be on the register in Dublin or in the area in which they previously lived.  I am a little disappointed to hear Senator Upton say that as a student he did not go back home to vote for de Valera and Dr. Paddy Hillery. That is out in the open now; he did not do it and that is it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>To be serious, the students of the nation have the choice of being on the register in the area in which their college is and where they are in residence or else in their home constituency for elections.  That is the way I read the section.  It is a section I welcome because of other provisions in it.  I do not think this amendment &mdash; unless I am reading it wrongly &mdash; is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan has thrown me somewhat, not for the first time.  Could we get clarification from the Minister because if what Senator Honan is saying is correct, my understanding is <Col N="1723" /> that it is a very restricted right at present and what is in mind here would be a much more frequent revision of the electoral list so that students would be able, in the numbers required, to register.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation so that we do not waste time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 11 (1) of the Bill a person may be registered once only as an elector.  Where a person is resident at more than one address he will have the right to choose at which of those addresses he will be registered.  Where such addresses are located in different registration areas, the registration authority for each area are required to take any necessary steps to ensure that the person is not registered in more than one of these areas.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 proposes to insert a new provision in section 11 to make it clear that a full-time student has a right to opt to be registered in respect of his parents' address or the address in which he resides during the academic year.  I would like to remind the House that section 11 (1) (b) makes it clear that where a person appears to be eligible to be registered in respect of more than one address, the registration authority shall determine the address at which he should be registered, subject to any expression of choice by the person concerned.  This makes it clear that there is onus on the registration authority to comply with the wishes of the person when he indicates which address he wishes to opt for.  The situation envisaged in Senator Naughten's amendment is already covered adequately in the Bill.  A student in the situation referred to will have the option to register at his parents' home or at the address at which he resides during the academic year.  The amendment is, therefore, not necessary and adds nothing to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 proposes to delete section 11 (1).  The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be that the existing unsatisfactory situation would continue where students &mdash; and possibly many others in certain circumstances &mdash;<Col N="1724" /> may be registered in respect of more than one address.  The effect of subsection (1), togeter with the provision of rule 27 of the Second Schedule, clarifying that the registration authority and the county registrar have power to make inquiries outside their registration area, will restore the law to what it was understood to be before the recent Supreme Court decision on the registration of students. The purpose of the provision of section 11 (1) is to safeguard against the possibility of electoral abuse which could arise if persons were to be registered as electors in more than one place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's reply.  I think what everybody on all sides of the House has in mind would be that the vote would take place in as fair a way as possible, as widely as possible, and that advances in technology in recent years would make registration in the holding of the vote as easy and widespread as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about an onus being on the registration authorities to make sure that people know that they have the right to register if they are full-time students.  Will he perhaps think also of some machinery where the Department, in conjunction with the third level institutions &mdash; there are not many of them and they all have good internal communication systems &mdash; would find some way of informing students of the rights available to them in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps he would also consider some sort of machinery which will allow students to register.  Students come to Dublin, Cork or Galway and they have many other things on their minds in coming to grips with their new way of life, and registering for a vote would be very low down on their list.  It would be worthwhile to have co-operation between the relevant authorities and the third level institutions to make this information available and perhaps to find some legally safe way of ensuring that people can be registered and not doubly registered.  We would all be happy to see the end of the situation of people being transported by bus back and forward at <Col N="1725" /> election time.  If people want to go back home to vote, they have that right but if they want to stay where they are, they also have that right.  I thank the Minister for his very helpful reply.</P>
    <P>All this puts a very strong onus on the political parties to see that people whom they would regard as being potential supporters are registered although, as Senator Upton pointed out, the difference between a potential supporter and a vote can often be very wide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still a little confused and I would like further clarification. I do not think it is sufficient that the student has the choice of being registered at home, in their digs or place of accommodation at a third level institution unless they know where they will be on the date of the election.  It may be all right in relation to the local elections, but no one knows when a general election will be held.  Will the Minister remind us up to what stage a student will be allowed to change?  The student is registered at home, perhaps guessing that an election will be held in July but if he makes the wrong guess and the election is held earlier, he is then attending college.  That is not much good to him if he has made the wrong choice and he is registered at home.  In this regard &mdash; I think 12 days or so were allowed the last time &mdash; will he be allowed to change if he has registered at home?  Unless that is the case, it will not help students to vote.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a question related to section 11 (c) which states that the registration authority of each such area shall take such steps as it considers necessary to ensure that the person is not registered in respect of more than one such registration area.  What exactly would the registration authority be required to do? It would be putting a heavy burden on the registration authorities to establish whether a person is registered in more than one registration area.  Will the Minister explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to cooperate and assist in every way possible in dealing with the third level colleges and <Col N="1726" /> ensuring that any information required is available to students in relation to this matter.  As the Senator knows, many notices are posted advising people to make sure that they register.  We will certainly look at that area in relation to specific problems.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Hederman, for students like everybody else, September will be the time for applying for registration. You cannot allow a person, 12 days after an election has been called to change his registration.  That cannot be allowed happen.  Wherever a person registers at the appropriate time in September is where he or she will have the entitlement to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the other point about the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is registering a vote local authorities have the right to inquire in the home area of the student to clarify that he or she is not being registered in both places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put his finger on the problem to which I alluded.  The practicalities of this mean that students will be disenfranchised.  It would be ridiculous to require students to register at their college in September.  Students &mdash; apart from the unfortunate minority repeating examinations or doing finals &mdash; are not in town in September.  I do not expect anyone, apart from the more advanced students of political science, to know that they need to register in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reality is that students do not know when an election will be called. June is a delightful time to have an election but half, maybe three-quarters of students have left the city at that stage because examinations are finishing. Some will have gone in the first week of June and some will be around until the second or third week in June.  However, unless students are committed and particularly anxious to wait and vote, they simply will not be able to vote if they have opted for their college address.  If <Col N="1727" /> they have opted for their home address, many of them will still be doing examinations and they would want to be the sound people about whom my distinguished colleague, Senator Honan, spoke to go down the country to vote.  I imagine that for the most part they would be giving priority to getting their exams.</P>
    <P>The practicalities of what is proposed here by the Minister is that students for the most part will be disenfranchised unless they are able to make their way down the country to vote; the vast bulk of them will not, the only elements who will make their way down the country to vote will be the committed political supporters of one or other party.  The average student, the floating voters, the people who would not be particularly into politics are the people who will stroll up to the local polling station and hope they will be on the register.  They will make a very unpleasant discovery.  The change in practice means that most students simply will not be able to vote at their college address.  That is a very important consideration in relation to where seats will finish up in a small number of constituencies in this city, in Dublin South-East, in some of the north side constituencies around Dublin City University and perhaps, to some extent, in Dublin South.  I am not familiar enough with Cork to be able to say where the balance of students votes would be liable to end up in voting terms but, these people, in effect, will be disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>The idea that students would, in the month of September, solemnly consider whether they would want to be registered at their parents address or at their college address is totally unrealistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Upton's second point.  He seems to think that the transfer of a large number of students will affect the outcome of the election but that is probably more imagined than real because most of the voting research shows that students tend to vote roughly along the same lines as the rest of the population.  There is <Col N="1728" /> generally not a different breakdown &mdash; they are as contrary as the rest of us.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton made two points, one of which is absolutely central, but I do not agree with the other regarding what happens in the month of June.  In all occupations there are certain natural hazards and June is a natural hazard for most students, it is the time of examinations, the time when they head off to jobs and so forth.  The lives of most of them are in turmoil anyway and no matter what you did in the month of June you would have great difficulty (a) in getting them terribly interested in elections as a priority and (b) trying to get arrangements that would suit them because some examinations end early, some end late and some people have to hang around and so forth, so I do not think June is a problem which can be realistically sorted out.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton made a central point in regard to September.  If we are serious about having a provision for students to register in a flexible way, then the month of September is a nonsense because, like June, it is the other odd month, students are not around.  They are recovering from the experience of working.  The Minister gave a commitment that the Department would seek to be flexible and if, between now and Report Stage, the Department could look at ways in which this September barrier could be overcome, it would be helpful.  There is no party difference on this; we all want to see to this provision as flexible and as wide as possible, and working within the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department should look at the whole question of whether the registration of votes at third level institutions could become, in effect, institutionalised in October because all third level institutions now have fairly massive freshers' days and very sophisticated internal communications.  There is no great difficulty about liaison between, say the third level institutions acting as a bloc and the Department, so some sort of scheme could be put in place.  We cannot mollycoddle students either, but if there is some sort of a scheme whereby information will be available, a place where they can register, make the choice, it is <Col N="1729" /> just one of the many other things that students would do at the beginning of the year.  However, September is not a suitable month; if it could be a month later the problem would be solved.</P>

      <P>I agree with the first point Senator Manning made.  With respect to Senator Upton, he is doing the student body a disservice in saying that they are not politically minded.  I think they are just as politically minded &mdash; no more or no less &mdash; as the rest of the population and they reflect that in their attitudes.  It is not fair to say that they will saunter into a polling booth just because it is there.  They are as committed to the voting system as any other section of the population.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of mollycoddling the students or of doing them a disservice.  The reality is that if this Bill goes through as it is, even the most seriously committed Fianna Fáil supporters &mdash; they are the most committed so we will talk about them &mdash; more than likely will not know in September where they will be living when they come back to college.  How then can they register?</P>

      <P>How can they register? In other words Senator Upton is saying that they will only have one vote. Senator Manning said that students tend to vote in the same way as other people; I am sure he is right but my concern is much more fundamental because I am not in party politics.  If we want to bring up responsible citizens it is wrong to put these obstacles in their way, and not to encourage or make it easy for them to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that if the Minister is genuinely concerned about facilitating everybody &mdash; not only students &mdash; he will not put stumbling blocks in their way but will go back to the system where they could vote. What is wrong &mdash; I do not think we have been told &mdash; with the line &ldquo;people to be <Col N="1730" /> registered in two places&rdquo;?  How many people will vote in two places?  Very serious penalties for such offences have always been in place.  We all remember the famous Pat O'Connor case.  I have seen personation only once, sombody trying to vote in another person's name in Oakley Road.  It may go on in the country but in Dublin, in my experience, there have been very few cases of people trying to vote twice.</P>

      <P>I have to wear my local authority cap as well: do we expect the local authority, the registration authority whose job it is to compile this register, to look at the register and pick out the people they think might be students?  Will they have to try to find out where these students are and to what third level college they have gone?  If they have to come to Dublin, if that can be established and they may be registered.  How are they then going to find out?  It is putting a huge burden on the Minister.  I do not know whether there will be any penalties if the local authorities do not get it right.  It is asking a lot of them.  How are they going to find out where these students have gone?  I would like the Minister to explain to me how they are going to do it.</P>

      <P>I am sure students have a much better idea of where they will be in September, whether there is an election or not.  I am not in a position to say where I may be.  I would also like to point out that the month of September is when the preparation of the register commences.  The draft is published on I November, so they have up until the end of October to register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the electoral arrangements is to enable electors freely and <Col N="1731" /> effectively to exercise a choice as between the different parties and candidates presenting themselves at an election. There is an obligation on the Legislature to ensure that what emerges from an election is the reflection of the real wishes of the electorate and that the results are not distorted by electoral offences.  In any situation therefore where the possibility of electoral abuses arises it is essential that sensible precautions be taken to safeguard against that possibility.  The responsible Minister and the Legislature would be shirking their obligations if they failed to build such safeguards into the electoral procedures.</P>
    <P>There is no allegation that students or other categories who could under existing law be registered at more than one address would abuse the situation.  It is necessary, however, to look at the matter quite neutrally and dispassionately. Experience here and elsewhere has shown that where the possibility exists of influencing electoral results by unorthodox methods, someone, somewhere, will be tempted to use such methods.  We would be remiss if we failed to provide sensible safeguards.  I hope, therefore, that the House will agree that the retention of section 11 (1) is essential and I would ask the Senator not to press this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> This amendment deals with people who are in homes and similar type institutions. Essentially, what we are trying to do with this amendment is to allow those people to be registered either at their own home address or at the address of the institution in which they are being cared for.  It is to provide them with a degree of choice.  As I understand the present provisions, they are restricted to being registered in their home address rather than in the address of the institution.  It is simply to give them an element of choice in much the same way as choice is being extended to students to register at the college or at their parents address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 proposes the deletion of subsections (5) and (6).  If the amendment is agreed to it would mean that registration authorities would have no guidance whatever in dealing with the registration of the categories concerned.  However, if subsections (5) and (6) were deleted it would probably result in registration of the categories covered by them at the place they are detained.  In so far as the registration of hospital personnel is concerned I think the House will agree that it is sensible that such electors should be registered there.  While the provisions of sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 in relation to the registration of an elector in a constituency or local electoral area may be adequate to deal with the registration of such electors, it is desirable that this provision should be retained to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to registration of prisoners, they are currently registered at their home address, that is, the address at which they resided before going to prison.  It must be remembered that the vast majority of prisoners are short term and that, having regard to the fact that a period of 18 months elapses between the qualifying date for a register and the expiry date for that register, many prisoners will have completed their term during the lifetime of the register.  Registration of prisoners at the prison where they are detained would be a pointless exercise unless special voting arrangements were put in place to allow them to <Col N="1733" /> vote.  Many categories of electors have difficulty in voting on polling day.  Apart from a very limited category of electors &mdash; security forces, diplomats and disabled voters &mdash; it has not been possible to devise special arrangements to allow those other categories to vote which would be secure, flexible and practical to operate.</P>
    <P>It might assist Members of the House if I give a brief outline of the background to the existing arrangements in relation to mental hospital patients, which is repeated in sections proposed for deletion.  Prior to the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1963, mental hospital patients were precluded from registering in the hospitals or institutions in which they were patients.  Short-stay mental patients were registered at their home address and long-stay patients were normally not registered at all.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Electoral Law, which reported in 1960-61, recommended that persons resident in county homes and similar institutions for long periods should be registered there and that the distinction between physical and mental illness should cease to be a factor in electoral law.  The Electoral Act, 1963, provided that long term patients and inmates in hospitals, including mental hospitals, would be registered there and that short term patients would be registered where they would normally be residing on the qualifying date.  This had the effect that long term mental hospital patients would be registered at and be assigned to a polling station in the polling districts to which the hospital was situated.</P>
    <P>Following the 1965 General Election, the first election held after the enactment of the 1963 Act, there was considerable concern in relation to the voting arrangements for mental hospital patients at polling booths situated in or adjacent to those mental hospitals.  The consensus then was that the new provision regarding voting by mental hospital patients had proved unsatisfactory in practice and that it would be desirable to revert back to the pre-1963 arrangements.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1966, introduced the <Col N="1734" /> existing arrangements in relation to the registration of mental hospital patients. The 1966 Bill was introduced on the basis that there was all-party agreement on the need to change the system of registration of mental hospital patients in the light of the experience at the 1965 election and it was welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The trend in the past decade has been to pursue a policy involving a shift in psychiatric services from the institutional to a community-oriented service.  This has involved the establishment of hostels and community residences for mental patients throughout the country.  Patients now residing in community residences are registered in the normal way in respect of these residences.  The number of persons detained in mental hospitals has progressively reduced over the years. For example, in 1983 a total of 9,182 patients of voting age were detained in mental hospitals; in 1990 that figure had dropped to 5,744 and the reduction is continuing.</P>
    <P>I hope in so far as the registration of mental hospital patients is concerned that Senators will accept that the existing provisions were enacted on the basis of experience in the operation of the system and, while it may not be perfect, it strikes the correct balance in all the circumstances. The present system was designed essentially to protect mental hospital patients from the kind of pressure and indignities they were subject to when registration at the hospital was permitted. I think the House will agree that short-stay hospital patients in non-psychiatric units should continue to be registered at their home address.  I would, therefore, ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel fairly strongly about this amendment.  Essentially what we are asking the Minister to do is to delete this section and leave the option to the patient, inmate or prisoner to make a choice as to where they deem their residence to be for the purpose of voting in an election.  That is only proper considering the choice that is available in section 11 (1) (b) &ldquo;subject to any <Col N="1735" /> expression of choice by such person, be determined by the registration authority&rdquo;. We would like to have the situation where this would also be subject to the expression of choice by the resident in an institution, either in a hospital or in a prison, and I really do not see any reason it should not be so.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, a prison situation. It would seem eminently resonable that somebody serving a sentence in excess of a few months would be resident for a period during which an election could take place and the likelihood of their actually exercising the franchise at their home address would be very small.  What we should be doing &mdash; and I think this had been the attitude on this side of the House all along &mdash; is facilitating to the maximum degree the exercise of the franchise, because we are concerned with extending democracy as far as possible.  I also think it would have a very substantial rehabilitation function.  The fact that somebody would be encouraged to vote within the prison confines, or the hospital confines, would give them an extra interest and awareness that would be beneficial to them, because it would mean they would be taking an interest in what is going on outside; and of course that is one of the greatest means of alleviating boredom and facilitating rehabilitation and a return to the community.</P>
      <P>It certainly seems to me that it would be eminently reasonable to allow the people to express their choice as to where their place of residence in respect of registration should be.  From that point of view I think it would be best for the Minister to delete this section so that this will be possible.  Again, I could suggest how the Minister that could be done.  It is very easy, for example, to exercise the franchise by having a polling booth within prison walls or within hospital walls.  It is a simple matter; or you could have a postal ballot.  The option is there and the actual facility is there; it is only a question of allowing it within the legislative framework.</P>

      <P>I for one do not stint in <Col N="1736" /> my admiration and praise for Senator Costello's work on behalf of prisoners over the years, but I have great difficulties with what he is proposing. Rehabilitation is an important aspect of prison, but I would also have a fairly old fashioned view on this.  I would have thought that where a person has been found guilty of a major crime and where it has been deemed fit that that person would lose her or his rights for a particular period of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The right to liberty but also the right to vote.  I bow to the Senator's superior knowledge and his obvious concern in the matter; but, in a very old fashioned way, to me a sense of punishment of some sort is also involved. If we talk to some of the people who are suffering at the hands of criminals at the present time &mdash; the victims of crime &mdash; and the word goes out from this House that we are so concerned that we actually want to have special polling stations in Portlaoise and Mountjoy where Dominic McGlinchey and company will be given the right to vote despite the heinous crimes they have committed, I would find, and I think the ordinary humane person outside would find on this particular issue that it was a step too far. They would say yes, do everything in your power when it comes to their rehabilitation, but this is a symbolic action and it must stop there.</P>

      <P>I feel I have to support Senator Manning.  I am sure Senator Manning would agree that we are not by any means saying that we should not try to rehabilitate prisoners, but we have to draw the line at some stage.  It may be ignorance on my part, but I was always of the opinion that once you were sent to prison you automatically lost the right to your franchise and that it was not the question of having polling stations in the prisons or anything like that.  If we reach the stage where we are going to provide polling stations within prisons, we will have to take a hard look at ourselves and <Col N="1737" /> ask exactly where we are going, because the people who have been victimised through the acts of people who have been sent to prison would not look to kindly at legislators who were providing a facility which many of those victimised could not avail of because of the very act of victimisation.  I definitely would agree with Senator Manning.  Perhaps, as he said, we are old fashioned, but that is the stark reality and I would be very slow to change that attitude.</P>

I must oppose any change in the arrangements in relation to prisoners and mental hospital patients. However, I would like an opportunity to give further consideration to patients and inmates in ordinary hospitals and institutions, as well as hospital workers, and perhaps come back to the matter on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct one or two points that have been said and comment on what the Minister said?  The sanction of imprisonment is the loss of the right to liberty, and that does not imply the loss of further rights, as some Senators have suggested.  If we were to go logically down that road it would mean that you would forego all your rights once the doors close behind you in prison, or in a mental institution.  That is a very dangerous approach for anybody in any democracy to think about; next thing we will be talking about education or health rights. Where do we stop?</P>
      <P>Where it does not place an imposition on the State that cannot otherwise be catered for in a reasonable fashion we should &mdash; I will not say err on the side of generosity &mdash; veer towards facilitating those with an interest in voting.  I think it would be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Visiting Committee's report on Mountjoy was published today.  The conditions there are described as appalling. They describe the overcrowding, the segregation, <Col N="1738" /> etc.  The Visiting Committee members &mdash; all of whom were appointed by the previous Minister for Justice &mdash; have said that people concerned with the prison system should have to come into it to see what the conditions are.  What better way is there than having a public representative listen to the complaints and for the inmates to be aware of what is going on in the political life outside. That could not but be beneficial and I would urge that the matter be considered.</P>

      <P>Section 11 (3) (a) states: &ldquo;a person shall be deemed not to have given up ordinary residence if he intends to resume residence within eighteen months after giving it up&rdquo;.  Is there any reason the figure of 18 months was chosen?  If that period was extended to, say, three years would that go some way towards meeting the anxiety and the concern of those who are pleading on behalf of the emigrants?  Is there any reason &mdash; I am not suggesting this but I want to know theoretically &mdash; why it could not be five years?  I am saying that because five years was the figure suggested by Senator Upton during which emigrants should be allowed to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Hederman.  There is that time scale of 18 months and it would meet some of the pleas made from this side of the House if that period of time was extended.  Eighteen months is a short period of time.  It certainly would not <Col N="1740" /> seem unreasonable that it could be doubled or trebled and still would not be an unreasonable period of time.  Perhaps the Minister might look at that again on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The second point I would like to make is in relation to section 11 (1) (a) which states: &ldquo;A person should not be registered as an elector more than once in the registration area nor in more than one such area&rdquo;.  I cannot see why the Government should see fit to overturn the Quinn <i>v.</i>  Waterford Corporation case in this respect considering that it was a Supreme Court decision and that students in particular are in a very even situation, namely, that third level students spend approximately six months in their residence and six months working or attending at college.  This would seem to be an area where it would seem reasonable for the legislation to facilitate students, particularly when they went to the trouble of specifically taking the action, winning the action and being complimented by Judge McCarthy for their initiative in ensuring that they got their entitlements in relation to exercising their franchise.  I would have thought that the Government and the Minister would appreciate that point, seeing that the case only took place in 1990.  Perhaps the Minister might look at that again for Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> This is a kind of perennial amendment: it keeps on coming up.  At present members of the Diplomatic Corps or whoever qualify for votes because they are spouses.  The amendment seeks to provide in the cases of people who are simply partners as distinct from being spouses that they would also qualify; in other words, people who have an established relationship with someone and who in effect are filling much the same functions as spouses but cannot be termed spouse because of the restrictions in the Constitution and so on here.  We are simply suggesting that they be treated in the same way as somebody's spouse and have the same rights for casting their vote in this country as is given to the spouses of diplomats and similar people who are outside the country at election time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 12 a person who is a diplomat attached to a diplomatic mission abroad and the spouse of that person are deemed to be ordinarily resident in this State for registration purposes and under section 14 such electors may vote by post.  The actual voting takes place under the supervision of a person appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The amendment provides that either a spouse or a partner resident with the elector shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident in the State and therefore, entitled to be registered as an elector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that this amendment is designed to cover the case of cohabiting couples.  The privileges and immunities guaranteed under the Vienna Convention conferred on Irish diplomats posted abroad by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967, extended only to the diplomat and members of his family resident in the household.  I think that the conferring of a right such as the right to vote by post should also continue to be on the basis of a family member who is related to the diplomat, in this case his or her spouse. In any event the word &ldquo;partner&rdquo; is much too vague to be used in this context.  The <Col N="1742" /> word can denote a partnership of any kind &mdash; in business, for example, or in any enterprise whatever.  When this provision was drafted in 1986 &mdash; by a Labour Attorney General, as it happens &mdash; it is quite clear that it was intended to cover the normal household arrangement.  I think this would continue to be the intention at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  Since the drafting of this provision in 1986 there have been considerable social developments.  Irish society has changed more dramatically in the last five or six years than it had over the previous 20 years.  Social welfare legislation contains a clear recognition of partners other than spouses, referred to there as a &ldquo;common law wife&rdquo; where the partner is female.  That would resolve any difficulty about wording but the issue here is the recognition of stable relationships other than marriage in all legislation. We must ensure the integrity of our legislative provisions.  If a term is used in social welfare legislation, why should it not also be used in electoral legislation?  The Minister might have another look at that.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will have another look at this as Senator Costello recommended.  These situations are catered for in welfare legislation and I cannot see why, with some imagination, we would not provide for the same contingency here.</P>
      <P>I am not too pushed about the rights which the Vienna Convention extends to the families of diplomats in this matter. We are concerned only with the voting rights of people who are effectively the common law spouses of Irish diplomats.  I have no doubt that the Minister is correct when he says that a Labour Attorney-General drafted this provision originally. The amendment was drafted by a distinguished labour lawyer who provides considerable advice to the party but moves on and sometimes labour lawyers differ.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;partner&rdquo; is <Col N="1743" /> too vague and is capable of too many meanings to be used in this context.  For example, if two or more persons were joint tenants of a house or apartment they could probably be described as partners even if there were no other relationship between them.  Clearly this is not the intention of the legislation.  &ldquo;Spouse&rdquo; on the other hand, even if its primary meaning denotes a marital relationship, is probably capable of being interpreted widely enough to cover less formal relationships.</P>
      <P>No representations have been made to my Department or to the Department of Foreign Affairs on this matter by any of the electors concerned or anybody acting on their behalf, nor am I aware that any registration authority has encountered any difficulty in this regard.  We must also take account of the fact that we are dealing here with a very small number of people, about 300 in all, consisting of civil servants and their spouses and it would be insensitive for the Oireachtas and the Government to give public indication of their belief that this small number of public servants are or may become involved in irregular relationships.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party try to be people of the world and we have observed this reality in recent times; hardly a day goes by but we hear of new cases.  In relation to the Minister not being in receipt of representations on this matter, that comes as no surprise to me. I am sure many of our diplomats come from the fine old school of &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; etc. and representations, if they were made, would be obscure.  It could take months or years for the Minister to be given the message from the diplomatic world in relation to these matters.  A lack of representations from that quarter does <Col N="1744" /> not affect my argument.  Given my inability to understand and interpret diplomat speak, I would not like to try to interpret representations from the diplomatic corps.  That is a complex art form and I suspect one would need ten or 20 years experience in the Department of Foreign Affairs to be able to understand representations from that quarter.</P>

      <P>A lack of representations on this matter is not remarkable.  I would be extremely surprised if representations had come from the diplomatic corps on this matter because it would imply the existence of relationships that might not be looked on in the best possible light by other echelons of society.  We are talking about a principle irrespective of the extent of present requirement for it.</P>
      <P>In other legislation there is provisions for common law wives.  We do not insist on the word &ldquo;partner&rdquo;&mdash; I accept the Minister's contention that the word &ldquo;partner&rdquo; could mean different types of partners.  Our meaning is a partner in a stable relationship.  There is no reason a common principle regarding this matter should not underpin all legislation.  If we can recognise a certain status in some legislative provisions, why can we not do so elsewhere, particularly when extending the right of franchise?  It is not beyond the powers of a draftsman or woman to come up with suitable terminology that would encompass what we are seeking here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 13, after &ldquo;date&rdquo; to add &ldquo;, or</P>
      <P>(d)  a person on the special voters list, or</P>
      <P>(e)  a prisoner, or</P>
      <P>(f)  a person whose occupation renders their presence on polling day in the constituency in which they are registered unlikely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with postal voters and proposes to extend the privileges of postal voting to additional groups.  We want to extend it to people in prison so that they can have their say in how the country is run.  As Senator Costello said, people in prison are deprived only of their rights to liberty; they retain other rights and we would like to see prisoners retain their rights to vote which would necessitate awarding them a postal vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we also propose that people whose occupation renders their presence on polling day in the constituency in which they are registered unlikely should also be given a postal vote.  We are talking here of people away on business or for some other reason at election time but who normally reside within a constituency.  We would like to see these people being enabled to vote. Certain occupation groups are away on business mid-week which is when elections are normally held on a Wednesday or Thursday.  Both days present considerable difficulties for people travelling <Col N="1746" /> to the country or who might be out of the country briefly on business.  These people should be entitled to cast their votes being full participants in Irish society but on polling day are unable to be present in their constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this beneficial amendment which the Minister should take on board.  Each of those categories has legitimate claim to a postal vote. Since the special voters' list was introduced in the early eighties there have been regular complaints from those who have benefited from it &mdash; if that is the word; they claim to have been subjected to a considerable degree of humiliation having to vote in the presence of a garda, having their vote supervised rigorously and their home invaded by a Garda officer.</P>
      <P>While improvements are made in this Bill in relation to the special voters' list its <i>modus operandi</i> is not satisfactory.  I would like people on that list to be given the option of a postal vote in the same manner as diplomats, gardaí and members of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>Second, the amendment requesting voting facilities for prisoners is an extension of a previous amendment.  A prisoner should be entitled to vote on the grounds that prisoners are deprived of a single right, which is the right to liberty, and are therefore by implication entitled to all other rights.  The State has a duty to ensure that voting facilities are provided for prisoners and if there is a problem with installing a polling booth within a prison wall or within a hospital which might also be necessary, prisoners and patients could be provided with a postal vote.  There is no reason that could not be done in those cases.  The involvement of the prison governor would help to ensure that the system was not abused. This provision would ensure that the franchise was given to those subjected to incarceration whether convicted or remanded without conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third category requiring a postal vote are those who cannot be present on polling day in their constituency.  I referred to this category in other amendments; <Col N="1747" /> it includes commercial travellers, merchant seamen, travelling sales people and the itinerant community on which I would like to hear the Minister's comments. I wonder if our legislative drafts-people have considered that category. Our itinerant population is significant and I wonder if they will be considered for a postal vote seeing that they are, by and large, of no fixed abode?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that commercial travellers and others whose occupation renders it difficult for them to vote at home on polling days &mdash; normally Wednedsays and Thursdays &mdash; and be facilitated by some means.  Commercial travellers, merchant seamen and other groups who work away from home should be allowed to avail of a postal vote.  Mention of Wednesday and Thursday brings me to a point which may be more properly addressed later, but I ask the Minister to consider holding some future election or referendum on a Sunday to see, first, if it would attract a greater turnout of voters and a more representative result and, second, to facilitate occupational groups who work away from home mid-week.</P>
      <P>The extension of postal voting to other groups would necessitate drawing up rules and regulations and I am sure that Senator Costello's complaints could be examined there.  People are glad to be included on the special voters' list instead of losing their vote through physical immobility, as happened prior to the lists inception.  We need to look no further than ourselves in the Seanad election.  It is not a daunting experience for us to go before the Clerk or to a county manager and we could not claim we were subjected to intimidation or had our constitutional rights infringed; I think that some of these complaints against the Garda may be exaggerated.  I ask the Minister to consider awarding <i>bona fide</i> commercial travellers a postal vote.</P>

      <P>It is a waste of Garda time to have to make themselves available to provide special voter's list service.  There <Col N="1748" /> is no problem with Garda behaviour; I have nothing but praise for their way of dealing with people in those circumstances, but it imposes unfairly on gardaí and special voters alike.</P>
      <P>I want to take up with the Minister the question of polling station workers, presiding officers and polling clerks and their entitlement to vote.  If they are employed in polling stations other than where they would vote themselves, they are at present unable to vote and wonder if there is provision to cover that difficulty in another part of the Bill?  If not, those people should also be given a postal vote. I gather that this group numbers about 10,000, a large number of whom are consequently disenfranchised.</P>
      <P>It is annoying for people to work in a polling station; maybe two miles from the polling station where they have their own vote, and to be unable to vote because of their obligations to work from the opening to the close of poll.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that matter.</P>

      <P>The Labour amendment is the better of the two.  While commercial travellers and merchant seamen would obviously be included in the intention of both, it is a mistake to single them out.  What about lighthouse keepers?  A small number remain who serve at the lighthouse for two weeks at a time. Would they be entitled to a postal vote if an election took place while they were on duty.  One can think of other categories.</P>
      <P>I support the suggestion that itinerants should have a vote and be facilitated accordingly.  Quite clearly by their very definition of their name indicates, that the majority of them are on the move.  I know that Ministers have tried in other years to have voting facilities provided for itinerants.  They have not always been supported by local politicians who often side with members of the settled community who do not want itinerants to have voting facilities.  If itinerants had the vote it might oblige unsympathetic politicians to consider them more seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> We try to enable persons to vote rather than make it more difficult for them.  I know the Minister and his Department have to cross t's and dot i's and make sure people do not vote illegally but a little flexibility would be helpful.</P>

      <P>Polling staff are covered by section 99.  Section 14 of the Bill restates existing law specifying the categories of electors who are to be registered as postal voters.  The categories are members of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and diplomats posted abroad and their spouses resident with them.  Amendment No. 18 proposes that in addition to the categories already provided for, disabled voters, prisoners and electors unable to vote in person on polling day because of their occupation should also be registered as postal voters.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 propose the extension of postal voting to commercial travellers and merchant seamen. As the House is aware, special arrangements are in operation to enable a disabled elector to have a ballot paper delivered to his or her residence by a special presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána to vote. This arrangement, introduced in 1986, operates satisfactorily and is free from the disadvantages associated with postal voting.  The amendments envisage an open-ended system for postal voting available to those such as commercial travellers and fishermen who, because of their occupation, may be unable to attend in person at the polling station to vote. It is envisaged that the facility would also be extended to the disabled and to prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the question of extending postal voting serious consideration <Col N="1750" /> has to be given to the protection of the secrecy, security and integrity of the ballot.  Unless these can be maintained the whole purpose of voting and the legitimacy of elected bodies can be called into question.  Experience here and elsewhere has show that postal voting is open to abuse.  An extended system of postal voting was introduced for the 1974 local elections.  Electors unable to vote in person due to illness, disability or the circumstances of their employment were entitled to vote by post.  Having regard to the experience at the 1974 elections additional provisions to safeguard against abuse were introduced in 1985.  Despite these additional safeguards there was abuse of postal voting at the 1985 elections. In introducing special voting arrangements for disabled voters in 1986 the Oireachtas, in effect, decided against an extension of postal voting.  I think circumstances have not changed in such a way as to warrant a rethink on this question.  I ask the Senators not to press this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has adverted to one major consideration for not extending the right to vote to other categories other than the diplomatic service abroad, the Army and the Garda and that is that it might be subject to abuse.  I would like the Minister to answer how a facility could be subject to abuse if operated in a prison?  How does he think the disabled would abuse the system?  How could a merchant seaman or a commercial traveller abuse the system?  I would like examples of how abuses might take place.</P>
      <P>A postal voting system operates in many countries and in Scandinavia there is a broad exercise of the franchise by postal vote.  We may be less honest in the way we do our business but I am not sure if the Minister implies that.  Other countries do not seem to have a problem with an extension of postal voting.  In the 1985 local election there was one incident of abuse in one constituency.  A single case should not be sufficient to prevent an extension of postal voting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will press amendment No. 19.  I detect a reluctance on the part of successive Governments to make worth while efforts to facilitate commercial travellers.  Voting is generally held mid-week and the commercial travellers must be away from home at that time.  It is grossly unfair.  Much has been said here about extending the vote to emigrants but we should ensure that people living in the country can vote. Commercial travellers are not the only neglected category.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the Minister that polling station staff are dealt with under section 99, they are not satifactorily dealt with.  It provides for a returning officer employing somebody in their constituency but in a polling booth other than the one the employee is entitled to vote in.  That may suit most people in the country and in the Minister's own constituency but in the cities, particularly in Dublin, many people are employed in constituencies other than their own.  They may serve in a polling booth down the road from where they live but it may be located in a different constituency and that contingency is not adequately dealt with in section 99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government are seriously considering giving representation or votes for emigrants there must be a method of facilitating commercial travellers.  It is baffling that a person living in Carlow who travels for work reasons to Donegal must travel back to Carlow on polling day.  Thousands who leave Dublin to work in other parts of the country are denied their right to vote unless they make the journey back and receive time off from their employers.  Surely they could be given the postal vote even if we were to extend the present scheme which applies to disabled persons.  I accept that it may be expensive to do that, but something should be done.  Thankfully, there is not a great deal of apathy here when it comes to elections with the result that we have become complacent about giving the vote to as many people as possible. We should forget about extending the vote to emigrants until we ensure that everybody in the Sate on polling day can <Col N="1752" /> cast their vote and that no fault lies with the Government or the Minister in that regard.  It is unreasonable to expect a commercial traveller who leaves Dublin on a Monday morning to come back on polling day to cast his or her vote.  The Minister should make greater effort to facilitate commercial travellers.</P>

      <P>Reservations about postal voting are not confined to the Government or this party.  The former Deputy, John Boland, as Minister for the Environment, said in the Official Report of 4 December 1986, at column 515:</P>
      <P>However, the sad and inescapable conclusion to be drawn from experience at these two elections is that postal voting is open to abuse, that it has been abused and that there is every likelihood that it would continue to be abused.  It is equally clear that it is not possible to devise safeguards which would guarantee the elimination of such abuse.</P>
      <P>In France and Belgium postal voting was abandoned on the grounds of abuse. In Northern Ireland, irregularities in relation to postal voting are legendary and I understand that the necessary power to suspend postal voting there has been enacted and may be brought into operation at any time.  The bottom line in regard to postal voting is that it is not possible to extend to the postal voter and his ballot paper the guarantee of secrecy, security and integrity which is provided at the polling station.  Until a way can be found of doing this, an extended system of postal voting is unlikely to commend itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point I have been trying to make and not because the former Minister, John Boland, was involved.  I would fault him as much as I would fault any Minister for not making an effort.  He was an excellent Minister, but it is extraordinary that we are considering giving votes to those who emigrate but we cannot provide votes for those in the country.  What is the difference between councillors voting in <Col N="1753" /> Seanad elections and providing voting facilities for commercial travellers?  It baffles me that we cannot at least reduce the number of those who are prevented from voting, because that is what we have done by not providing voting facilities for commercial travellers.  It is unreasonable to expect a person to run the risk of reducing his income, or even losing his job, if he travels from Galway to Dublin to vote, simply because we cannot find another way to give that person a vote. The date of polling and names of the candidates are known well in advance. We can forget about giving the vote to emigrants if we cannot give it to the people in the State.</P>
      <P>I would like some encouragement from the Minister that he will consider this matter between now and the next time we discuss this Bill or that in his term of office he will introduce a Bill enabling most commercial travellers to cast their votes on polling day.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister or his Government ever think of making voting compulsory and that one would be fined for not voting, as is the case in Australia and other countries?

    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for stressing the need for safeguards against abuse.  An election affected by abuse is not a real election and does not reflect the will of the people.  We know that under our system a very small number of voters can make all the difference.  There is a strong obligation on the Oireachtas to make sure that the safeguards are adequate.  I want to make it clear that it is not those to whom the postal vote is given who are likely to abuse the system.  The danger is that they would become victims of abuse. It is true, of course, that some categories <Col N="1754" /> and individuals would be in a better position to resist abuse than others. However, we must not put ourselves in the position of having to make this kind of judgment, nor am I saying that we are more prone to electoral abuse than others.  Under our system and in our circumstances, electoral fraud, even on a very limited scale, can have a significant effect.</P>

      <P>Senator Hederman spoke about votes for itinerants.  My experience is that itinerants have been given votes provided they are settled, but they do not use them.  Very few itinerants cast their votes.  We went to endless trouble in County Dublin when we got them settled in halting sites to give them the vote, but only about I per cent cast their votes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 19 and 20, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Subject to sections 7 to 10, a person who reaches the age of eighteen years after the specified date for the coming into force of the register of electors and before the expiry of the said register shall on reaching the age of eighteen years be entitled to apply to be entered on the said supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of registration for an elector is far too long and every effort should be made to shorten it.  It means that a person <Col N="1757" /> who becomes 18 years of age in September and has the resident qualification is not entitled to be on the register, or will not have a vote, for almost 18 months.  That is ridiculous.  We should have a supplementary register within six months after which an opportunity should be given to those how reach 18 years on 1 September, or in the six month period afterwards, to register.  Alternatively we should ask people to register when they reach the age of 17 years even though they would not be entitled to vote until they reach the age of 18 years.  Most, if not all, of us have come across cases where a person who is not 18 years is on the register on election day because a number of them slip through the system. Advice is given to boys and girls when they reach the age of 17 to register.  I see nothing in the regulations which forbids them from doing so.  Indeed, I have occasionally given advice to people to register when they reach 17 years of age because they only commit an offence if they vote before they are 18 years old.  I would like to hear from the Minister if any effort is being made to shorten this 18-month period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 15 as drafted only persons who were entitled to be registered on a qualifying date, but were not so registered, are entitled to apply for entry in the supplementary register. The secton provides a mechanism whereby electors who should have been included in the first place can be added to the register.  The essential consideration is that the persons concerned must have been eligible from day one. Under the section as drafted, no account may be taken of subsequent events.  For example, the section will not cater for people who change their address during the lifetime of the register or people who return home after a period abroad; nor is it intended to cater for people who reach voting age after the coming into force of the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 21, in the name of Senator Naughten, would enable a person who reaches 18 years after the coming into force of a register to apply <Col N="1758" /> for entry in a supplementary register on reaching that age.  The question of principle involved here is whether a person should have a right to be included in the register as soon as he reaches the age of 18 years.  This question was argued at length under amendment Nos. 6 and No. 9, mistakenly I believe, because the amendments would not have achieved the objective desired.  It is for the Chair to decide whether repetition of those arguments is appropriate now.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 15 in relation to the supplementary register is basically a safety net to catch those eligible electors who should have been included in the first place.  This amendment, if accepted, would depart from the principle on which the section is based.  That principle is that the applicant for inclusion in the supplement must have been eligible when the register was being compiled.  If we depart from that essential principle in relation to the elector's age then it would be only logical to depart from it also in the case of an elector who changes residence or who returns from abroad. We should then be opting for continuous revision of the register.  Our electoral arrangements are based on the idea of a final and conclusive register.  Section 15 proposes to retain this arrangement subject only to the correction of proven errors.  Acceptance of the amendment would mean a radical departure from this position.  I ask Senator Naughton to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 127 relates to the question which may be put to an elector in the polling station.  The form of question proposed in amendment No. 127 would be appropriate only if amendment No 21 was accepted.  If amendment No. 21 is rejected then amendment No. 127, which is consequential, would also follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recognises the efforts of the Irish Government during their Presidency of the EC in facilitating the London amendment of the Montreal Protocol, resulting in the agreement to phase out CFCs and recognising the danger to health caused by the depletion of the earth's stratospheric ozone layer, calls on the Government to continue their efforts through the EC to stabilise the earth's ozone loss.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, here this evening.  I am sure the House is very grateful to her for coming to take this very important motion, particularly when you consider that the Earth Summit begins next week.  I wish the Minister well in her deliberations at that conference.</P>
      <P>The depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer poses one of the greatest threats to the health and well-being of the human race.  Further depletion could have devastating long term effects on human life, for animal and natural life and for the environment generally.  The threat is real and the threat is now.</P>
      <P>New alarming reports from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration suggest that not alone is there now a hole in the ozone layer over the South Pole but a hole could soon appear over northern Europe, including Britain and Ireland, this year or during the next two years.  The general public simply do not realise the seriousness of the situation now.  It is a fact that future generations will no longer be able to enjoy the sun in the same way that we have and that is a shame.  We have a responsibility to future generations.</P>
      <P>The hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985 by Dr. Joe Farman over Antarctica.  New reports suggest that ozone depletion of up to 30 per cent to 40 per cent could occur in the northern hemisphere over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ozone layer as Members are aware, acts as a shield against the sun's <Col N="1760" /> ultra-violet rays and it is now being eaten away by man-made chemicals at an alarming rate.  The situation is more tragic when you consider that we cannot repair the damage but merely stabilize it. There is evidence of a potential ozone loss of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent per day over northern Europe.</P>
    <P>CFC gases remain in the atmosphere for decades after they are emitted and can remain in existence for more than 100 years.  Already it has been estimated that up to 20 million metric tonnes have been dumped into the atmosphere.  Were CFC production to cease it would take 100 years to return to natural levels.</P>
    <P>CFCs are a basic part of modern industrial and commercial life.  They are to be found in refrigerators and air conditioning systems and are used in the manufacture of cleaning solvents for example, and plastic foams.  They are also an essential ingredient of the modern aerosol spray can.  There are one billion refrigerators on the planet earth and there are hundreds of millions of air conditioning systems.  CFCs therefore are fully intergraded into modern industrial production.</P>
    <P>The rapid depletion of the ozone layer poses a threat to human health.  This matter is becoming important here in Ireland now that the summer has arrived. Irish people are fair-skinned and have skin that is pink and white.  We are, therefore, particularly vulnerable; 90 per cent of skin cancers are caused by overexposure to the sun.</P>
    <P>A Dublin cancer specialist Dr. John Healy of St. Luke's Hospital has now suggested that for every I per cent reduction in ozone protection, there is a 3 per cent to 5 per cent increase in skin cancers and a 0.5 per cent increase in melanomas.  In 1988 53 people died in Ireland from malignant melanoma.  The instances of malignant melanomas have doubled in the past ten years.  It has been suggested that Ireland could be facing a three fold increase in the instances of skin cancers and a 20 per cent increase in melanomas as a result of the ozone depletion.</P>
    <P>Children in particular are most vulnerable. <Col N="1761" /> The attitude of Irish people to the sun will have to change dramatically in the years to come.  In other countries health problems have already emerged and in Australia, for example, there has been a threefold increase in skin cancers. Ultra-violet rays cause cataracts and blindness.  The World Health Organisation have produced statistics showing that 17 million people are now blind as a result of cataracts.</P>
    <P>Ozone depletion affects the body's general ability to fight off disease.  It also reduces yields of basic crops and kills plankton in our oceans.  The continuation of this depletion also affects the earth's weather pattern, particularly temperatures and winds.  Changed weather patterns have been detected and have already emerged over Antarctica.  Firm evidence of all these effects has now been discovered.  This is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>How are governments throughout the world responding to this situation? Unfortunately, there has been a history of international government inaction and delay in this regard.  Doubting Thomases queried whether ozone depletion was a fact and have left it very late in the day to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bush Administration in the United States, for example, has not behaved well in this regard and has undertaken an exercise in back pedalling. I have no doubt that this issue will be raised in tomorrow's debate dealing with the Earth Summit and the attitude of the United States to the various issues on the agenda.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Montreal Protocol was agreed allowing for 50 per cent reduction in CFC production by 1999.  These targets were amended three years later in the London agreement which called for a total phase-out by the year 2000.  The EC has now committed itself to a total ban on CFC production by the end of 1995.  I congratulate the efforts of the Irish Government during its Presidency of the EC in facilitating this London amendment of the Montreal Protocol resulting in the agreement to phase out CFCs.  I congratulate Minister Harney on <Col N="1762" /> her efforts through the EC in bringing about the revised totals.</P>
    <P>The phasing out of CFCs poses one of the biggest challenges to the governments of the world.  The issue must be central to the deliberations in Rio next week. It will require technical ingenuity and extraordinary diplomatic skill.  It will be necessary to find substitutes for CFC gases and, thankfully, a number of substitutes have already been discovered. There is, however, still a problem in relation to medical aerosols, fire fighting equipment and metal cleaning applications. It will be necessary to switch technology which will, in fact, be very costly for the industries of the world.  This is a major challenge and is linked with the concept of sustainable development which will feature at the Rio conference next week.</P>
    <P>Recycling is necessary, particularly in relation to fridges.  At present fridges throughout the world are regularly and carelessly drained, dumped and damaged. New, imaginative measures are called for.  Exports, for example, not meeting strict ozone friendly standards should face international sanctions.  The challenges facing Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are particularly daunting and the developed countries will have to aid and assist these countries to tackle this major problem.</P>
    <P>The consumers will also have to take a stand, I believe they are already doing so and are conveying the message to big industry.  Consumers should boycott particular products, for example, the aerosol can.  You will find that consumers more and more are taking this approach and are leading the way.</P>
    <P>Governments throughout the world are engaged in a process of crisis management on this issue.  The depletion of the ozone layer is a fact.  In parts of Chile, for example, children are kept indoors between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. and sports events for children are no longer held during the day.  The Australian Government now issue alerts when very high levels of ultra violet rays are expected. In New Zealand citizens are advised to wear hats and to eat their lunch in the <Col N="1763" /> shade.  Ozone alert systems, for example, are common in Canada and Denmark. Ozone alerts will be a feature of modern life, particularly if the hole in the ozone layer occurs over the Northern Hemisphere. Warnings to wear sun-glasses and sun screens will be common.  People will have to be advised to take the sun in moderation.</P>
    <P>What should we do in Ireland?  Most people here remain ignorant of the real scale of the danger they face.  I would suggest that Ireland needs to take a stand in this regard.  We should not necessarily always follow on the heels of the big players in Europe and the industrialised world.  We should not merely follow our EC partners but lead the way and, if necessary, take action unilaterally, independent of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>Recently the Irish Cancer Society launched a campaign known as &ldquo;Skin and Sun&rdquo;.  The Minister was present for that formal launch and was very much involved with it.  I suggest that the Government should more actively promote health, education and public awareness on this issue.</P>
    <P>In addition we must now put in place an ozone alert warning system given the potential dangers.  According to the meteorological services, Ireland would be an ideal location for monitoring ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere. It is necessary for us now to put in place a sophisticated monitoring system and to secure the equipment needed in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some Irish companies are leading the way on this issue.  Murphy's Breweries for example, have introduced environmentally friendly beer coolers at a cost of £2.5 million.  Team Aer Lingus have developed a way of recycling nearly 100 per cent of CFCs used in aircraft fire extinguisher systems.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the Irish Government should lead the way.  I call on the Government now to undertake studies to examine the possibility of declaring Ireland a CFC free zone.  We do not manufacture CFC products in Ireland and, therefore, it would be easier for us <Col N="1764" /> to undertake this action.  We would then be giving a moral lead as we have done throughout our history on other issues such as peace, justice and basic human rights.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council have already declared the capital a CFC free zone in principle and are now working on the practicalities of this decision.  Small practical steps can be taken.  For example, each local authority can set up a CFC extraction unit for the extraction of gas from old fridges and promote and educate people in relation to this matter of recycling.</P>
    <P>The phasing out of CFC represents a major challenge for governments throughout the world.  I call on the Irish Government to take the high moral ground in this issue and I wish the Taoiseach, Minister Harney and their party every success in their negotiations at the Earth Summit next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion I welcome the opportunity to speak on an extremely important topic, one of the most important topics with which we will deal in the Seanad.  All of us, not just the Government, have a responsibility and obligation to ensure that our environment and all that goes with it is safe.  The enormous problems in keeping our environment safe must be highlighted.  We have a tremendous responsibility, as Members of the Oireachtas and legislators, to ensure that that takes place.  I am delighted that the Minister of State is here tonight because she is very involved in the whole area of the environment and environmental awareness.  She spent a considerable time with us on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not necessarily talking about our own situation in Ireland but about a worldwide phenomenon and the environmental development throughout the world.  I said on the last occasion, that we have responsibility to get expert advice. Having got that advice we should inform the public of the consequences of the methods being used which pollute the <Col N="1765" /> atmosphere, with consequent effects on the world environment.</P>
    <P>We must use every opportunity to highlight the tragic consequences of the abuse and destruction being waged on our environment.  For some peculiar reason, this topic was very much on people's minds a couple of years ago but it seemed to wane in recent times and people felt it was of less importance. When we discussed this matter a few years ago in the Seanad everyone was talking about the consequences of global warming and matters of that nature but then there seemed to be a lull in people's concern.  I am glad that the matter is now coming back on the agenda; I am sure the conference in Rio has something to do with it.  It is not before time that the problem is again being highlighted.</P>
    <P>I remember at that time congratulating the then Minister for the Environment on proposing a total ban on chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the nineties; this ban, if possible, should be implemented even before the end of the nineties.  I urge the Government to try to ensure that there will be a total ban on CFCs before the end of the nineties.</P>
    <P>The scale of modern-day development has reached a point where the cumulative effects on the environment are undermining the delicate, natural and physical equilibria of the entire planet.  The damage will take years to repair, indeed the damage will take years to be seen, that is the difficulty.  Experts say that the effects of the destruction taking place today will not be seen for at least 15 years.  Even if we start to repair the damage today, it will be well into the next century before we see the fruits of our labours.</P>
    <P>Many people maintain that some of the damage is irreparable but we should not be that pessimistic.  We must be optimistic and believe that if we take decisions and action now positive results will follow.  We cannot sacrifice man's future in the interest of short term financial gain.  That is where the big problem arose at the start where there were huge vested interests in particular areas, which caused the deforestation of South America <Col N="1766" /> and other areas.  The introduction of CFCs and carbon dioxide was in the interest of short term gain.  Nobody was paying much attention to the environment and those who raised doubts or fears about what was happening a number of years ago were looked upon as people with a chip on their shoulders or as eccentric individuals who had nothing else to do except to complain about things that did not really matter.  The truth is now beginning to dawn on everybody and we all realise that it is extremely important to take corrective action.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the thermal balance of the earth's surface is governed by solar radiation and is highly sensitive to the concentration of certain lower level gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane which are referred to as the greenhouse gases.  These gases occur naturally in the atmosphere but there concentrations have increased greatly because of man's activities.  CFCs are exclusively man-made chemical products. They allow heat radiation from the sun to penetrate the earth's atmosphere as ultra-violet rays but they prevent the heat that the earth radiates from escaping back into space in the form of infra-red rays.  This is the greenhouse effect to which Senator Haughey referred.  The gases act as a type of one way thermal barrier by allowing ultra-violet heat from the sun into the atmosphere but prevent it from leaving.  The result is a gradual warming of the earth's atmosphere, its land masses and the oceans in general. CFCs are virtually indestructible, they are man-made and they have the dubious distinction of not only contributing to the greenhouse effect but of destroying the ozone layer.</P>
    <P>As Senator Haughey said, the ozone layer protects us from the harmful rays of the sun.  The difficulty is that when you are talking technically about the ozone layer and all that type of thing the ordinary person in the street, to a very large extent, does not want to know.  Unless the message is brought home in clear, specific and plain language of the consequences of depletion of the ozone layer, people will not take us seriously. <Col N="1767" /> Our educational system could help, I am not just talking in terms of people who are learning geography; civics classes, could be used to stress the consequences of the depletion of the ozone layer and pollution.</P>
    <P>We have a great facility in our schools, primary and post-primary, to educate our young people because in a very short space of time they will be making decisions as to how things should be done.  You cannot start early enough in ensuring that there is a definite policy and the easiest way of doing this is to encourage our young people to participate. A number of our schools, both primary and post-primary, have undertaken huge environmental projects to highlight the problem and to make young people aware of it.  It should be Government policy that a programme of that type should be part and parcel of every single school.</P>
    <P>The ozone layer is vital for the continued existence of all life on earth and, as Senator Haughey said, it protects us from the harmful rays of the sun which cause skin cancer, cataracts and other disorders.  I am sure Senator Raftery will forgive me for mentioning a finding which said that if things continue in the same way in terms of global warming, the rising of the oceans and the warming and melting of icebergs, Cork will disappear by the middle of the next century.  On a lighter note I express the hope that they will disappear from the hurling field next Sunday week.</P>
    <P>To be serious, the effects of global warming will mean rising tides, huge droughts and land turning to desert, culminating in millions and millions of people being affected.  We all know that the vast majority of our population live at sea level so the consequences of increasing global warming and the rising of the oceans will be catastrophic.  We need every opportunity to highlight this issue.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Haughey, I also take the opportunity to wish this major conference in Rio every success.  It is the first time that all the major countries <Col N="1768" /> throughout the world have come together with a view not alone to look at environmental difficulties but at future developments. Environment must go hand-in-hand with development.  You cannot have one group of people talking about the environment and another group going their own merry way in the development field.  Unless both sides come together and agree a policy for the future then the world will be in serious difficulties in relation to this area.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House and I am glad to have the opportunity to second this important motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted with interest Senator McKenna's comment about Cork.  As a Tipperary man it may be some consolation to Senator McKenna that the first part of Cork to disappear, should this happen, would be Páirc Uí Chaoimh where the Cork hurlers train.</P>
      <P>More seriously, I welcome the Minister. I have noted her continuing interest in this subject and in the environment in general.  I am delighted about that.  The world has a responsibility to generations yet unborn to ensure that we leave the environment in as good a state as we found it and possibly better.  However, on all the evidence to date, I am afraid that will not be the case.  The generation to which we belong have caused more damage than any previous generation, I hope we will be the last to do so.  The major damage has been caused by the rich industrial nations and the major responsibility lies with them to take a lead, to clean up the mess we have created and to help to rectify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two problems involved here, particularly in regard to atmospheric pollution &mdash; the greenhouse effect which is caused by the depleted of the ozone layer and emissions of carbon dioxide.  Taking the ozone depletion first, as Senator Haughey said, it is caused primarily by chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as they are popularly known.  The principal sources of the CFCs are refrigerators, air conditioning units and aerosol sprays which are in common use today.  To <Col N="1769" /> replace chlorofluorocarbon would be an expensive process.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Community has decided to ban all CFCs in 1995. However, I am concerned about poorer countries, such as China, India, Pakistan and the African countries.  Because of their climate, they depend on the use of cooling equipment to preserve their food, if not to improve their lifestyle, and they will find it exceedingly difficult and costly to use a substitute.  In that regard there is a responsibility and a moral obligation on the wealthier countries to help them, and in doing so, to protect the environment for all.  I have a lot of admiration for the United States, but I regret to say that in certain areas they are the main culprits because not only are they using more CFCs than any other country but they are also more reluctant to do anything about the problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ozone depletion, it was first noted in the Antarctic region. Regrettably, there is evidence that it is stretching towards the northern hemisphere. The effects of it have already been documented.  We should bear in mind that the Celts &mdash; the Irish people &mdash; have the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world.  This is evident in countries to which the Irish have emigrated. Figures from Australia, New Zealand, South America and North America all indicate that there is a higher incidence of cancer among the Irish because we have a greater susceptibility because of our very fair skin and, to some extent, blue eyes.  I do not believe our population are adequately aware of this or, if they are, I am surprised they are not doing more about it.  It is still very popular, particularly among the young ladies, to go and tan themselves in the sun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only the young ladies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Principally the young ladies.  If we could somehow make white skin popular we would have less of a problem.  I sometimes wonder about young people and the risks they take. <Col N="1770" /> For instance, in my own college, I am alarmed at the huge increase &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;increase&rdquo;&mdash; in the number of young girls smoking, despite the evidence from all sources that smoking is harmful to one's health.  I doubt if warnings about the risk of skin cancer from sunbathing will have very much effect.  Nevertheless, we must continue to hammer home the message.</P>
      <P>With regard to CFCs, there is no doubt that much of the emission of CFCs is from fridges, freezers and air conditioning units that are not operating properly.  There is a need for proper servicing of these units while they are using CFCs and, more importantly, to have them drained of CFCs when they are out of use.  The common practice, we have to admit, when discarding fridges and freezer units is to dump them.  Consequently, when rust sets in, the CFCs escape into the atmosphere.  Eventually, it is hoped that we will have a substitute material and the sooner the better, but in the meantime, we must ensure that there is the minimum amount of emission of CFCs from our fridges, freezers and air conditioning units and that there is a service for extracting the gas when they are being discarded.</P>
      <P>Regarding the change in weather patterns, there is no doubt that the depletion of the ozone layer will cause problems as far as climate change is concerned. However, the effect of that in Ireland will be miniscule by comparison with the effect elsewhere.  Consider a country such as Bangladesh, which is barely above water level at the moment with a population of 120 million people.  One can imagine what a rise of 12 inches in sea level will do to that country, or even the state of Florida in the United States which is virtually at sea level.  There are many densely populated areas, which will be seriously and adversely affected by rising seas if and when that comes about and we have an obligation to take steps to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as climate changes are concerned, a more serious aspect is the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Before I discuss that, let me <Col N="1771" /> point out that CFCs are not the only gases that contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer.  Petrol burning engines which do not have a three way catalytic convertor fitted emit materials, such as nitrious oxide, which also damage the ozone layer.  In that regard we should promote greater use of diesel engines; we should also promote the use of catalytic converters, it will probably become compulsory soon anyway, and we should promote the use of smaller petrol engines where petrol engines are used.  However, I regret to say that the last budget went in the opposite direction.  The large reduction in the price of petrol with no reduction in the price of diesel discriminated unfairly in favour of petrol engines.  As regards road tax, the flat upper rate of £800 per annum for any size of car over a certain level brought about a saving for the owner of a Rolls Royce of about £500 per annum, whereas for myself, it involved an increase of 20 per cent in my road tax.  Although this may be only a small issue it is sending the wrong signal in relation to our concern about the environment.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to note that a Cork firm &mdash; Murphys Breweries &mdash; have given a lead by introducing coolers that do not contain CFCs.  As I said initially, it is the responsibility of all of us to address this problem, and it is principally the responsibility of the wealtier countries, who have caused most of the damage to date, and who are in the best position to do something about it.  In that regard I would again have to point the finger at the United States.  With 5 per cent of the world population, they are consuming over 30 per cent of the world oil stock used internationally each year.  The price of oil in the United States is too low and is they have consistently refused to increase the price.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Community, the Commissioner, Carlo Ripa di Meana, has proposed a carbon tax to discourage the use of carboniferous fuels.  Unfortunately, the Community has so far failed to agree to implement this.  Again, this is sending the wrong signal to the Rio <Col N="1772" /> de Janeiro conference and is offering the United States a way out, because I feel they are dragging their feet in tackling the issue of excessive consumption of carboniferous fuels.  We in the Community must lead the way.  We, in Ireland, can help to lead the way in the Community. We have played a reasonably good part in that but, regrettably, as I have already said, the last budget gave a wrong signal with regard to the price of petrol <i>vis-a-vis</i> the price of diesel, and with regard to road tax on the largest cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Senator Haughey, on taking the initiative on this matter at what is a relevant time in the context of the Rio de Janeiro summit.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of hearing his views on this important matter, and those of Senator Raftery, who has on many occasions contributed in a very expert way to issues which perhaps we, as a community, do not consider as important as we should.  This is one of those issues. I am particularly pleased that Senator Raftery vented his ire against the United States.  I intend to follow much the same pattern because I believe they really are the culprits, apart from our own misdemeanours.</P>
      <P>It leads me to ask at the outset, are we really serious as a country and as a member of the European Community, about this issue?  It seems to me that whenever international symposia have been held on this issue over the past couple of years, the goalposts have shifted whenever a decision seems about to be made on the year in which CFCs should be eliminated.  Consequently, at the last minute, the date is extended by yet another two, three or five years.  In this context, the United States seem to be adopting the &ldquo;live now, pay later&rdquo; concept of playing poker with the future of our children, and that of our children's children, as it relates to the depletion of the ozone layer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the United States are dragging their feet on this issue because one must compliment them on having taken the initiative ahead of <Col N="1773" /> Europe in a number of areas.  For example, unleaded petrol was widely available in the United States long before the concept became accepted in this part of the world.  I remember the first occasion I visited the United States, I was driving a car and when I stopped at a petrol filling station, or a gas station as they call it, I was asked if I wanted leaded or unleaded petrol.  I must confess I had no idea what the man was asking me.  I did not know that there was a difference. That was only 15 or 16 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have progressed quite a way in terms of our awareness of the environment and the potential for disaster from carboniferous fuels to which Senator Raftery referred.  The US took the lead in that area and also in relation to the catalytic convertors.  That was not initally a European concept, it was more an American concept.  In the whole area of the use of car fuels, the Americans seem to have been wise to a degree. Therefore, I cannot understand why they have been dragging their feet in the area of CFCs, as Senator Raftery correctly says, and why they had to be pulled, kicking and screaming to the conference, and to agree on a timescale for the eventual elimination of CFCs from the atmosphere. The forthcoming Rio de Janeiro conference may be an ideal opportunity for much of the developed world, and particularly the European Community who now seem to have adopted a multilateral view on this, to reach an agreement on when we should phase out the CFCs.  Perhaps pressure can be brought to bear on our American friends at Rio de Janeiro to concur with this view.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a lackadaisical attitude bordering on apathy here and in developed Europe towards the sun and the dangers from its effects.  When one lives in a temperate climate where there are more grey days than sunny days, human nature being what it is, it is inevitable that we should want to holiday in a sunnier climate for two weeks and come back with a sun tan.  I have been trying <Col N="1774" /> to establish when it became fashionable to have a tan.  It seems to have originated, like many of our modern tastes, in Victorian England.  The term &ldquo;redneck&rdquo;, which is still in use in America in a pejorative sense originated from the peasant or farming stock who were working constantly in the sun and hence they developed red necks and were forever branded as being peasant stock.  Today, one would never refer to somebody sporting a continental tan as being a redneck but essentially the result is the same.  Apparently it became fashionable in the middle of the 19th Century to spend some days in the sun and develop a tan, because it gave an impression of life and vitality and was also used as a cure for various complaints and diseases.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the energy produced by the sun has positive effects.  I was reading recently an article which was anti-sun tanning but which said that certainly the first few days of sunshine after months of grey, dull weather would clear up a few pimples and make a person look a little better, but that ultimately if one stays out in it too long, the pimples could develop into melanoma, as Senator Haughey correctly pointed out.</P>
    <P>There are a number of &ldquo;dos&rdquo; and &ldquo;don'ts&rdquo; that I feel it is important to highlight.  Perhaps the media present for this debate might pick up on some of the more relevant ones.  First, one should not remain in the sun between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.  The old song, &ldquo;Mad Dogs and Englishmen Go Out in the MidDay Sun&rdquo; was written by a continental European who knew what was best for him by staying inside and having a siesta between the hours of 11a.m. and 3 p.m. Obviously the only people who went out between these hours were mad dogs and Englishmen, or Englishwomen.  Unfortunately, Irishmen and Irishwomen do the same when they go abroad, and even when they are at home, if the last few days are anything to go by.</P>
    <P>Second, it is vital that Irish people, and northern Europeans generally, wear a <Col N="1775" /> sun block cream because of their fair skin.  I wonder how many of our young people, not necessarily those going off to sunnier climates, who have taken advantage over the last week of the wonderful sunshine we have been experiencing, have considered even for a moment the possibility of using a sun block.  I would say that the vast majority of them have not, on the basis that &ldquo;a couple of hours sun will not do any harm, it will only do you good&rdquo;.  If you are a fellow you will come out with a tan and the women will think you are great, and if you are a woman you will have a wonderful tan and you will be able to wear a bikini on the beach in the summer and the fellows will think you are great.  It is a question of fashion rather than health.  If one does decide, having bought a sun block and avoided the period between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., to go out in the sun, it is vital that one should only stay out for about an hour.  If one decides to stay longer, you can end up looking pink all over rather than brown, and it is strongly advised that one should cover up the following day and keep out of the sun completely.</P>
    <P>I wonder if manufacturers of sun creams, conditioners, after-sun creams and all the various accoutrements of a modern-day sun holday are somehow neglecting their responsibilities.  It is not enough to create new products and market them as being something wonderful. I believe manufacturers now have a responsibility to their consumers and I hope that the Minister, when replying to this debate, will comment on the role of manufacturers generally, and whether she feels they have a responsibility when marketing their products to make it quite clear &mdash; as cigarette manufacturers were legally obliged to do &mdash; that sun tanning, without taking effective precautions, also damages one's health.  If they will not voluntarily produce information for their consumers, they should be legally obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>I have discovered that the recent spell <Col N="1776" /> of good weather has absolutely nothing to do with the depletion of the ozone layer so we can sleep safely in our beds. According to an item on last night's &ldquo;News at Ten&rdquo; on ITV, it seems that the weather goes through cyclical patterns, known as weather irregularities but meteorologists have not yet been able to establish any firm pattern.  Some of you will remember the last time we had an early summer, which was in May 1976, and it lasted for a couple of weeks.  That was a long time ago, but as we have not had much good weather since I am sure many of you will remember it.  It is similar to the only time that Leitrim won the Connacht Final in 1927, and we are still talking about it.</P>
    <P>We can rest assured the ozone layer is not being depleted to any great extent as a result of the recent good weather but the comments and arguments I have made about adopting a more responsible attitude among our citizens in sunny conditions is still valid nonetheless.  Is the Minister aware that since this issue arose, countries and manufacturers were of the opinion that because fridges were causing this serious difficulty, it was necessary to remove the CFCs and replace them with material more environmentally friendly?  I read somewhere recently that the alternative is now proving doubtful and perhaps we are all getting confused about the ozone problem at this stage.  I only make the point in passing but, because of the number of fridges being used in the developed world and, as Senator Raftery pointed out, the dumping of old-style fridges on the Third World markets, it is a very serious problem and is central to the whole issue of CFCs.</P>
    <P>I am curious to know what steps the Government are taking to alert the public to these problems and the potential danger to our planet if the ozone layer is reduced.  I support the stance taken by the Government, and the enlightened decision to create a Minister of State with responsibility for environmental matters. I compliment them on the moves that <Col N="1777" /> they are making but I wonder what specific steps the Government are taking to alert, inform and educate people about the dangers of too much sun on the one hand which leads to all sorts of medical problems and, on the other hand, the steps they are taking towards encouraging manufacturers to be responsible in marketing their products and what steps they are taking to educate people not to use sprays containing CFCs.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate my congratulations &mdash; I think that is the correct word to use in the circumstances &mdash; to Senator Haughey for taking the initiative in introducing this motion and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with others in complimenting Senator Haughey on putting this motion down. He presented the case very clearly and emphasised the urgency of the problem. The debate has been helpful.  I am genuinely pleased to see so many speakers on the Government side enthusiastic about this motion and showing concern for the environment.  We know the Minister has done more than anybody else in her concern for the environment by the very practical steps she has taken.  Rather than looking at other countries and what they are or are not doing &mdash; there has been a lot of criticism of the United States which I agree with, and we have heard about the problems in the Soviet Union, China and elsewhere &mdash; I would like to examine in more detail what we are doing here and what the problem is here without in any way disregarding the global problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always feel that in approaching environmental issues &mdash; I have said this in other debates here &mdash; it is through the accumulation of a great number of small efforts, whether it is recycling in Ireland or whatever that the global problem will be resolved if every country looks after its own environment.  That is not for one moment to say I do not approve of what is being done in Montreal, London and all the other places and what I hope will <Col N="1778" /> happen in Rio de Janeiro, but I feel that what we should do here is to concentrate on the environmental work we may or may not be doing here.</P>
    <P>In that context it would be very helpful to make it clear that we are not without blame in this regard.  The <i>Protection of the Ozone Layer</i>&mdash; a very good document brought out by the Department of the Environment &mdash; states that the Central Statistics Office indicates we are importing 1,400 tonnes of CVCs and they suspect that the current usage is probably as high as 2,500 tonnes per annum.  I think we can assume that the Department of the Environment would not have been exaggerating the situation and I presume everybody will agree that they are the facts.  I feel we have quite a long way to go and there is much we can and should be doing in this area.  I realise we are talking globally but I was really staggered by a figure of 100 million tonnes of halons in CFCs per annum to be phased out. That is a major challenge which I hope the conference in Rio will take action on and indicate its concern.</P>
    <P>I remember when the former Minister, Deputy Flynn, published an Environment Action Programme in 1990, which was the year of our &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Presidency. At that time I noticed that there were many vague aspirations contained in it.  I refer to the section on the protection of the ozone layer:</P>
    <P>During the Presidency Ireland will play an active role in the international debate on the issue of ozone depletion and will press for more effective action at international level to eliminate the production and use of ozone depleting substances.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for us I suppose to take the international stage and request the elimination of the production of ozones when we do not produce any ourselves. That next two paragraphs state:</P>
    <P>The provision and recovery of recycling facilities for CFCs, especially those used as coolants, etc., will be <Col N="1779" /> promoted and £50,000 will be made available in 1990.</P>
    <P>My colleagues will agree that was not a very generous figure in the context of the problem, and indeed was a very pathetic gesture if that was all that was being offered.  However, a sense of urgency appears to have crept into the situation.</P>
    <P>It also states in the booklet that local authorities will be asked for their views. Senator Haughey mentioned that the Dublin City Council has unanimously passed a motion to make Dublin a CFC-free zone.  I ask the Minister, or the Minister of State, to sign the order confirming that because, we cannot do anything, not even ban smoking in our Chamber, without the Minister's consent.  I would like to know if we will be given an undertaking here this evening that the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, or the Minister, Deputy Smith, will sign such an order.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider what action should be taken.  There is a general feeling in the Seanad that we need to infuse a greater sense of urgency into the whole question of the control and elimination of CFCs and, obviously, we cannot do that if the problem and its solution is not more publicly highlighted.  In that context I would like to compliment the Department of the Environment on this booklet.  It states the position clearly and it is very helpful.  On page 20 of the booklet it says that we should ban imports of CFCs and halons.  I am somewhat disappointed to see, according to what I read, that a total ban does not seem possible at this stage.  As we do not produce CFCs here we need to ban the sale of all ozone depleting substances as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It states at the bottom of that paragraph that &ldquo;a total ban does not seem possible at this stage the reason being that it would prevent the importation of products with essential uses&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister why they cannot be exempted, as this has been done in other places.  In Germany they banned the use <Col N="1780" /> of CFCs for solvents and cleaning agents but they allowed limited exceptions.  Is there any reason the same course cannot be followed here?  I accept there may be some areas where they cannot be banned but can they not be exempted in the legislation?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to ban the importation of CFCs?  Why should we wait for the EC to act or why should we only do as little as we can?  As Senator Haughey said, let us show an example in this situation and let us take the lead. We are always priding ourselves on our actions in environmental matters.</P>
    <P>On page 16 of this booklet the question is asked: &ldquo;what is Ireland doing about ozone depletion?&rdquo;.  We note from this that Ireland is playing its part in international action through participation in conventions, etc.  That is all very good and I am not denigrating it in any way but when it comes to the practical reality of what is happening in this country, we continue to allow the use of CFCs.  Other Senators have made this very clear, and I am sure the Minister feels a great sense of urgency about it.  As far as I am concerned a total ban on the use of CFCs tomorow would be too late.  We have all accepted that too little has been done too late because people did not realise how serious the problem was.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey also refered to the need for ozone alerts.  I fully support him. We need to have a national network of ultra violet B monitoring and we need that equipment hooked into an ozone alert system.  I understand &mdash; the Minister probably knows more about this than I do &mdash; that such equipment is relatively inexpensive.  I understand that Trinity College is producing monitoring equipment which costs as little as £500, whereas prior to that I think the US equipment was costing in the region of $400.  How many of these monitors are needed and where they will be put I do not know, but I think we should have ozone alerts like we have pollen counts. There are a great number of countries where this has already been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> One other suggestion I would like to make &mdash; I think Senator Mooney referred to it &mdash; is that the Minister might give information about blocking creams.  If you go out to buy a fridge how can you know if you are buying an ozone friendly fridge?  Is there any assistance on that? What about monitoring the labelling of products which say there are no CFCs in them?  Can we believe that?  I was going to mention briefly what other countries are doing.  There is a great deal being done in other places.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment on the question of HCFCs.  Will they be dealt with, are they being dealt with and can we expect them to be included in the ban in the near future?  I hope the Minister will act in the decisive and courageous way that she has done in the past, that we will lead in this area by example and that we will get our own house in order first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for raising this issue tonight.  I would like to thank Senator Haughey in particular for proposing this motion and to acknowledge the support he is giving to the Government's efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ozone layer depletion is an issue which has brought home to Governments and peoples across the world the collective responsibility of humanity for the sustainable development of our planet. International co-operation has been successfully mobilised in face of the dangers involved.  Indeed, the mechanisms for international co-operation developed for the elimination of ozone damaging substances have set an important precedent for the more recent global action on climate change and biodiversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate, as the Seanad has acknowledged, is particularly opportune coming as it does just a week before the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) opens in Rio de Janeiro.  I know the Minister for the Environment will be addressing <Col N="1782" /> this House on UNCED tomorrow. The scheduling of these two important motions in the Seanad this week reflects the widespread concern which now exists for the environmental consequences of all our actions.</P>
    <P>The ozone layer acts as a vital shield for the earth's eco-system, filtering and controlling the penetration of ultra-violet radiation.  Excesses of this radiation threaten human and animal health, particularly in relation to skin cancers and eye diseases, and in addition will lead to various forms of crop damage.  The protection of the ozone layer has attracted particular attention this year with reports of a more rapid than anticipated depletion in the northern hemisphere.</P>
    <P>The European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment, known by its acronym EASOE, began in mid-November 1990 and completed its main measurement phase at the end of March 1992.  The research was prompted by the decline in northern hemisphere ozone values during the last decade and the need to understand the role of the halocarbons in this decline.  Measurements were made over a wide area of Central Europe, across the North Atlantic to Greenland and the European Arctic region, including Russia.  They comprised regular ground-based and ozone sonde measurements for more than 20 sites, observations within the ozone layer by experiments on 41 large balloons and nearly 100 flights of three research aircraft. A large amount of data has been collected and analysis will continue for several months.</P>
    <P>Preliminary results indicate that the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere was highly perturbed this winter.  This was due to man-made chlorine and also large amounts of aerosols following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo; total ozone amounts in the European Arctic and middle latitudes were anomalously low and were less than expected from simple extrapolations of ground-based and satellite <Col N="1783" /> ozone measurements.  The low ozone amounts can be partly explained by the unusual tropospheric weather patterns this winter; while rates of ozone loss were large at times during January and February in many of the air parcels studied, the subsequent rise in temperatures which led to a decrease in the levels of reactive chlorine compounds precluded a major ozone loss or &ldquo;ozone hole&rdquo;; and the measurements this winter indicated the potential of the chlorine already in the stratosphere to cause large ozone loss.  With the inevitability of increased chlorine loading during the rest of this decade and the possibility in other years of lower temperatures later in the winter, this potential for ozone destruction could be realised in the future.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling in this context that concern about depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is of quite recent origin.  A paper in 1974 by two American scientists, Rowland and Molina, postulated on a theoretical basis the likely connection between certain chlorine and bromine emissions and damage to the stratospheric ozone layer.  Chlorofluorocarbons, the so-called CFCs, and halons are potent sources of these chlorine and bromine emissions respectively. While these chemicals are stable at ground level, they release chlorine or bromine atoms when exposed to ultra-violet radiation in the stratosphere. These atoms break down the ozone molecule in the ozone layer and change it into ordinary oxygen; the chlorine or bromine atoms remain available to do further damage over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>As we know, use of CFCs increased greatly since the early 1970s.  They were adopted for use as cooling agents in fridges and air conditioning systems, as propellants in aerosol cans, as solvents in the electronics industry and in other activities, and to blow foam for furniture, packaging and insulation.  Halons are used mainly in fire extinguishers.</P>
    <P>The theory of Rowland and Molina <Col N="1784" /> found empirical verification with the researches of scientists into the Antarctic stratosphere.  The so-called &ldquo;hole&rdquo; which was identified in the Antarctic ozone layer confirmed the fear that breakdown of the layer might be occurring.  Meteorological processes, in addition to chemical processes, play a role in determining ozone distribution.  The EASOE experiments are, therefore, a significant contribution towards a better understanding of the process of the ozone layer depletion.</P>
    <P>International co-operation in this area began in 1985 with the conclusion of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme. This was a framework convention and was intended to be complemented by more specific Protocols. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed in September 1987.  That Protocol introduced controls on the production, consumption, import and export of five CFCs and three halons implicated in ozone depletion.  Each party to the Protocol was required to ensure that its level of consumption of CFCs was halved by 1998 compared to 1986 levels; consumption of halons was to be stabilised at 1986 levels in 1992.</P>
    <P>While the Montreal Protocol was a landmark decision it quickly became apparent that its controls were not sufficiently stringent to halt ozone layer depletion.  In 1989 scientists reported that, while there was no ozone hole over the Arctic comparable to the one which had emerged in Antarctica, the Arctic stratosphere had nonetheless been observed to be perturbed with significant amounts of active chlorine present. There was, therefore, potential for ozone loss in the region.  Scientists also reported that even with a complete phase-out of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals, it would be decades or even centuries before chlorine levels dropped to the level of the early seventies because <Col N="1785" /> of the long time that these substances remain in the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The EC led the campaign to revise or strengthen the Montreal Protocol.  The European Council at is meeting in Dublin in June 1990 adopted a Declaration on the Environment.</P>
    <P>Substantial adjustments and amendments were subsequently agreed in London in June 1990: first, CFCs and halons already controlled by the 1987 Protocol were to be subjected to an accelerated phase-out programme so as to eliminate their production and consumption by the year 2000, with intermediate targets of a 50 per cent cut by 1995 and an 85 per cent cut by 1997. Second, new substances were identified for control namely, other fully-halongenated CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, which is used mainly to produce CFCs, and methyl chloroform, which is used as a solvent.  A phase-out date for the production and consumption of these other CFCs and for carbon tetrachloride was also set for the year 2000 and for the year 2005 for methyl chloroform.  Third, a financial mechanism was established to ensure the widest possible participation by countries in the Protocol.  This recognised the burden which compliance with the new provisions would place on developing countries.  The London Amendment accordingly provides for arrangements relating to financial assistance and technical co-operation, including technology transfers, for developing countries.  The mechanism is intended to meet all the agreed incremental costs to these countries of compliance with the Protocol.  Pending the formal establishment of the financial mechanism, an interim mechanism is operating in the period 1991-93 with total funding amounting to US$200 million.</P>
    <P>The London Amendment is a valuable achievement as it marked a further advance in our efforts to protect the ozone layer.  It is due to come into force on 10 August 1992 as the necessary number of instruments of ratification <Col N="1786" /> have now been lodged.  Ireland, together with other European countries ratified the amendment in December 1991.</P>
    <P>I will readily admit, however, that at the London meeting Ireland pressed for and would like to have seen agreement on earlier phase-out dates.  However, not all countries were able to support this, but in recognition of the threat to the ozone layer the member states of the European Communities decided in March 1991 that CFCs and carbon tetrachloride should be phased out earlier within the EC: dates of 1 July 1997 were fixed for CFCs and 1 January 1998 for carbon tetrachloride, two and a half years and two years, respectively, ahead of the London deadlines.  As regards implementation, the control provisions of the original and the amended Montreal Protocol are being implemented jointly by the EC member states and this has proved an effective arrangement.</P>
    <P>The latest scientific findings from EASOE show the need for even more stringent measures and the EC has responded quickly to the situation.  In March this year the Environment Council adopted a position in favour of the elimination of the production and consumption of CFCs and related substances by end 1995 and a reduction of 85 per cent by end 1993.  This advanced timetable is a major step forward and Ireland fully supports the measures.</P>
    <P>The Community will press for the adoption of similar timetables at the review of the Montreal Protocol to be concluded in Copenhagen next November. The EC are also looking for the institution of a system of controls on the so-called &ldquo;transitional substances&rdquo; which are being developed to allow the phase-out of CFCs but which also have an, albeit lower, ozone-depleting potential.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently adopted an advanced position on measures to protect the ozone layer.  We are a party to the Vienna Convention and have ratified the Montreal Protocol and were among the first EC countries to ratify the London <Col N="1787" /> Amendment.  In August 1990 a document entitled &ldquo;Protecting the Ozone Layer&rdquo; was published by my Department.  It outlines in non-scientific terms the problem of ozone depletion and action being taken to counter it.  The document was widely distributed free of charge and is available from ENFO.  The Irish Presidency of the EC worked for the adoption of the London Amendment of the Montreal Protocol.  Ireland is contributing to the multilateral fund established under the amended Montreal Protocol.  A quarter of a million pounds will be made available by Ireland to the fund in the period 1991-93.</P>
    <P>None of the controlled substances is manufactured in Ireland and our overall use of them is relatively small: the latest figures available to my Department show annual national usage of the main CFCs of the order of 2,500 tonne per annum. Direct contact has been made with the industry.  Significant suppliers and users of CFCs in Ireland were asked to develop individual company programmes to reduce and eliminate the use of these substances as quickly as possible.  I am pleased to report that all of the companies expressed awareness of the requirements involved and responded in positive terms.  I will continue to encourage a total phase-out of these substances in Ireland as rapidly as possible.  I accept the suggestions made in that regard by Senator Hederman.  Although there are no substitutes for some medical equipment &mdash; for example, inhalers for asthmatics &mdash; we will explore the possibility of an earlier phase-out where there are alternatives.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond to some of the specific points made by Senators. Senators Raftery, McKenna, Hederman and Haughey referred to the need for monitoring.  I am pleased to tell the House that my Department have started discussion with the Meteorological Service with regard to having ultra-violet radiation monitoring in this country.  We <Col N="1788" /> believe that a sufficient number of sites should be found where this monitoring could take place.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery and a number of other Senators were very critical of the United States and I think there is a misconception here.  While the United States have been slow in relation to climate change, they have been progressive in relation to CFCs.  They too have a 1995 phase-out date.  In relation to the fund that was established under the amended Montreal Protocol, the United States pay 25 per cent of that fund, which is by any stretch of the imagination a substantial amount.  To be fair, they have been good in relation to CFCs.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey referred to the efforts made by Team Aer Lingus in dealing with halons during the maintenance of aircraft.  I would pay tribute to the efforts made by Team Aer Lingus.  They were one of the winners this year of the Good Environment Awards for Industry for that particular effort.  I compliment them and I would like to encourage Irish industry to continue to explore environmentally friendly options.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the sun and Senator Raftery spoke about younger women wanting to get a sun tan.  I think not so young women and indeed men want sun tans too.  In fact, in the 18th century people spent a lot of money putting toxic chemicals on their face to make it whiter and it is probably only a matter of time before it becomes fashionable again to be pale skinned.  As Senator Haughey said, I launched the Irish Cancer Society's sun and skin campaign last week.  They have a very appropriate slogan; fry now and pay later.  It is very apt.  It never ceases to amuse me how much concern there is in Ireland about the depletion of the ozone layer and yet how quick people are to run off and bake themselves in the sun.  They do not seem to see the connection.  Some people who have highlighted the difficulties and dangers have equally been the people most <Col N="1789" /> vociferous in trying to find their way to sun-packed holidays.</P>
    <P>In relation to recycling, the safe storage of CFCs and fridges, my Department have made grants available to local authorities in line with the environmental action plan.  Twenty-four local authorities now have facilities and we are having discussions with two further local authorities.  That is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the need for a public health warning and my Department are having discussions with the Department of Health in that regard. It is essentially a matter for the Department of Health as to what issues they decide to give public health warnings on. I know discussions are under way in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the need for proper labelling of products and I share his concern.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, which is now in force, provides a system for the establishment here of eco-labelling and that will give a correct and authoritative guidance to consumers.  Only those companies, manufacturers and products that have been submitted and approved for the label will be able to carry the label in future.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Seanad for giving us the opportunity of discussing this issue and for showing such a high level of interest in environmental matters generally.  I have been to this House on numerous occasions in the past couple of years and it indicates to me that among the representative of the people there is a high level of interest.  I compliment Senator Haughey and the Fianna Fáil Party for putting this motion down this evening for Private Members' time.  I thank them for their good wishes in relation to the Rio Conference.  I hope it begins the process of the world being able to deal in a realistic way with the problems of economic growth and environmental protection and that we <Col N="1790" /> can begin to plan ahead on the basis of sustainable development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join in welcoming Senator Haughey's motion and I welcome the Minister's very detailed and comprehensive response.  As the Minister said in her final comments, we have this at times very difficult balance between economic development and the maintenance of the environment.  It signifies a tremendous change worldwide, but particularly in our attitude to the environment.</P>
      <P>During the course of this Seanad we have had many practical references, Bills, discussions and debates on the environment.  It is only a short time ago since the Minister herself was with us for prolonged and detailed debates on the Environment Protection Agency Bill.  It is very much to the credit of his country that for the first time the environment was made the primary concern of the European Community during our Presidency. We have contributed as much as we can to international recognition of the problem.  It is perhaps particularly appropriate that we should be doing so in relation to what is very much an Antarctic discovery.  It was, after all, an Irishman, Shackleton, who was so pre-eminent at the turn of this century in Antarctic research and really set the foundations for the work which so many years later was to lead to American and other observations in relation to the ozone layer. Let us not forget that at one time the Antarctic explorers and researchers were ridiculed.  The time and money spent and the danger in which they put themselves were often criticised and in post-war years it was quite difficult to find funds for the Polar Institute, for various other Antarctic research institutions and research expeditions and for research bases in the Antarctic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings home a general lesson that it is very easy at times to condemn what seems like almost irrelevant research, pure research.  What relevance is it to us <Col N="1791" /> here in Ireland that people are spending a winter in the Antarctic looking at the penguins, measuring the depths of snow and taking these very abstruse measurements of such things as the ozone layer? It is only in the past four or five years perhaps that we have realised it could be of enormous significance.</P>
    <P>I am glad the proposer of the motion, his seconder, the Minister and indeed all the speakers have emphasised the health aspect.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, coming from County Limerick, from a rural background, will remember from the talk of old folk that in years back it was regarded, rightly, as a very serious sign if someone became deeply tanned all over their body.  It was fine if you got tanned on the face or if men working in the field got tanned on the chest; but if someone had the overall tan that so many people strive for today, it was regarded with great seriousness because it was a manifestation of a particular form of tuberculosis affecting one of the hormone glands of the body.  As the Minister has suggested, the fashion in those days was to be as white as possible.  The jet setters of the times painted themselves; indeed I think there were lead paints involved which probably did not do them all that much good, even if they produced a temporary pallor of the face and cheeks.</P>
    <P>Now we have gone right round to the opposite side.  People are looking for this tan and until very recently were doing so with very little regard or concern for, or perhaps even knowledge of, the fact that they could be running quite a serious risk of skin cancer and other forms of cancer, particularly if they do not use creams which cut down and reduce the ultraviolet rays.  The Minister has taken up the suggestion made here that manufacturers should point out &mdash; and in this case it would be something very much to the benefit of their sales &mdash; the usefulness, and indeed necessity, of having some indication of the tremendous importance <Col N="1792" /> of using a cream which will cut down the ultra-violet rays.</P>
    <P>This is particularly important for Irish people.  We are, it so happens, the most liable to skin cancer of any race or group of people in the world.  We have many advantages, but this is one of the physical disadvantages we have.  Someone mentioned the rednecks.  To this day in Barbados, to which once upon a time Irish people were rather involuntarily removed, there is a group of people, sometimes called the Irishers, sometimes called the rednecks.  This is related to the very severe effects of the sun on their skin.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a lot of fashion in this. A few years ago people laughed at the idea of the old sun helmet; you would have a laugh straight away on television or in the theatre if someone came along wearing a sun hat or helmet but there was a very good reason for it in its day. Perhaps not with the explorer's toupee, but it is useful to cover the old head with something if you are out in the midday sun.  Certainly, for many Irish people going to Spain or the Canaries or wherever else to get sun it is very foolish to rush out to try to get as much sun as possible in the first two or three days, particularly during the heat of the first two or three days.  Quite apart from the pain and discomfort, there can be rather more lasting and more serious effects.</P>
    <P>I would like to come towards a conclusion by referring to CFCs and DDT. It is not all that long ago when in this country we thought DDT was the best thing going.  Farmers were being advised to spray their crops with DDT, housewives were using it to get rid of flies and so on.  It took two decades before we realised the enormous damage that was being done by the use of DDT.  Unfortunately, in many countries of the world it is still being used and there is still the accumulation of damage caused.</P>
    <P>Thank goodness, with CFCs there is a more rapid appreciation of the damage they can cause.  Sometimes I wonder in <Col N="1793" /> view of the very stringent regulations we rightly apply now before a new drug can be introduced and given to people, whether similar regulations should not in some way be applied to industry before substances such as CFCs go into widespread use.  Closely related to this we have furniture with foam in it, containing similar, and in many cases the same substances, which have been responsible for so many deaths because of the rapidity with which such substances not only take fire but produce noxious fumes.</P>
    <P>It is a very good step forward to see that a motion such as this, which would have been almost unthinkable ten years ago, or regarded as irrelevant or trivial, is now recognised as being one of the more important private motions that have been put forward in this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  It is extremely difficult to enthuse the ordinary person when you talk about something as abstract as the ozone layer and explain to him the danger of depletion, but nevertheless most people have recognised that there is a change in our weather patterns over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech.  I have been following the Minister's work in her Department as it relates to the environment and to energy.  I would have preferred if the Minister could have been more explicit on the practical steps we could take in this country to do our part to ensure that an improvement can take place.  I know we have not got a manufacturing industry which produces CFCs here.  It is true that some of these products are used in aerosols of one kind or another, but I understand that on many of those aerosols you now see &ldquo;Environmentally friendly&rdquo; marked on them.  We shall be looking closely at this structure because of skin cancers in the next number of years people will have difficulty getting treatment because of the shortage of <Col N="1794" /> hospital beds and there is no indication that the situation is improving.  It is important that people should take whatever steps are necessary to prevent skin cancers.</P>
    <P>The sources of the greenhouse effect and the contribution of greenhouse gases, if expressed as a percentage indicate that energy accounts for 49 per cent, deforestation 14 per cent and agriculture 13 per cent.  I will deal briefly with agriculture and ask the Minister to seriously consider some of my suggestions.</P>
    <P>As I said, agriculture contributes 13 per cent to the greenhouse effect.  I would ask the Department, in an effort to make some contribution, provide a special grant-in-aid to either EOLAS or Teagasc to develop a non-farm gas digester that would convert methane gas so that it could be bottled and used for heating purposes and so on?  As people drive through the country they express dissatisfaction at the obnoxious smells from the slurry spreading.  If the methane gas is extracted from the slurry the residue will not have any smell.  That type of inhouse industry would not only provide greater efficiency to the agriculture industry, but would probably save on the importation of fossil fuels which, we are told, will be depleted by the year 2018.</P>
    <P>Energy accounts for 49 per cent of greenhouse gases.  Here again the Department of the Environment could encourage practical steps to be taken in this direction.  For instance, newly developed solar panels are available that do not need direct sunlight to provide a substitute heat source, whether it is for water heating or other energy requirements. This too would save on the importation of fossil fuels.  The Government &mdash; whether it is the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Energy or the Department of the Environment &mdash; should encourage greater use of bio-energy and the introduction of bio-diesel.  A great deal of work has been done in these areas in France, Germany and Austria.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> Last week during a debate on a section of the Finance Bill dealing with a Community directive of 15 February last, the Minister told us that the Commissioner had introduced a directive, which will be compulsory in member states from 1 January 1993 and will reduce by 90 per cent the duty on bio-energy, whether it is ethanol-based petrol or vegetable oil-based diesel; a diester.  This would make the fuel very competitive.  To my horror the Minister and his officials said they never heard of it.  How an EC directive announced by way of a press release on 15 February 1992 can escape the attention of our gurus in the Department of Finance beats me.  Anything that will cost the Exchequer even a few pounds will not see the light of day, and that makes me apprehensive.  Not only can we, as a small economy, make a worth-while contribution to the conservation of the ozone layer, but we can provide the opportunity for new industries and job creation.</P>
    <P>The latest figures for C02 emissions by fuel are peat 20 per cent, coal 26 per cent, gas 10 per cent and oil 44 per cent. The emissions by sector, which is a very important consideration are, transport 19 per cent &mdash; we can do something about that by changing over to more environmentally friendly fuel &mdash; industry 18 per cent, utilities 35 per cent, commercial 7 per cent and residential 21 per cent.  The transport and residential areas could make a considerable contribution to a reduction in the emissions of C02 by more efficient use of solar energy and the introduction and promotion of environmentally friendly fuels, either through vegetable oils, whether rape seed or linseed, or any of the ethanol or alcohol based fuels which can be made from many of the farm crops we grow.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I hope our delegation to the conference in Rio de Janeiro next month will come back with positive views and ideas on how to make a practical contribution <Col N="1796" /> to the type of environment we should all like to conserve.</P>
    <P>If I read the new Common Agriculture Policy amendments correctly, there is an opportunity of creating in the region of 12,000 or 14,000 additional jobs.  If we grow the same acreage of rape seed oil as we do best, the number of jobs in Greencore could be doubled.  Those opportunities are there for all to see; they are not a figment of somebody's imagination.  However, the big problem for the farming community is that they do not have the contracts to put additional acreage under the plough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important debate, even though its importance may not be immediately recognised.  The Minister spoke about the public interest in certain impacts of ozone depletion, such as the ultra violet radiation that can cause certain kinds of skin cancer and so on, that has a certain public face to it, but there are other more remote areas in which we should have considerable concern and where this Government, and particularly this Minister with her sensitivity to issues like this, can and will play a significant role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take up a couple of technical arguments because they may not be fully understood.  It may well be that the Minister has contemplated these arguments and has rejected them.  While I welcome her speech in general, I am a little concerned at the paragraph where she refers to new substances having been identified for control, namely, other fully-halogenated CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, and so on and the phase-out date for the production and consumption of CFCs and carbon tetrachloride also set for the year 2000 and the year 2005 for metal chloroform.  I am concerned because I do not believe that these so-called HCFCs are quite the adequate remedy they appear to be.  The reason for this is technical, because the mechanism of measuring their impact on the <Col N="1797" /> ozone layer is deficient.  Civil servants use a measure called the ozone depletion potential in order to evaluate the impact of substances on the ozone layer.  For a variety of reasons, which I hope to have the opportunity to place on the record, this is an inadequate method of measuring this impact.  In fact, I will put on the record of the House two clear examples of why and how this is so.</P>
    <P>It under-estimates the short and medium term impacts, particularly of halogenated CFCs, which the Minister referred to and appeared to be satisfied with in her speech.  In fact, the United Kingdom's scientists have described the use of ozone depletion potential as being a completely unreliable indicator in this case.  We ought to bear that in mind. Because HCFCs release their chlorine much more quickly than CFCs, they will have the most serious impact within the next few decades, at a time when the ozone layer faces its maximum exposure to chlorine pollution from CFCs already in the air.  This will increase the amount of ultraviolet light penetrating the ozone layer during the period of maximum risk. This is precisely what the Minister is concerned about.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Commissioner of the European Community, Carlo Ripa di Meana, stated at the beginning of this year that:</P>
    <P>HCFCs also contain chlorine and can therefore destroy ozone.  They have approximately only 5% of the ozone depletion potential of CFCs. Nevertheless, it is of paramount importance that HCFCs are controlled under the Montreal Protocol and that the system of control is complied with globally.  To this end, I will propose to the Commission that a quantitative limit &mdash; to be known as a cap &mdash; should be placed on the amount of transitional substances consumed globally.</P>
    <P>The exact level of a cap will still have to be discussed in the framework of our consultations with industry, but I <Col N="1798" /> see the figure of 5% of a total ozone-depleting potential as only a starting point and would feel happier with a lower figure.</P>
    <P>The problem with that is that the Commissioner has accepted this form of measurement, he has accepted this instrument to measure.  However, he is suggesting that it will have a 5 per cent impact.  In other words, because there is a 5 per cent register by this indicator, the ozone depletion potential, it will, therefore, merely have a 5 per cent impact on the ozone layer.  This is incorrect if more sensitive methods of measurement are applied.  I will give two examples.</P>
    <P>The ozone depletion potential of HCFC 22, calculated over 200 to 500 years is 5 per cent of that CFC 11, but the chlorine loading potential of HCFC 22, which is a better method of assessing the impact, is 15.2 per cent of CFC 11, greater than that of methyl chloroform which stands at 11.4 per cent and which is a recognised major ozone depleter.  In other words by using another method of calculation, you arrive at a position that these halogenated CFCs are, in fact, more dangerous in certain aspects of their impact than chemicals that are already recognised as being seriously toxic.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the SORG &mdash; the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group &mdash; in the United Kingdom &mdash; a group of scientists who are looking into this area &mdash; stated that:</P>
    <P>the use of ODP is limited by the failure of models to predict ozone depletion correctly and by the fact that it refers to steady state conditions which precludes predictions of changes over the next few decades.</P>
    <P>A year later, the 1991 SORG report reinforced this point.  It observed that:</P>
    <P>Although ODPs purport to give a true basis for comparison between halocarbons, the models of atmospheric chemistry by which they are calculated cannot reproduce measured ozone depletion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> There is a serious worry expressed by responsible senior British civil servants employed as scientists by the British Government with regard to the efficiency and appropriateness of using this method of calculation.  Here it will give my second example.</P>
    <P>The relative impact, in terms of chlorine loading, of an emission of HCFC 141b after ten years would be over half that of a similar emission of CFC 11, yet its steady state ODP is only 8 per cent.  In other words, if you measure the impact of this particular chemical using the ozone depletion potential as your indicator, you come up with an 8 per cent impact, whereas if you use the other method it is 50 per cent.  That is a very serious discrepancy and something that ought to be looked into.</P>
    <P>The study commissioned for the United Kingdom Government by Coopers and Lybrand into this question of HCFCs indicated that not only is there a problem here but there is going to be an increase in the use of HCFCs over the next decade or so.  They predicted growth in demand for HCFCs of more than 10 per cent per year.  The study states that suppliers anticipated growth at up to 10 per cent per annum in 1996 with a decline after 2006.  This implies that demand could double.  There are no official United Kingdom Government figures for HCFC production or use but ICI at present have production capacity for 30,000 tonnes of HCFC 22 a year at their plant in Runcorn, Cheshire.</P>
    <P>I put this on the record because the Minister indicated that we are not the guilty parties, that we are not producing any of these chemicals here.  However, ICI in England are producing very considerable quantities.  This raises the question of why material is presented in certain ways; why particular indicators are chosen.  I would suggest to the Minister that there is more than a possibility that this is done for commercial reasons as a result of a considerable lobby by <Col N="1800" /> the chemical industry in Great Britain, particularly in view of the fact that the United Kingdom Government's scientists, the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group, recommend using chlorine loading potential which are not based on models of long-term chemicals as ODPs are, but on more straightforward calculations and observations of how much pollution actually gets into the lower and upper atmosphere in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>Why are we having the plugging of these particular chemicals, a trap into which I feel the Minister may have fallen, although she may possess information I do not have, particularly when you look at the fact that there are in existence chemicals and substances which do not have this problem.  ICI have lobbied about this.  They claim that the new chemicals they generate are cost effective, yet this is clearly wrong.  HCFCs are a significant threat to the ozone layer, while ICI's product HFC 134a, with which the company are keen to capture a significant part of the former CFC market, is a greenhouse gas 3,200 times stronger than carbon dioxide.  The main concern of these companies in producing CFCs and HCFCs may be to deny market to truly alternative systems which may not offer the same profit but which will do the same job.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to one paragraph from a report I have in front of me.  In reality these halogenated CFCs that the Minister was waxing lyrical about are not essential substances for society, only for HCFC manufacturers and commercial users who want to avoid investing in new less harmful equipment.  The Coopers and Lybrand report states that &ldquo;there are no current or potential applications of HCFCs in the sectors examined for which no other technically feasible alternatives exist or are likely to be available in the short to medium term&rdquo;.  In other words, there is an option and I would hope that in the light of the discrepancies I have indicated this evening <Col N="1801" /> in the different forms of measurement for ozone depletion, the Minister will lobby along the lines I have suggested that, instead of accepting the easy notion that halogenated CFCs are an alternative, she will realise they are not as acceptable an alternative as she appears to believe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening and answering so well the various queries put to her on this important subject.  I also thank all the Senators who contributed to this motion.  We have had a wideranging debate and it is appropriate that we should discuss the depletion of the ozone layer this week in advance of the Earth Summit in Rio.</P>
      <P>The Minister and some Senators mentioned that the Seanad seems to be playing a particular role as regards environmental issues.  That is very important.  The Seanad has to carve out a role for itself and I suggest that cultural and environmental affairs are suitable for this House.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her scientific grasp of all the issues involved. Ozone depletion is a technical issue and the Minister put that forward in scientific terms.  I am delighted to hear from the Minister that Ireland is to the forefront on this issue.  She also mentioned that discussions are taking place regarding the monitoring of the depletion of the earth's ozone layer.  That is a major advance and I know the Meteorological Service will fulfil their obligations in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that 24 local authorities have put in facilities to deal with the recycling of fridges.  The Minister mentioned that discussions are taking place with the Department of Health regarding public health warnings. There is no doubt that ozone alert warning systems will be a feature of modern life, particularly in the northern hemisphere; they already exist in many other countries, especially in Latin America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> A number of Senators spoke about the greenhouse effect.  In my view the ozone layer is separate from the greenhouse effect, although obviously both are environmental issues.  No doubt we will be able to discuss in greater detail the whole question of the greenhouse effect and how to deal with it in tomorrow's debate.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna suggested that ordinary people are not aware of the problem and that education is needed in that regard.  I suggested that too, but young people in our schools are aware of the problem.  I understand that over the past few weeks children have been coming home from school, having learned all about the Earth Summit, and asking their parents what they are doing about the environment.  That is a healthy sign.  Our children are being educated about the environment; the children are teaching their parents with regard to the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Many Senators mentioned the USA and how they seem to be dragging their heels.  However, the Minister clarified that and said that they are not necessarily dragging their heels on the CFC question. The role of the USA at the Earth Summit will be watched closely.  America is a great country, but its basic philosophy is consumption, cheap gas, etc., and the American dream is very much linked into that industrial development.  It will be very difficult for the United States to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned how fashionable it is to have a sun tan, but that was not always the case, to have very white skin was fashionable at one time and, no doubt, that will be the case again.</P>
    <P>An interesting situation has developed in the local authority in Dublin.  It has been brought to my attention that when the local authority are carrying out junk collections, fridges are often left out and the men involved do not always appreciate how environmentally sensitive fridges are.  I believe this could be true and, while we have the extraction unit at Hammond <Col N="1803" /> Lane, the public and the people involved with the collection of fridges need to be further educated in that regard.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of examining whether Ireland could be declared a CFC free zone.  The following motion is on Dublin County Council's agenda today:</P>
    <P>That following the unanimous agreement at City Council that Dublin be declared a CFC free zone, this committee proposes that the Dublin city area be declared a special control area under section 39 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, with a view to eliminating CFCs from Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider that motion seriously when its terms are conveyed to her.  No doubt there are a number of legal implications, but it would be great to see local authorities taking a lead and to see Ireland take the high moral ground and declare the country a CFC free zone.</P>
    <P>Several Senators mentioned health warnings and how Irish people do not seem to be concerned about sun bathing and so on.  We need to consider that matter carefully.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for her contribution. She seems to be tackling the various issues involved.  No doubt, all those issues will be high on the agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio.  I hope that all countries will co-operate in that process and make a meaningful effort to tackle the various environmental issues confronting us.  The summit has been described as the last chance to save the earth.  I know that Ireland will lead the way and that we will take a lead through the EC process and bring that view to the Earth Summit in Rio.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for their contributions. We dealt with all the issues in great detail.  There is no doubt the matter is serious.  The evidence the Minister presented is indeed, scientific and technical. At the end of the day all that information confirms that a hole could <Col N="1804" /> possible appear in the northern hemisphere over the next two years and that is a very dangerous situation.  We need to take all possible steps to tackle the problem and reduce the emission of CFC gases into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear that monitoring of the depletion of the ozone layer is underway.  I am delighted that discussions are taking place with the Department of Health regarding ozone alert warnings and that Ireland is taking a lead in the EC.  In conclusion, I ask the Minister to consider seriously the possibility of declaring Ireland a CFC free zone given that we do not manufacture CFCs in this country.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin gcás a bheidh mé ag ardú inniu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address myself to the question of means testing, particularly as it relates to people over the age of 18 living with their parents.  As I understand the regulations at the moment, and it is hard to get definitive documentation on this, people living with parents are assessed on their parents' income above a certain level.  I understand that if somebody claimed unemployment assistance while living with their parents whose income exceeds £160 a week, they would then not be entitled to social employment assistance.  I understand that the calculation is worked out by excluding parents' income up to a limit of £105 and making amounts in excess of that assessable. I heard of one case lately where the <Col N="1805" /> parents' income &mdash; was £200 a week. There was three people in their twenties &mdash; from 21 to 27 &mdash; living at home; and £105 was deducted from the £200 giving a balance of £95.  There was a dependent child in the house, so £12 was allowed and the difference when divided by three meant that each young person was entitled to unemployment assistance of around £30.</P>
    <P>The argument can be put that the State cannot fund such people and that there was sufficient means in that house.  Most adults do not want to be dependent on their parents beyond a certain stage of life, and there is a hidden cost that cancels any possible savings made by accounting the parents' income, that is, the temptation for people in this situation to move out of home and obtain accommodation elsewhere.  If they do they become entitled to £55 per week, to go on the housing list and to a rent supplement in certain cases.  The Department of Social Welfare can wind up paying them in the region of £80 to £90 per week.  Furthermore, another name may have been added to the housing list and there is pressure already on housing lists all over the country.  The State may eventually be obliged to provide such a person with local authority accommodation at a cost of £20,000 to £30,000.</P>
    <P>I know that regulations say one must justify leaving home, but that is not beyond people's imaginative capacity when there is a financial benefit at stake. It is easy enough to say I am not getting on with my parents, we fight all the time, I had to leave home and if I return there will be rows all the time.  It is impossible for a social welfare officer in that situation to give an accurate assessment of the situation.  My view on this is that people placed in this situation in order to obtain independent means add to the net cost on the State.</P>
    <P>I would also like to address myself &mdash; as I have in my motion &mdash; to people who obtain temporary, transient, part-time income.  Somebody might be on call to work part-time in a pub and would earn £5 or £10 a night.  If they work legitimately <Col N="1806" /> they are obliged to sign off for that day which means that they lose £10 or £11 unemployment assistance.  It is reasonable to say that nobody is going to forego £10 or £11 to earn an income of £8 or £9.</P>
    <P>Many schemes are meant to address this problem, including the part-time workers' scheme, but that operates on the assumption that we live in an ordered world.  It presumes, for example, that part-time work will give one an income well in excess of £25 a week if one is single.  It also presumes that one is going to get work for two months at least.  As an ex-employer who often gave part-time work, I faced a serious problem if I needed to employ somebody for one, two or three days.  If somebody got sick, they could get supplementary income by working on an on-call basis getting a day here and a day there but if they work the system legitimately, as the Minister recently pointed out they should in a recent major speech, there is no profit in it for them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore for somebody working in the self-employed sector on a part-time basis, there are no part-time job incentives because to avail of these incentives one must be in either A1 or J1 employment. I know the Minister has addressed himself to the question of means testing but in my experience, it is a minefield which prevents people from rising one small step above the minimum income levels.  We should accept that social welfare incomes are minimum incomes and the objective should be to help people to get off the bottom rung of the ladder because the concommitant cost savings in social services, housing, etc., are considerable when there is even part-time work available.  I have done a certain amount of survey work unofficially and have found that where there is part-time or full-time work and a variety of income extras available in a community, the cost of and demand for social services drops rapidly.  Unfortunately our system tends not to take that balance into account and <Col N="1807" /> that policy has not been cost effective.  It has been a disincentive to people to work and, furthermore, has encouraged people in the long term to make extra demands on the State.</P>
    <P>Ceisteanna tábhachtacha iad seo uilig. Ní mór dúinn córas a leagan amach nach spreagfaidh daoine chun costais bhreise a chur ar an Stát.  Is maith go bhfanfaidh daoine ina gcónaí sa mbaile muna bhfuil postanna acu mar beidh siad ann le cúnamh a thabhairt dá muintir agus iad ag éirí sean.

Ba chóir go mbeadh daoine ábalta tairbhe a bhaint as obair ar bith a thiocfadh a mbealach gan an t-uafás fadhbanna páipéar sa mbealach orthu is atá anois agus gan a bheith faoi bhrú dul taobh amuigh den chóras dleathach, ach leas a bhaint as obair laistigh de.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Cuív has made some interesting points about the social welfare system.  I know he has studied this area and has a great deal of practical experience there.  I learned a considerable amount on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill from his contributions and from the contributions of other Members of this House.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides for the assessment of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant for certain schemes.  In practice, this generally means the value of free board and lodging and most often arises in the case of applicants living in the family home with their parents and claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of free board and lodgings has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  It covers the value of accommodation, meals, support and maintenance as well as generally sharing in the standard of living of the household and facilities which the household enjoys. <Col N="1808" /> The assessment achieves a degree of equity as between applicant in different household circumstances.</P>
    <P>The method of assessing benefits and privileges is not currently set out in legislation but is operated on an administrative basis.  This can mean that social welfare recipients may be in doubt as to how exactly they are being assessed.  It can also give rise to instances where a client may mistakenly perceive that he is being treated differently to others in a similar situation.</P>
    <P>A further problem with benefit and privilege assessment is that it does not apply in a uniform manner to all situations in which household resources are shared.  I will be bringing forward proposals in the near future to streamline means testing arrangements.  My intention is to reduce the complexity of the current system and to make means testing arrangements more intelligible to the client.  In this context I am considering prescribing benefit and privilege rules and regulations.  I am also examining what can be done to ensure a greater degree of equity in the application of such rules.  As Senator Ó Cuív pointed out while a person lives at home she or he cannot receive unemployment assistance due to the benefit and privilege rules. They then take a flat and the Department have to pay them full unemployment assistance plus a supplementary welfare allowance to cover the cost of their housing accommodation.  There is evidence to suggest that that puts up the price of rented accommodation because landlords avail of this subsidy.  Instead of costing the State £5 a week, he now probably ends up costing us £80, £90 or £100 a week.  There is no saving to the State as was rightly pointed out but an unavoidable cost.  We are considering that matter because there is evidence under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme that costs are going up rather than down. It is a complex area but we are aware of it in the Department.</P>
    <P>Up until this year income from casual <Col N="1809" /> part-time work in insurable employment has been excluded in assessing the claims means for unemployment assistance purposes. The claimant must, however, sign off for the day or days of employment. This year's Social Welfare Act provides for income from insurable employment to be counted as means.  This change is necessary to bring it into line with the treatment of self-employed persons.  It also ends the anomoly whereby a person could have considerable earnings from part-time employment, claim unemployment assistance for the days they were not working and still be assessed with nil means.  This provision will be brought into effect through a commencement order and in doing so I will look at ways of continuing the financial incentive which currently applies for people to take up part-time insurable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the trouble to come in and listen to my contribution.  I am concerned about a school for autistic children located at James Connolly House in Blanchardstown where I understand a number of autistic children are housed in what was a Portakabin.  The building is a temporary structure and they were housed there on a temporary basis.  They were located in this structure two years ago on the basis that it would be a short term arrangement but the situation has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>Autistic children require a great deal of attention and pose a considerable teaching challenge to the people dealing with them.  The class size is about six and that is as many as a teacher can cope with. I understand that the accommodation in Blanchardstown is overcrowded and I gather that there is a waiting list for places in the school for next year and subsequent years.  The present accommodation situation will deteriorate unless a solution is found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> The present building is unsuitable. Windows are caged which is usually a feature of building sites and makes the opening of the windows difficult.  It is inappropriate that autistic children should be located in that type of structure.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulties involved in dealing with autistic children, I understand the teacher needs assistance from a nurse or other suitably qualified person. This school had the services of an assistant, a nurse or a helper, who was involved in an accident, had to take sick leave and was not replaced.  She has been on leave for quite some time and her absence makes the teacher's situation even more difficult.</P>
    <P>The accommodation arrangement here is totally unsuitable and it is inappropriate that it should be allowed to drag on.  There is already some degree of overcrowding and the situation is exacerbated by the loss of the teacher's assistant.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to resolve the situation urgently by making resources available to alleviate the difficulties of persons caring for these children.  The situation is a matter of grave concern to the parents who are anxious to obtain the best education for their children.  I imagine that the amount of money required to resolve the situation is small but that extra provision would improve the quality of life of teaching staff and students and greatly alleviate the worries of the families involved.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to explain the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This special national school was recognised almost 30 years ago to provide for the educational needs of psychotic and severely disturbed children.  It was originally located on campus with the Children's Unit, St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital, Palmerstown.  It was known as <Col N="1811" /> St. Loman's national school, and enrolment has been about 60 before the steady decline in recent years.  The Eastern Health Board is the school patron and, following a reorganisation of its Child Psychiatric Services, one class and teacher were transferred in September 1988 to accommodation in Court Hall, a large dwellinghouse which had been acquired by the health board for use as a medium-term treatment centre in the Mulhuddart area.  The remaining two teachers and their classes, comprising children whose special needs were more clearly long term, were transferred in September 1990 to accommodation located in the grounds of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, and the school is now known as James Connolly House national school.</P>
    <P>At present, the school is housed in two locations, i.e. Court Hall, Mulhuddart and James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.  These locations are approximately five miles apart.  School accommodation in Court Hall comprises one ground floor room at present.  Facilities for practical activities and physical education have yet to be provided &mdash; it is understood that a sink is to be fitted in the classroom in the near future.  School accommodation at James Connolly House comprises a Portakabin structure with part use of one other room.  At present the waste outlet from the Portakabin sink requires some further attention. Sanction from the Department for the accommodation at both locations is on a temporary basis, with that at James Connolly House being considered unsuitable for use as a school and approval being as a temporary measure until 30 June 1991.</P>
    <P>Current enrolment is 17 pupils, 15 boys and two girls, and average attendance is exceptionally high at about 97 per cent. Age range is six to 18 years and about 75 per cent being post-primary age.  Fifteen of the pupils are in five day residence, <Col N="1812" /> ten are from the greater Dublin area, four from other counties within and three from counties outside the Eastern Health Board area.  Two classes are held in the James Connolly House and the Eastern Health Board has an input in the two groups of five and four &mdash; a total of nine pupils.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to investigate the accommodation requirements and recommend the upgrading of the facilities so that the James Connolly House national school has adequate and suitable accommodation for its requirements.  I will ask my professional advisers to report on conditions obtaining there so that the various sections and Departments can be approached in order to bring the facilities up-to-date and make provision for the education and the practical activities as recommended by my inspectors.  It is my intention to do this at an early date and I will keep the Senator informed of progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his positive approach to this matter.  I greatly appreciate that and encourage him to continue treating it as a top priority.  I would be grateful if he could give some indication when the facilities would be upgraded and the timescale involved.  I appreciate the positive attitude he has adopted to this matter which, as I am sure he will agree, is of great concern to the families concerned.</P>

      <P>I have had representations from residents in the Terenure/Whitehall Road area where some residents find that the water supply pipe carrying the main water supply to their houses on the Whitehall Road and Whitehall Road West is connected with the water supply pipe under the main roadway which is the responsibility of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties arise when the supply pipe goes out of order and needs to be repaired.  Responsibility for the repair of <Col N="1813" /> the supply of service pipe lies with the householder.  That arises from anomalies in some Act dated back to 1930.  If the supply pipe to somebody's house is damaged while it is under the main roadway, the householder is responsible for paying for its repair.  I see Senator Wright acknowledging the problem; he is all too familiar with it.  This problem is raised regularly at Dublin County Council meetings and, councillors there are driven to despair by it.</P>
    <P>The provision does not apply to people living in the Dublin Corporation-Dún Laoghaire Corporation areas.  It is difficult to explain to constituents who happen to live on the wrong side of the Cromwellsfort Road that if they lived on the city side and suffered damage to the water pipe it would not present any difficulties. For those on the wrong side of the road it means being faced with huge bills.</P>
    <P>A woman told me recently that she was faced with a bill for £500 to start digging up the road and with a charge of £500 a day after that.  It is a matter of great concern to residents arising from an anomaly in the law.  I hope the Leader of the House might take this message back to the appropriate Minister.  I have no doubt that the Leader understands the situation well and probably understands it better than I do given that he has been a member of Dublin County Council longer than I have.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for national primary road development at Headley's Bridge, Knocknagoshel, Tralee, County Kerry.  I have been asked by a number of residents in the area to raise this matter, and also by people using the road daily.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council have carried out much work between Castleisland and Headley's Bridge over the past number of years with regard to realignment and have brought it up to a reasonably good standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> The road from Headley's Bridge to Abbeyfeale is substandard.  All design work has been completed by Kerry County Council for Headley's Bridge, has been submitted to the Department over many years and has been recently updated as requested.  Commitments have been made with regard to Headley's Bridge but there has been no positive response.</P>
    <P>The road from Abbeyfeale to Limerick has received a lot of funding over the past few years and is reasonably good.  I appeal again to the Minister in view of the bad condition of Headley's Bridge and the road to Abbeyfeale, to make the essential funding available to Kerry County Council to get the work under way within the current year.  A number of serious accidents have taken place at Headley's Bridge.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for taking the issue of Carrigkerry post office in County Limerick and I call on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to direct An Post to reopen the post office there.  It is now two months since it was closed and there is deep anger and resentment in the community as a result.</P>
      <P>Carrigkerry is a small rural community in a remote area of west Limerick between Athea and Ardagh.  It is a poor area and has suffered severely in recent years from high emigration and high migration.  All the young people have left the area which has a high number of senior citizens who use the post office to collect their old age pensions.  These people have been hardest hit and are now obliged to find methods of travelling to Newcastlewest or Athea; most do not have the means of doing so.  It is cruel to change the facility they used to collect their weekly pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carrigkerry represents what is best in a small rural community.  People are very supportive of each other.  If a pensioner failed to collect his or her weekly money, the former postmistress travelled to that <Col N="1815" /> person's home to check if he or she was ill.  People congregated in the village on pension and children's allowance days and contributed to sustaining the small businesses which maintain the existence of this small village.  The church, school and post office were the key services and provided a focal point for the identity of the community.</P>
    <P>An Post has pulled the plug on the post office.  The savings which will accrue are minimal, less than the value of two pensions. The decision is merely to conform with the policy to close any rural post office which requires a change in ownership. The concerns of the people and the question of what is right and proper for the community are ignored.  This trend <Col N="1816" /> must be reversed.  If the Minister is not prepared to do this, they minimum she can do is to insist on the provision of a facility in the village for a half day each Friday to pay out pensions and another half day per month to pay children's allowances.  This is the minimum which is acceptable and there are plenty of precedents for making this arrangement.</P>
