      <P>I have notice from Senator Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to explain the involvement of military contingents in religious ceremonies.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to take urgent action to remedy the conditions and policies that give rise to the appalling profile of an Irish prison depicted by the Mountjoy Visiting Committee in their 1991 report.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ó Cuív of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction the work to the group water scheme in Beal an Daingin, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to further extend the urban renewal scheme in Bray, County <Col N="1922" /> Wicklow, and to extend the scheme to Wicklow town.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to clarify the proposals made by An Taoiseach to develop a deep water transhipment port on the Shannon Estuary; and to make a statement on the suitability of Foynes as a location for the port.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the measures he is taking to deal with the recent problem caused by the toxic effect of cucumbers; the action he is taking to protect consumers; and the initiatives he is taking to deal with the difficulties this discovery has caused the Irish producers of cucumbers.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy, Costello, Ó Cuív, Ross, Neville and Upton as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Murphy and Costello's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ó Cuív, Ross, Neville and Upton may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I give today's Order of Business may I suggest to the House that either tomorrow Thursday or Friday we would, by agreement, have statements for two hours on Maastricht. I suggest this to the leaders of the other <Col N="1923" /> parties on the basis that I believe the House would be better informed by waiting 24 hours and we would have better statements.  I hope that meets the requirements of those who have been in touch with my office regarding the situation.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is Item No. 1, the Fishery Harbour Centres (Amendment) Bill until 4.30 p.m., if that is agreed; from 4.30 p.m. to 6 p.m., Committee Stage of Item No. 2, the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991; and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Motion 46.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for the arrangements he is making for a debate on what is happening.  I am one of those who do not believe that the skies will necessarily fall in because of what happened yesterday in Denmark.  I think it is worth waiting a day or two until events have settled so that we can have a better informed discussion, and I am glad he has acceded to the request.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the question of statements on Common Agricultural Policy reform.  There are a number of speakers from this side who would like to get involved in that, and perhaps the Leader would leave that open ended rather than what was proposed originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's rapid response to the request for a debate on the fallout from the Danish decision. I had put in a section 29 motion, but in the light of the Leader's very amenable position I am happy to withdraw that. Could I ask that the debate might be for three hours and and that there could be a limit of ten minutes on each contribution? Also, if there is a ministerial response, that response should not be counted as part of the time of the debate, because there is a possibility that many people would wish to speak on this.  Perhaps the Leader might consider holding the debate tomorrow rather than Friday so that the maximum number of people could participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the initiative <Col N="1924" /> taken by the Leader in making time available for this debate tomorrow.  I also support Senator Norris when he calls for a limit of ten minutes on the time for each speaker.  As far as I am concerned, that is adequate to make the points which should be made.  It seems perfectly obvious that nobody in this country appears to have given any real consideration to what the implications of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in Denmark would be, and it seems that broadly speaking that is true of what is happening in Europe as well.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. On an entirely different matter, may I ask the Leader what is the position in relation to the Control of Dogs Bill and when can we expect it to be debated in this House?  I would also like to know what is the position in relation to the Bill to enact the provisions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to make grants available to mature students at third level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to <Col N="1925" /> express appreciation to the Leader of the House for providing time for a short debate on the Maastricht problem.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader to provide an early opportunity for the House to debate the famine situation in a number of African countries.  We have had a motion on the Order Paper for a considerable length of time.  With all the other pressing problems in the world it is quite obvious that the people who have the facilities and the means of alleviating the massive starvation in a number of African countries are otherwise engaged.  We must again bring to the attention of the EC, and indeed of the United Nations, the plight of those starving millions.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, we have had little short bites at it each time.  There is, I hope, no truth in the rumour I heard circulating last week that a guillotine is going to be put on it.  Could we have a reasonable time to debate it at some stage?  It makes it difficult to debate the Bill if we just get an hour here, an hour there and a hour and a half somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Hederman in relation to the Electoral Bill.  It is important that we get an opportunity to discuss it in depth for a substantial period.  Today the proposal again is that we have an hour and a half for it.  A good reasonable time to debate the Bill would be in order.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal by the Leader of the House to hold a debate on Thursday or Friday on the Maastricht problem. It was the intention of the Labour Party to seek the suspension of the Standing Orders today so that the matter could be discussed at length.  Now that he has voluntarily offered us a period for debating it I would like to see that extended for three hours and indeed a time limit of ten minutes for each speaker.  It would now seem that the Maastricht Treaty on European Union is without legality, null and void&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important also to ask the Leader of the House for an opportunity of hearing the definitive legal opinion when we debate the matter so that we will know the Government's position after they have consulted with the heads of Government in Europe.  We would then find out precisely the legality of our Referendum Bill and the proposal to hold the referendum on 18 June.  It would seem foolhardy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I compliment the Leader of the House for arranging to hold a debate on the Maastricht situation tomorrow.  I agree with the other speakers in suggesting that ten minutes be the maximum for contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise an entirely different matter.  It may not be appropriate to raise it now but exceptional circumstances always arise.  I refer to a former Senator of this House who has had an outstanding <Col N="1927" /> achievement.  I ask the Leader of the House to convey our sincere good wishes and congratulations to former Senator Brian Friel on a magnificent international achievement with &ldquo;Dancing at Lughnasa&rdquo;. It has reflected magnificently on this House.</P>

      <P>May I join with the other speakers in welcoming the opportunity to speak on the Maastricht Treaty and the situation that has now arisen.  I ask the Leader to have that debate tomorrow.  It would be helpful if legal opinion that may be made available to the Government today on where the Treaty stands was made available to us in this House before we commence the debate.  I also agree with other speakers that ten minutes restriction will ensure that as many speakers as possible will get the opportunity to contribute.  It is important that the Government give a very clear indication to the Irish people of their intentions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am drawing my remarks to a conclusion.  One of the reasons I wanted to say this is because I was awoken very early this morning by my Danish mother-in-law, who is involved in politics in Denmark.  I want to send a message back to her that we have no intention of following the Danish lead in voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Leader of the House to have a further discussion on Maastricht in the light of the new situation in which we now find ourselves.  I join with my colleagues in asking that the contributions be confined to ten minutes but I appeal to the Leader to allow more than two hours.  On that last occasion there were a number of Senators who wished to make a contribution but were denied the <Col N="1928" /> opportunity of so doing because of the restriction of time for the debate &mdash; I think it was also two hours.  I ask him to confine it to ten minute contributions but to leave it openended after that so that every Senator who wishes to make a contibution can so do.  I also ask him to delay the debate until Friday or even next Tuesday because there is a strong possibility, in my opinion, that the Government may come around to the opinion of postponing the date of 18 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members on the opposite side for their agreement to have a debate later in the week.  Three hours is no problem for the debate, ten minutes per person can be arranged and also we will ensure that the Minister's time is not included in the three hours allowed.  As the Foreign Affairs Ministers are meeting tomorrow I suggest that we should wait until Friday.  Since some Senators have suggested that we should have the most up-to-date information possible on the situation, I think we should wait until Friday.  If that is agreed, we would start at 2 p.m. on Friday and go on for three hours.  I am sure that all the Senators who have Friday appointments could make other arrangements since this is the most important issue this country will face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we leave it to the Whips?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips can arrange that.  Since there is to be a meeting tomorrow by waiting until Friday this House would be in the position of having the most up-to-date information and of having a very good debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the statements on the Common Agricultural Policy tomorrow, there is no problem; I have already <Col N="1929" /> agreed that that would be carried over until next week.  As regards having the Control of Dogs Bill before the summer recess and the Electoral Bill, I hope, with the agreement of the Whips to have three to four days next week to clear this. Hopefully, the Electoral Bill will be in the Dáil the week after the Maastricht vote.  Have no fears about any rumours you may have heard.  It will be on the Order Paper next week and be taken for at least three days and possibly four.</P>

    <Title>Fishery Harbour Centres (Amendment) Bill, 1992: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to define the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour to include Berehaven Sound within those limits and thereby enable me by order, under section 2 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968, to extend the limits of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre to coincide with the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour.</P>
      <P>Berehaven Sound at present forms part of Bantry Bay Harbour and is under the aegis of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. Foreign fish factory ships which visit Castletownbere during the mackerel season are unable to berth at the Fishery Harbour Centre because of their size and these ships operate from the Sound.  Because the fish factory ships anchor in Berehaven Sound, harbour dues accrue to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, who are based 30 miles away by road and two hours by boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is full agreement locally that dues from fishery related activity in the Sound should accrue to the Fishery Harbour Centre.  It is also desirable from a safety and geographical point of view to have the Sound under the jurisdiction of the Fishery Harbour Centre.  The harbour master at the Fishery Harbour Centre in Castletownbere estimates that <Col N="1930" /> he could have collected £65,000 in 1990 and £47,000 last year in respect of harbour dues from fish factory ships anchored in the Sound.  To do this the Fishery Harbour Centre has to be extended to include the Sound.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the Bill defines the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour.  It provides that Castletownbere Harbour includes the area known locally as Berehaven Sound.  This is the sea area within the limits of a straight line from Fair Head to Shee Head on the western side and, on the eastern side, a straight line drawn from Furze Point to Roancarrigmore Lighthouse and thence to Carrigranean Island and thence further to Bear Island.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that an order made by the Minister for the Marine under section 2 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968, to extend the limits of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre to incorporate the Sound will not be subject to the procedures outlined in section 2 (6) of the 1968 Act.  This will dispense with the requirement to publish notice of the proposed order in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or the daily newspapers.  It also provides that Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners will have no powers, functions or duties in relation to the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that where a vessel in the course of its voyage to or from Bantry Bay Harbour anchors or passes through Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre, harbour rates will not be payable in respect of the anchoring or passage aforesaid.</P>
    <P>The extent of Castletownbere Harbour was not defined in the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.  That Act designated a number of fishery harbour centres, including Castletownbere, and provided for their limits of jurisdiction to be defined by ministerial order.  However, in the case of Berehaven Sound legal advice available to me concludes that it is extremely doubtful that the substantial sea area of the Sound forms part of Castletownbere Harbour.  The legal advice also concludes that amending legislation is required to include the <Col N="1931" /> Sound within the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House addresses this legal difficulty by including the area known locally as Berehaven Sound within the limits of Castletownbere Harbour.  Once the Bill has been passed by both Houses I will then be in a position to redefine by order the limits of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre to include in it the Sound. This will enable the harbour master to collect the harbour dues properly payable in respect of the facilities afforded to the fish factory ships.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of harbour dues on commercial activity in the Sound area.  I discussed the provisions of the Bill with the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners during the course of my recent visit to Bantry.  The Commissioners drew to my attention the fact that from time to time commercial vessels in the course of their voyage to or from Bantry Bay Harbour anchor in the Roancarrigmore lighthouse area.  Once the Castletownbere limits are extended such traffic could then become liable to pay harbour dues to two public authorities, the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre and the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. In order to provide adequately and fairly for this situation I introduced an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann.  The amendment, which was fully supported by Dáil Éireann and which now forms section 2 (4) of the Bill before this House, will ensure that a situation such as this will not arise.</P>
    <P>I hope this short Bill will command the support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and wish it as speedy a passage through the Seanad as it had through the Dáil.  It is self-explanatory.  My only visit to Castletownbere harbour was during the Seanad &ldquo;trail&rdquo; where its beauty caused me to stop in my tracks.  It is a harbour of extreme beauty, with physical qualities and attributes that give it potential for tourism as well as for development as a leading <Col N="1932" /> fishing port.  This has been called for by many Deputies in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Commercial viability has to be considered. There is a need for more facilities, and, hopefully, in the context of Maastricht funding will go towards ensuring that infrastructure facilities there will be improved by the provision of a larger ice plant and lifts, because this is an area of extremely dangerous waters which can deal with larger ships.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the Bill on which I am not very clear relates to the lack of revenue. The harbour master estimates that he could have collected £65,000 in 1990 and £47,000 last year in respect of harbour dues from fish factory ships anchored in the Sound.  Hopefully, the commercial viability of this harbour will be extended to ensure that that money will not be lost to the area.  Unemployment figures are quite high for that part of Cork and, therefore, commercial viability is essential.  It is not just enough to have scenic beauty; the area must also be developed as a centre of economic activity.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that once the Castletownbere limits are extended vessels could then become liable to pay harbour dues to two public authorities &mdash; the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre and the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. Looking through the debate in the Dáil, I noted that that amendment, which was the only aspect of the Bill that needed to be clarified, was accepted and that it ensures that situation will not arise again.  Now that the position has been defined, I hope there will be further infrastructural development to ensure that the harbour operates viably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  While it will help the Harbour Commissioners at Castletownbere to collect more fees, I believe that it has a much more important function. With the liberalisation of travel generally, we need to set very definite limits at sea.  We have so many estuaries.  We talk about fishing limits.  It is necessary to define the limits, not including inlets and estuaries, of our many important <Col N="1933" /> fishing grounds.  It is hard to educate those who are not interested in keeping to any guidelines.  I see this Bill as being just as important for the definition of fishing limits as for the collection of harbour fees.</P>
      <P>We must have funding for the upkeep of our harbours and piers.  I come from a part of the country where we have ongoing difficulties with foreign fishing vessels and also with the upkeep of our harbours and piers.  Their upkeep must be financed from whatever source funding can be obtained.  Everybody involved in the fishing industry will welcome this development.  I encourage the Minister to proceed with legislation and with regulations under the legislation to clarify the positon regarding as much of our waters as possible.  Legislation should be drawn up and implemented sooner rather than later because it will become harder if we become full EC partners and therefore subject to EC legislation and law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address myself briefly to this uncontroversial Bill which does not have much substance to it and has the support of this side of the House.</P>
      <P>It seems sensible to define the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour to include Berehaven Sound.  In his speech the Minister explained the anomaly whereby factory ships serving Castletownbere moor about 30 miles away in Bantry Harbour.  It is desirable that dues rightfully owing to the Castletownbere harbour centre should be collected there. The estimated loss was £65,000 in 1990 and £47,000 last year and it may possibly be more in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the people involved in fishing in Castletownbere well.  I know the place well; I bought seaweed there many years ago.  When in Norway some years ago talking to people who manufacture capital goods for the fishmeal industry, I was instrumental in persuading the owner of a large Norwegian fishmeal company to come to Ireland.  He went to Castletownbere intending to set up a facility which at that time was not available there.  Castletownbere Harbour is a <Col N="1934" /> superb fishing location and the regularising of their situation will benefit the town and the State.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the Bill. It is right and sensible that the boundaries of Castlebownbere Harbour should extend far enough to embrace the factory boats or &ldquo;Klondykers&rdquo; which are anchored there, for three to four months a year; I have seen them there.  It is appropriate that the Department of the Marine and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners should exact long overdue harbour dues from these boats.  Money is required for the maintenance of harbours; around the coast there are five major fishery harbours. There may be other harbours that could be extended in a similar fashion to Castletownbere Harbour in order to bring boats, commercial or otherwise, that anchor close to the boundaries, under the jurisdiction of the harbours.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan mentioned that we need money to maintain the harbours and we cannot expect the Department of the Marine and the Government to provide more money each year to do so. People may not agree with me when I say that a significant number of foreign fishing vessels fish off the west coast of Ireland.  The time has come to entice these fishing boats into fishery harbours in Castletownbere, Dingle, Killybegs and elsewhere so that they may boost our income.  They will fish within our 200 mile limit and take it home to Spain and France while we get nothing in return.  I have held the view for a number of years that if we could entice these boats to land their fish in our harbours and to take fuel, ice, food, etc, on board there, these boats might leave on average &mdash; and I have checked the amount of money involved &mdash; £12,000 to £14,000 per trip in the port. Jobs would also be created in ports like Castletownbere from extra landings of foreign fishing boats.  There is no point in discouraging them from landing in Irish ports.  They have a right to land there and the hand of welcome should be extended to them because they will pay landing fees.  Landing fees would help pay for the proper maintenance of our harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> I hope the Minister will not mind my saying that I would like Dingle declared a major fishery harbour centre.  I hope he will take a close look at this proposal in the near future.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Fitzgerald's request £4.5 million has been allocated to Dingle Harbour at this stage.  I hope the authorities there will put things in order to enable us to promote Dingle Harbour as a fine fishery harbour.  I will bear the Senator's views in mind.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the question and provision of funds generally. We will be looking for extra funds under the Maastricht Treaty and hoping to double the moneys now available.  The fishery and commercial harbours will be prime targets for the allocation of money for the improvement of infrastructure. We look forward to that development.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Staunton for his support and for noting his personal interest in Castletownbere Harbour having collected seaweed there in the past for his own operations.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan is familiar with the difficulties surrounding foreign vessels. This is an issue to which we must adopt a positive approach.  Foreign vessels must be encouraged to land in Ireland and to have their products processed here.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman who raised a number of issues would like to see landing fees being used for harbour development. Castletownbere Harbour is developing well at present and I expect that it will develop into an excellent fishery harbour. This Bill is supported by local residents. We have taken action quickly, have overcome the legalities and are ready to go ahead once this legislation is passed.  The order can be made without delay to enable dues to be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dues foregone are of the order of £50,000 to £65,000, an important sum for the local harbour which has been in deficit in recent years.  Money raised under this provision will be used to clear the deficit, after which it will go into a fund to finance works in various harbours. <Col N="1936" /> In Castletownbere a number of recent works have been undertaken, such as reroofing the auction hall, the installation of a new ice plant in 1991 and the large scale overhaul of the synchro lift which has not yet been completed &mdash; it requires certification of the weights it can carry before it can go into operation. Navigational lights and some of the high mast lights have been provided locally. Altogether quite an amount of harbour work has been done recently.</P>
    <P>Our policy is to plough back the money collected into necessary and worthwhile harbour developments.  We need more money for harbour development which we will look for anywhere we can.  Funds allocated to Ireland under the Structural and Cohesion funds following the Maastricht Treaty will be important in this area and to the Department of the Marine generally because we are charged with improving access to Europe, and with the development of commercial harbours and fishery harbours.  Fishery harbours are developing their business very well at present.</P>
    <P>We are re-examining the Common Fisheries Policy at EC level.  Our objective there is to be allowed to catch more fish and to have more boats so that harbour business and employment may be increased.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their welcome for this Bill which is very important locally in Castletownbere.  It will make a major difference to the town.  We have sorted out the difficulties which had arisen between Bantry and Castletownbere. Everybody is happy with what is being done and looks forward to the speedy and efficient implementation of this proposal.  I look forward to putting these measures into operation at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendments to section 15 of the Second Schedule provide for a revised time limit for the submission of applications for entry in the supplement to the register and for an amendment procedure for dealing with the applications. The closing date specified in section 15, as drafted, for applications for entry in the supplement in respect of an election or referendum is the date of the order appointing polling day.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24, in the name of Senator Naughten, proposes that the closing date for application for entry in the supplement should be seven days before the polling day, while Senator Ó Fóighil, in amendment No. 25 proposes to have a cut-off point nine days after the date of the order appointing polling days. Amendment No. 23, in the name of four Labour Senators, provides for the deletion of subsection (5) which sets the cut-off point after which applications for entry in the supplement will not be considered at an election or referendum. Amendment No. 27 provides for insertion of a new subsection (6) which would allow supplements to be published at any time during the lifetime of a register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have carefully considered these proposed amendments and the comments made by various Senators during Second Stage debate.  At the outset I have to say that I regard the cut-off point as absolutely essential.  We must make sure that applications for inclusion in the supplement will be fully checked out.  We must also make sure that the status of the <Col N="1939" /> register proper is not undermined, that we are not, in effect, providing an easy and less difficult way for getting on the register.  There must be a cut-off point and it must provide adequate time for the registration authority to check applications thoroughly.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment which would remove the cut-off point.</P>
    <P>In so far as amendment No. 27 is concerned, I would like to assure the House that a registration authority will consider all applications for entry in the register received through the year.  Any application received after the closing date in respect of an election or a referendum will still be processed and electors eligible for entry in the supplement will be added to it and will be eligible to vote at any further poll which may be held later in the registration year.</P>
    <P>During Second Stage debate many Senators thought the closing date proposed in the Bill was too early and did not give people a real opportunity of getting on the supplement, particularly as omissions are more likely to come to light during the election campaign.  Other speakers stressed that we should have regard to the danger of abuse and the risk of undermining the status of the register proper.  Having carefully considered both viewpoints, the Minister has come to the conclusion that a closing date somewhat closer to polling day would be possible and would be desirable in order to allow as many people as possible to avail of the facility.  I feel, however, that the deadline of seven days before polling day, as proposed in amendment No. 25, would be too late and would give very little time to the registration authority to process the applications and have the supplement finalised for delivery to the returning officer in good time before polling day.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 22 proposes a deadline of 12 days before polling day for applications for entry in the supplement. This would broadly be in line with Senator Ó Foighil's proposal because, at a typical Dáil election, there would be a period of about three weeks between dissolution and polling day.  I <Col N="1940" /> consider that this revised closing date strikes the correct balance and will give potential applicants about a week after the election has been announced to check the register and submit their application while allowing reasonable time for the registration authorities to process applications. If the time for receipt of applications is extended, as now proposed, it will be necessary to revise and simplify the procedure for dealing with applications.</P>
    <P>The procedure provided for in the Second Schedule to the Bill is rather cumbersome and time consuming and follows, as near as possible, the procedure for preparing the register proper.  It provides for investigation of the application by the registration authority, a recommendation to the county registrar, publication of a notice setting out details of the application and allows a period of five days during which objection may be made to the inclusion of an applicant in the supplement.  The county registrar would then rule on the application as soon as possible after the five day period. If the time for receipt of applications is extended, as now proposed, it would not be practical to comply with this procedure and amendment No. 172 proposes a shorter and simpler method of dealing with applicants.  Under this method, the registration authority will rule on applications and, in the event of an application being refused, the applicant will have the right of appeal to the county registrar.</P>
    <P>I believe that amendments Nos. 22 and 172, in extending the time for applications and simplifying the procedure, will meet the general view expressed. In the circumstances, I suggest that the Senators concerned may wish to withdraw their amendments and instead support Government amendments Nos. 22, 26 and 172.</P>

      <P>We could argue about 12 days, ten days, five days or two days, but I believe the Minister has struck a reasonable enough compromise.  Perhaps it might not be the one I would have come up with myself, but it goes a fair way to meet the concerns of Senators.  It is important, in relation to that, that the registrar and the Department of the Environment should ensure that the public are made fully aware of the deadline being 12 days away so that the political parties have an opportunity to check the register to find out whether certain people are on it.  Then they can get their act together in time to allow people who are legitimately entitled to a vote to be in a position where they cast their vote.  I am happy enough with the compromise produced by the Minister.  I thank him for acceeding to the general concerns which were expressed during the debate.</P>

      <P>In page 22, subsection (2) (a), line 42, to delete &ldquo;suffered by him&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the use of language.  My understanding of people who suffer from a variety of different disabilities is that they are concerned about the use of language, particularly the term &ldquo;suffered by&rdquo;.  Maybe it is a subliminal slip on my part; I used it in the previous sentence.  That is why we are suggesting that that term be deleted. I do not think the deletion of the term will seriously change the meaning of the Bill.  For that reason I am anxious that the Minister accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) of section 17 sets out the category of electors eligible for entry in a special voters list.  The <Col N="1943" /> category includes any elector unable to go in person to the polling station to vote because of physical illness or physical disability suffered by him.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 proposes the deletion of the word &ldquo;suffered by him&rdquo;. While at first glance the words may seem superfluous I would like to explain that if the words were deleted it would be open to an elector to apply for entry on a special voters list on the grounds of illness or disability suffered by somebody else.  For example, another member of the household might be ill or disabled and might be cared for by the elector. This might make it difficult for the elector to vote in person at the polling station and he or more likely she would reasonably take the view that this entitled him or her to avail of the special voting facilities. Obviously this is not the intention of the original legislation and I doubt if it is the intention behind the proposed amendment. Nonetheless, if the words were removed the provision could reasonably be read as having this meaning.</P>
      <P>It is clear that when the special voting arrangements were introduced in 1986 only persons actually suffering from disability were intended to avail of this facility.  I consider retention of the words to be essential in order to put the matter beyond doubt.  In any legislation we must strive above all for clarity and certainty, even if this may demand a certain awkwardness of expression from time to time.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister cannot accept the amendment. Essentially, my concern is the use of terminology which is offensive to people who have a physical illness or disability. I understand that these people are concerned at this terminology, I can understand the Minister's concern for clarity in legislation but I hope it would be possible to attain that clarity while at the same time not offending the sensibilities of certain groups in the community.  I ask the Minister, perhaps on Report Stage, to <Col N="1944" /> have another look at the terminology used.  It is a relatively small point.</P>
      <P>It should be possible to clear up the difficulty by use of another set of words. I sincerely hope it is not beyond the capacity of the Minister and his advisers to come up with terms which would meet both his concerns and the concerns to which we are alluding in this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is seldom that Senator Upton makes a point that he, like myself, does not feel strongly about.  Obviously, like Senator Hederman, I am not quite sure why the words &ldquo;suffered by him&rdquo; upsets Senator Upton, but maybe it is because the section deals with special voters lists, and section 100 is tied to it. All of us in the House have been close to these special people and I appeal to the Minister and his senior advisers to look at this.  Like Senator Hederman I do not see the problem with the present wording but because this specific section deals with special people, I appeal to the Minister to look again at it.</P>

I do not want to build it up into a big issue.  It is just a matter of trying to meet those concerns.  I sincerely hope it can be done.  Senator Hederman made a good suggestion.

      <P>(c) he is unable to go in person to vote by reason of imprisonment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to people who are unable to vote because they are imprisoned. This was debated here in considerable detail already and I do not want to go through all the points which have been made.  I just want to say that imprisonment involves the removal of the right to liberty but it need not necessarily involve the removal of a series of other rights.  For those reasons I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 29 proposes to extend to prisoners the special voting arrangements currently available only to disabled prisoners.  As the House is aware, special voting for the disabled involves a visit by a special presiding officer and a member of the Garda Síochána to each special voter at his or her place of residence, where a ballot paper is delivered to the voter.  The voter marks his or her ballot paper in the presence of the special presiding officer and garda and returns the sealed ballot paper envelope to the special presiding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the registration of electors, we stated in this Bill: &ldquo;prisoners are registered at their home address.&rdquo;  A prisoner, like any other elector, could only vote in the constituency where he is registered.  He could be detained in a prison at a considerable distance from his constituency.  Any prison might contain prisoners from all or most of the 41 constituencies. If the special voting facility were to be extended to prisoners, we could have the situation where the prison would have to be visited by a special presiding officer and a garda from each constituency concerned.  This would not be practicable.  No special facility is provided <Col N="1946" /> for voting by prisoners but then no special facility is provided for other categories who, for one reason or another, ther, are not able to go to their polling station, categories who have at least as strong a claim for consideration as prisoners. It is relevant to say that in most countries of the EC prisoners are debarred from voting or standing for election.</P>
    <P>The special voting facility was designed specifically for disabled voters.  It is a cumbersome and expensive system to operate.  It was introduced to facilitate a category of electors rendered housebound due to physical disability or illness. It is clearly not suitable for extension to prisoners and I ask the Senator not to press the amendment.</P>

The closing date proposed for applications would be the same as that applying to applications for inclusion in the supplement to the register under section 50.</P>
      <P>The amendment to section 15 which we have discussed will allow applications for entry in the supplement to the register up to the 12th day before polling day. This cut-off date would not be suitable in relation to special voters because, depending on the polling day selected, special voting could already be underway by the 12th day.  In this connection section 81 requires ballot papers to be delivered to special voters as soon as practicable after the close of nominations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for dealing with special voters applications would also render this cut-off date impracticable.  A medical certificate may be necessary and the registration authority may require further information.  Under rule 20 of the Second Schedule a minimum of seven days must be allowed for the furnishing of such information.  Also, special voting requires detailed forward planning by both returning officer and the Garda authorities.  Even if it were practicable it would be most undesirable to have special voting applications being made when an election is already underway. We are dealing here with some of the more vulnerable sections of our community, <Col N="1948" /> the disabled, the ill and the old. They should be allowed to make up their own minds in their own time, free from the kind of pressure that can be generated by the heat of an election.  To have applications up-to-date as suggested would be neither practicable or desirable.  I suggest that the amendment be pressed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6) No order for costs may be made in proceedings under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to appeals.  One of the reasons people will not take cases to court is the enormous costs that are involved.  At the same time, very important principles are frequently at stake which should be decided by the courts. It is for that reason that we have put down this amendment, namely, that no costs should be made in proceedings under this section, to allow people to have the opportunity of being able to take cases without having to worry about the effects of decisions being made against them in relation to costs.</P>

      <P>Section 21 restates existing law in relation to the right to appeal to the Circuit Court against any decision of a county registrar on a claim in relation to the register of electors.  Provision is made in this section for an appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Circuit Court on a point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 proposes that no order for costs may be made in relation to proceedings under this section.  It is a normal part of the process of legal proceedings through the courts that a person initiating an action or lodging an appeal <Col N="1949" /> against a court decision may be awarded costs or have costs awarded against him. The same applies to other parties to proceedings. I do not see why an exception should be made in the case of appeals made to the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court in relation to revision of a court decision.  A claimant for entry on the register who decides to appeal to the Circuit Court, and possibly the Supreme Court, should if his claim succeeds be eligible to have his or her costs paid by the respondent to the proceedings.  I think it would be outrageous for the law to provide that he could not recover his costs if the court finally upheld his claim.  It is also reasonable that a person who, having gone through the full procedure laid down in the Electoral Acts for the registration of electors, fails to establish his entitlement to be registered should be liable to have the costs incurred by other parties to the proceedings awarded against him.  This should apply particularly where the original claim may have been frivolous.  It is, of course, a matter for the courts to decide, in any case, whether an order for costs should be made.  It is reasonable to assume that the courts would have regard to all relevant facts in considering this question in each case.  This is a matter which could and should be left to the courts.  I would ask the Senator not to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>(7)  The decision referred to in subsection (1) shall contain notice of the right of appeal to the Circuit Court, and the decision of the Circuit Court shall contain notice of the right of appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment simply endeavours to ensure that where decisions referred to in subsection (1) are being contested and when decisions have been made, people should be informed of their right to <Col N="1950" /> appeal to the Circuit Court.  The decision of the Circuit Court, in turn, should contain a notification of the right to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. It is a provision aimed at making people aware of their entitlement to further appeals when decisions have gone against them.</P>

      <P>Section 21 repeats existing law in relation to the right to appeal to the Circuit Court against any decision of a county registrar on a claim in relation to the register of electors.  Provision is also made in this section for an appeal to the Supreme Court against a decision of the Circuit Court on a point of law.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for an insertion of a new provision in section 21 requiring the decision of the revision court, on a claim, to include notification of the claimant's right to appeal to the Circuit Court and his right to further appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court.  Rule 12, paragraph (3), of the Second Schedule to this Bill provides that the registration authority shall, on receiving from the county registrar his decision on the claims at the revision court, notify the claimant and any other person appearing to them to be interested, together with the intimation of the right of appeal against the decision of the Circuit Court under section 21.  The first part of the proposed amendment is, therefore, already provided for.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary and possibly inappropriate to make provision in this section for the regulation of the procedure for notification by the Circuit Court of its decisions.  This would be a matter for the court itself and for the rules of court.  Its normal for appellants in the Circuit Court to engage legal representatives to handle the appeal.  It would be a matter for the legal representatives to advise the claimant of his or her right of appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court.  The court itself would almost certainly give this advice in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of consistency it may be inappropriate, or at least undesirable, to provide for such detailed <Col N="1951" /> procedural provisions in legislation.  This type of provision is not normally provided for in legislation and could be confusing if it were provided for in an isolated case such as in this Bill.  I would ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 25, subsection (3), line 37, to delete subparagraph (i).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the registration of political parties.  Subsection (3) says &ldquo;The Registrar shall prepare and maintain a register (to be known as the Register of Political Parties) in which, subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, he shall register any political party&rdquo;.  It subsequently states that it is is necessary that the registrar should form the opinion that what is being registered is a genuine political party.  It also refers to its &ldquo;being organised in the State or a part thereof to contest a Dáil election or a European election or a local election.&rdquo;  I would have thought that the organisations which come together to contest elections are, by definition, political parties.  I cannot see the need for the use of the term &ldquo;genuine&rdquo;.  It seems to suggest there are such things as bogus or pseudo political parties or that there are dud or Mickey Mouse political parties.  It is beginning to sound like Monty Python's Flying Circus with its semi-silly and semi-serious parties. I do not understand the need for this term which seems pejorative.  The reference to genuine political parties, real political parties makes them sound like real ale, the language taken from the slogans of politics, which are bandied about at election time, when we are all <Col N="1952" /> trying to put one over on the opposing candidates.  I do not understand the need for the term &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; here.  The least that might be done is to amend the section to read: &ldquo;in his opinion is a political party.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the introduction of a system of registration of political parties was to enable the names of parties to be entered on ballot papers in relation to the names of their candidates; up to 1963 the names of political parties were not included on ballot papers.  The procedure for the registration of political parties was introduced by the Electoral Act, 1963, on the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.  One of the recommendations of the joint committee was that only parties which, in the opinion of the registrar, genuine political parties could be registered.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the subparagraph is to give clear guidance to the registrar that he may register only groups whose objectives are political and who have a serious intention of selecting and presenting candidates for election to public office.  If the groups' objectives are other than political, if their aims are basically commercial or if the intention is to entertain or provide amusement, then they may not be registered.  The registrar must, in the first instance, decide whether a group is a genuine political party.  How he satisfies himself on this and what evidence he may require are matters for the registrar. It is likely, however, he would seek to establish whether it is the group's intention to engage in elections, to select and present candidates, whether it has a statement of aims, a constitution, rules and political documents of whether it has a structure geared towards decision making and policy formation, in other words, does the group have the characteristics we normally associate with political parties.  All these questions arise under subparagraph (i).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subparagraph (ii), the registrar would consider whether the group had the organisation, at least in outline, necessary to put these objectives into <Col N="1953" /> effect.  Subparagraph (i) sets out the essential conditions for register.  It is, in effect, the core of the provision.  Without it, the instructions of the Oireachtas to the registrar, the appeal board and the courts would be vague and incomplete. The subparagraph is essential and this section could not stand without it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns of the Minister would be covered by the words &ldquo;he shall register any political party&rdquo;.  Once you have said that, I do not see the need to say that the political party must be a genuine political party.  I am also concerned that under the term &ldquo;may provide a means by which&rdquo; some people may be excluded from being registered as political parties.  There was a time in this country, not all that long ago, when a number of groups of people who considered they were political parties had difficulty being registered.  Subsequently the regulations and their interpretation became more liberal.  These groups have duly been registered and, as far as I can see, it has made no difference at all.  I do not understand what the Minister's concerns are in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>My own view of the democratic process is that it works its way to a certain conclusion. I do not believe business people would waste money running political campaigns for non-political purposes.  I am concerned about business people being behind certain groups of politicians for reasons that would be considered business rather than political reasons.  I do not understand why the term &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; needs to be used.  I have many reservations about that term; it has a certain ring to it which, in this context, is unacceptable.  It seems to hint at the possibility that certain elements who are engaged in the political process might not be considered to be genuine and, therefore, should be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I want to allude to the role of people who have been involved in violence.  Over the years, one of the cases which has been strongly made by many people is that it is very important that people who have pursued physical force as a means of attaining political <Col N="1954" /> objectives should submit themselves to the test of the ballot box, they should become involved in the everyday business of politics.  If they did that, the restraints imposed by the practice of politics would be a very strong encouragement for them to desist from the use of violence.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; seems to contain a suggestion of censorship.  What would be a non-genuine political party?  Even if there were such a thing, where is the difficulty?  Such people come and go and they do not last very long.  The outlook for new political groups in this country is not encouraging.  One has only to look at all the groups which have come and gone since the foundation of the State; Ailtirí na hAiseirghe, for example, were around at some stage in the forties; there was Saor Éire, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talún, Aontacht Éireann.  It is a considerable list.  I do not want to suggest that any of these groups were not genuine political parties.  Perhaps I am wronging the Minister if I suspect he is becoming somewhat patemalistic, feeling that these groups, who have not much chance of succeeding in the longer term, should be protected from themselves and not allowed to waste effort and money in establishing themselves, having a short half-life in nuclear terminology, resembling the more suicidal of the enzymes, which do not last very long.  Perhaps the Minister even has some deeply held subliminal anxieties which relate to his concern about the Progressive Democrats and the outlook for that party.  I wonder if they would be considered a genuine political party in the context of the historical treatment of groups which come and go?</P>
    <P>I hope I do not seem a trifle smug when I take these positions.  I speak as a member of the oldest of all the political parties in this country, a party whose impending death was forecast, with a great deal of enthusiasm, by many people.  Yet, after all those years, here we are, alive and well and looking good for another 80 to 100 years or so.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the use of the term &ldquo;genuine&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Upton in much, perhaps not all, of what he said and to thank him and the other Labour Senators for having put down this amendment.  I intended to put it down and it slipped my notice.</P>
      <P>What is the difference between a political party and a genuine political party? The introduction of the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; before &ldquo;political party&rdquo; suggests, as Senator Upton said, that there are non-genuine political parties.  I also find it difficult to accept the provision that it must be, in the opinion of the registrar, a genuine political party.  We all have our opinions on issues.  There are probably as many opinions in this House as there are Senators and every registrar probably has a different opinion.  Perhaps in the previoius Act some criteria are laid down which are not mentioned in this section of this Bill.  Are there more criteria laid down, so that the registrar does not have to rely too heavily on his opinion, which may be different from that of a previous or subsequent Clerk of the Dáil?  I do not know.  I have not been here long enough to know how long, on average, a Clerk of the Dáil stays in his post.  Since I have arrived in Leinster House, the Clerk of the Seanad has gone to become Clerk of the Dáil.  Presumably that means in my short time here there have been at least two Clerks of the Dáil.  Do they have the same opinion with regard to what constitutes a genuine political party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that up to 1963 there was no mention on the ballot paper of a candidate's political party affiliation.  I am sorry it was ever allowed to be introduced.  I think we would have far better politics without it.  I do not intend any offence to any Deputy.  On the Seanad ballot paper there is no mention of political parties.  It would be far better if, when candidates were standing for the Dáil, and even more so, for local authority elections, that they were not allowed to put their party political affiliation on the ballot paper.  They then might have to stand on their own feet. They might have to be people who had a genuine base in the constituency, who were well known, who had a track record, <Col N="1956" /> perhaps in the case of local authority elections, of commitment to the community. They could not be drafted in at the drop of a hat or imposed by headquarters in Dublin and forced on that area.  I do not know much about this because I am not in a political party.  The fact that candidates have Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or The Workers' Party after their names means the good old stalwarts who just blindly vote on party lines do not have to know who they are. As long as they see Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or whatever, they are happy to put the tick after the name.  It does not matter a tinker's curse the standing of that candidate. I greatly regret that.  I suppose I would be only wasting my breath asking the Minister to consider bringing in regulations to go back to the pre-1963 situation where there were no indications of party affiliation after candidates' names. The present system is wrong and I would dearly love to see a change in it.</P>
    <P>Members of political parties often get out of difficult situations by saying &ldquo;I was under the party whip&rdquo;.  Once they are under the party whip everything is forgiven. They can do what they have to because they are under the party whip, and their opinion does not matter.  All that could be done away with if we discontinued this system.</P>
    <P>To what is the Minister referring when he speaks about a political party with commercial aims?  Will he clarify that? Is he suggesting that groups would put forward candidates as an advertising gimmick? If so, would he explain how it could be done?  I would then be satisfied with what he said.</P>
    <P>If the register were to be approached by a group who wanted to call themselves the party of Independents would that cause any problems, or is that a contradiction in terms?  I am an Independent; I have always been an Independent and I hope always to remain so.  Many Independents feel frustrated by the present party system.  They believed, at the local election, that they heard the voice of the people telling politicians what they felt about many political candidates in the considerable boost that was given to <Col N="1957" /> Independents.  If we wanted to register as an Independent Party, would that, in the opinion of the registrar, be a genuine political party?</P>
    <P>I support Senator Upton's amendment. It should be acceded to.</P>

      <P>We must differ on the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; because it is the core of the section.  We all know of people participating in politics who were not genuine or sincere about their cause.  The registrar must, in the first instance, decide whether a group is a genuine political party.  What evidence he may require is a matter for the registrar.  It is likely that he would seek to establish whether it is the group's intention to engage in elections, to select and present candidates, whether it has a statement of aims, a constitution, rules and policy documents, or if it has a structure geared towards decision making and policy formation, in other words, whether the group has the characteristics normally associated with a political party.

      <P>There are all sorts of innuendoes here.  I may appear naïve, but the Minister must remember that since I have never been a member of a political party I do not know what goes on there. I do not know to what the Minister is referring when he talks about people who are not sincere.  Is it possible to have a genuine political party which might not necessarily select candidates or a policy document and policy formation normally associated with political parties?  I agree with the necessity for a constitution.  The Minister is saying that the political parties we have are the ideal and anything that does not conform to that cannot be genuine.  We can only go along with what we know.  The Minister and his colleagues have tunnel vision when it comes to political <Col N="1958" /> parties; I am not referring to the Minister personally, but to the political parties in general.  I am not singling out any one party &mdash; although the Green Party do not subscribe to this way of organising their affairs.  The Minister goes along with the idea that everybody who wants to have a genuine political party must have a policy document and a system of policy formation that is normally associated with political parties, and woe to those who do not go along with that; woe to anyone not prepared to kowtow to the party whip.  They are thrown out of the party, as we saw here last week.  That has been the practice in this country heretofore.</P>
      <P>Many countries, however, do not operate the party political system as it is operated here with its tunnel vision accommodating only those who subscribe to, bow to, agree with, the party line and are prepared to stop thinking for themselves because the party tells them how to think.  If people are prepared to allow the party dictate to them, although they do not agree with it, they can beat their breast and say they had to obey the party Whip.  That excuses everything.  I do not believe that is the way parties should operate.  The Minister is now saying that unless a political party subscribes to that view it will not be a genuine political party.  I find that alarming, and I am sorry Senator Upton is not alarmed by it.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to be more explicit about what he means by people who are not sincere.  Could he give me examples?  Could he explain what he meant when he spoke about people with commercial rather than political motives?</P>

Senator Howard misinterpreted what I said and accused me of an abuse of freedom as an Independent, attacking the motives and intent of political parties.  That is not what perturbs me; I am perturbed about the Minister's assertion.  He gave us a list normally associated with political parties and implied that unless a party subscribed to them they were not a genuine political party.  I do not wish to insult any Member of this House or the other House, but the criteria which applied to political parties 20, 30 or 50 years ago are now outdated. <Col N="1960" /> We should move forward and act like other European countries, where they believe in consensus rather than the three line whip.  We should allow freedom to evolve towards that end instead of on these curtailing provision &ldquo;which, in the opinion of the registrar, is a genuine political party&rdquo;.  When I asked the Minister what he meant he said they will be engaged in the selection of candidates, they will have a constitutional policy document and other matters normally associated with a political party.  What worries me is that if a new type of political party, more geared to be effective in the Ireland of the nineties as we became more closely involved with our European colleagues, is formed it may not be the best or most constructive way forward.  In my opinion the Minister is tying us to what may have been suitable up to relatively recently. The Minister has not explained what he meant when he spoke about people whose aims were commercial.  Will he spell out what he meant?  If he does, I will not return to it.  How could people who were not sincere form a political party?  What or who is the Minister thinking of?</P>

The fact that Senator Hederman is, to some degree, outside the political club and not a member of a political party gives rise to a distinct and separate perspective of the political process.  To some extent she speaks for the average person whereas with political parties, there is a tendency to think in terms of the members of the club.

      <P>I promised I would sit if the Minister answered the two questions I put to him but he did not.  In saying that what the Joint Committee on Electoral Law said must be right, the Minister led me to presume that High Court, if not Supreme Court, judges headed that committee, and that a cross section of people from trade unions, etc., <Col N="1962" /> were members of that committee.  Now, Senator Upton tells me &mdash; and as the Minister did not shake his head I must assume that Senator Upton is correct &mdash; that the Joint Committee on Electoral Law was made up of party politicians.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>Senator Upton has been helpful.  The Minister is now saying that the people in the club decided the rules for the members of the club and they will not allow anybody else into the club.  Senator Upton is correct in saying it is a club.  A club makes the rules and the people in the club are all right but for those who are not members, it is their bad luck.  Are there any criteria covering this?  Are there any criteria laid down for what the Minister so articulately trotted out in regard to political parties engaging in such matters as selecting candidates and so on?  Are there rules informing the Registrar of the criteria in relation to political parties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (6) line 21, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>There are two issues to be dealt with here.  The first related to political parties not being allowed to register if the name of the party is considered to be unduly long and the second refers to the prohibition on the use of regional names by political parties.  I do not see any problem with that.  In many ways it is self-limiting for political parties to use names which were unduly long.  The names will obviously be confusing, unwieldly, and, may lead to the use of an abbreviated term or alternatively, to the demise of the political party.  I do not understand why the Minister is worried about that issue.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;unduly long&rdquo; is rather vague.  The Minister should be more precise if he wants to limit the length of names of political parties.  If that is his objective he should have either specified the number of words or the number of letters that could be used.  I do not accept that the term &ldquo;unduly long&rdquo; is appropriate and that is why I propose that paragraph (b) be deleted.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Minister has nothing to worry about in this regard because I do not visualise any serious or even half-serious political party using a long and unwieldly name.  That would not make sense; it would not allow the party to develop a proper profile or image and, accordingly, would seriously militate against the success of the party. However, if a party were successful in using an unduly long name, inevitably and indeed rapidly that name would be abbreviated to something much more mangeable.  Most parties abbreviated their names, in any event.</P>

      <P>Like FF, double F, as some of us call them, FG or the PDs.  Of course, we, in the Labour Party, have persisted with our old name but that is short, crisp terminology.  I am not aware of any party who have a long name.  As Senator Honan has mentioned FF &mdash; or double F, as I call them &mdash; they have an ancillary handlebar on their name as they are also known as The Republican Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking in terms of apologies; how could anybody even think for a second in those terms?  That party, who have the somewhat unwieldy name of Fianna Fáil, The Republican Party, for the most part use their abbreviated name of Fianna Fáil.  Similarly, Fine Gael have abbreviated their name to FG and the PDs quickly abbreviated their name having started life as the Progressive Democrats.  Therefore, I do not understand the Minister's concern in that regard.  I sincerely hope his concern has not emanated from listening to the &ldquo;Monty Python Flying Circus&rdquo; political party broadcast in which there was a gentleman from one of the African countries who seemed to be part of a very long and unwieldy party, or had he a very long and unwieldy name?  I cannot quite remember.  I do not think we have anything to be worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (c) precludes political parties from using local or regional terms <Col N="1965" /> in their names.  I do not see any difficulty with a Clare Fianna Fáil Party, a Cork Fianna Fáil Party or a Cork Labour Party.  While there could be a short term local gain for such a party they could also lose out on a national basis.  These things usually balance and people will be sensible about the issue.  Those who belong to national parties are at an advantage when running for election and I do not believe that advantage would be lightly sacrificed.  A person representing a Cork or Clare Fianna Fáil Party or Labour Party, is confined to that area and precluded from moving.  Therefore, I cannot see it doing any harm in the short term.  Such a party running against a similar national party would soon find themselves in difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are other ways of dealing with local issues.  People can simply change their name, as various people have done, the most distinguished being Seán (Dublin Bay) Rockall Loftus, who changed his name to suit the issues which concerned him from time to time. Indeed, he got his point of view and concerns across in a far more effective manner than if he had gone forward as the Dublin Bay party, in which, perhaps, nobody would have taken a great deal of notice.  I believe we would be better off letting people use local names or names that are designed to highlight some special issue.  In a relatively short period of time those people would simply fade from the scene and, therefore, there is nothing to be concerned about.  There is no need to incorporate those preventive measures in a Bill such as this.  The old political process takes care of that kind of thing, so on that point I will move the two amendments.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to abandon his <Col N="1966" /> proposal to means test European Social Fund grants and instead to establish an expert independent body to examine all aspects of student grant aid and make recommendations thereon.</P>
    <P>I commiserate with our Minister for Education, who is in hospital.  I wish him well and hope that his appendix operation is just a minor one.  I am very disappointed that we do not have the Minister for Education here because, since his appointment, he has not been in the Seanad.  Over the last few months we had three Ministers for Education but only Minister O'Rourke came into the Seanad.  It is important that, before the year is out, we would have a debate on education.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that we have had to resort to Private Members' time to raise issues which are very important, particularly when this day week students will commence their leaving certificate examination &mdash; the countdown is on for them. In addition to the normal examination pressures, there is an additional pressure on those students aspiring to third level education if they applied on their CAO forms for courses in any of our nine regional technical colleges &mdash; Sligo, Galway, Letterkenny, Athlone, Tralee, Cork, Waterford, Carlow, Dundalk, CoACT in Limerick and the six Dublin colleges of technology known as Dublin Institute of Technology.  The decision to means test the maintenance grant of £39 made post-Christmas is still there and this will have a devastating effect on the ability of many of those students to enter regional technical colleges.  I am extremely disappointed because I would have thought at this stage that Minister Brennan, as that was not his idea, would have abandoned this proposal.  It is estimated &mdash; and I have visited many third level colleges &mdash; that seven out of ten applying will not qualify because the income threshold is abysmally low with the result that, effectively, the lower middle income group families will be affected.</P>
    <P>The former Minister's excuse was that <Col N="1967" /> he wished to bring equity to the system, but the higher education grants system as applied in the universities is anything but just and equitable.  He stated at the time that he would have a committee which would report back, but it still has not reported back, and after this week we can effectively say that the schools are closed and we are into the next academic year.</P>
    <P>Our motion seeks to establish an expert independent body, which is essential if we are to bring the social partners in education together.  This body should reflect the views of all those interested in education.  These would include the Minister and Department of Education officials but also IDA representatives, the Higher Education Authority, universities and regional technical colleges and other third level institutions, plus parents, teachers unions and the Union of Students in Ireland.  That to me is the proper social democratic education grouping which would be essential if we are to examine and make recommendations regarding the removal of inequities in relation to student grants.  I would be very disappointed if the Minister's committee was not extended to be this expert independent body which we in Fine Gael are advocating.  I would ask, in the dying days of the academic year, that the committee which I suggest, would meet.  Seeing that social partners have been very much &ldquo;flavour of the month&rdquo; with the Government, I would expect that the social partners in education would be treated likewise.</P>
    <P>We note again and again, and we have done so here on the Order of Business, that it is the PAYE workers and their families who are being discriminated against in the assessment for third level education grants.  These low income families are excluded from third level education because the income thresholds are too low.  The industrial wage of £250 per week effectively will disqualify parents from that grant when the means testing for the £39 maintenance grant begins in September.  The threshold of £12,900 is a very meagre wage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> Effectively, instead of bringing equity to the system, the Minister is disadvantaging the already disadvantaged. The payment of fees and the £39 represents for thousands of average, middle income families their only chance of getting into higher education.  I noted in the school in which I was teaching that the children could get the benefit of third level education &mdash; regional technical colleges &mdash; specifically because of the scrimping and saving of their parents.  They came from unemployment blackspot areas, their parents knew the problems of lack of qualification as regards job opportunities and wished their children would not suffer the same fate.  These are the income groups who will be affected. I do not wish to see those children ending up on the dole queues if they do not gain access to third level education because that surely will not be cost effective.  We are talking about a minimum of £50 a week for social welfare versus £39 for a better chance of employment.  I cannot understand the mathematics of what Deputy Noel Davern brought about in January when he was Minister.</P>
    <P>I have visited the colleges in Limerick. Students are aware of the efforts and sacrifices their parents have made.  They think they are all right because they are in the system now, but they also think of younger brothers and sisters denied a chance.  Parents making representations to me have said it is better for many of them to go on the dole, because then at least their children will be eligible for the grant.  It is a strange country if we are actively encouraging parents to go on the dole because their meagre incomes will be means tested.  These people have a tremendous thirst for learning and their parents want them to do better than they did.  Many of these parents would not have had an opportunity to avail of third level education and they are crying out for their children to be given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I was looking at an excellent book from the Higher Education Authority called &ldquo;Who goes to College&rdquo; by Patrick Clancy of UCD, published some time ago.  This was a second national survey of participation <Col N="1969" /> in higher education.  Looking through the socio-economic status of entrants, students are asked a single question on the occupation of their parent or guardian and they are assigned to an appropriate socio-economic group on the basis of their response to that question.</P>
    <P>I will go through the grouping &mdash; farmers, agricultural workers, higher professional, lower professional, employers and managers, salaried employees, intermediate non-manual workers, other non-manual workers, skilled manual workers, semi-skilled manual workers and unskilled manual workers.  This was a study done on new entrants in 1986.  If I had the time I would go through it line by line.  The largest group of new entrants were from the farmer social grouping.  I have no problem with that because it is very obvious now, with the way farming incomes are going and the prospects of a career on the land, that particularly if you have more than one son or daughter they will obviously go on to third level. The ratio coming through in the higher socio-economic groupings in regard to access to education was very specific.  The national population participation rates study showed that the group which was under-represented were unskilled manual workers &mdash; only 1.3 per cent of new entrants came from this social grouping, although they made up 8.2 per cent of the comparison population group.</P>
    <P>Summarising very briefly, the higher professionals had a ratio of 3; salaried employees, 2.3; lower professionals, 2.4 per cent; employees and managers, 1.98; and farmers, 1.45.  These were the social groups which were over-represented in relation to admission to higher education. The five social groups significantly under-represented as shown by their participation ratios were unskilled manual labour, 0.16; semi-skilled manual workers, 0.42; other non-manual workers, 0.45; other agricultural occupations, 0.48; and skilled manual workers, 0.51.</P>
    <P>I am stressing that comparison because the point the Minister stated in January in his press release was that he was bringing <Col N="1970" /> equity into the system.  The comparative figures there show that the better off the parents the better chance of participation rates.  At the very end are the lower socio-economic groupings.  They are the people who go directly to regional technical colleges because they wish to avail of the fees plus the maintenance grant schemes. In other words they are under-represented in the institutions of Higher Education Authority &mdash; UCD, UCC, UCG and Trinity College &mdash; and totally under-represented in the professional areas.  They are going to regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>It is a fallacy to say that the Minister is bringing equity into the system when he is not hitting at the very well-to-do people who get grants that perhaps they do not need.  Under the ESF funding, all are entitled to grants.  My premise is that the Minister is hitting at the lower socio-economic groupings, who are very poorly represented anyway.  This further erosion of moneys in relation to the £39 grant when it goes &mdash; and I said it will be gone for seven out of ten &mdash; will disadvantage the already disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The social groups which had the smallest percentage of students without any financial aid were unskilled manual workers, farmers, semi-skilled manual workers and other agricultural occupations. I make that point because they are the very end of the scale.  They do not go for further education if they do not have financial aid.  The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I took a cross-section of one college in Limerick and it gives a breakdown very close to the one I have mentioned as regards access for students.  Out of a total number in one college I got a participation rate of 70 per cent in the unskilled category, the lower socio-economic level.  At the highest level, the children of the professional classes generally go to UCD, UCC or whatever.  They become doctors, solicitors, engineers or whatever.  They are not necessarily moving into the RTC area; they are there, but not in great numbers.  As I said, a person who earns £250 a week, which is not a great amount of money &mdash;<Col N="1971" /> there are people earning less who would wish to send their children to third level &mdash; is over the limit.</P>
    <P>If we look at social selectivity, in general the more prestigious the sector and field of study the greater the social inequality in participation levels. Inequality between social groups was greatest within the university sector &mdash; emphasising again that students from higher professional groups were more highly represented while sudents from working class backgrounds had the lowest representation in this sector.  They are already disadvantaged in universities. There are large disparities in enrolment areas.  Any serious effort to achieve a reduction in class inequality will require intervention at the primary and secondary stage.  What would we in Fine Gael do about it?  Certainly we would remove that inequality instantly.  We would not have a situation where we have discrimination again among the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>When I am summing up I may have an opportunity to refer to the Culliton report and where we should be going as regards educational and vocational training, particularly in the context of Maastricht. This is important if we wish to put further emphasis on the need in this country for a highly qualified skilled workforce who will be able to take their place in a Europe which has tremendous emphasis at the moment on technology, engineering, electronics and so on.  This committee of the social partners must be set up to ensure that our students get equality at third level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. This motion has a particular significance at this time of year because it is now that the leaving certificate students are anxiously preparing for their examinations. The anxiety created by the points system, by the entire academic rat race, is further exacerbated this year by the uncertainty that hangs over their head about their future in terms of the financing of whatever third level courses they may select.  For that reason this is an <Col N="1972" /> extremely serious debate.  It is important that the Minister in his reply tonight would allay the fears of people who look to ESF funding as their means to third level education in the coming year and that they be left in no doubt that the means testing will be removed for one year, pending a review of the course. It is the objective of Fine Gael on this occasion to allay those fears and to put the minds of the parents and the young people at ease prior to their leaving certificate. That is what motivated this motion.</P>
      <P>The RTCs and colleges of technology were given a tremendous boost in terms of enrolment, of status and of activity in them because of ESF funding.  This funding increased enrolment and maximised participation of the colleagues. Their present level of status, their confidence and their standing is in no small way due to the ESF funding.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report is considered to be the bible on job creation, on economic regeneration and specifically on industrial policy for the coming years.  That report emphasis beyond yea or nay the critical importance of technical and technological education as a mechanism for job creation for innovative activity in the economy that will give rise to new jobs, that will create the necessary lift in employment.  For that reason, rather than talking about curtailing our input to third level grants or in any way inhibiting people from access to them, we should make it extremely attractive to attend our RTCs and colleges of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House that I am aware that in our RTCs and our colleges of technology we have a number of students from the higher professional backgrounds.  We have a number of people from very wealthy backgrounds and that is how it should be. It is not an unacceptable phenomenon. All analysis by the Clancy report, by recent USI surveys, or any empirical studies of participation in RTCs show that there is a tendency for the people from the poorer backgrounds to participate. This is obviously as a consequence of ESF funding, which is not a <Col N="1973" /> particularly major piece of largesse.  An ESF grant is £39 a week to a student.  It is welcome, it is good and it is certainly a boost to the student; but it is not manna from heaven.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have no difficulty with the principle of means testing.  That is not at issue.  What we have difficulty with are the ceilings on the means tests.  We have a difficulty with the fact that the means are assessed on gross income rather than net income.  We have a difficulty with the mechanisms by which we arrive at means and at what constitutes a genuinely just case for somebody to get to college on ESF funding.  That is our problem.</P>
    <P>The logical thing for the Government to do now is to abandon for one year any plans to introduce means testing.  During that year they should carry out a root and branch analysis of ESF funding and of the third level grant structures &mdash; how they impinge on access to education, how they affect enrolment, how they affect the different socio-economic groups, etc. When that analysis is complete then introduce, if necessary, a means testing package for all the colleges and institutions. That will not be found unacceptable. What is unacceptable about the present plans is that, on the one hand, there is the introduction of means testing and the panic that that has caused among the parents and the young people; but, on the other hand, there is no strategy in place for its implementation.  That is our concern.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who unapologetically believes that we should pass the Maastricht Treaty, and I think it is the duty of all public representatives to advocate it. The events of yesterday should only reinforce our desire to assert our stance on it and not, by some sleeveen type strategy, be affected by what is happening abroad.  One of the marvellous byproducts of the Maastricht Treaty will be the opportunity for this country to expand the whole range of funding for third level education; it will expand the whole grant structure; and there should be potential to expand ESF funding to increase the amount of money going into <Col N="1974" /> that sector, with a resultant increase in take-up.</P>
    <P>That is another compelling reason this should be put on hold until the Maastricht Treaty is in place and we see the level of cohesion funding arising from it.  That is an area of dispute at the moment, if it will be £6 billion, but when the funding is there, and the Treaty is in place and when there is an analysis of how to effectively means test, that is the time to look for a review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins repeatedly made the point in the Dáil that he did not envisage this as some sort of a come down for the Government.  Nobody is asking the Minister to withdraw the principle of means testing; I do not think anyone proposes that.  We are asking the Minister to say that, in the interest of commonsense, the means testing will be put on hold for one year and that the review will take place during that year as to how effectively means testing could be put in place.</P>
    <P>This is important.  The one thing we need is to gear all our resources, human and economic, to job creation and rewarding incentive.  This is an opportunity for us to give the green light to young people who want to go to third level institutions.  That green light is much better than consigning those people to the dole queue and to a life of helplessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>commends the Minister for Education for his initiatives in seeking to achieve greater equity and equality for all under the third level student support schemes; notes the various improvements to these schemes as announced earlier this year; and that further and more comprehensive improvements will be announced in the near future arising from a detailed review of the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the <Col N="1975" /> House and I hope it is in order for me to extend good wishes for a speedy recovery to the Minister for Education, who I understand is hospitalised.</P>
    <P>We must all acknowledge that great strides have been made in the area of third level education over the last few years.  There has been a huge increase in the numbers participating in third level courses.  Forty per cent of all school leavers in 1991 entered third level courses. When we compare this to the 20 per cent of school leavers who entered third level courses in 1980 and the 25 per cent who entered into third level courses in 1986, we can see the huge increase in participation that has taken place over the last few years.</P>
    <P>Third level admission procedures have been simplified and streamlined.  Many additional student places have been provided in our third level colleges.  Last year 2,500 new places were provided in the third level colleges and the previous year &mdash; 1990 &mdash; 1,200 new places were provided. There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that a further 9,000 places approximately will be provided over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In addition, there has been a huge increase in the amount of financial support for third level students.  I understand that at the moment approximately £70 million of State funding is being provided in support grants for students in the third level system.  This year a new grading system for the leaving certificate is being introduced.  These are major advances and we should give a lot of the credit for these advances and for this progress to Deputy O'Rourke, who was Minister for Education between 1987 and 1991 and was responsible for introducing all these reforms which have been so beneficial to our student population, and particularly to students in the third level system.</P>
    <P>In 1991, 25,000 new students entered third level education.  This brought the total number in third level institutions up to approximately 75,000 students and it is anticipated that this figure will grow by a further 15,000 over the next few years. <Col N="1976" /> Of those students who are in the system, approximately 55 per cent are in receipt of support under the various student grant schemes.</P>
    <P>University students have access to the higher education grants.  These grants are means tested.  Degree students in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges have access to regional college scholarships, which again, of course, are means tested on the same basis as the higher education grant scheme.  I would agree with those who said the income limits for higher education grants and for regional college scholarships are relatively low, and I sincerely hope it will be possible for the Government to raise those income limits so that, by degrees, more students will qualify for these grants.</P>
    <P>Certificate and diploma students in the regional colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges who are attending ESF aided courses are in receipt of ESF grants.  These grants up to now have not been means tested. Initially, only a small number of courses in the RTCs and in the Institute of Technology colleges were ESF funded, but by degrees funding was extended to cover practically all the certificate and diploma courses.  Many people were under the impression, and appear to be still under the impression, that there is no limit to the amount of ESF funding which is available. This is not so.  The Community support framework limits the amount of funding that is available.  A funding limit was set in the Community support framework at 19,600 students.  By 1990 this limit had been reached; the enrolment of 19,600 had been exceeded.  In 1991 the number on ESF courses was over 22,000. This means that 2,600 in excess of the limit are now on these courses.  These 2,600 students are being paid grants which are fully funded by the State at a cost of £10 million and without any means testing.</P>
    <P>There is a means test in operation for all other students.  Obviously, this is an inequitable situation where we have some students in receipt of State-funded grants without a means test while the vast <Col N="1977" /> majority of students who apply for State-funded grants, such as the higher education grants, are liable to means testing. It is understandable that, arising from that situation and against that background, the Minister felt obliged to make some changes in the ESF grant scheme and it was with a view to achieving greater equity and equality for all third level students that he examined the situation.</P>
    <P>As I see it there were three options open to the Minister.  He could have limited the number going into these courses. He could have limited the number to the 19,600 who would be funded by the money available under the Community support framework but that would have resulted in students being denied places on the courses.</P>
    <P>The second option was to limit the range of courses to which ESF funding would apply.  The third option was to try to accommodate as many students as possible on these courses by applying a means test to the maintenance element of the ESF grant.  That was the option the Minister chose and I believe he chose the correct option.  To choose either of the other two options would have done an injustice to the many students who will now continue to be accommodated in those courses.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out the proposal to means test the maintenance element of the ESF grant will only apply to new applicants for ESF grants, that is, new students who enter the ESF-funded courses in September.  The fees of the students will be paid.  It is important to emphasise that there is no change as far as existing students are concerned.  ESF students on certificate and diploma courses will continue to receive their ESF grants.</P>
    <P>Students who have completed their certificate courses and who are undertaking work experience programmes in order to proceed to diploma courses will be eligible for the ESF grants when they enter these diploma courses.  They will qualify both for maintenance and fees but as and from September the new entrants to ESF-funded courses will be means tested for the maintenance element.  They will still be at an advantage <Col N="1978" /><i>vis-a-vis</i> other third level students because their fees will be paid irrespective of means.</P>
    <P>This is something I would like to see extended to students in all third level colleges.  I would like to see a situation reached eventually where the fees of all students in all third level colleges are paid.  That is why I welcome the fact the Minister has established a committee to carry out a full review of the present situation in relation to student grants. I hope one of the recomendations that review committee will come up with is that all fees will be paid for all students in third level colleges.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the amendment which states that further and more comprehensive improvements will be announced in the near future arising from the detailed review of the higher education grants schemes that is ongoing at present.  I look forward to these improvements and I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I reiterate the sentiments expressed by Senator Mullooly and I congratulate the Minister on the initiatives he is taking in relation to bringing equity into this whole system of third level education. I am rather in a quandary in relation to the Opposition motion here because as I understand it, &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; Senator Jackman had the old idea in relation to meanstesting and so on while her colleague, who seconded the motion, was agreeing in principle to the whole notion of means testing.  I wonder is there a difference of opinion among the Opposition in relation to whether there should be means testing? One person seemed to be saying there should be no means testing and the other was saying that they agreed in principle on meanstesting.  I respect and appreciate the concern of all people, particularly the two people in the Opposition who put down the motion and seconded it, who are in the educational field, as are a number of people on this side of the House.  We are all concerned with development in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> One could really say that the reason the motion was tabled is because of the success of the RTCs and the huge development that has taken place in the whole RTC system in recent years.  I would hate to think for one moment that the reason the RTCs were such a success was principally because people were getting paid money in order to go to third level colleges.  All of the success stories in the RTCs are basically because there is an outstanding facility there and there is a most worthwhile third level educational mechanism in operation in the RTCs.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman was trying to differentiate between universities and RTCs.  I know numerous people who left my own school and other schools who would have been quite capable of gaining entry to university but who opted for an RTC even though under the means testing they would have qualified for entry to university.  Because they felt that was the area they wanted to be involved in and that the RTCs were more appropriate to the type of careers those people wished to follow in the long term, they opted for education in an RTC and not necessarily because there was ESF funding.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that more than RTCs get ESF funding.  People are not aware that there are now a number of third level and postgraduate courses in university that are ESF-funded and their number is growing.  I welcome that development which I regard as very important.</P>
    <P>In relation to the socio-economic groupings and the fact that unskilled people seem to be suffering most, I do not think for one moment that has any bearing whatever on entry to third level colleges.  There are many other problems and difficulties that have to be taken into account.  I am sure Senator Jackman is aware of the difficulties in second level education where, not alone is it almost impossible in a number of instances to encourage people to go to third level education, but it is extremely difficult to encourage people to finish second level <Col N="1980" /> education.  That is where the difficulty is. The vast majority of people in the socio-economic grouping that has been mentioned would qualify, even if they were means tested, for entry to third level education and would be funded.  As Senator Mullooly pointed out, only the maintenance is being means tested; the fees remain unchanged.  There is inequity in a situation where two people on the same income, with the same number of children and the same commitments, but one opts to go to one third level college and the other goes to another; one gets away scot free and the other has to pay through the nose.  That is not equitable and anyone who suggests it is would have to produce very strong proof to convince me.</P>
    <P>I recognise Senator Mullooly has difficulties in relation to means testing. Every year at local authority, vocational education committee and county council meetings, when the third level grants come up for approval, I try to change the system of assessment for means testing and to bring about a change in emphasis where possible.  I have advocated a number of times that net income should be the appropriate figure for means testing for entry to third level colleges.</P>
    <P>However, this is a different matter. The difficulty is that the funding initially coming from Europe was for a limited amount and because of the success of the scheme, we spent that money very quickly.</P>
    <P>As Senator Mullooly said, what started off as a small range of courses mushroomed into a multiplicity of courses within a couple of years.  That is fantastic and I welcome it.  I agree with Senator O'Reilly's comments on the importance of Maastricht in the education field and the developments accruing to this country as a result of our ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  I am pro-Maastricht. When people get the opportunity to vote on 18 June I hope they vote massively in favour.  From the education point of view alone, the opportunities accruing to us will be enormous.</P>
    <P>We have to face reality.  It is a crazy system if a millionaire sends a son or <Col N="1981" /> daughter to a RTC course that is ESF funded he does not have to pay a penny in terms of fees or maintenance while a worker earning above the income limit has to pay for his son or daughter attending a third level institution, other than an RTC.  That is inequity.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for trying to reverse the situation and ensuring that every student enters third level education on the same basis and that they would opt for a course not on the basis of how much they will get but the career they see for themselves.</P>
    <P>I compliment the RTCs for the magnificant contribution they have made to third level education and I have no doubt that they will make an even greater contribution in the years ahead.  I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well.  I know the committee set up to review the position will bring forward concrete proposals and I look forward to reading their report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in a county that has one of the lowest participation rates in third level education.  The announcement by the then Minister, Deputy Davern, and the subsequent Ministers for Education of the means testing of the maintenance of the ESF grants has caused widespread alarm throughout the length and breadth of Wexford and in other areas.</P>
      <P>We do not have any third level colleges in Wexford.  Any young person who wants third level education must leave Wexford and live away from home from Monday to Friday.  As a result, the maintenance portion of their grant is of particular importance when they do not have the option of attending a third level course in their town or area.  I have a file from parents, councils and individuals, all expressing alarm and wanting an explanation of what the proposals might mean for their sons and daughters next autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that we have yet to hear the views of the public on this issue.  It will only be in the next few months as leaving certificate results are analysed and as place offers from the CAO/CAS <Col N="1982" /> system come in that the new changes introduced by the Minister will dawn on parents.  I urge him to review this.  I accept there are enormous inequalities, inequities and injustices in the present system of grants at university level but what is needed is a fundamental reform of the system and not just a tinkering with the system by attacking the easy option, the ESF grants for those attending RTCs and Dublin Institutes of Technology.</P>
    <P>This group should not be singled out in the absence of an overall review of the system of third level funding.  That is the point I am making.  We do not want to perpetuate any more inequities.  We are not in the business of ensuring, as Senator McKenna said, that millionaires get maintenance grants for their sons and daughters while others with £200 over a strict income limit get nothing for sending a young person to university.  That makes little sense, but for the few big fish the Minister catches in the net he has cast in relation to ESF maintenance grants, there will be hundreds of borderline cases, second, third and fourth members of a family, who will not now be able to take up the option of third level at an RTC or Dublin Institute of Technology because of the proposed changes.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to put these proposals on hold until we have the results of his overhaul of third level funding.  His proposals do not make sense on social, education or economic grounds.  The sum of £39 per week maintenance for the 22,000 RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology students has proved a lifeline not only for the students themselves but for the colleges concerned because it has ensured a throughput in the RTCs and Dublin Institutes of Technology of quality undergraduate material, young people who would not have had the option of going to these colleges but for ESF funding.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion makes great play about noting the various improvements to these schemes announced earlier in the year.  That is worth looking at and dispelling the myth once and for all.  I have before me the <Col N="1983" /> answer to a parliamentary question, answered by Deputy Seamus Brennan, Minister for Education, on 19 February. There are five points made, four will bear little relevance to what we are talking about now.  For example, the Minister spoke about income limits and maintenance grants being indexed from 1992. In theory that sounds marvellous but unless you start off at a realistic level there is little point in indexing them at 3 per cent or 4 per cent or whatever the cost of living or inflation rate will be in the years concerned.  It will make little overall difference to whether the second child or third child of a large family, living in rural Ireland, will be able to go to the local regional college.</P>
    <P>Indexing is fine once you start from a realistic level in 1992 but I am suggesting we are not doing that.  Lone parent welfare payments under the lone parent's allowance will be excluded from assessment of income.  Realistically, how many will that let off the hook or give maintenance grants they otherwise would not get?</P>
    <P>Mature students will now be assessed on the basis of their own incomes rather than their parents' incomes.  That is commonsense and it is accepted but it is a very small proportion of what we are talking about.  Again, it will make little difference to the basic overall problem. Income eligibility will be assessed on income and income limits in the year of entering third level rather than, as heretofore, on income limits in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate. A youngster might not be going to third level, to a RTC or a Dublin Institute of Technology for three or four years after they leave school.  Their parents' income may have collapsed in the meantime and it makes sense to assess them on the income eligibility on the year of entering third level rather than the year in which they sat the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>May I come back to the one point which will make a little difference.  In the amendment great play is made of the various improvements to these schemes, <Col N="1984" /> as announced earlier in the year. However, most of them really are very selective in that the number who will be helped as a result of the Minister's changes will be so small as to not affect the overall problem or the bulk of the students who are the subject of the motion this evening.</P>
    <P>The income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level.  If my figures are correct, for the academic year 1991-92, if a married couple with two children, who want to send each child to third level have a gross income over approximately £10,780, immediately there will be a decrease in the amount of grant eligible to them until it tapers out altogether.  We all know that a gross income of £10,800 leaves one with very little disposable income.  Certainly, it would ensure that a couple with that gross income would not have sufficient disposable income to allow a son or daughter attend third level outside their own town.  That is the position in Wexford and that is why we have a low uptake of third level education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase after the first child of £2,000 in income eligibility, but a £10,800 gross income for the complete maintenance and tuition grant means the option of going to third level education is not very realistic.  While we welcome the few points the Minister has made, it is not the fundamental review we all agree that is necessary to have equity and to remove the injustice that is in the present system.  My colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins and many others have said that what the Minister is now proposing to do is transfer the fundamental inequity of the existing higher education grants system which operates in the universities to the Dublin Institute of Technology and RTC colleges.  I urge the Minister not to do that until the fundamental review is available.  I urge him to put on hold any means testing of the maintenance portion of ESF grants until the review that I understand has been commissioned is before us.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell us when that review will be available, when it can be <Col N="1985" /> implemented, who is reviewing it and how long they have been reviewing it?  I ask the Minister to retain in full the present ESF funding arrangements for third level courses pending this review.  I also ask him to give us assurances that he will enter into negotiations with the European Community to obtain further ESF funding for other third level courses and institutions.</P>
    <P>What is the thinking behind means testing the maintenance portion of ESF grants?  Is it because we used up in full our ESF block grant last year and the Government had to carry the last 2,500 students directly out of the national Exchequer.  I am quite sure that if the case was made in Brussels more ESF funding would be made available.  If anything in the Maastricht Treaty makes sense, if cohesion, convergence, the removal of disparities, or help in relation to unemployment mean anything at all, there will be ESF funding if the Government look for it in Brussels.</P>
    <P>To achieve what I have asked for, we would need to establish a permanent education secretariat in Brussels for education, monitoring, research and liaison. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to this House that he will do that in order to maximise the benefit of European Union in this most important area.  We welcome the inclusion of education in the provisions of the Treaty.  I ask the Minister to think about the matter and not to make any change until we have the full review and look at the overall funding of third level education in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister this evening.  He has been thrown in at the deep end.  We send our good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who is ill in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Sentor Doyle referred to the good things Deputy Davern announced when he was Minister.  The fact that the eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first is a very important step forward. The income eligibility being assesed on the current year's income is very important. I have always said that if I were <Col N="1986" /> Minister for Education one of the things I would do is to send everybody out to work for a year after leaving second level education.  They should go out into the world, into the university of reality, where many of us had to go and we did not suffer as a result.  When they then go back into third level education, they will go back with a greater sense of purpose and there will be far fewer drop-outs. The number of drop-outs from third level education is alarming at present.  Last year the failure rate in some of our universities was deplorable.  We are spending increased amounts on health and education but we have a sicker society now than we ever had and we also have more illiteracy than we ever had.  When I was in the national school in third class, before we went to the next room to fourth class, the teacher always ensured we could write a letter home to our parents so if one ever had to leave the country, at least one would be able to write home.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable today that with so much third level education people are leaving school who cannot write their names.  It is not that people are any less intelligent. One sees cases of people who cannot write their own names, who are involved in all kinds of vandalism, stealing cars and so on.  I was a mechanic for many years and some of these fellows could open a car quicker than I could. They could stick a bit of plastic into a lock and have the car open in no time.  It is not that they are unintelligent.  A group of people who amaze me never went to school at all &mdash; I am speaking of the travelling salesmen who sell carpets and can tell you the yardage you need for a room; they sell televisions and tell you how to work them; they drive vans and cars but you never see them in a garage. They cannot spell &ldquo;nut&rdquo; but they know the nut to fit the bolt.  They are highly intelligent.</P>
    <P>I hope the review group will take a good hard look at the amount of money that is spent on education and see if we are getting the maximum results.  For far too long we spent a great deal of money educating people for the Civil Service <Col N="1987" /> and the public service, and any person who went into business or was entreprenurial-minded was regarded as a speculator; it was a dirty word.  I hope that the people in our colleges are learning about marketing and research.  Up to now people did not know very much about selling.  Everything was geared towards Civil Service work.</P>
    <P>The technical schools did a great job but they never got credit for it.  They trained the people for life.  They taught them a trade.  We should look at how vocational schools could be upgraded. Maybe we spend too much on FÁS when that money could be better spent on vocational education.  If the vocational schools went back to teaching students a trade, they would do more to create employment and students would be able to earn a living when they leave the colleges.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator O'Reilly said about the Maastricht Treaty.  It is important that we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum because we need funds for education and I would hate to think we would do anything to hinder that.  If we did not have the ESF funding we would not be talking about this motion or this amendment.</P>
    <P>Since Bord Telecom stopped printing directories for the whole country I am sure Senators have had occasion to ring Directory Enquiries, now you are asked to spell the name of the person or firm whose telephone number is required.  If you cannot spell the name you are told it is not in the directory and they cannot help you.  It is a sad reflection on our education system that people in those jobs do not have a clue how to spell a name like Gallogly.  I rang the operator for the telephone number of a pub known as TDs and the operator asked me to spell it.  I said it is simply TD.  It is time we looked at our standard of education when people cannot spell a simple name. I hope the review body will take a good indepth look at all those issues.</P>
    <P>We have regional colleges in Sligo, Letterkenny and Limerick and it is ridiculous that people from Sligo go to the colleges in Letterkenny, Limerick or <Col N="1988" /> Dundalk.  The same courses are held in Sligo but when the course is full the chidren are sent elsewhere.  There is a lack of organisation here.  It is a waste of money sending students all over the country for interviews.  There should be one interview board in each area and each student would be given the result of their interview which they could send to any college.  I hope the review body looks at that as well.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment.  I welcome this indepth review and I hope some of the points I have made here will be taken on board.  When students leave school they should be able to write and spell.  We should not need adult education today when we consider the amount of money we have spent on education over the last 25 years.  It is ridiculous that children cannot write their own names.  We need to take an indepth look at this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion, I do not agree with the amendment because essentially it copperfastens the position adopted by the Minister, which I think is the wrong one.  The Minister put the cart before the horse earlier this year when he decided to means test ESF funding.  It was quite the wrong thing to do.  There has been a call for an equitable form of assessment for higher education grants, and I fully subscribe to that.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to introduce restrictions on funding from Europe that has been used &mdash; I do not want to use the word &ldquo;exploited&rdquo;, but that effectivey is what it is &mdash; widely and effectively for the benefit of our third level students.  What is happening now is that we are being penalised for our success in attracting ESF funding and for the greater numbers of students attending third level institutions.  We have barely exceeded the estimated number of students eligible for ESF funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the criticism could be made of the Government that there was not a greater perception of these increased needs and that they did not negotiate a greater tranche of funding in this direction, but I acknowledge that there has been tremendous development in this <Col N="1989" /> area of education.  The Government are either trying to restrict students coming into the system or ensure, by means testing, that they do not pay more than 50 per cent of the cost of third level education where the students attract ESF funding.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that the Government should see fit to limit the number of students this year for the sake of a few million pounds &mdash; I think it is £2 million this year, £2 million next year and perhaps £2 million the following year, approximately £6 million in three years. We do not know what the future holds but we do know that the present intake of students will be disadvantaged.  Students had to apply for courses by 1 February but because they thought they would be means tested, some of them will have decided not to apply for the courses they wanted to do.</P>
    <P>We do not know what will be the effects of the January announcement. Did people decide not to go forward for certain courses because there would be a limit on funding, in other words, that they would get funds for tuition but not for maintenance?  We would have been better off devoting our energies to seeking an increase in the amount of European funding for education because Europe is more sympathetic to providing funds for training and education than for any other area.  Rather than means testing students who will commence courses in September, we should have gone back to Europe on the matter.  In my view, the Government should have carried the extra costs this year in the context of closer European union in the future and greater funding coming into this area.</P>
    <P>At present, approximately 60 per cent of the 9,000 students in the Dublin Institute of Technology are in receipt of ESF funding; that is the percentage of students who would be affected by this move; obviously not all are affected in the sense that some of them are already attending courses.  In 1990 we succeeded in extending ESF funding to first, second and third year courses, certificate and diploma courses; this was a major development; we extended the age limit; we abolished the upper age limit of 25 <Col N="1990" /> years and we have been very successful in extending the barriers and funded courses, and, in a sense, we are being penalised for that success.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges and other third level institutions have attracted ESF funding.  The 1986 Clancy report on third level education makes it obvious that in areas where there are third level institutions, and particularly regional colleges, a higher quota of students are attracted to third level education.  We should encourage that trend because it attracts ESF funding.</P>
    <P>All the documentation produced by the Department of Education deals with training programmes and trainees, so we are not talking about allowances for any other purpose and, in that context, it is improper for the Government to describe it as a maintenance allowance.  They say they are taxing the maintenance allowance, not the tuition allowance but it is really a training allowance.  I do not think it is right to tax an allowance that is given for training purposes.  There is no way we can tax &mdash; which is effectively what the Government are doing &mdash; money provided by the European Community for training purposes.  The Government are on very shaky ground.  They should look at that issue again before legal action is taken against them.  We did not need this <i>ad hoc</i> response from the Government to means test once they found there was an overrun, and when there was uproar about that, to increase the eligibility threshold; I welcome the increase in the eligibility threshold by £2,000.  The Government say they are setting up a review committee to bring a more equitable income assessment scheme into operation and to establish proper criteria. Why did they not do it the other way round?  This is the worst type of <i>ad hocery</i> and the Minister must be criticised for his approach.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister, even at this late stage, to ensure that students starting their third level education in September will not be penalised <i>vis-a-vis</i> students already in the system.  First year students in the Dublin Institute of Technology, the regional colleges and other third level <Col N="1991" /> institutions will not be given grants whereas those starting their second or third year will receive grants.  I ask the Minister not to go ahead with these proposals to extend the present scheme for a further year.  Perhaps the review committee has already been set up, but I hope it is a wide-ranging remit and that once and for all, we will have an equitable income assessment scheme for those attending higher education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first heard of the Government's measures on means testing ESF funding, I did not share the horror of some of my colleagues because I was not totally in touch with the situation as it affects the people involved. When I made inquiries at various schools &mdash; I visited them recently with the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton &mdash; the one message that kept coming through from the pupils &mdash; not from the parents but presumably the students heard it from their parents &mdash; was that this measure discriminated against them and many of them would not be able to receive a third level education as a result.</P>
      <P>I believe the Government did not realise the effect this measure would have on ordinary people, the disappointment and discomfort it would cause and the fact that they would be deprived of a third level education to which they were entitled.  It will mean that some people will not receive third level education while their colleagues of equal academic merit will.  I believe that the Government, at this stage recognise they made a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello put his finger on it just now when he said that the characteristic attitude of a pragmatic Government, of the kind we have now, to education, as to everything else, is to respond and react in a piecemeal fashion.  One of the most distressing aspects of this measure is that it tells us more about the Government and their attitude to education than anything else.  The Government have no philosophy or commitment to education.  I do not know whether they believe that everybody who is academically qualified <Col N="1992" /> should be entitled to third level education, but this measure would indicate that when they found they did not have enough money to meet the demand for education, they came up with the idea of a means test.  A means test sounds very fair but as it will be applied here, it is very unfair.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly as much as admitted that because he said it only applied to the maintenance element and to new students.  That is an admission that the Government are doing this with great regret, that they do not really want to take this action but are being forced to do it by circumstances.  It shows a lack of an educational philosophy and a lack of a commitment.  It also demonstrates the tendency of the Government to take a shortcut even where education is involved.  It offends the principle of merit in education which is a principle to which all parties in this House would aspire.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister regarding third level education that the Government would seriously review the points system as it exists at the moment and the system of entering third level education.  I know the Minister is said to be setting up a review body, the terms of which I am unaware, but if there were to be a review body on education, the most important thing they should consider is how people enter third level education; whether there is to be a points system, an interview system or what sort of system because the pressures students who sit the leaving certificate suffer today are totally unacceptable.  The system provides us with automatons, robots and people going into university and third level education simply on the basis of points.  Unsuitable people are going into university and doing courses for which they are not suited.</P>
    <P>There are extreme cases where a person could be an absolute genius in one subject such as English and extremely weak in others but because of the fact that they are so weak in these other subjects, although they would star in one particular subject, they will not get into university or any third level college.  The system is totally unfair, not only because it puts <Col N="1993" /> the wrong people in the wrong courses but also because it puts immense pressure on students.  On the basis of one or two hours in their life their whole future is determined.  That is unfair and that is what the Government should look at in the third level education field.  That is desperately important.  It is also important that the grants they give out are channelled into a much fairer system.</P>
    <P>We know the Government are short of money and everybody on this side of the House would sympathise with their plight.  They should consider asking universities who take in foreign students to charge full commercial fees to them. Some of them obviously pay full commercial fees, for example, the College of Surgeons but in some of the universities such as Galway, Dublin, UCD and UCC many of the students benefit from the taxpayer.  I see nothing wrong with that in principle but, as a marketing exercise, it is unnecessary.  We should encourage people from here to go abroad and also encourage people from abroad to come here.  We should not discourage them by making the fees higher but there is no doubt there is an enormous demand from overseas for education in this country and in the UK.  Not only is there a demand for it but people are quite willing to pay for the high level of third level education which we can offer.  Yet, the Government subsidise many of these people to the tune of maybe 60 per cent.  I do not know the figures but a saving could be made in this area by the Government by offering this education to more students from overseas but on a commercial basis. Those places would be taken up fully by foreign students and we would benefit also because our universities and third level institutions would become more cosmopolitan.  The third and final advantage would be that the Irish taxpayer would benefit also.</P>
    <P>I do not share the sentiments expressed by Senator Farrell which sounded to me as being anti-third level education.  It must be acknowledged &mdash; we should all think about this very strongly &mdash; that third level education is not the be-all and the end-all.  It is not necessarily something <Col N="1994" /> to which everybody should aspire. There is no shame or stigma attached to not having a third level education.  Some of the brightest and most successful people in Irish society, in business, journalism and among Irish authors never received a third level education. They did not need it to prove they were successful people.  Senator Farrell was possibly trying to say that.</P>
    <P>We should examine whether we are getting results from these educational establishments.  I do not believe what Senators Mullooly, McKenna and other Government speakers said that the solution lies in setting up a review body. When the Government are in trouble on issues like this, or on any other issue, instead of taking hard decisions they set up a review body to deflect the criticism they receive from the Opposition and the population.  Nowhere have I seen more spontaneous opposition than among the school teachers and schoolchildren to this deplorable suggestion from the Government that ESF grants should be means tested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Senator Ross said in relation to education and third level education.  The Government can claim a very good record and have a very good philosophy in regard to education.  It was this party which under the late Donogh O'Malley brought in effective second level education and made it available to young people.  I agree a great deal needs to be done as regards the stage after that and it may be time for us to look at third level education in a somewhat similar or perhaps more revoluntionary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not altogether disagree with Senator Ross except that I consider continuing education, let us call it third level education, is something all our young people should have available to them. It need not necessarily be an academic education as such.  In fact, the dividing line between what is academic, what is applied and what is vocational is becoming very blurred.  Perhaps we suffer a little in this country from a narrow, restrictive and artificially elitist view of third level <Col N="1995" /> education suffered up to the past few years.  Even now there is still a somewhat narrow and almost snobbish view of third level education.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made regarding the points system.  It is a cruel and inequitable system which masquerades under the name of equity and fairness.  It is indeed an appalling system. Children must go through this dreadful experience at a time in their life when their education should be broadening and when they should be looking forward to developing their personalities.  Instead, they find themselves totally constricted and under pressure because of this appalling bureaucratic system.  It is cruelty beyond description and is not in any way educational or fair.  God help all the students and their parents who have to suffer under this system.</P>
    <P>There should not be any means test for third level education.  I do not agree with the idea that one in any sense, either Government or anyone else, saves money by not expending it on education at third level.  The realities are twofold: one, it is an essential.  We had much discussion today on the expansion of the European Community but we will not be able to play an effective part in that unless our students have an opportunity for further achievement and training in order to realise their full potential.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily have to be a BA in French literature &mdash; I have nothing against that, it is very important in itself but it might equally be two years training in some aspect of aerospace systems or a whole lot of other things.  Equally, if it were a manual trade there is nothing wrong with that.  What is essential is that it enriches the personality of the young person and allows them to play a role in life so that they and the country will be able to compete in what is, like it or not, a very competitive environment.</P>
    <P>It costs far less to have a young person undergo some form of post-secondary training than it does to have the same person unemployed and on the dole and it is an extraordinary shortsighted and narrow view of Government economics <Col N="1996" /> to imagine otherwise.  We are perhaps a little better off than the United Kingdom, as regards education but compared with Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and almost any of the other members of the European Community we have a smaller percentage of people in third level training. This is very much to our disadvantage. If we had even something half-way between our present situation and that of Germany we would, in that process alone, have 50,000 people immediately removed from the dole which would be of great benefit to themselves and to the State.  It would be at lower cost than the present methods of providing social security for them.</P>
    <P>We need to review the area of third level education in a very broad manner, to review the totality of third level opportunities for young people and the number of years they should have the opportunity to stay in training.  That further education is not necessarily a university education. It is not necessarily a regional technical college education.  It may be education in a business school, education in agriculture or a technological education. There are a thousand different methods of expanding the individual personality. Every youngster could benefit by having that opportunity, preferably following what is his or her bent and certainly not doing X, Y or Z because they had the misfortune to obtain a certain number of points.  That system must be looked at, and preferably abolished as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to follow on Senator Ross's point in regard to foreign students. We have in some ways a tremendous opportunity in this country which has only been very slightly tapped at this stage.  We have a very good, well earned and deserved reputation for teaching.  It is something that for one reason or another we seem to take to naturally and students enjoy coming here.  In our economic circumstances, other than for very special cases and it is one good way of helping the developing world, those students should not be a burden on the Irish taxpayer.  They should make some contribution.  There are ample opportunities <Col N="1997" /> for so doing but only a few have as yet been used by our various colleges. One would like to see that greatly expanded.  There is a tremendous and worthwhile opportunity there in which we are both giving and taking at one time. Let us expand the number of foreign students who come here.  They enrich our colleges and educational establishments but they should not be subsidised other than those, perhaps, from developing countries or in very poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an end to means testing for third level students.  I would like to see young people taking it as natural that they would continue in education in one form or another.  It need not necessarily be an academic education and for many students they would be far better off if it were not.</P>
    <P>The other point which I am glad to see was supported by the Minister in January is the opportunity for mature students. There are many people who for one reason or another do not have an opportunity to study at a younger age.  They benefit by doing some work and then come back to study.  We should encourage them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this motion it is relevant to recall the substance of what was said by the Minister for Education in the Dáil on 18 February on a motion on the Government's commitment to education where he gave details of the substantial progress that has been made by this Government in the field of education since 1987.  He pointed out that since that time the underlying theme of positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged has informed Government action in the field of education. This is reflected in the provisions on education in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Positive discrimination is designed to ensure that the benefits of education are distributed equally over all sections of the community rather than compounding the advantage of those who are already privileged. Side-by-side with the equalisation of opportunity, significant steps have <Col N="1998" /> been taken to enhance the quality of education for the benefit of all participants.</P>
      <P>Great advances have been made in facilitating access to education at all levels. It is a measure of our success that 73 per cent of all students complete the senior cycle of second-level education and a major objective of education policy for the 1990s is to bring that up to 90 per cent.  Enrolment in full-time third level education has grown from 21,000 in 1965 to 75,000 in the current year, an increase of 350 per cent over a quarter of a century. A substantial proportion of that increase has taken place since 1987.  A further increase of 15,000 places is projected over the next four to five years.  In a period of less than ten years there will have been an increase of 34,000 students in third level education &mdash; a staggering increase of 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>The projected increase of 15,000 places over the next few years will bring the number of third level places to 90,000. This represents 45 per cent of the relevant age cohort.  A comparison with 24 per cent in Portugal and 30 per cent in Germany will give a clear indication of the enormous financial and logictical demand which we face in providing quality higher education for such a large proportion of our young population.</P>
      <P>Despite the explosion in numbers of full-time third level students more than half of all students at present are in receipt of grants.  The total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State is about £72 million.  The average support per student is £1,900 per annum.</P>
      <P>The massive growth in student numbers is nowhere more evident than in the case of ESF-aided programmes.  In 1986 there were some 10,600 students on ESF-aided third level programmes.  In the programme of support negotiated under the European Community support framework provision for an expansion of the number to 19,600 by 1993 was made.  By 1990 that threshold had been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1990 a further 2,600 students have joined the same programmes for whom no ESF support is available.  The State, therefore, has had to meet the <Col N="1999" /> full costs of these extra students which amounts to £10 million per annum.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that ESF support for the development of human resources in Ireland will be substantially increased from the beginning of 1994 and that it will be extended to courses which have been regarded as ineligible up to now. This will create the possibility of increasing not only the actual numbers of students but also the proportion of students on ESF courses.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of means testing ESF grants which up to now have not been subject to means testing. To this extent ESF grants represent an exception to the general rule because, as Senators know, our national schemes of student support are based on the principle of means testing.</P>
    <P>In a situation of limited financial resources choices have to be made.  The choice facing the Government in this case was to limit the number of students going on ESF courses or to accommodate a greater number by introducing a means test to maintenance grants.  The only equitable solution which does not militate against students from a lower income family is to apply means testing.  Even at that the savings achieved only partly offset the shortfall in ESF funding for the programmes.</P>
    <P>Two things should be clearly understood. First, there will be no change for existing students enrolled on ESF-aided third level courses; and, secondly, all students on these courses will continue to have their tuition fees paid for them, regardless of income.  That is to say, the ESF students will continue to have an advantage over other students since the means testing will apply to maintenance grants only.</P>
    <P>The developments in relation to ESF grants should be seen in the wider context of achieving more places for more and more students in third level education within the constraints of limited funds and a more equitable distribution of the available funds focusing in particular on students from the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The revisions in ESF grants are only <Col N="2000" /> one of a number of measures which have been announced to remedy inequities in existing student support schemes.  They comprise a package of measures and none should be considered in isolation from the others.  The other main features of the package are: the income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education; income eligibility will be assessed on current income rather than as heretofore on the income in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate; mature students who secure a place in a third level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant, mature students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes and, if married, their spouses' incomes rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now; lone parent's welfare payments under the lone parent's allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility and income limits and maintenance grants will be indexed linked in 1992.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it will be obvious that the objective of the measures announced in relation to third level student grants is to achieve absolute equity in the distribution of available funds.  Within these limits the amendments introduced for ESF maintenance grants will ensure that a greater number of students from the lower income families will be enabled to participate in third level education.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the revised arrangements forced on the Government by limited funds protect students from the lower income groups.  I accept there is still a problem for students from middle income groups.  I am conscious of the great financial sacrifices which many parents in these groups make in order to provide the opportunity of third level education for their children.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Minister for Education iniatiated a full review of all aspects of the students support scheme. In announcing the review the Minister clarified its objectives as follows: the <Col N="2001" /> overall aim will be to ensure equity within and between the different schemes and the review will include the removal of any outstanding barriers which may militate against students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  To the extent that it is practical and affordable, it will seek to address the particular financial pressures on students from the lower to middle income families.  In particular, the review will re-examine the financial criteria for eligibility for student grants and develop more equitable means assessment criteria. The same rules must apply to all. The review is well advanced and the Minister expects to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly with a view to introducing major changes in the student support schemes.</P>
    <P>My attention was drawn by a number of Senators to the uncertainty among intending applicants for third level places as to their grant entitlement from next September.  It was pointed out in the Dáil on 18 February by the Minister for Education that he intended to apply a means test to maintenance grants payable to new students on ESF courses from next September.  That decision has been a matter of public knowledge since 18 February.  It is only one element in a comprehensive overhaul of the grant schemes for third level students.  As I have already pointed out, this is a highly complex matter involving a range of other Departments and agencies. However, the Minister hopes to be in a position to publish the amended scheme without further delay.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Senators in the debate to the possibility of postponing the introduction of means testing until September 1993.  Many Senators did not disagree with the motion of means testing.  The application of means testing to ESF grants is only one of a package of amendments to the student support scheme.  I am satisfied that the new scheme is more equitable and designed to facilitate access to third level education by disadvantaged students.  From that equity standpoint, I am sure we would all agree that the earlier the scheme is introduced the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> Reference was also made to the general issue regarding the decision to means test ESF grants.  One point should be made absolutely clear.  The improvement to the income eligibility limits which the Miniser will be introducing shortly will benefit all PAYE workers whether their children apply for places on ESF or non-ESF courses.  I am aware of the public perception that third level grants are available to people outside of the PAYE system who otherwise appear to have substantial means.  The new scheme of grants will tackle that issue.  It will try to ensure that the criteria used to assess income under the new scheme will give a true indication of taxable income for PAYE and non-PAYE taxpayers alike.</P>
    <P>I thank those who contributed tonight to a very informative and interesting debate.  I will most assuredly bring to the attention of the Minister for Education the various points of view put forward and I will also convey to him the best wishes for his speedy recovery expressed by Senators.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Senators wanted to know when the review committee would report and the Minister referred briefly to the substance of what the review committee would address straightaway &mdash; income thresholds and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only Senator with whom I agree is Senator Conroy when he spoke about the importance of education.  It is the great instrument of European union.  All European third level institutions are non-fee paying.  I hope the review committee will explore how best to exploit the funds we will get.  The Minister in Limerick last week referred to the doubling of funds <Col N="2003" /> that will come within the new policy area of education.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the review body referred to in our motion be an expert independent body.  I am not happy with just the Minister for Education and his officials being involved; I hope it will be extended to the social partners in education, representatives of Higher Education Authority institutions, regional and technical colleges, representatives of IVEA, parents, students' unions and teacher bodies.  They are the people best equipped to deal with a comprehensive review of third level education.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna missed the point I was making about bringing equity into the system.  The Clancy report states that the disadvantaged do not have access to the &ldquo;traditional universities&rdquo;; the children of the professional classes and the higher income earners are the main recipients of professional education.  The facts are that children of the lower income groups go to regional technical colleges.  I am not making a division between the status of universities versus a lower status of regional technical colleges. The numbers going to regional technical colleges speak for themselves. We all know these institutions were set up to provide training and expertise in the engineering, high-tech and electronics industries, etc.</P>
    <P>The fact that such colleges have the greatest increase in the number of third level students speaks for itself.  Senator McKenna completely misinterpreted what I said: I said the Minister, by means testing ESF grants, is disadvantaging the already disadvantaged.  The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The £39 per week maintenance given to students is survival money.  Students in regional technical colleges told me it is not drink and cigarette money but bread and butter money.  The introduction of the means test will affect those most in need.  Nothing the Minister said does anything to address that system.  I agree with the increase in the income level of £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level &mdash; we complimented the <Col N="2004" /> Minister when this was announced earlier this year; we welcomed the proposals in relation to income eligibility being assessed on current income; we welcomed the proposals dealing with mature students, lone parents, etc., and the fact that mature students could get a place in a third level institution provided they met the academic requirements and the fact that they would be assessed on their own incomes and not that of their parents.  I do not take issue with any of those points. This is all very positive but it is not enough because the target group Culliton referred to, those who most need qualifications, are being affected and they will continue to be affected.  Nothing that was said here today will change my mind on that.</P>
    <P>I taught in an inner city school where students did not have access to the traditional universities; academically they were qualified to attend but not from a financial viewpoint.  However, the development of the University of Limerick helped because these students could live at home.  Many of these students opt for regional technical colleges but I am afraid that as a result of what is happening now the academically qualfied students will no longer have a choice.</P>
    <P>As Senator Costello said, ESF funding is European money.  I am not saying we do not have a discretion within the principle of a democratic deficit of utilising that money the way we think it should be used but it is not being used the way the students wish and they are outraged. Once again they will be relegated to the dole queues being paid £50 plus social welfare against a £39 grant.  The mathematics are crazy.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, would probably say he inherited this problem but if he were here today, I am sure he would agree to scrap this scheme because it is bringing nothing into the Exchequer.  All it does is to disadvantage the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Maastricht Treaty, hopefully we will have a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.  How shall we use the doubling of funds?  We will be in a dilemma because if we go the European way we may opt for <Col N="2005" /> no fees for any students in line with our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>Outside of the Netherlands, we have the highest participation rate in subdegree education, not &ldquo;sub&rdquo; in the sense of substandard but in the sense of a diploma instead of degree.  This brings me back to the point I was making; students were taking diploma courses because they were provided with the survival money of £39 maintenance and their fees were paid; many of these students could not afford to say on for a degree.  There will be a huge increase this year in the number of second level students who will have access to third level education.  This is marvellous but we should not forget that many thousands of students will have to opt out when they receive their diplomas because they cannot afford to stay on.  They do not get ESF funding after two years.  That is an area we should look at.  European social funding should be provided for third and fourth year students.  We must ensure that a balance is struck between professional and lower grade training, particularly when Europe is the target labour market, and not just Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the importance of flexibility and self-reliance through enterprise training.  This cannot be stressed enough.  There will be a debate we would love to have had within the context of the Green Paper.  It is not something <Col N="2006" /> that should be pushed through post-Maastricht. We need to tease out what best to do with that increased funding. We must address vocational education and bringing equity into the system.</P>
    <P>My last point is very important.  Having a senior civil servant or somebody in the diplomatic corps in Brussels looking after our educational interests is a far cry from establishing a permanent education secretariat in Brussels but if we had we would be in line with the other member countries who have an education secretariat developing the whole area of the curriculum, language and student exchange.  We have a very poor rate of exchange in education and training, particularly in the apprenticeship area to which Senator Conroy referred in the context of the German model.  We must learn from Europe but we are too insular at the moment to do so; we only pick up bits and pieces here and there.  If we had a permanent secretariat there would be a feedback to the social partners and to the independent body which I hope the Minister will set up.  When we come to address the problem of equity in third level education we must ensure that we do not just tinker with the system but overhaul it to the advantage of all students.</P>

      <P>The topic I want to raise this evening arises from the recent decision of the Army authorities that the participation of individual soldiers should no longer be obligatory at church parades.  We may thank the trade union, PDFORRA, whose representations led to this historic decision.  I want to raise an important related matter, that is the presence of Army units of the Regular Army or FCA contingents at religious ceremonies.  I hasten to add I mean religious ceremonies of any denomination but, to be honest, the denominational complexion of this country being what it is, I suppose I am talking for the most part about Roman Catholic ceremonies.  The topic is appropriate in view of the coming Eucharistic procession season, where we regularly see in numerous Corpus Christi processions units of the Army or the FCA acting as escorts to the corps of the religious procession where the clergy carrying the monstrance are frequently flanked by a military unit.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether other variations of this custom have now died out.  People of my vintage and the Minister will remember the sounds and sights of the trumpet fanfare and the flash of swords during the elevation of the Host at the consecration of the Mass and that was an even more incongruous example of the kind of thing I am talking about.  In my native city of Cork the Corpus Christi procession is a big event.  It is interesting that, not for the first time, the Cork Council of Trade Unions had quite a divisive debate about this issue recently. The question was whether the council should be represented collectively or corporately at this religious occasion and strong feelings were expressed.  Some members said they had no objection, others said that as council members they simply did not want to have their presence interpreted as a kind of trade union participation in this procession.</P>
      <P>The Army presence is a more salient example of that same relationship which in my view is unhealthy.  Any State presence as an integral component in a religious ceremony is an unacceptable symbol of Church-State relationship in our secular age.  I am glad it is a secular age because in the long term interests of peace and harmony in this country and of denominational relations we must have a secular State.  Irish Society is now composed not only of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter but of Catholic, Protestant, lapsed Catholic and free thinker.  All are taxpayers and it may no longer be taken for granted that all assent to this close relationship, this historically meshed thread of Church and State.  I think I represent the view of an increasing number of citizens in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be said that the Constitution <Col N="2009" /> lends some vague authority to this custom in Article 44.1 which state:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God.  It shall hold His name in reverence and shall respect and honour religion.</P>
    <P>Frankly, there is no place for such a sentiment in the Constitution; it belongs to a now outdated concept of the confessional state.  Even if we accept this article as a constitutional reality, it is hard too invoke it as a justification for these customs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be excessively rigorous or pedantic about this.  Certain functionaries need to have an <i>aide-de-camp</i> present at a Church religious ceremony and that is accepted.  I am talking about a more fundamental symbolic relationship suggested by the presence of regular Army or FCA units.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read what Alexis de Tocqueville, the celebrated French journalist, philosopher and observer had to say about this when he came to Ireland in 1835.  He came across several bishops who had been in France during the Bourbon restoration and bishops such as Bishop Kinsella of Ossory were appalled that the Bourbons had learned nothing and forgotten nothing, that despite the sore lessons that <i>ancien regime</i> should have taught them about the danger of a relationship between Church and State nonetheless Charles X was still trying to identify Church and State.  Bishop Kinsella of Ossory told de Tocqueville that he had witnessed sentries outside the palace of the Archbishop of Rouen and said that they made people think of the archbishop as the representative of the king rather than as that of Jesus Christ. He witnessed the Corpus Christi procession in the same city as I described it a moment ago; the clergy and host were flanked by lines of soldiers.  The bishop's reflections were, &ldquo;What are these soldiers for?  Who wants a military show as part of a religious feast?&rdquo; So, even from the point of view of religion 170 years ago Catholic bishops were beginning to realise that a close identification of <Col N="2010" /> Church and State was unhealthy and perhaps their present-day successors should take a leaf out of Bishop Kinsella's book.</P>
    <P>That is not our concern here.  Incidentally, a Chathaoirligh, I took the precaution of letting the Department of Defence know earlier this afternoon the subject of this Adjournment debate and the questions I proposed to ask.  My questions are, who requests the involvement of military units as guards of honour at eucharistic processions, which is only an example of something wider, and who authorises the involvement of these military units?  What is the policy of the Department of Defence in this matter? Does it reflect Government policy, and would the Minister agree that these practices should be discontinued forthwith?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>All members of the Defence Forces are given every opportunity and assistance to attend religious services of their choice. Close liaison is maintained by the military authorities at local level with churches of different denominations and there are excellent relations between the Defence Forces and these churches.  Defence Force regulations have provided for many years for guards of honour, escorts of honour or Army bands being made available on certain religious occasions often involving the civilian population.</P>
      <P>Such occasions are relatively few and do not now normally arise in response to specific requests.  In general, these occasions are of a traditional nature and the decision to participate will rest with the local military authorities and will be subject to the exigencies of the service. Military escorts, bands and firing parties are also provided for funerals of deceased members of the Permanent Defence Force of all denominations, as well of course for State funerals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a separate but related matter I should like to comment on, namely, the practice of church parades.  These parades whereby troops march in a body to church have been part of the tradition and ethos of the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State.  In the past soldiers participated in such parades willingly, <Col N="2011" /> and indeed with pride.  Senator Murphy said it was thanks to trade union activity that this practice has been modified or discontinued.  I did some research in my Department and discovered that the Adjutant-General had been researching it for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A post hoc decision but not before it had been considered.  Earlier this year a review of this whole matter was initiated by the military authorities and as a result of this review it was decided that the practice of religious parades should be discontinued except for certain important occasions which will be designated by the military authorities. Examples of such occasions would be the National Day of Commemoration ceremonies held in Kilmainham and the Annual 1916 Commemoration held in Arbour Hill.  On those limited number of occasions on which church parades take place, there will, of course, be no obligation on any member of the Defence Forces to attend a particular religious service.</P>
      <P>I understand that the practice of military personnel being involved in religious ceremonies is the same in foreign armies. I should like to stress, however, that the military authorities will organise such occasions on a strictly voluntary basis in so far as the military personnel are concerned except for essential military ceremonial elements such as bands and guards of honour.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked who requested a military presence and in the body of my statement I indicated that this was a tradition in various local areas, as the Senator himself mentioned.  A military presence is authorised by the local military command and I cannot give a blanket answer to the question of whether they should be discontinued.  I think I covered those points in the substance of my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people would not agree that it is an unhealthy state of affairs, although connecting military matters with religious <Col N="2012" /> matters in the instances given by the Senator would seem to me to be slightly out of kilter.</P>
    <P>The Senator stated that Article 44.1 should have no place in the Constitution but it is in the Constitution and we are committed to observing the Constitution until it is changed.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to our friend de Tocqueville who had some interesting comments to make on this country, to show the difference in interest between the Senator and myself what I remember from de Tocqueville is that he referred to a custom in our taverns whereby if one bought a tankard of ale one could take pheasant, partridge, duck and other fowl for nothing, it being the custom of the kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think de Tocqueville travelled mostly in Leinster which was a very well off part of the country; he would not have received that treatment in Cavan or Cork.  While I thank the Minister for his reply I am not altogether satisfied with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is a hoary chestnut at this stage.  I ask the Minister for Justice to take urgent action to remedy the conditions and policies that give rise to the appalling profile of an Irish prison depicted by the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee in their 1991 report.  The report is as bleak as could possibly be expected from a visiting committee but its bleakness is heightened by the fact that this visiting committee was appointed by the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, largely because he was dissatisfied with a previous visiting committee which produced a couple of hard hitting reports on the prison system and particularly on Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>This visiting committee report is equally hard hitting and describes a prison in a scandalous condition.  I will read the first three paragraphs to indicate the tenor of the report.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison is grossly overcrowded. <Col N="2013" /> The prisoners find themselves in multiple cells contrary to the rules of the Government of Prisons, 1947.  On occasions there are no beds available.  The serious riots during the year were caused primarily by boredom and frustration and by overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Urgent steps should be taken forthwith by the Government to transform the prison system into a dignified rehabilitative centre.  It is essential in this allegedly socially enlightened era.</P>
    <P>Security, control and justice are the vital elements in the prison structure. Security and control are regularly used as excuses for negativing or minimising justice.  They are, in fact, interdependent and justice should be the predominant one.</P>
    <P>There is a rising prison population. The overcrowding of prisons develops inevitably into violence, sexual assaults, riots, drug addiction and episodes of ingrained viciousness.</P>
    <P>Those are the opening paragraphs of the 1991 Mountjoy Prison report and they describe appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>We could see further examples in what has appeared in the course of the year. The report on suicides in Irish prisons showed that the majority of suicides took place in Mountjoy Prison and that we had, in fact, double the English ratio of suicides <i>per capita</i> in prisons, treble that of Scotland and 16 times the rate that exists in the external population.</P>
    <P>The report indicates quite clearly that the vast majority of prisoners do not do any work while in prison, they are not occupied in education, training or in any form of employment.  It indicates that drugs are circulating widely in the prison &mdash; we are talking about illegal drugs &mdash; and expresses considerable concern at this and about the continuing supply of drugs to persons in prison, despite precautions that have been taken.</P>
    <P>The committee are concerned that every prisoner is locked up for at least two-thirds of the day, 16 to 17 hours daily and also, as the report indicated, that they are deprived of privacy by the fact <Col N="2014" /> that they are placed in multiple cells contrary to the rules and regulations of 1947.</P>
    <P>The committee put forward quite a number of specific proposals and I will enumerate a few of them just to give an idea of the proposals and what is possible. It is suggested that each prisoner should be assessed on arrival both in terms of his or her ability to undergo a long period of detention and also in terms of what type of employment or education they should be allotted in the prison.  The committee proposed that judges, prosecuters and defenders should spend at least 24 hours in the prison to see the conditions themselves.  Interestingly enough, there are a few categories of people who are allowed free access to the prisons, High Court judges, Cabinet members and bishops, none of whom seem to have any great desire to visit prisons.</P>
    <P>The committee believe everybody should be allocated some form of employment in the prison, which does not happen now; that alternative methods of maintaining order should be looked at and that a degree of compassion and kindness might not be a bad idea.  The committee talk about the fact that we are the only country in Europe that segregates our HIV positive prisoners and says it is counterproductive because there are at least as many prisoners in the general body of the prison who have the AIDS virus as are in the segregation units which stigmatise the prisoners.  The report indicates that Dr. Fiona Mulcahy is available to attend a clinic in Mountjoy Prison but because the Departments of Health and Justice cannot get their act together she is not able to attend the prison and the prisoners have to be taken out to St. James's Hospital.  It would be easier to attend them in the prison itself.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee in their report ask that there be a special remand centre for prisoners.  At present there is not and, of course, remand prisoners are not convicted.  It is suggested that there should be a limit on the number of prisoners in prison and that we should not allow the prison to become grossly overcrowded; that temporary release is a <Col N="2015" /> worrying aspect of the system and that something should be done about it because people are released in a sort of revolving door system; that there should be greater staff training to come to terms with the complexity of relationship with the prison population; that the visiting committee themselves should meet at least annually and that they should have more effective powers than they have at present.</P>
    <P>In relation to Limerick Prison, there have been serious assaults which are worrying.  An investigation is going on at present.  Where there is a single female prisoner, the Minister is on record as saying that consideration should be given to her with regard to isolation.  Perhaps she should be transferred to the unit in Dublin rather than remaining the single female prisoner in the prison, surrounded by male prisoners.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that Portlaoise Prison is a powder keg at present.  The number of political prisoners has been reduced but there are so many ordinary prisoners they do not have the facilities for recreation or work as have political prisoners.  It is a very dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated in a letter, which the Leader of the House gave to me recently, that he is looking into proposals in relation to prison policy and action to be taken regarding conditions, but he indicates quite clearly he does not envisage any legislative reforms taking place.  That is not a sufficient reply.  Successive Ministers have said they were looking at proposals and would do something about the system, but they stop short of providing a statutory basis.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware that I am proposing a Bill to put before the Seanad. This whole area needs to be looked at and I would like the Minister to accept this Bill as a step towards prison reform. My Bill states it is:</P>
    <P>a Bill entitled an Act to implement the Whitaker Report on the penal system, to provide that sentences of imprisonment shall be imposed only where <Col N="2016" /> necessary; to provide alternative sentences to imprisonment; to establish a Criminal Law Reform Commission; to make provision for the rights and living conditions of prisoners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is really serious, he must first define the sanction of imprisonment, he must look at the prison rules and regulations, he must look at the old 19th century legislation underpinning the prison system, he must look at the report of the 1925 visiting committee and the basis on which it was made, in the context of the criticisms of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee.  He must also look at the possibility of establishing an appeal board in relation to internal disciplinary matters, he must look at the Whitaker Committee and in view of the widespread criticism of the revolving door syndrome, he must look at the possibility of equalising the remission.  At present it stands at one quarter for women and one third for men.  If it were equalised at one third for both men and women, which is the way it is in Britain and in Northern Ireland, there would be better motivation in the prison system and we might get away from the revolving door syndrome which causes problems and natural concern in the community at large.</P>
    <P>I would like in particular, to bring to the attention of the Minister the specific problems that exist in one prison, to indicate that this is not a new matter and to state that we need broad-ranging new policies to address the prison system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, wishes me to announce that he welcomes the Mountjoy Visiting Committee's 1991 report.  The report is a valuable contribution to the whole process of developing a new strategy for the prison service. He is the first Minister who has taken a personal interest in this for quite some time.  As he has already announced, a major policy document is currently being prepared in his Department to update the aims and objectives of the prison <Col N="2017" /> system, to decide on a set of priorities and to set out the strategy to achieve them.  Have no doubt, this Minister for Justice recognises that the prison system requires a new sense of purpose and direction.</P>
      <P>He will not adopt a piecemeal approach to his challenge.  He is preparing the groundwork for a planned and co-ordinated approach to getting it right on prison reform.  It will not happen overnight; we are talking about developing a considered policy to improve the conditions with which prisoners, and indeed prison officers, have to contend.</P>
      <P>Turning to some of the specific issues raised by the visiting committee, on his recent visit to Mountjoy Prison the Minister himself saw at first hand the difficulties under which that prison operates.  In an address to the annual conference of Prison Officers' Associations on 30 April 1992, he spoke of the poor physical conditions, the inadequate infrastructure and the <i>ad hoc</i> facilities there.  It is his expressed intention to improve the facilities throughout the whole prison service.  Mountjoy is one of the oldest of the prisons and, of course, being the only committal prison for adults in the Dublin area, it is the busiest.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to record the work which has been undertaken to improve the physical conditions for offenders in Mountjoy over the past couple of years.  It is as well that it should be put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new electrical system which includes a cell call system, smoke detection and smoke control ventilation has been installed.  A new unit to cater for the special needs of about 60 offenders suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV AIDS, is nearing completion and will be in operation before the end of this year.  Work on the refurbishment of the women's prison is progressing very well and will be completed later this year.  The refurbishment work provides for sanitation facilities in each cell and I regard this as a particularly significant development.  While the work is in progress, the female offenders are being accommodated temporarily in the <Col N="2018" /> newly refurbished D Wing of St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>The existing dilapidated kitchen will be replaced with a modern purpose built kitchen.  This will be tendered for very shortly.  A refurbishment programme which will include the provision of in-cell sanitation and other modern facilities &mdash; I regard that as a top priority &mdash; new workshops where offenders can be provided with the opportunity to acquire a skill to help their rehabilitation into the community on their release, improved visiting facilities, improved recreation and exercise facilities for offenders and improved facilities for the staff.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee referred to the health of prisoners and ensuring proper medical care.  On the recommendations of the Director of Prison Medical Services, additional moneys are being provided this year to augment the standard of medical care.  The additional provision will enable general medical and psychiatric care facilities, including clinical arrangements to be improved.  The number of psychologists for the prison system will be increased from three to six in the immediate future.  Recruitment of the additional psychologists will commence shortly.  The question of the need for further additional psychologists will be kept under constant review by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The lack of training for custodial officers has been commented on by the visiting committee.  A committee comprising departmental and Prison Service staff has examined the range of training which is required to be undertaken and has prioritised a training scheme, having regard to both needs and the financial resources available.  However, a major problem in providing training is the overtime cost of replacing staff who are on training courses.</P>
    <P>The funds available to my Department for overtime working are limited.  Within the available resources every effort will be made to provide development training on the lines recommended by the committee. For instance, the Minister is arranging with the help of the Samaritans, that a two day training course in <Col N="2019" /> suicide awareness will be set up in July of this year.  This will cover the way a prison officer would relate to a distressed prisoner, the importance of active listening, being non-judgmental and non-directive, the stigma of suicide, bereavement, depression, sexuality and young people at risk.  Role plays and dynamic communications will be used to make the skills gained by staff as practicable and as applicable as possible.  This type of course is being incorporated into the induction training for new recruits as and from next month.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee also expressed their concern about overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison.  The Minister is convinced as I am, that imprisonment should be used as a last resort and that alternatives to custody should be applied wherever possible.  At the present time there are over 3,200 offenders serving community based sanctions under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.  That is about one and a half times the number of persons who are actually in custody.  A new system of intensive supervision was introduced last March which provides for the close monitoring and supervision of offenders in the community by the Probation and Welfare Service.  That scheme, when fully operational, will accommodate up to 200 offenders.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on these matters this evening. Obviously in the course of my reply I have only been able to deal with a few of the items that were mentioned in the visiting committee's report.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to improve conditions in Mountjoy Prison.  Many of the prisoners who are accommodated there will see some of those improvements. The Minister intends to pursue a planned strategy for the achievement of stated objectives.  This is a matter of the highest priority for the Department and the Minister has indicated a personal interest in this matter.  He is interested in improving the penal and custodial system.  It is perhaps, the first initiative that has been taken in that area for some <Col N="2020" /> time and some good work is being done there.  More needs to be done.  The Minister is giving it, and will continue to give it his time, effort and energy.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to mention a matter which I raised last week in relation to the Adjournment Debate but, unfortunately, the Department of the Environment saw fit to kick to touch in relation to it.  The Leader of the House knows I am referring to the problem of the water supply to the people of the County and city of Dublin during the summer months.</P>
      <P>Because so many new houses are being built, the demands on the reservoir system are excessive, but nothing has been done to provide a backup water supply.  Water pressure is also a problem in some areas and if there were a fire, water pressure would be dangerously low for fire fighting.  I would ask for a review to ensure the availability of an adequate supply of water all year round to avoid the local authority engineers having to issue warnings during dry spells that water may be cut off or rationed.  That leaves many people in very difficult circumstances. I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment.  I am sure this is not just a south city problem.  I hope he will be as concerned about this as the Members of this House are.</P>

There is something contradictory in having the headquarters of the rural organisations &mdash; Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, as it was, and Teagasc &mdash; based in Dublin city.  As one who comes from Dublin 4, I would <Col N="2021" /> like to see Teagasc move as I did, to the West, and I would suggest a very suitable area where the Department owns plenty of property &mdash; Athenry, County Galway.</P>
      <P>Service jobs are the big growth area in employment and it is very important that the State should follow a comprehensive policy in ensuring that each region gets its fair share of these jobs.  Athenry is more than suitable for such a project because it is on a main rail line to Dublin, it is near main roads and it is near Galway city.  I believe it would be an attractive location for the headquarters of a rurally based organisation.</P>

      <P>I call on the Minister for the Environment to immediately confirm the proposals submitted by Limerick County Council to review speed limits in the county.  These proposals were submitted to the Department of the Environment on 4 March 1991 and, to date, the council has not received approval to the revised speed limits.</P>
      <P>These proposals were submitted after long consideration by the Garda Síochána in County Limerick, by the engineering section of Limerick County Council and by the members of the council who, almost one and a half years ago, adopted the proposals as outlined.  It is difficult to understand why it is necessary in the first place for the Department of the Environment to involve itself in a matter of such local interest when all those concerned on the ground are in favour.  It is much more difficult to understand why a decision cannot be taken by the Department after some 15 months.  If local government is to have any semblance of power, such issues should be decided at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 23 areas require alteration due to changed circumstances.  Many of these are causing extreme concern to the people in the areas.  In one of the villages, Kilcornan, there is extreme concern due <Col N="2022" /> to the increased traffic on the N69, the coast road, and the extreme danger to children entering and leaving the local primary school.  Extensive changes are also required at Abbeyfeale, Adare, Askeaton, Athea, Drumcollogher, Glin, Kilmeady, Pallaskenry, Patrickswell, Rathkeale, Ballylanders, Ballyorgan, Monegay Strand and Tournafulla.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment, without delay, to sanction the requests by Limerick County Council for the above extensions.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to provide access to Lough Doon (Pedlar's Lake) at Conor Pass, Dingle, County Kerry.  This lake is approximately one mile beyond the car park at the top of Conor Pass on the Castlegregory side. It is a sparkling clear seven acre, 10,000 year old corrie lough.  The distance from the carpark is approximately 200 metres and it is a 30 degree climb from a small waterfall at the carpark.</P>
      <P>This lake has always been a popular stopping point for visitors and there is no doubt that it has a high amenity value. It is my opinion that in line with the recommendations of An Foras Forbartha an environmentally friendly footpath should be constructed from the carpark to the lake.  An Foras Forbartha recommended that utilisation could be encouraged by making a rough path into the corrie and describing the area on a plaque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early 1990 the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board, in co-operation with the local Dingle and District Anglers Association stocked the lake with rainbow trout; 2,650 one year old rainbow trout and 74 two year old rainbow trout were put into the lake.  This venture was a great success and over the three month trial period, attracted 428 anglers from all parts of the world &mdash; New Zealand, Hong Kong, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, France, the USA, Germany, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and almost every county in Ireland.  Anglers paid over £3,200 in fishing permits during the <Col N="2023" /> trial period.  However this venture had to be discontinued due to problems of access to the lake and objections from an Taisce.</P>
    <P>I now ask the Minister to provide a couple of thousand pounds to construct this environmentally friendly footpath to the lake and make access easier for those <Col N="2024" /> going to the lake and, in the future, to resurrect the much needed angling facility which was praised by all, except An Taisce and a small number of individuals who were also members of An Taisce.</P>
