      <P>I have notice from Senator Upton that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to clarify the position in relation to the proposal to locate a clinical waste disposal incinerator at St. James's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator E. Ryan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on the grave and unacceptable situation in Thailand.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hussey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to indicate the up to date position regarding the Williamstown sewerage scheme, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal by the Department of Health to situate a central incinerator for the disposal of clinical waste from all Dublin hospitals in St. James's <Col N="1230" /> Hospital, despite the objection of local residents.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding for the Adelaide Hospital; and to ensure that the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital is maintained in the proposed new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Upton, E. Ryan, Hussey, O'Toole and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Upton's and Senator Ryan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    <P>As Senators will have noticed, the motions from Senators Upton and O'Toole are almost identical.  I understand Senator Upton is willing to share his time with Senator O'Toole, I am sure that will be acceptable to Senator O'Toole.  Senators Hussey and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Leader, I wish to refer to the sad death of Mr. James Tully, a former Minister for Defence and Minister for Local Government and, in accordance with the practice of the House as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I will call on the Leader of the House to formally move the motion of sympathy. <Col N="1231" /> I intend calling one Member from each group to formally support that motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to extend sympathy to the family of the late James Tully who held, with distinction, the posts of Minister for Local Government and Minister for Defence.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I extend to the family of the late Mr. James Tully and to the Labour Party our sympathy on the death of a man who was a fine parliamentarian and a very fine public representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to go on a little further and put on record the side of James Tully I knew.  I would like to extend sympathy to his family.  I think most of those who served with him in the Dáil on all sides of the Chamber will admit that he made a wonderful contribution to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention in particular his contribution when the late Séan Dunne asked him to work on behalf of the rural workers &mdash; farm labourers, market gardeners, local, government employees, etc.  He often had to work very late into the night as well as dealing with his Dáil business.  The matters that Jimmy Tully devoted himself to over years involved him in travelling great distances to settle very small problems and then returning to the Dáil to do his business.  When Jimmy was serving in the Dáil as a backbencher he sat hour after hour through all the Estimates and examined every one of them on behalf of the public.  He was a great servant of the public.</P>
      <P>When he was Minister for Local Government there were arguments about the corruption going on at local level. Jimmy Tully established An Bord Pleanála. He took planning out of the political arena.  He was confident that was the correct thing to do in order to prevent corruption.  In his Bill reforming local government he introduced tremendous changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The number of houses that Jimmy Tully caused to be erected, stand on record as being the greatest number in the history of any period of local government. It is not generally known but for about 30 years the urban councils had not permission to build houses.  However, when Jimmy Tully became Minister for Local Government he introduced an Act which allowed the local government people to start building houses again. What has happened to that since is not Jimmy Tully's fault.  May the Lord have mercy on his soul.</P>
    <P>When Jimmy Tully became Minister for Defence he saw the two sides, because at one time he had been a soldier on duty outside Leinster House.  He served in the Fifth Battalion.  It was nice to see him becoming Minister for Defence, and did a very good job in that post also.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, he was a very strong law and order man, but we needed that on occasions.  He was ebullient, but his courage and his compassion were evident at all times.  When you think of a person who can be elected annually on 14 occasions as chairman of a political party, he must have had a lot going for him. Having regard to all his other good attributes, it must go on record that Jimmy Tully was one of the best public servants even in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish just to extend my sympathy to the family and to the party also.  There may have been differences of opinion about some of his decisions in the planning and constituency boundaries area, but it cannot be taken from him that he was a hardworking public representative and a diligent constituency worker who gave himself generously to Irish public life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to extend our sympathy to the Tully family and to the Labour Party on the death of Mr. Tully.  He was a very committed public representative and did his best to fulfil all the tasks and duties required of him.</P>

    <Title>Death of Former Minister. - Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is Item No. 1 until 6 p.m.&mdash; Committee Stage of the Electoral Bill &mdash; and Motion 44 between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House when item No. 5, which has been on the Order Paper for a very long time, will be taken?  Secondly, I am aware that we now have new proposals to have topical debates each week.  Will the Leader of the House tell me when that procedure will commence, because it is very clear that there are a number of major issues which should be discussed, including our preparations for the World Environmental Conference, the problem in Northern Ireland and the changes to the Common Agricultural Policy which are currently being announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House might outline for us the sitting arrangements for the rest of the week.  He should also take the opportunity over the next week or so to indicate the legislative programme for the rest of this session.  As has been referred to by Senator Upton and others over the past number of weeks, part of the new arrangements for the Order of Business, etc. included the taking of topical motions on Thursday afternoon.  That has been neglected over the last number of weeks and I will certainly be demanding it for future weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with the other speakers in asking the Leader to let us know what the position is in relation to the topical items on a Thursday?  When are we going to see these matters being debated?  Would he include the debate on the banks under this heading at the first opportunity &mdash; in other words, tomorrow?  Would it be possible to have a debate on the Ombudsman's report so that we might get a chance to debate the data relating to the continuing problem <Col N="1234" /> with Telecom Éireann and the confrontations with their customers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to indicate when we will debate the Education Bills dealing with the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges?  Perhaps he could tell us also if he has any information in relation to the Green Paper; is it coming in this term or in this year?</P>
      <P>My second question relates to Item 15 &mdash; the Prison Reform Bill.  The week before last I raised this matter and sought to have First Stage moved to the Order of Business.  The Leader's reply was not very satisfactory but he did indicate &mdash; I refer to the Official Report of 6 May &mdash; that he wrote to me regarding the request about the Prison Reform Bill and that the Minister also replied to me.  I got no reply from either person.  I would appreciate it if I could get the grounds for the apparent refusal of the Minister to allow this item to come on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one proposal in regard to the ordering of business which I believe the Leader of the House might perhaps consider favourably. Last week there were quite a number of variations for the Order of Business.  This would be obviated if the Matters of Concern, for which members are allotted two minutes each, were taken immediately after the Order of Business. Perhaps that could be looked into.  I believe it would get away from all the difficulties we had last week.  I formally make this suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to review and it is an ongoing situation that can be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be reviewed in four or five weeks' time to see how that two minute arrangement works out and the associated matters which have not been tried out yet, as far as I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of enforced defections <Col N="1235" /> recently from the other side, these benches are going to get very crowded.  I do not know where we are going to put Senator Hanafin.  If he is good he can sit on Senator Norris's lap, otherwise we have no place for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader of the House any plans to have an early debate on Item No. 7, which is a review of the activities of the European Community for the past four and a half years?  Such a debate is certainly appropriate now with the extraordinary changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the two minutes grievance time, seeing that there are perhaps more than ten Senators involved today, is it possible that there would be some procedure in the near future to have a response to the grievance <Col N="1236" /> time?  It is on at 8.30 p.m.  We came in last week, we said what we had to say and we heard no more.  It is not going to take any of the frustration out of us.  I will not disrupt the Order of Business by saying that my grievance this evening relates to the status of the Seanad.  Will the Leader give me a firm indication when we are going to get the long awaited debate on air transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House agree that it would be timely for this House once again to have a general debate on the health service, but on this occasion to establish how we can establish how we can use the same percentage of GNP&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House not to accept the proposal to change the rules agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, even before they are implemented.  It seems that Senator Norris does not agree that grievance time should be at the end of business because he seems to think he will not get the same publicity he did previously.</P>

      <P>I am looking for some direction from you, a Chathaoirligh.  Item 16, Motion No. 41, on the Order Paper today relates specifically to the Adelaide Hospital. There is a specific motion on the Order of Business in the names of Senators Norris and Ryan, and this item is on the Adjournment today.

      <P>Item 5, the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, will be taken within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>With regard to the topical issues, I am as keen as anybody to implement that particular facet of the reform, but last week we had the Maastricht debate and the debate on the referendum and this week we have the Finance Bill.  Senators will remember that part of the reform was that the legislative programme would always take precedence.  Having said that, I am hoping that over the next couple of weeks we will deal with the Earth Summit, Common Agricultural Policy, air transport and the banks.  I would hope that within the next four weeks we will deal with those four items.</P>
      <P>Regarding the legislative programme, I will come back to Senator O'Toole on that; between now and the end of July and early August we will cover as much of the legislative programme as possible. As regards the letter Senator Costello mentioned, it will be with him today and, hopefully, will give him some idea why the Minister suggested that we wait another while before dealing with that item.</P>
      <P>In regard to the reform, I am pleased that tonight 11 Senators are availing of the time to raise Matters of Concern.  As part of the agreement, we hope to review the reforms at the end of this session, before the summer recess.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5) The Local Elections Acts, 1963 to 1991 and Part II in so far as it <Col N="1239" /> relates to local government electors and Part XXIII in so far as it relates to local elections may be cited together as the Local Elections Acts, 1963 to 1992, and shall be construed together as one Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical amendment.  We are trying to include the Referendum Acts, which are on their way to being signed by the President, for 1992 as distinct from 1991.  Essentially all we are trying to do is to bring it up to date.  It is a simple, straightforward technical amendment and I hope the Minister will be able to accept it.</P>

      <P>This is a technical adjustment to assist the parliamentary draftsman or woman.  The collective citation there &mdash; The Local Elections Acts, 1963 to 1991 &mdash; refers to the existing Acts in place at present, terminating with the Local Government Act, 1991.  Once this Bill is passed, it will be the 1992 Act. What is required is a proper citation that will reflect the addition to what will then be the Local Election Acts, 1963 to 1992.</P>

      <P>I am not absolutely clear on that.  We already have the collective citation, which is the Local Elections Acts, 1963 to 1991.  We will be adding to that a new Act.  At present it is a Bill; but it will be a new Act as of 1992 and it is not part of the existing citation.

      <P>Essentially, this is an old fashioned amendment.  It is that the Act would come into operation as soon as it is passed as distinct from the Act coming into operation when an appropriate order is made by the Minister.  The difficulty in relation to that is, as I understand it, that the Act could be passed and the appropriate order may not be made, which would leave us in a very difficult and ugly political situation.  We wish to avoid the possibility that this Act may become law without making of the appropiate order to bring it into force.</P>

      <P>Section 1 (6) provides for the bringing into operation of the Bill by means of a commencement order or orders to be made by the Minister.  It allows for the entire Bill to be brought into operation at the one time and for different sections of it be be brought into operation on different dates.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to delete subsection (6) which would mean that the Bill would come into operation immediately on its enactment.  A provision along the lines of subsection (6) is a standard provision in major legislation to allow different provisions of the legislation to be brought into operation when suitable circumstances arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of this Bill it is envisaged that the core parts such as those dealing with the conduct of Dáil elections, arrangements for the poll, counting of votes and electoral offences will be commenced as soon as possible After the enactment of the Bill.  However, in the case of certain sections of the Bill it will be essential to have some flexibility in relation to a commencement date.  For example, the Bill proposes a new time <Col N="1241" /> schedule relating to the registration of electors.  This new timetable must be brought into force to coincide with the preparation of the new register.  Otherwise we could have a situation where an election or referendum might have to be held on the basis of a register which is not prepared in accordance with the law then in force.  The possibility of an election or referendum held in such circumstances being challenged in the courts cannot be discounted.  I think, the House will agree that the provisions of subsection (6) are essential to allow the new enactment to be brought into force in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>I ask the Senator not to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's concern and the points he has made to illustrate his argument are quite reasonable. However, this Bill will be an important Bill from a political point of view and the possibility exists that if it became politically expedient the Minister may desist from making the appropriate order to put this Bill into operation.  I can envisage political circumstances where that would be most undesirable and would pose threats to democracy.  I agree with some of the points the Minister has made but some protection should be built in to ensure that when this Bill is passed the key political part will come into force as soon as the measure has been signed by the President.</P>

      <P>I accept the sincerity of the Minister's statement.  Unfortunately, as the Minister said, it is standard practice with all legislation that the making of orders implementing various sections is <Col N="1242" /> left to the discretion of the Minister.  It is bad policy to leave the implementation of a part here and a part there of any legislation to the whim or a Minister.  It may not be the Minister who introduces the Bill.  A Minister may go out of favour, not to mention out of government at any time.  While the present Minister may have the best of intentions, implementation is too important a matter for the Oireachtas to allow it to remain undecided. We should be more circumspect in ensuring that when legislation is passed we have fixed terms for its implementation. While it is valid to argue that certain parts should be implemented at certain times, those could be specified. Here it is left entirely to the whim of the Minister.  That will remain an unsatisfactory situation.</P>

      <P>If the provisions in the Bill governing how behaviour in the vicinity of polling stations will be controlled become law before the next election there will be important financial and electoral considerations concerning the amount of money which will be spent at polling stations, the manner in which political parties will conduct elections and the manner in which resources available to different candidates will be used. If this part of the measure is implemented most political parties will probably spend more time calling directly to their supporters and may lead to different behavour patterns.  That is an important political consideration, especially for parties that may not have much money to spend on polling day.  It will certainly change the rules according to which elections are conducted.  We must not get into a political argy-bargy in relation to the highly sensitive political parts of the Bill which should not be included if they are not going to be implemented immediately on the passing of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is similar to our first amendment seeking to improve a technicality in the substance of the Bill.  We ask the Minister to include the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; and the definition that it means &ldquo;prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.&rdquo;  We have the <Col N="1244" /> interpretations of all other items but not of the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;.  In section 3 it is stated that &ldquo;the Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter...&rdquo;. Section 3 allows the Minister to make regulations but there is no definition of the word &ldquo;prescription&rdquo;.  It would normally appear in the drafting of the Bill and appears to have been overlooked in this case.  I ask the Minister to include an interpretation of the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; in the Order which is an additional to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert in the interpretations section of the Bill a definition of the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; as used in the Bill.  A definition of this kind is normal and will, I believe, be found in most, if not all of our electoral codes.  The definition proposed is a standard one and I have no problem with it.  However, the provision is unnecessary in this Bill.  The expression &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; standing alone, is not used in the Bill.  I refer, for example, to section 46 (2) on page 38 where it says that the nomination paper shall be in the form prescribed by the regulations made by the Minister.  Instead of referring to the prescribed form the manner in which the form will be prescribed is spelled out.  As the provision provided for in this amendment is unnecessary the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Every order made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> This amendment proposes that every order be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 1 (7) states: &ldquo;An order made under subsection (6) shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after it is made&rdquo;.  That should apply to all orders and not only to certain orders as in section 1 (7).  In section 8 (6) (b) there is a proposal that the draft order be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>This Bill prescribes two different practices for the laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In one instance the order is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and in another instance we only get an opportunity of perusing the draft order without seeing the final order. In the interest of synchronising policy and practice we should have a uniform approach as contained in our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section to provide for the laying of every order made under this Bill before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  While such a provision is standard in most legislation, it would be inappropriate in this Bill.  Section 3 already provides for the laying of regulations before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  In the case of orders to be made under this Bill, the individual sections specify the procedure to be adopted in relation to the making and publication of the order. It is not necessary to proceed with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a satisfactory reply because it does not address the point I made.  Two different sorts of practices have been adopted and while both are described it does not mean that one is correct and the other not.  I am asking for a standard practice in relation to all orders made under this legislation and I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to grant that.  Final orders are published and made available to the <Col N="1246" /> public.  It would seem from the Bill that we are only going to get the final form of some orders and the draft form of others without an opportunity to see the final form before publication.  That is not good enough for the Oireachtas.  The Minister should standardise the manner in which every order will be laid before this House so that we will see each in its final form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The more important orders will be made in draft and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  For example, section 8 provides that an order relating to the extension of voting rights at a Dáil election to citizens of a member state of the EC resident here must be approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas before being made.  In the case of an order made by the Minister under section 165 in relation to an emergency or special difficulty in relation to registration of electors or the conduct of an election, it is provided that the order should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and may be annulled by either House.  In the case of an order appointing polling day under section 96, the order must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as may be after it is made.  It goes without saying that it would not be appropriate that such an order should be annulled by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas.  In the case of a general election, of course, the Dáil would already have been dissolved.  As the provision proposed for insertion by this amendment is unnecessary I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern arose while perusing section 8 and examining the manner in which draft orders will be laid before each House.  I wondered why the final order could not be laid before each House and whether that was a textual error and if the intention was that the draft order would be discussed by the House because it was so important but that the final order should then be presented to the House.  I am not sure the Minister has covered that situation. He referred to a section where it is stated <Col N="1247" /> that the order should be published as soon as possible but that does not cover the entirety of orders.  My concern is with the draft orders.  We should have a single standard practice for dealing with all orders that arise under this legislation.</P>

      <P>If the final order is approved in draft form it remains a draft statement; we do not have an official order.  When that order is published as a statutory instrument, it is available in the Government Publications Office and to libraries.  We are talking about procedure when we talk about a draft order; we are not talking about the final product.  I am concerned that final orders may be available to the public at the same time as they are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in final form.</P>

      <P>In the Bill orders are graded according to importance.  The most important require prior approval and less important are laid before the Houses and may be annulled.  The less important orders are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It is clear that procedures are being adhered to as heretofore.  We are spending time on an unnecessary amendment. The regulations are clearly laid down and procedures are being adhered to.  The important sections are being covered <Col N="1248" /> here and the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied.  I accept the Minister's point that he is making a distinction between two types of orders.  He is saying that the order indicated in section 1(7) is a minor order but in that section there are many important orders to be made.  Therefore, because it is designated a minor order it will not appear in a draft form for debate. Then he says that major orders will appear in draft form for debate.  In one case the final order is going to be put before this House and in another we will have only the draft order.  We should take two procedures, one, where we debate the draft order and, two, where the final order is laid before the House for perusal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 39 and 40, and substitute the following definition&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;elector&rsquo; means, as the context may require, a presidential elector, a local government elector, a Dáil elector or a European elector;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With all of these amendments my purpose is the same.  Since they are a symbolic gesture and are not of great importance I hope the Minister will accept them.  I ask that when the Minister mentions presidential, Dáil, European or local government elector that he gives more status to the local government elector. The same principle informs the other amendments so I will speak on them all at the same time.</P>
      <P>I believe, as I am sure the Minister believes, our Constitution's words, that power comes from the people.  The people are all-important and the authority nearest to the people is the local authority whether county council, urban district council or whatever.  It is to local authorities that people in the first instance cede their power.  They ask the local authority to carry out certain functions when they elect representatives to it.  Functions may include the provision of street lighting or the running of the local park.  The national Parliament, while important, is undoubtedly further removed from the people.</P>
      <P>I have put the presidential elector first because the President is the head of State and is all-important.  The head of State, in my reckoning, is not included with the Dáil, European and local government categories of elector.  I object to the fact that the European elector is mentioned before the local elector.  Local authorities were there long before the European Parliament was ever thought of; my local authority dates back to the 12th century and to denigrate them to the lowest position is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians from time to time speak of power devolving to local authorities.  To devolve means to hand down.  These politicians <Col N="1250" /> feel that power belongs to them and gratuitously they will hand it down to a lower level.  That is not the way I see it.  Power belongs to the people who freely elect local authority members or members at national level and give them power to carry out certain functions for them.  I dislike the word &ldquo;devolving&rdquo; and never use it because it contains an unjust implication.</P>
    <P>No other country in western Europe is as arrogant as ours or treats local democracy with such contempt.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto promised better local government and better national government and therefore the Minister should accede to my request.  It is symbolic and not of great significance but it would indicate that the Minister thinks more of local authorities than he appears to at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments is to change the order in which reference is made to the various categories of electors in Part II of the Bill.  The objective is to place references to local government electors ahead of references to Dáil electors and European electors.  The Bill provides for four categories of electors &mdash; presidential, Dáil, European and local government.  These are referred to in ascending order of size commencing with presidential electors, the smallest category consisting of Irish citizens only and ending with local government electors which include all residents irrespective of nationality and citizenship.  The order in which reference is made to these parties was selected by the parliamentary draftsmen. It is a clear and logical order and <Col N="1251" /> there seems to be no practical reason we should depart from it.</P>
    <P>In an Act of the Oireachtas the meaning of a provision is not affected by its position in the statute.  Placing a provision before or after does not add to or detract from the meaning or the effect of the provision.  The draftsman seeks to follow an order which is logical, consistent and convenient.  The statute is a severely practical document.  Its purpose is to set out the intentions of the Oireachtas, in plain language.  It does not and cannot concern itself with signals, images or prestige.  The effect of the amendments would be purely cosmetic. They would make no change in substance, they would not clarify meaning in any way and would replace a clear logical order by one which does not seem to have any obvious logical base.</P>

    <P>In page 14, to delete lines 39 and 40, and substitute the following definition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;elector&rsquo; means, as the context may require, a presidential elector, a local government elector, a Dáil elector or a European elector;&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If local government and local democracy are so close to the Minister's heart, perhaps he could adopt the order I have requested.  As he said, this is not of momentous importance.  I do not understand his objection to my request.  He has said it will not add or subtract anything.  It would be consistent with views expressed by some of the Minister's colleagues &mdash; that they have a real commitment to local democracy, subsidiarity, etc.  When it comes to something like this, acceptance of the change of order would be a gesture of some concern and interest in local democracy. Local authorities were there long before central Government.  The majority of <Col N="1253" /> people in this country feel their local authority is of far more importance and concern to them than the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire faoi rud a bhaineann leis seo ach nach bhfuil tagairt ann dó in aon chor.  Tá Acht ann ar a dtugtar Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta agus is toghchán áitiúil é sin faoi Acht 1979.  Níl sé luaite anseo, a bheag ná a mhór, agus, dar liomsa,, ba chóir go mbeadh sé ann.  Ní rachaidh mé chomh fada leis an Seanadóir Hederman nuair a deir sí go gcaithfidh sé bheith chun tosaigh nó i lár báire; bheinn sásta fiú dá mbeadh sé istigh ag an deireadh.  Is Acht é a d'eascair as Rialtas agus parlaimint an Tí seo.  Bíonn toghcháin ann faoin Acht seo sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fad gach cúigiú bliain, díreach ar nós na dtoghchán áitiúil.  Ach, mar a dúirt mé, níl tada ráite faoi anseo. Ceapaim go ndearnadh dearmad gan tagairt a dhéanamh dó anseo agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé istigh leis an liosta anseo faoi thoghcháin le haghaidh na Dála agus na hEorpa.  Ba mhaith liom tuairim an Aire a fháil faoi ar chóir go mbeadh aitheantas dlíthiúil le fáil ag Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an gcaoi chéanna le gach Acht eile?</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. Order is important; it is important to have logic in the order of the electorate to the representatives bodies referred to here.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the order being presented by the Independent Senators, the order in the Bill cannot be correct because it lists the presidential elector first, then a Dáil elector, followed by a European elector and, finally, a local government elector.  If there was logic in the order, it would begin with the basic element of democracy, which is local government, followed by the national government and then the European Union.  European elections should not be in the middle.  If we see local government as the pillar of democracy, that should be given first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we applied this order to the Members <Col N="1254" /> of the Houses of the Oireachtas, people would look askance if, at a civic reception, Ministers were placed at the end of the line; and Ministers might not be too happy with that order.  Whatever criteria we use, we need to use a certain degree of logic and ensure that the fundamental element of democracy is given priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are interesting.  The Bill makes provision for presidential elections, then elections to the Dáil, then Europe, and finally county councils.  Senator Costello spoke about the scene at home.  At a State reception, for example, you have the President, the Taoiseach, the Cabinet Ministers and then the chairmen of the county councils. In my book, while being a committed European, I must acknowledge that those involved in the EC came on the scene only recently.  Nobody should be foolish enough to think that members of local authorities are not national politicians.  Perhaps the draftsman does not have a poitical outlook or lacks respect, otherwise why does the Bill refer to the national scene, then to Europe, and then back again to the national scene?  Why does it not refer to local government before Europe?  I am sure the Minister will not accept this amendment but I would like to fire a warning shot; the draftsman should take note of what is said here about the important role of local government and local elected representatives.</P>

The section gives us some deep insight into the psychological processes of the person who drafted it but, other than that, there is nothing of significance involved.

      <P>To answer Senator Ó Foighil's question first. Údarás na Gaeltachta elections are covered by a separate code and there is reference, in page 87 of the Bill, to Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>In relation to the order of the categories of elector, for presidential and referendum votes, Irish citizens only are entitled to vote.  For Dáil elections Irish citizens and British citizens are allowed to vote because we have a reciprocal arrangement where the Irish in Britain are allowed to participate in elections there.  In European elections Irish citizens and nationals of EC countries are allowed to vote and in local government elections all residents, irrespective of nationality or citizenship, have a right to vote.  I accept the points made but I stress that there is no slight intended here.  It is a logical order in relation to the size of the vote at the appropriate time.  For that and for no other reason it has been laid out in this fashion.  It is no reflection on local government, quite the opposite.  As I have outlined, the order relates to numbers only.</P>

Rather than stress this amendment I would be prepared to compromise if the Minister is prepared to go along with Senator Honan's suggestion referring to presidential, Dáil, local government and finally European elections.</P>

Níl sé luaite ach amháin mar reference.  Is é an pointe atá á dhéanamh agam ná go mba chóir go mbeadh sé ráite i leith toghcháin oifigiúla Stáit.  Bíonn toghcháin ann le haghaidh Uachtaráin, na Dála, na gcomhairlí contae, na gcoimisineirí baile agus comhairleoirí baile, agus chomh maith leis sin bíonn toghcháin ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoi Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, agus níl sé luaite ann.

      <P>There have been recent occasions in this House when a Minister has accepted reasonable amendments from the Independent, if not the Opposition, benches.  It saddens me to see such inflexibility again being displayed on the Government benches. Senator Hederman obviously feels very strongly about this issue.  She has received support from many sections of the House.  She has now suggested a compromise which is extremely reasonable, and the only conclusion I can draw is that the Minister has not the power to accept her amendment, that his instructions are to accept no amendment.  That is a grievous pity and shows a return to that old-fashioned rigidity and inflexibility <Col N="1257" /> from which I thought we were getting away.</P>

      <P>I am sorry we are on a collision course here, especially as it is unnecessary.  I have been reasonable in outlining very clearly the reason for the order of the different categories who are entitled to vote.  It would be a pity if we were to divide on this because it is no reflection on local government &mdash; an area to which I am very committed.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Murphy.  The Minister is displaying a degree of rigidity which is unnecessary. When the Environmental Agency Bill was going through this House a similar type of rigidity was expressed by the Minister and good amendments were not accepted.  Similar amendments, almost word for word, were put down in the Lower House and they were accepted by the Minister.  To my mind, that showed the Government have a mental block when it comes to accepting amendments in this House, even where the Bill has been initiated here.</P>
      <P>We are at the beginning of the Committee Stage of this Bill which was initiated here.  It would be terrible to see if the Minister refused to accept amendments here but accepted similar amendments in the other House.  I am not saying the Minister will do anything of the sort, but it is a very distasteful practice and implies that Ministers do not respect this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has adverted to and <Col N="1258" /> adhered to a certain logic, but I do not think that logic is any more valid than that expressed by Senator Hederman.  If you take the electorate with the lower number, Irish citizens alone, and work your way up through Irish and British nationals.  Irish and European nationals and then all citizens, the reverse order is equally logical.  This would be in line with the need to underpin local democracy as the pillar of our society.  I do not see why the Minister has to be rigid about this matter.</P>

Tá chuile shórt ráite faoi chomhairleoirí contae agus baile, choimisinéirí baile, srl, agus ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta mar chuid den chomhdhéanamh seo ó thaobh rialtais áitiúil de.  Tá Acht ann, atá níos láidre ná aon rud anseo, faoinar cuireadh Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun i 1979, agus, i gcead don Aire Stáit, ní féidir liom glacadh leis nach bhfuil sé luaite anseo mar cheann de na toghlaigh faoi mar atá chuile cheann faoin Stát luaite anseo.</P>

      <P>I am not going to press this point.  As other speakers have said, it is a great pity the Minister could not show a little flexibility in this area. He could give a boost to local democracy without losing one milligram of power. That is what it is all about; it is about holding on to power.  There is no local democracy because those at the top will not cede even a little power.  They want to keep it to themselves.  The Minister and his side have lost an opportunity to make a gesture without losing any power but obviously they are not prepared to <Col N="1259" /> do so.  I will not push the matter any further.  It is yet another little knock for local authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), line 24, to delete &ldquo;was, on the qualifying date&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially this amendment is designed to deal with the issue of the definite qualifying date, which I understand is 1 September at present.  If somebody happens to be 18 years of age on 2 September they simply will not be qualified to vote. Regardless of when the election is held these people will not be able to get themselves registered and, accordingly, they will not be able to go out and exercise the franchise.  That is a matter of considerable frustration particularly for young people and indeed for their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who has been involved in politics knows only too well the unacceptably <Col N="1260" /> high proportion of people you meet during election times who are very frustrated because they are not able to go out and have their say in who gets into power in this country.  People who are not 18 years of age on the qualifying date are excluded, regardless of when the election is held.  We are suggesting that the reference to the qualifying date would be deleted and that flexibility would then enter into the system.  People who are 18 years of age at election time could be on the register and be allowed to have their say in how the country is run.  That is particularly appropriate, given the large numbers of young people who are coming up to voting age.</P>
    <P>It is also very important, given the amount of lip service we pay to the rights and needs of young people and it is very hard to reconcile that with the fact that some young people may be almost 19 years of age and still not able to cast their vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment.  According to the Second Schedule, page 100, the qualifying date for registering is 1 September and the date in which the register comes into force is 15 February.  If somebody becomes 18 on 2 September they have to wait 12 months before they are entitled to go on the register and then the register does not come into force until 15 February. In other words almost 18 months will expire before that person is entered on the register.  That is an unacceptable length of time for a young person to be denied their franchise.  It behoves us to ensure that our procedure does not disenfranchise anyone for 18 months.  Our amendment covers that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the qualifying date deleted so that anybody who has reached the age of 18 is entitled to vote.  That is important.  If a person has reached the age of 18 he or she should be entitled to vote; that is the principle of my amendment.  By the procedures we have adopted, people could be over 19 years before they could vote.  We should be able to insert the date of birth on the register of electors.  As <Col N="1261" /> well as having young people on the register from the qualifying date there should also be a list of names marked with an asterisk where the date of birth is given so that if an election takes place during that limbo period of 18 months it will be up to those in charge of the register to inspect it and allow the person to vote if his or her birthday has fallen during that time.  This would allow greater participation by a younger electorate in exercising their franchise.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment in the hope that he would allow an increase in the number of people entitled to vote in an election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed in this amendment and I appeal to the Minister to take them on board because the purpose of compiling a register and preparing a list of electors should be to ensure that everybody who is over 18 years should have the opportunity to vote.  Anybody who has reached the age of 18 should be included on the supplementary register.  The purpose should be to ensure that the maximum number of the electorate can vote at any given time in an election and that, as far as possible, the maximum number of people should be registered.  Therefore, the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill relate to the registration of presidential electors and Dáil electors.  The sections as drafted provide that the citizenship and residence requirements for the registration of presidential and Dáil electors, respectively, is determined by reference to the qualifying date for the register.  The Second Schedule provides that the qualifying date would be 1 September of the year preceding the coming into operation of the register.  Each register will come into operation on 15 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments propose to remove the reference in sections 7 and 8 to the qualifying date.  The effect of the amendments would seem to be that there would be continuous registration.  The <Col N="1262" /> registration authority would be obliged to register each person as soon as he or she satisfies the registration requirements even if that happened to be the actual polling date of the election.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 9 repeat the corresponding provisions of existing law. Our electoral arrangements are based on the idea of a final and conclusive register of electors.  There is a standing register, prepared by reference to the specified date.  It comes into force on a prescribed date, remains in force for a fixed term and is used at every election and referendum taking place during that year.  This arrangement is essential in our situation where the Constitution allows the Dáil to be dissolved at any time and requires the general election to be completed within 30 days of dissolution.  In this situation a register which is specifically prepared for an election or which is continuously updated is simply not possible.  Therefore, it would be very difficult to implement what the Senator proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that argument. Everybody knows the date of their birthday and the majority of young people believe they are entitled to vote and that all they have to do is turn up at the polling booth once they have reached the age of 18.  We should facilitate them in whatever way we can.  Our job as legislators is to ensure that there is maximum implementation, operation and participation in democracy and if we can facilitate that we should.  What my amendment proposes will involve continuous registration but I do not see that as a problem.  If a person had not reached the age of 18 at a certain time but does so after a week, a month, six months or 12 months, the qualifying date does not allow for that because we specify it as 1 September.  That means people born on 2 September have to wait one year before they can be considered for inclusion in the next election and then they have to wait until 15 February for their names to be put on the register, almost 18 months. It is not good enough for us to say that it poses problems, there is a way in which <Col N="1263" /> the Minister may, by order, regulate the matter if a person wishes.</P>
      <P>In compiling the initial electoral register people could fill in their date of birth and that could be transferred to the final register so that, automatically, anybody in charge of the register at a polling station can see their date of birth.  There are many special categories of people on a register, people who can vote in one election but who cannot vote in another, special voters and so on.  Why can we not introduce another category?  This other category would include people whose birthday falls within the time schedule of the compilation of the register, which is up to 17½ months.  It is possible to do that. The Minister may not have considered this to the same extent as we have in putting forward the amendment, but he is not able to give us a definite answer now he should not rule it out because it is too important.  He should consider it and come back to us on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point in regard to an ongoing register. To put into practice Senator Costello's point, the date of birth would have to be registered in the voters' register and if an election took place before that date they would not be able to vote, but if it took place after that date they would be able to vote.  I agree with the Minister that it would be an ongoing register.  It would be very difficult to work it in practice. However, at present people believe they can vote when they are 18.  I have five children over 18 who thought they could vote when they reached 18 but many people may be 19½ before they are entitled to vote.  Would it be possible for people to be on the register if their birthday fell before the date on which the register came into operation, which is 15 February?  If a person's birthday falls between 1 September and 15 February, it is possible that his or her name could go on the register because that register would not be coming into force until 15 February?  That would mean that if somebody's birthday was on 14 February they would be entitled to vote, but if it was on <Col N="1264" /> 16 February they would not be entered on the register and would have to wait for a full year.  However, under this system they must wait for nearly 18 months.  Can that anomaly be considered? We are wasting our time if the Minister is happy that some people are virtually 19½ years of age before they can vote, but if he is not happy about it, we are putting forward various proposals for his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to show some flexibility here.  I do not accept his suggestion that it would not be feasible to have people registering right up to polling day.  It would be easy enough to cope with this; 50,000 to 70,000 people are born here each year, an average of 1,000 people each week.  If you take the 50 constituencies and divide them by 50, 20 people will be eligible to register during the last week of an election campaign.  State agencies should be able to cope with those numbers and they can also verify if those people are telling the truth because there are ways and means of checking their dates of birth. On average, for each constituency, one is talking in terms of 20 or 30 people requiring to be registered.  Even if it were 100 people, it would be a very small burden on those who administer the election process on polling day.  For each table in a polling booth, one might be talking about a maximum of three, four or five people who might present a difficulty as a result of their birthday falling in the week preceding an election.  As I said, the numbers involved are very small and given existing technology, I see no reason for the Minister not accepting this amendment and using imagination to solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello made an excellent point regarding people who have just come on the register, that their date of birth which could be indexed by month and checked on polling day.  Alternatively, some other form of indexation could be introduced.  With a little imagination and flexibility, it should be feasible to allow everybody over the age of 18 the right to vote.  Senator Hederman is <Col N="1265" /> correct when she says that when people reach the age of 18 they simply assume they will be able to vote in the next election. I am sure everyone in this House has met people who are not on the register and who are exceptionally annoyed and upset because of that.  The reality is that we must tell them there is not a single thing that can be done for them.  I hope the Minster will show some flexibility and produce a system which will allow people to cast their vote on reaching the age of 18.</P>

      <P>The amendment will not secure the end it seeks to achieve.  The qualifying date in sections 7 and 8 relates to residence and citizenship.  The question of age is dealt with in rule 1, paragraph (3) of the Second Schedule on page 100.  Up to 15 February any person of 18 years of age will be entitled to register. It is not correct to say that one could wait a year and a half before being able to register, 15 February will be the date when a person can register in order to be eligible to vote.  The amendment will not achieve what Senators want here.  In fact we should deal with this later in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying date for a register shall be the first day of September in the year preceding the year in which the register comes into force.  The 15th day of February in the year in which a register comes into force shall be the date by reference to which a person's age shall be taken for the purposes of sections 7 to 10.  I cannot see the Minister's point in this respect.  I still think our point is valid.  If somebody's 18th birthday falls after 1 September &mdash; he/she cannot be on the register for February and must wait until the following September and they are automatically registered the following February.  As I see it, months will elapse before that person becomes entitled to register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that the amendment will not secure this, but that is a matter for regulation.  We want to ensure that everybody who has reached the age of 18 years will, in fact, be able to vote. That is the law, that is the principle, it is <Col N="1266" /> stated in the Constitution and all we are governed by is a qualifying date the law regulates.  We are seeking to regulate it in a different way so that we will acknowledge the basic principle in regard to a young person reaching the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily saying the Minister must accept this amendment.  What I am saying is that we will not press the amendment if he is prepared to accept the priciple of what we are saying to ensure the maximum of enfranchisement for young people who will otherwise be left in limbo between one registration period and the next, with the result that they might lose not only 17½ months but, if an election was held, the period until the next election.  Therefore, a young person might be 22 or 23 years old before he or she could vote.</P>
    <P>We offered a reasonable way of providing a regulation for this, where we established a certain category within the register of elections that would enable each person whose birthday falls after the qualifying date, but before the register comes out, to be indexed from their birthday so that when the election takes place all that will need to be done when they arrive at the polling station is to check their birth date.  They should then automatically be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>The Minister may suggest another way of doing this, but this is one way of doing it.  This is a matter for regulation but we would like to underline the basic principle that everybody who has reached the age of 18 years should be allowed to vote and we should ensure, especially with modern technology, that every facility is made available so that they can participate in an election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what Senator Costello is attempting to do.  He said that if somebody has not reached the age on 2 September they cannot be on the register.  That is not my reading of the Bill.  I understand that 1 September has more to do with the residence of the person and that the following 15 February is the important date.  That does not seem to be appreciated by Senator <Col N="1267" /> Costello.  It is important and I hope I am not reading it wrongly.  If that is the position, I believe it is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused about this and perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.  My understanding of the matter is the same as Senator Costello's, that if you are 18 years of age and an Irish citizen resident at a certain location on 1 September, you are entitled to be on the register; otherwise you are not entitled to be on it.  It is ridiculous to think that a person who is 18 years of age in the first week of September will not have the privilege of voting until 15 February, a year and five months later.  If the position is as the last speaker stated, then it shortens the period somewhat, but in my view it does not shorten it enough. A supplementary list should come into operation half-way through the period to permit 18-year-olds to vote.  Casting the vote gives young people a feeling of status, a feeling of belonging in the community. I accept it is something one does in a few minutes but it means a great deal to most people, irrespective of their ages. Therefore, every effort should be made to shorten that period.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether the impression we have on this side of the House and the impression Fianna Fáil Senators seem to have is correct because, if so, it is certainly far too long.  If a person can register on 1 September and attains 18 years of age at Christmas, in January or up to 15 February when the register comes into operation, it is somewhat better than it was but it could still be shortened by bringing in a supplementary register to facilitate those people.  In my view, it would be worthwhile to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate on this matter because I agree with what Senator Finneran said.  The date of 1 September has nothing whatsoever to do with the registration, it relates to residency and one is eligible to register up to 15 February.  I appreciate the concern of the Senators on the other <Col N="1268" /> side.  The difficulty in trying to streamline this registration is to know at what point to stop.  There has to be a cut-off point at which it is feasible and reasonable to expect that a register would be prepared. If it is left open-ended the opportunity is provided whereby people can register right up to polling day.  That would not be practical; notwithstanding all the regulations and streamlining procedures in place at present, there are still many problems caused by people impersonating others on polling day.  If it is left open for people to register right up to polling day, I would be fearful of the consequences.  There would be absolute chaos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment if he wishes to get the best possible results from this Bill.  Take, for example, a person who reached the age of 18 on 1 February and there is an election the following January; if he or she is not 18 years on 1 February that person does not have a vote.  In effect, that person is deprived of a vote for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>In the case of a local election, regarding which everybody knows the date six months in advance &mdash; any local elections I recall were held in the month of June &mdash; why not update the register on 1 June so that anybody who would be 18 years of age on 1 June in the year of local elections would be added to the supplementary register?  This should be feasible.</P>
      <P>The same procedure could apply to presidential and European elections.  We know the approximate date of the next European elections which will take place in two years' time.  I do not see anything wrong with the supplementary register including the names of those who were 18 years of age on 1 June of that year. There should not be any great difficulty with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our aim in this Bill should be to ensure that on the day of an election the maximum number of people will be able to vote.  If the Minister accepts this amendment it will help to achieve this <Col N="1269" /> aim.  As Senator McMahon said, the fact that young people have a vote, that they can cast a vote which reflects their views on who they elect to the local authority, to Europe, to Dáil elections, county council elections or presidential elections, gives them a sense of status.  I appeal to the Minister, in the spirit in which the Members from this side of the House put down this amendment, to accept it so that on the day of an election we can give the maximum number of people the opportunity of voting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last few points made by Senator Naughten.  I do not see why a register cannot be prepared once people reach the age of 17 in anticipation of their being 18 on election day. This would only necessitate the preparation of a register and having each person's date of birth entered on it once they become 18 years of age.  If you work out the figures for each constituency, you are talking of approximately 1,000 people who would become 18 years of age during a full year and during the period of an election.  It would be a small number, perhaps 100 people.  I see no reason that cannot be done.  In other words, prepare a register specific to people who will reach 18 during the forthcoming year, enter their date of birth beside their name on the register and on the day of an election, simply consult the register to ensure that they qualify to vote.  I do not see any difficulty in solving this problem if we use some imagination but our present policy in this matter is, in the European jargon, a very significant democratic deficit in relation to large numbers of young people.</P>

      <P>We are unnecessarily at cross purposes here.  The amendment has nothing whatsoever to do with age.  I repeat the any person who is 18 years of age on 15 April will be entitled to vote in subsequent elections.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 relate to citizens and have nothing whatsoever to do with age.  We are ahead of our time because on page 100, as I have already mentioned, the Second Schedule covers the points made by the Senators. <Col N="1270" /> Therefore, the amendment is not in order because it refers to a different matter.  It has nothing to do with age and the points made by the Senators are covered later in the Bill.  Senator McMahon may not have been present when I said that earlier. The points he made are covered in subsection (3) on page 100 of the Second Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has answered my question.  The Second Schedule clarifies that the qualifying date for somebody to be registered is 1 September.  The second criterion is that their name be on the register by 15 February.  We have got both obstacles to people being on the register.  However, another obstacle remains no matter how we look at it, whether a person reaches the qualifying date or whether he is a citizen or not.  Let us take the example of a person who has reached the age of 18 years and, under the Constitution, is entitled to a vote.  Under the system we have introduced they have to be 18 years old and on that register before 15 February. If not, they have to wait 12 months.  We still have to do something about that.</P>
      <P>The Second Schedule does not resolve that problem: it merely establishes the criteria for drawing up regulations.  Will the young people in the Chamber today be able to vote in a year or two?  Should be disenfranchise them for a further 12 months?  I am sure they expect that once they reach the age of 18 they will be automatically entitled to vote.  How are they to find out that, because they did not reach the age of 18 by a certain date they cannot vote for another 12 months? If there is an election in that 12 month period they will not vote until the election after that, and, in the meantime, three, four or five years may have elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is eminently reasonable that we look at the position that has been enunciated here.  There have been a number of <Col N="1271" /> suggestions made that we anticipate local elections.  We know what year and month they take place.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator Costello in putting down the amendment was hoping to confuse this Seanad, but by his contribution here today he is attempting to confuse the Seanad.  His amendment has nothing to do with age; his amendment has to do with residency.  Let us go through it for a second.  He is asking to delete &ldquo;was, on the qualifying date&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is&rdquo;. What is after that is that on the qualifying he was a citizen of Ireland and was ordinarily resident in that constituency. Where does age come into it?  Senator Costello might have intended to deal with age, but that point is covered 85 pages later in the Bill.  There is no point in <Col N="1272" /> his continuing this debate and trying to confuse the House.  Either his amendment is defective and he is trying to cover up, or he has misread the situation.  As far as I am concerned this amendment has nothing to do with the section we are dealing with.</P>

      <P>A person shall be entitled to be registered as a presidential elector in a constituency if he has reached the age of eighteen years and if he was, on the qualifying date&mdash;</P>
      <P>Senator Upton and his colleagues have used the word &ldquo;is&rdquo;.  What all of us want to do is to try to ensure that if there is a June election &mdash; and all our local elections fall in June &mdash; or if there is a presidential election, which is known for a long time in advance, the Minister of the day could make an order, for example, that up to the first of the month before the election, anybody who had reached the age of 18 years whether it is 1 June or 1 September, would be entitled to cast their vote.  Age is referred to here &mdash; the words &ldquo;on the qualifying date&rdquo; are used.

      <P>It makes me uneasy when I find my distinguished colleagues on the other benches confused by Labour Party amendments.  I wonder if the amendment has been properly read.  What we are suggesting is that if he/she is a citizen of <Col N="1273" /> Ireland and has reached the age of 18 &mdash; in other words, when somebody reaches the age of 18 &mdash; he/she will be entitled to vote.  That is what the amendment says: the qualifying date is gone.  We are suggesting that it be removed.  That is why <Col N="1274" /> the Schedule is not relevant to this amendment.  We have got rid of the qualifying date.</P>

    <P>This is a very important amendment in as much as it relates to the question of emigrants being given the right to vote. I am sure Senators on all sides of the House have had a series of representations in relation to this matter.  I have received quite an amount of representations from various emigrant groups who are very anxious to have a say in how this country is governed.  Over the years we have had a great deal to say about our concern for the welfare of our emigrants.  We have taken a great deal of pride in the success of many of them. We have no hesitation in exploiting their attachment to this country when it comes to inviting them and enticing then back here for holidays or to visit their relatives.</P>
    <P>However, the crunch comes in relation to our being prepared to give emigrants a say in how things are done here, to give them a say in ordering our business, to give them the opportunity to create an appropriate environment or to support parties who will pursue policies which will reduce greatly the need for emigration. This amendment provides for that opportunity. It provides the Government with the chance to give emigrants a vote in Dáil elections, and I think that is desirable. Emigrants already have a vote in Seanad elections to the extent that they are able to vote for graduates of the National University of Ireland and graduates of Dublin University in the University constituencies for this House. That has not created any great problems. In many ways it is very much to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Well, I welcome it and I welcome the contribution of the people in the seats behind me, although, as I have said in this House on a number of occasions, I have some reservations and questions to ask in relation to whether graduates of universities should be singled out for special treatment in the <Col N="1276" /> matter of votes.  However, that is for another day.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which is in considreable accord with the amendment put down in the name of Senator Naughten, allows for emigrants to be given the vote. It gives the Government an opportunity to put action in the place of promises, sentiment, good wishes and basically pleasant but harmless talk.  We are now giving the Government the opportunity to get down to brass tacks and allow the emigrants to have a say in this country, to keep them part of this country, with which so many of them want to be involved.  That is perfectly obvious from the number of representations I received from emigrant groups from all over the world.  My colleague in the other House, Deputy O'Sullivan, has had a tremendous response and a considerable degree of interest from emigrants in relation to the Bill which our party introduced in the other House on the question of giving emigrants the right to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of a number of people in trying to facilitate our emigrants in some way and giving them some recognition for the fact that they want to feel part of their homeland. A substantial number of them have left the country through no fault of their own. While many of those people would be active members of organisations and political parties, independent people who would have their own political views, through no fault of their own they find themselves in a situation they never anticipated.  It is appropriate and timely that we would express our concern and try to facilitate them by formulating some proposition that would suit them and give them the franchise.  That is where the difficulty is.  How does one co-ordinate or regulate it?  I know the Government are at present taking a serious look at this situation and I would prefer to wait for the outcome.  They are due to report back in the near future and I await the outcome to see what type of approach the Government will adopt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment <Col N="1277" /> and accept what Senator McKenna says about the goodwill of the Government. The Government voted down a Labour Party Bill which sought to give rights to our emigrants.  Reasons can always be found to put it on the long finger but at some stage the nettle has to be grasped and action taken.  This proposal has not been plucked out of the air but is the norm with our European colleagues.</P>
      <P>If we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June we enter another stage of European integration. The majority of our European colleagues have procedures in place whereby their citizens when absent from the jurisdiction for whatever reason can vote in internal national elections.  We would with this amendment bring ourselves into line with the rest of Europe and the United States.</P>
      <P>We should look at the positive side to see how we might facilitate electors rather than at the negative side for obstacles and difficulties.  There are admittedly, enormous difficulties given that in 1989, 46,000 Irish citizens emigrated. Last year it was considerably less but in every year there has been a plus factor of emigration.  Many people would qualify for electoral status as Irish citizens living abroad who left Ireland, unwillingly for the most part but who remain anxious to contribute politically.  There would have to be certain regulations but that should not take away from the principle of ensuring that Irish citizens in jurisdictions abroad should have the right to make a political contribution and to feel part of our democracy.</P>
      <P>I would like to see this amendment taken seriously by Government and I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply.  I understand that the Progressive Democrate are in favour of enfranchising Irish citizens abroad.  What steps could be taken to ensure a level of involvement and enfranchisment for our citizens abroad?</P>

I am not talking about extending this provision over a 20 to 25 years period but over a two to three year period.  It is not a simple measure which is why I have stated in my amendment &ldquo;subject to regulations made by the Minister&rdquo;.  It would have to be controlled but what I find objectionable is that people who emigrate for a short period of six to 12 months sometimes find on their return that they have been scratched from the register.  That is grossly unfair and we must provide a facility in this Bill that will allow those people the right to vote.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton referred to the fact that one section of out population abroad, graduates from university, can vote in Seanad elections while those who are not graduates have no input into either House of the Oireachtas.  People who emigrate, many for only two or three years, should not find themselves without a vote when they return and have to wait for another year or 15 months to rectify it.  I appeal to the Minister to extend the principle to young emigrants who are extremely anxious for the right to vote. A facility should be provided in this Bill whereby they could go to the local embassy or consulate and exercise their democratic right to vote.</P>

      <P>It is not clear from either the Labour Party amendment or Senator Naughten's amendment whether we are talking about people who happen to be abroad on a one or two year basis, such as people on a temporary secondment out of the country, in which case I do not see difficulty, or whether we are talking about enfranchising the great exodus from Ireland.  This is nonsense and I am not sure of the motivation of those who advocate it &mdash; sympathy perhaps and I share that.  Shylock speaks about the curse never falling upon our nation until now &mdash; I never felt it until now.  I did not feel it until my daughter became a permanent emigrant.  My only grandchild now lives on the other side of the world and I share the general feeling of loss towards emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the motivation is possible that <Col N="1279" /> there are many emigrants, meaning there are also many relatives and relatives mean votes.  I suspect some of the motivation is to attract votes and to ingratiate politicians with relatives.  Another part is a pie in the sky hope that somewhere out there may be the kind of constituency that, if properly organised, will suit us in our domestic politics, whether it is in New York, London or elsewhere.  Irrespective of the motivation, and people may have the highest motivation, this proposal is nonsensical and the Government would be better off to say this is not on.  It is not on in point of principle because no matter how much sympathy one has with emigrants they live in another country from morning till night; they have their being in another country; and the politics and society of that country impinges upon them every hour.</P>
    <P>As long as we talk about promising or half promising emigrants the vote, they will be left in a semi-permanent state of schizophrenia about where they belong. Are they ever going to be British?  If Britain gives them a living they should consider themselves British and participate fully in British elections.  The same applies to America and other countries. We cannot say &mdash; you belong to us in a way; we cannot give you a job at the moment but we will give you a vote &mdash; to people who cannot be informed on what goes on here from day to day and whose physical presence abroad ensures that will be influenced by the country they live in now and not by Ireland.</P>
    <P>The proposal also offends against the fundamental democratic principle of &ldquo;no representation without taxation&rdquo;.  The point has been made that there are many people in this country who do not pay tax &mdash; a rather unconvincing point.  They do not pay income tax so therefore they are in the same position as the emigrants, but they are not because they pay indirect tax in a variety of ways.  My attitude is that while I share all the &ldquo;no fault of their own&rdquo; stuff, when we have wept our crocidile tears, let us admit that emigrants have settled in other countries and that <Col N="1280" /> is where they belong if we are talking about permanent emigration.</P>
    <P>I find it unacceptable that emigrants should have a massive influence on elections in this country, and it would be massive.  It is all very well for Senator Costello to talk about falling into line with other countries if we give emigrants the vote.  No other European country has a massive imbalance between the resident population and Irish born foreign population comparable to ours.  Logically, if we want to give emigrants the vote we must give them all the vote.  What is the cut off line?  We may accept something like temporary secondment, a year or a scholarship period or a term on contract for special consideration but there is no logic to support giving it to those who left within five years and not to the generation of the 1950s.  They have as much moral right to it as the generation of the 1970s.  The thing bristles with logistical problems.</P>
    <P>I will not raise the spectre of electoral fodder being organised by sinister forces, but it is there nonetheless.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Murphy.  I am not in favour of giving votes to emigrants.  He has made the necessary points and I need not go over them.  This proposal, has nothing to do with one's pride or concern for emigrants, with what they have achieved abroad or how one feels at their having to go and how much one would like them to be able to return and find work.  It is not fair to say we are prepared to exploit <Col N="1281" /> them for tourist purposes.  We should seek to attract people who have left this country to return and enjoy Ireland's peace, beauty and the quality of life here. One could not describe that intentions as exploitative.</P>
      <P>Emigrants lose touch with their country of origin.  One cannot live away for any extended length of time and be <i>au fait</i> with issues here.  This motion says &ldquo;formally resident&rdquo;.  Does it mean that if one left Ireland as a baby and lived abroad for 50, 60 or 70 years one could now be entered on the register in one's constituency of birth?  The proposal is fraught with hopeless complications.  I am opposed to the proposal.</P>

If one lives abroad for two years, ten years of 50 years does one always qualify?  Does it cover people on holidays or working only?  It is a non-starter.  Like Senator McKenna, I have sympathy for our emigrants but emigration and voting rights are different issues which we should separate.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten referred to University panels and graduates abroad having votes.  They have a vote not by virtue of where they live but by virtue of where they graduate from.  I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>Emigrants should be able to vote here for a period of five years after leaving.  I am amazed at the case being made by Senator Murphy and Hederman as they enjoy the privilege of external votes; obviously neither of them has benefited from the external vote.  My experience in dealing with local authorities is that persons who emigrate are not automatically taken off the register. People who left my locality seven or eight years ago are still on the register there. We are talking about young people who emigrate before they register.  They should be entitled to register and vote here.  Emigrants cannot vote but they <Col N="1282" /> should remain on the register and if they go to the expense of coming home on polling day they can vote.  Dublin county and most local authorities keep emigrants on the register for a considerable time after they have emigrated.  When the people compiling the register report that a person has left the country the practice is not to omit them from that register for some time although they have no hope of voting unless their homecoming coincides with an election.  It would be too expensive for anyone to take a boat or plane in order to cast their vote here.</P>
      <P>The amendment is reasonable.  If the Minister would make certain orders to limit the time people would remain on the register it should be considered.  Many people on the Fianna Fáil benches feel the same way and the Minister might consider that.  In years gone by we have been accused of forgetting about those who have left the country.  This is one way in which we could show our concern for them.</P>

      <P>On Senator Naughten's point in relation to people absent for short periods of time, temporary emigrants who have a firm intention of returning can have their registration retained under section 11 (3) of this Bill for up to 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing law on the registration of electors which is repeated largely unchanged in this Bill provides that in order to the eligible for registration as an elector a person must be ordinarily resident in a Dáil constituency.  The effect of these amendments would be to modify the residence requirement and enable persons resident outside the country to be registered as electors.  Both amendments are wide in scope.  The amendments proposed by the Labour Party Senators would enable every Irish emigrant no matter how long absent from the country to be registered.  Senator Naughten's amendment is even wider and would <Col N="1283" /> probably enfranchise everyone born here who subsequently left the country.</P>
    <P>I note that no special arrangements are proposed to enable people living outside the State to vote in elections.  These matters would have to be teased out and dealt with at a later stage.  I mention these points in passing, but these are not the reasons I ask the Seanad not to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>The Government are examining the feasibility of providing voting rights for emigrants.  Representation in the Oireachtas on behalf of emigrants raises fundamental questions, including constitutional questions.  In fairness to emigrants and to the resident population, any arrangement that might be decided on would have to recognise the differences in situation between those who reside permanently in this country and those who, for whatever reason, live abroad on a continuing basis.  The difference relates not just to the representation and taxation question, but to emigrants' entire circumstances, including jobs, wages, housing, health and welfare, environment and so on.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of whether we are for or against emigrant representation. The question is what is possible within the constitutional, legal and practical constraints and what is appropriate and fair to emigrants of whatever duration, as well as to the resident population.  The Government are giving the fundamental issues the careful consideration they demand and I hope that the Government's position will be made known shortly.</P>
    <P>At this stage I am not adopting a position either for or against emigrant voting. In the circumstances I ask the Seanad to reject these amendments and allow time for the Government to complete their consideration and adopt a position in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister say that as far as the general idea of votes for emigrants is concerned he has an open mind on it.  That is good, but it is a pity he will not accept our <Col N="1284" /> amendment which converts the question into brass tacks terms.  The first issue I would take up with the Minister is his statement that we wanted to give a vote to every Irish emigrant.  That is not our proposal.  We want to give a vote to every Irish emigrant who is also an Irish citizen, and that is clearly spelt out in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The fact that emigtants are Irish citizens means that this country has some obligations to them and we are quite vigorous in pursuing those obligations from time to time.  We acted vigorously when Mr. Brian Keenan found himself in dreadful circumstances in Beirut.  We took a great deal of pride in the fact that the Irish diplomatic services played an important role in securing his release.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points I would like to take up in relation to Senator Murphy's remarks.  He said that emigrants would not be informed and the implication is that they should not then be allowed to vote.  I am sure Senator Murphy realises that being informed is no qualification to vote.  People are entitled to vote whether they are informed or not.  Many political parties exploit the fact that people are not informed on matters to persuade them to vote in their favour.  That argument has no validity nor does the point about taxation. Emigrants do not pay tax here but neither do they use the services provided in this country from taxation returns.</P>
      <P>In relation to electoral fodder and how these people might vote in Irish elections, I do not accept that people should be barred from elections on the basis of how they might vote.  It would have an attraction for all of us if we could prevent our political opponents from having votes in elections.  We are not in favour of that. We should not claim that certain elements of the Irish emigrant population would vote in a way which many of us here would find unacceptable.  There are many people in this country who vote for and support causes which some of us would find repugnant and unacceptable but I do not think any of us would argue that they should be barred from voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make one final political comment <Col N="1285" /> on the likely way in which Irish emigrants would vote?  My own view is that many of them would support the Fianna Fáil Party when they get into the old misty sentiment which many of them seem to wash down with large consignments of alcoholic beverages in America and elsewhere.  I would not expect our party to do well from the granting of votes to emigrants.</P>
    <P>We should draw a very clear distinction between Irish emigrants who remain Irish citizens and those who do not.  A number of Irish citizens, particularly in the United States of America, many of whom Senator Murphy might be alluding to, are prepared to engage in talk late at night, in American saloon bars about the old sod and political violence and so on but when it comes down to brass tacks, will look after No. 1 which means increasing the size of their bank accounts and swelling the dimensions of their pockets with dollars.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senator Upton's name would look well on a poster in downtown Texas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Senator Naughten's amendment, one of the most important phrases is: &ldquo;subject to regulations made by the Minister&rdquo;.  I do not know whether the Minister acknowledged that when replying.  Many of would like to see emigrants have some franchise but the intricacies of that must be looked at; it is not a simple or straightforward matter.  The votes electing some of our university colleagues come from foreign parts.  I do not know how that system operates and perhaps the University Senators are informed about it.  I presume there is difficulty with addresses.  When the University ballot papers are sent to a last known address, they may be picked up by an other person or disappear into a wastepaper basket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the position in relation to our embassy staff or Irish people representing this country abroad.  It is important that they have a vote in each election and referendum. <Col N="1286" /> What is the position with our Army personnel who are doing such a good job with the United Nations?  There may not be a massive number of votes involved &mdash; I have personal knowledge of the value of even a small number of No. 1 votes &mdash; but sometimes the last seats have been decided by what would be attributable to one constituency.  Whatever about the broader aspects &mdash; and I am glad the Minister indicated that the proposals are being studied &mdash; the Minister should be able to clarify the position in relation to Irish people abroad who are readily identifiable.</P>
    <P>During an election or referendum it should be physically possible to locate a ballot box in an embassy or nearest point of call to enable Irish people to vote.  I understand the staff of foreign embassies here can avail of such a service.  I support in principle what our spokesman has said in relation to the question.  It is not an easy question, but I would like some commitment from the Minister on it.  Perhaps he could reply to the points I raised.</P>

      <P>Emigration has been one of the great tragedies of this country involving personal sadness, human and economic loss.  It can still be extremely sad and painful today, as Senator Murphy implied.  It was infinitely more tragic and heartrending up until quite recently, because when somebody went abroad to the United States or elsewhere it often meant that parents or grandparents might never see them again, or only occassionally.  It is only in the past 20 years that air travel has become more frequent and cheaper and the sadness and tragedy of emigration has been eased considerably.  It is very deep in the psyche of this country and we have tended to ignore and neglect it.  Our emigrants did not and do not have a vote. Perhaps in times past if they had a vote some of the stagnation, backwardness, self-satisfaction and smugness which we have experienced and suffered from in this country might have been questioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the amendments although they are not really satisfactory I am very pleased the <Col N="1287" /> Government are going to look at this situation.  It may, in practice, be virtually impossible to find any satisfactory way of providing a voice or a form of voting rights for our emigrants but it is time we looked at it.</P>
    <P>In other countries, for example the United States and Australia, one is obliged to vote.  In Australia a person can be fined and even if a person is in Ireland on a holiday and if they do not go to the Australian Embassy and register their vote they are liable to be fined.  It is not as easy for us because we are a small country with many of our population abroad, whereas Australia and the United States may have tiny proportion of their citizens abroad.  Nonetheless, there is a clear contrast between our attitude which allows no vote at all and that of these countries where, by law, one must vote.</P>
    <P>We should perhaps consider whether emigrants should be represented, truly represented, through the Seanad.  We have this extraordinary anomaly as a result of which some of our colleagues in the Seanad receive votes from Irish people who have emigrated.  Indeed, some of their voters may not even be Irish citizens but have qualified in one of the two universities.  That may have been an excellent system the best part of a century ago but should it still be the situation today?  It is certainly an anomaly that a person who is born and bred here and who, because of economic circumstances, is forced to live elsewhere has no vote, whereas somebody from some other country who comes here and does a degree in three years, thereafter has a vote in the Oireachtas for the rest of his or her life.  That seems very strange.</P>
    <P>I would dissociate myself from some of the comments made by Senators Upton and Murphy.  I do not know the views of Irish people who happen to have emigrated to south Boston but I do not think we should sneer at them.</P>

      <P>It will be very difficult to find a satisfactory method based on Dáil constituencies.  Should we allow former residents of a Dáil constituency to vote for Dáil candidates in that constituency?  Should we allow people who have, effectively, taken up permanent residence elsewhere for many years and have totally lost any connection with this country, to vote?  In the United States effectively, you have to become an American citizen and, when you do so, you must abjure citizenship of any other country.  Perhaps such people, when they take that decision, should not have a vote as Irish citizens.  On the other hand they could argue they were obliged to give up their citizenship.  There are many factors concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By not having had any system of representation <Col N="1289" /> for our emigrants down through the years, we in this country and not just the emigrants, have been the losers.  I am delighted the Government will look at this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's reply.  He did not respond to my amendment in the way I thought he should.  I was very careful to say &ldquo;subject to regulations made by the Minister&rdquo;.  I fully recognise as Senator Conroy has pointed out, that this is not something that can be done very simply. It is a complex and difficult question.  I am equally satisfied that we cannot just ignore those people who, because of circumstances outside their control have had to emigrate and have no vote if they come back, and if they wish to vote from abroad they have not got the right to do so.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that we could not give a blanket vote to all citizens outside this State.  It would certainly distort the results in some constituencies.  I recognise that.  I am talking about those people who are recent emigrants, who have not settled down and have no permanent residence outside this country.  They still recognise Ireland and their home residence where they were born as their home.  We should try to facilitate them. That is why I was very careful to put in &ldquo;subject to regulations by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that the Government have stated on a number of occasions that they are examining this matter.  I regret very much they had not made a decision before this Bill came before the House which could have been incorporated as part of the Bill.  The Minister in his reply said that a temporary short term arrangement would apply where people who were gone away would be retained for a short period on the register.  I would like the Minister to clarify what is the definition of short term.  Is it three, six or 12 months?  I regret the Government have not made a decision one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made by Senator Murphy that many of those people who are abroad may not be informed.  I can <Col N="1290" /> assure Senator Murphy that I know of many people, who vote in every general election, who are not informed.  There is an anomaly here, as Senator Conroy pointed out.  Somebody who is not an Irish citizen but who comes here for three years and gets a degree, can vote in Seanad elections.  Yet people who are born and reared here and who have lived here for 20 or 25 years have no say, because they did not attend a university. Our recent emigrants should have a possibility of using their democratic right in a general election.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the meaning of &ldquo;temporary short term&rdquo;.  I ask him to take this amendment on board and come back on Report Stage with some suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry we had a little altercation a few minutes ago.  I sometimes think I am too well behaved in this Chamber.  I was glad the Minister brought in the constitutional position. My objection to these amendments was based on a certain ground of principle to begin with, namely, no representation without taxation but the more fundamental objection may well be a constitutional objection.  That is an obstacle which the Government have to face.</P>
      <P>If we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Maastricht and a European Union is established with the consequent diminution of our powers and responsibilities in this Oireachtas, than (a) the question of whether emigrants have a vote in Ireland becomes less important, because we will be less important; (b) as far as the United Kingdom and other members of the European Union are concerned, people might as well vote in the member state of their residence, which is only one component of a wider federal union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Naughten has not clarified what he means when he speaks of temporary absence and so on.  Does that mean he is totally at variance with the views put forward by the Glór na ndeoraithe movement both in the UK and in the United States, which makes no stipulation about temporary absence from the country?  They are really talking about votes for emigrants, period. <Col N="1291" /> Senator McMahon mentioned five years. Why not ten or seven, which is another mystical number?  How does one decide that after five years a person is no longer entitled to vote?  I suggest that these points have not been thought out.</P>
    <P>In the United States there are substantial numbers of Irish people who have never taken out American citizenship, who are Irish citizens extending back to the 1940s, but who have lost total contact with the realities of this country.  That is why I mentioned south Boston.  I did not mean to sneer; sneer is a nasty word.  I was suggesting that there could be a Gerry Adams in south Boston, or worse and it would be possible to so mobilise a particular vote to make it opposed to the best interests of this country.  I do take Senator Upton's point that we do not have any right, obviously, to tell people how to vote.  I found it interesting that he thought they might vote Fianna Fáil, especially if the vote was held just after closing time and they fell out of a pub.  The Labour Party are no daws when it comes to wrapping the green flag around them, either.</P>

      <P>Senator Upton made a good point; I have no right to base my opposition on the hypothesis of how people may or may not vote.  On the other hand, some of Senator Upton's other comments and those of Senator Naughten were facetious.  To say that, because certain people are ill informed when they vote, that is an argument for giving all ill informed people a vote, is unworthy.  Living week after week, month after month in a foreign country does put one hopelessly out of touch and one is ill informed in a sense in which the resident voter, no matter how unsophisticated he is, is not ill informed.  There is a very important distinction there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me nail something else.  More than one Senator referred to the extra territorial vote in the case of the university Seanad elections.  The question was: who am I to complain about emigrants getting <Col N="1292" /> the vote when some of my support comes from emigrants who happen to be university graduates?  I do not know what the position which obtains in Dublin University is, but the percentage of emigrant graduates who are listed on the register of electors in the Seanad Éireann NUI register is absolutely infinitesmal; I would put even the number of NUI graduates in Northern Ireland as no higher than 10 per cent.  As regards the proportion outside the jurisdiction, and outside the island of Ireland, I would say it is less than 0.1 per cent.  I certainly do not want their votes and have never looked for them.  I am consistent about this.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister for the Environment asking him to consider the anomaly of British subjects who live in this country and who are university graduates, but cannot vote because they are not Irish citizens.  I understand from something Senator Conroy said that he thought whether you were an Irish citizen, if you were a university graduate, you could vote.  That is not so.  This is quite consistent with my views on this matter, no representation without taxation. My British subject consultant who cannot vote for me and who has lived and worked all his life in Cork, but who is not an Irish citizen, should have every right to vote for me.  I take the point for what it is worth that the person in the United States does not have that same moral right.  That is a very small point.</P>
    <P>No one has answered the question of imbalance.  We are unique, as far as I know, in western Europe, in the huge imbalance there is between our emigrant population and our native population. No one has said how this enormous problem of logistics could be faced.</P>
    <P>How many foreign resident British subjects voted in the last general election? I am not quite sure, but it certainly was not more than 50,000 or 60,000 in that huge electorate.  I do not know how many were entitled to vote or what kind of people voted but it is an example of the great contrast there is between our country and others.  This issue is not a problem for other countries but it is a vast logistical problem for us.</P>

      <P>People who attended university are entitled to a postal vote for Seanad elections.  Many of these graduates live outside this jurisdiction and they may be citizens of another jurisdiction. It is irrelevant for Senator Murphy to say that only a tiny percentage of people are registered abroad.  They would be registered at their residence when they were attending university and the mail would be sent there.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;people there were entitled to vote for candidates who stood for this Seanad.  This is anomaly.  In our debate on Seanad reform I do not remember either Senator saying we should disfranchise those people from abroad who are now allowed to vote for them in the Seanad election.  They are prepared to say we should not enfranchise people who do not have a vote in any election while those who have it already keep that right.  There is a contradiction there.  All the logical development of Senator Murphy's argument does not take away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> It is the norm in European countries, the United States and Australia for citizens abroad to have the right to vote.  As Senator Conroy pointed out, they have an obligation to vote.  Why should we always adopt a negative approach and put up obstacles?  Why can we not try to facilitate our citizens abroad?</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy put forward some of the weirdest objections I have come across.  He says many people have relatives abroad.  Has not everybody a relative in another part of the country? People in Cork have relatives in Dublin, people in Dublin and Cork have relatives in England and the United States and so on.  That is not an argument.  He said these emigrants do not pay taxes here. How could they?  That is irrelevant.  If they were here, they would be paying taxes; they would love to be in a position to pay taxes here; they have probably emigrated because they were unable to get employment at home.</P>
    <P>It is the Trinity and NUI graduates who have made a deliberate choice to go abroad.  They have had the education to earn a good living in any country.  The majority of Irish people who have gone abroad have not done so from choice.  We should be telling those people, citizens of this country, that we are interested in their welfare and we should ensure that they get representation in our elections. We are not saying it should be a blanket representation.  Regulations will have to be made.</P>
    <P>We can confine it to those who choose to remain citizens, or we can set a timescale. That can be discussed.  We can go as far as other countries and make it not just and entitlement but an obligation.  I cannot accept a blanket refusal to examine the situation at all.</P>
    <P>We will eventually have to accept what the Minister is saying, that the Government are examining the feasibility of the issues.  I am glad they are taking that positive step.  Because this is an electoral Bill, I would like to see it include the findings of the committee set up to examine the problem.  Could the Minister give us any idea how far the Government committee <Col N="1295" /> have got in providing the vote for our citizens abroad?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Play has been made of the fact that there is an imbalance in the proportion of Irish citizens living abroad compared with that of many other western European countries.

      <P>With reference to Senator Naughten's comments in relation to emigrants being residents in another country for 18 months, where emigrants have a firm intention of returning under section 11 (3) they can have registration retained under section 11 (3) of the Bill. I would like also to refer to the Senator's amendment which mentions regulations to be made by the Minister.  I think the Minister should be given some guidelines as to what should be in the regulations. The Oireachtas very rarely gives such sweeping and unfettered powers to any Minister.  If the Senator has a view on that, he might like to think about it further.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to our embassy staff abroad and members of the Defence Forces, every one of whom is entitled to vote and arrangements are made for them to do so.</P>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the points made by Senators on all sides of the House.  Even in the short debate we have had here today, with so few Members present, we can see the variation in views and opinions on both sides of the House.  It is important that this matter should be looked at very carefully. The Government are considering the matter and I hope and expect they will make a decision very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw a recent &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; where this issue was debated and there were divided views.

      <P>I am anxious that the Minister should give a little more detail on the Government's views on votes being given to emigrants.  It is clear that he has an open mind and that a series of proposals is being considered.  It is highly desirable that those proposals should be included in a Bill like this, which seems to be the ideal way to deal with the control and regulation of votes for emigrants.  For that reason, I am very anxious that the Minister give us more detail, perhaps on the next occasion we are debating this Bill, rather than that we should have to reach a definite decision on the amendment before us this afternoon.  I am very interested in the Minister's views and would like to know the timescale he has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the unwarranted attack by An Post on the postal service; and, in particular, condemns&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the suspension of postal workers,</P>
      <P>(2)  the recruitment of temporary staff while permanent vacancies remain unfilled,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> (3)  the refusal to pay salaries of postal workers,</P>
    <P>(4)  the proposal to transfer the bulk of mail deliveries from Iarnród Éireann to road transportation,</P>
    <P>(5)  the proposal to reduce the workforce by one-fifth,</P>
    <P>(6)  the proposal to close at least 550 sub-post offices throughout the country,</P>
    <P>calls on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, in consultation with the postal Unions,</P>
    <P>&mdash; to negotiate a solution to the present impasse;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to agree alternative proposals to the wholesale shedding of jobs and closure of sub-post offices; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; to agree arrangements to recompense An Post for carrying substantial social obligations for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. In the course of this debate we will be calling for the resignation of the chief executive of An Post, Mr. Hynes, or calling on the Government to sack him as a man unfit for the job for which he was appointed, on the grounds that Mr. Hynes made an unwarranted attack on the postal service and on the postal workers and thereby provoked an industrial action which was entirely unnecessary. As a result of that, the competitiveness of An Post in its operation, and indeed the competitivenenss of our business and commercial sector, has been seriously affected as well as the all important jobs of the postal workers.</P>
    <P>He is in total breach of both the spirit and terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The 4 per cent and 3 per cent for last year and this year have not been paid.  We are 17 months through the programme at present and not a penny has been paid even though it was due to be paid earlier this year. <Col N="1298" /> The entire <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was based on a consensus, on agreement, on a social partnership between the trade union movement, the employers and the Government.  While the trade union movement have adhered to that, that has not been the case with the employers in this instance, or indeed in relation to the banks.  Mr. Hynes's gung-ho union bashing attitude has been very detrimental to industrial relations, to the existence of the present <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and to any future programme in the context of the trade unions being involved.</P>
    <P>Last year An Post lost £3.1 million in its year's trading.  At present it is losing approximately £3 million per week.  That is directly as a result of the unilateral decision of the chief executive of An Post to introduce casualisation at a time when negotiations were taken place, when a ballot was actually in place, arising out of the proposals and recommendations of the Labour Relations Commission to look at proposals that had been made. That is the antithesis of good industrial relations.  At present there is little or no service provided in Dublin and a very small proportion of service provided by An Post throughout the country; 1,300 workers are suspended and 2,600 are left unpaid.  Workers entitled to their pay have had to take An Post to the High Court to get a fulfilment of their contractual duties.  This is all due to what I would describe as Mr. Hynes's bully boy tactics, which are the antithesis of good industrial relations.  He has left a trail of destruction &mdash; in Guinness, when he closed down a subsidiary there, in Dublin Gas and in Dublin Bus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind Deputy Costello that Mr. Hynes is not here to defend himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak about the chief executive of An Post, who is the person responsible for all the activities I have referred to and which have led to the present crisis.  The only way I could properly describe him is as a serial company <Col N="1299" /> killer, somebody who comes in and leaves a trail of damage in his wake, who unleashes damage, because he goes at it baldheaded rather than going about it through a reasonable process that would be accommodated by a trade union movement that it accommodated, and certainly is accommodating at present. &ldquo;Hardheaded management&rdquo; it may well be described in the business sector, but in industrial terms it is simply bad industrial relations and always ends up causing destructiveness rather than a beneficial outcome.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have to say that I am dissatisfied with the contribution by the Minister in that she seems to have adopted the position of An Post without due consideration for the complexity of issues involved.  The Minister has already accepted the introduction of casualisation while the ballot was going on. She gave her <i>imprimatur</i> to that, even though that was contrary to the recommendations of the Labour Relations Commission and that caused the situation to come to a head.  It would seem that succour is being given to An Post by the Minister's words to date in the public media.  I would have thought that she, as representative of the Government and as a participant in the social partnership, would be an honest broker in this situation.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept, therefore, the amendment, namely, &ldquo;supports the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in her efforts to secure the implementation of measures to restore An Post to financial health...&rdquo;.  The measures that are being taken by the Minister are, as far as I can see, simply in support of the action that has been taken by An Post management, and that is not going to restore An Post to financial health.  In fact, it is costing a tremendous haemorrhaging of resources that is going to have a calamitous effect on the financial figures in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could perhaps read for the Minister what I would regard as a very simple measure for restoring An Post to financial health.  If we look at the ledger for last <Col N="1300" /> year we see that the fees paid to consultants in the year ending 31 December 1991 amounted to £1,372,211 &mdash; that was paid to consultants in a single year; professional fees on behalf of senior management and professional organisations amounted to £127,771; entertainment cost £125,106; personal entertainment&mdash; for whom I do not know &mdash; cost £11,205, and travelling and subsistence cost £2.2 million.  With decent management that would easily eliminate the debt that was incurred last year of £3.1 million.</P>
    <P>Remember we are talking about a proposed debt in excess of £10 million last year so, in fact, it was very close to breaking even.  If there had been proper control on these expenses the deficit could have been wiped out.  That is just one example of where An Post management are still spending money as though they had plenty of it and at the same time preaching to the workers the need for a rationalisation plan, the need for viability, the need for a reduction in the number of employees in the postal service, taking a very hard line in that respect while obviously, on the other side of the coin, there is a very generous approach towards expenditure.</P>
    <P>At this point I must urge the Minister to cease acting as a guarantor and as a rubber stamp for all the actions of Mr. Hynes.  That must be the bottom line as far as the Minister is concerned and, indeed, as far as the Minister for Labour is concerned.  It seems to me that you are acting as a guarantor for all the activities of Mr. Hynes.  I have not heard one word of complaint from the Minister in relation to any of the activities adopted by the management in An Post so far, yet they suspended 1,300 of their workers and neglected to pay 2,600.  That, to my mind, is a very serious matter and at least justifies one voicing some element of concern at what is taking place.  This, of course, is following along the lines of what the banks have done already.  It is part of the same type of strong handed tactics that were used in that dispute too and which I find to be equally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Two hundred and fifty casual staff are <Col N="1301" /> being recruited into the service at a time when 450 vacancies remain unfilled. Remember that casualisation has never been a facet of the operation of An Post. There have been temporary staff but there has never been casual staff employed on a day to day basis.  There are plenty of temporary staff who have been there for six months, 12 months and in excess of that, who could easily be given certain contractual rights.  Casualisation means no rights, so I have to say that that development is totally unacceptable and has to be opposed by any trade union worth its salt.  It is a new element being introduced.</P>
    <P>This problem of the recruitment of temporary staff and overtime did not come from the workers or the unions.  It is something that came directly from bad management in 1987 and 1988 when 800 voluntary redundancies were allowed, more or less along the lines of what happened in Waterford Glass, and the company has been trying to retrieve the situation ever since.  The result is that there is a great deal of overtime, and nobody is opposed to reducing overtime. Already the union has proposed that the overtime be reduced by a factor of 25 per cent this year, and that it would be done on a gradual basis.  But no, we got a blunt, bull in the china shop approach, where everything must happen on a crash programme.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago we had the same viability plan being introduced by An Post and they dropped it because of the local elections in June.  Now they have another spring offensive starting along exactly the same lines and with exactly the same procedures and methods. Instead of coming along softly and seeking to persuade by consensus and negotiation, as is enshrined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, they use a sledgehammer and say this must happen now, that must happen now; it must be done unilaterally, not with negotiation and not with the opportunity for anybody to ballot on it.  That is in direct conflict with the recommendation made by the Labour Relations Commission.  I have to say to the Minister again that I <Col N="1302" /> find the position she has adopted to be totally unacceptable, apparently supporting one side and not giving any credence to the other.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the fact that obviously &mdash; and I can see why he is doing it &mdash; the chief executive is targeting Sheriff Street sorting office.  He sees that as the weak link in the chain and he is trying to break that area because there is a lot of overtime in it.  I have to be terribly concerned about that.  That is one of the few areas of employment in the north inner city; it employs a number of people. There are hundreds of people employed there both on a direct sorting level as post workers and as cleaners, etc.  This would reduce employment very severely in that area, an area which can ill afford it.  The Minister should not be shaking her head, because I live in the vicinity and I know.</P>
    <P>What about the effect these proposals will have on Iarnród Éireann, who have eight mail trains per day going out of the city, two to Cork, two to Galway, and the rest to other destinations.  Already we have lines, like the Sligo line, which are extremely vulnerable.  Jobs will be lost there and indeed there is a threat to the future of Iarnród Éireann and to many of our provincial lines.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to reduce the work force by one-fifth.  Rationalisation always takes place in the context of reducing the work force, never increasing the workforce. To say it must happen, that it is part and parcel of the viability plan, is unacceptable.  Look at the 550 sub-post offices that are to close.  That number has, I understand, increased to 800.  That cannot take place in a rational fashion, because a sub-postmistress or a sub-postmaster is entitled to be there until they retire or until they voluntarily give up their contract.  The State or An Post cannot choose those that are most marginal and costly to the service.  They have to wait and see what comes in.  They cannot say that the 800 to go will be the 800 who are least necessary; it is going to be a lottery.  To deal with it like that is not going to help.</P>
    <P>May I say to the Minister that I <Col N="1303" /> am disappointed with her noninterventionist policy and with the fact that where she has made statements they have been biased and in favour of one side involved in this dispute.  I would like her to put on the record that she will be an honest broker from this point on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On seconding this motion I wish to say that it is blindingly obvious that this dispute is having a disastrous effect on the country.  It is having an undesirable effect on business generally and in particular it is having a disastrous effect on small business, which relies on An Post to engage in commerce.  Big business to some extent can deal with communications through the use of FAX machines and so on, but there is a limitation on the extent to which that is viable and to which it can be used.</P>
      <P>This dispute is having a disastrous effect on the tourism industry and in particular on the small players in the tourist market, the people who run bed and breakfast and small hotels, the people who provide services for the tourist industry, small restaurants, public houses &mdash; they are all going to suffer.  It means that the inflow of tourists to this country this year is going to be very seriously diminished arising from what is happening.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the inconvenience and disturbance which this strike presents for the general public.  People are very greatly inconvenienced by what is happening. They are unable to do their business, such as the everyday matters of paying their bills or even receiving them. That might be desirable for some people in the short term, but inevitably there will be a day of reckoning.  After disputes in the past a number of people have found themselves in very difficult circumstances when a whole series of bills descended on them and they had not made the necessary preparation to cope with that. When these strikes ended in the past a number of small businesses went to the wall as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to close the sub-post offices is very disturbing.  We are talking <Col N="1304" /> about a large number of sub-post offices. They play a vital role in maintaining the social fabric in rural Ireland.  They act as a central point in keeping small villages in existence.  In some places the sub-post office is one of the few centres where somebody is employed, where there is a sense of continuity.  Many of these places struggle and the threat of the closure of the sub-post offices will very seriously damage the fabric of those places.</P>
    <P>The prospect of closure of sub-post offices in urban areas will present great difficulty for many old people.  Pensioners have become attached to the idea of going to the post office on pension day and meeting a pleasant person behind the counter who at least gives them some sense of importance and value.  If that is changed it is going to create many social problems for people.</P>
    <P>There is also, as Senator Costello said, the irrational nature of the way this is going to work out.  There are contracts in existence between the people who run sub-post offices and An Post.  Those contracts will have a legal validity and under their terms it will not be possible to terminate them.  There will be an irrational series of closures which will be good for nobody.</P>
    <P>I understand the genesis of this problem dates back to an agreement which was reached sometime around 1987.  It seems that in 1987 the attitude of An Post was simply that everything would work its way out and that a kind of a happy accident would occur whereby the terms of the agreement which were reached in 1987 would result in the desired changes. That has not happened.  That is a failure of management.  At that stage a certain number of An Post workers took redundancy, but the management of An Post were unable to get it right.  It is because of that inability to manage the company properly that we are experiencing the present crisis.</P>
    <P>We now seem to have moved into this phase of macho-management, let loose now that the local elections are over and we can let these people rip on the workers in the company.  What is happening is appalling, with 1,600 people being suspended. <Col N="1305" /> In the latter days of the 20th century it is totally unacceptable that that kind of nonsense should be going on.  It is an indictment of management. They have failed miserably when such numbers of people are suspended.  They have also failed miserably when 2,600 people are not being paid.  That is no way to run a company, it is no way to do business and it is totally unacceptable that strong-arm managerial tactics should have been used.</P>
    <P>There is also the proposal to take business away from Iarnród Éireann.  That will put in jeopardy a series of lines operated by Iarnód Éireann.  It is going to put in jeopardy the jobs of people who work in that organisation.  Worse than that in many ways it is going to add to the levels of pollution and to the inconvenience which arises on the roads from the carriage of material up and down the country when that could be carried in a much more suitable and appropriate way by putting it on trains.  I cannot see how this kind of proposal comes about without anybody being prepared to take action to stop the disastrous effects it will have on the viability of Iarnród Éireann, but worse in terms of the effects it will have on people as they drive up and down the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello has dwelt at length on the manner in which what is happening now is in conflict with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> What we have to do is begin to think in terms of solutions.  It is clear that the impression coming from the Minister's approach in relation to this is that she is very much on the side of the management in An Post.  It is a pity and in many ways it is giving encouragement and hope to those people who are prepared to engage in this type of unacceptable managerial practices.  The lack of intervention by the Government in relation to this problem is very much in contrast to the attitude taken by the Government during the bank strike. There is very much a hands-off attitude taken in this instance, whereas in the bank strike there seemed to be a far <Col N="1306" /> greater level of anxiety to reach a solution.</P>
    <P>There are two other points which need to be elaborated on.  One is the question mentioned by Senator Costello of consultants being paid in excess of £1 million by An Post.  I wonder what sort of service is provided by consultants at a cost of more than £1 million.  It is hard to find an easy explanation for somebody such as myself who is not particularly familiar with the activities and behaviour of consultants. I am not familiar with the fees they charge, but looking at those fees you would begin to wonder whether we should all take up some type of consultancy if that is the type of money that is available.  It would still be small money to Senator Cassidy &mdash; I see him smiling.</P>

It is imperative that the Minister let the word go forth to the people in An Post that a solution has to be reached to this problem. The duty, obligations and the function of management is to manage and to run the company properly.  The last thing that is part of a properly run and well managed company is a strike where 1,600 people are suspended and over 2,500 people are not being paid.  That is no way to run a business and I hope the Minister will become much more active in seeking a solution.</P>

    <P>I congratulate the new Minister on her <Col N="1307" /> appointment and wish her well.  She has been a close colleague of mine for a number of years, a lady of great ability, integrity and a very fair person.  I am delighted to see her in this portfolio and I know she will excel in the other portfolios to which she is appointed.</P>
    <P>I speak from the position of having been a postman long before I came into Seanad Éireann.  Possibly, I am the only Member of this House who has been a member of the postal service.  When I was in the service we were very poorly paid; I gather that pay has not improved very much since.  These people are the salt of the earth.  They provide an excellent service, a social service in particular. They have a great rapport with the people they serve so efficiently and excellently. I would like to pay a tribute to them.</P>
    <P>It would be wonderful to be a Senator here tonight speaking from the opposite side of the House.  It is a sensitive time when there is a dispute, particularly a dispute of such magnitude.  I support the Minister's efforts to secure the implementation of measures to restore An Post to financial health without recourse to State subsidies.  State subsidies are the most important issue.  We have a very fine and efficient postal service and An Post provide this service. They were established in 1984 and were given a commercial mandate.</P>
    <P>The annual report for the company for last year shows that their performance in the delivery of letter mail was of a very high standard indeed.  The company succeeded in delivering 93 per cent of letters on the next working day following posting. Last year the growth in mail volume was the best for a number of years.  These facts show that An Post have the capacity and the ability to deliver the goods.  There is no doubt but that the users of the postal services wish to see the company continue to provide a good quality service. However, there is a major problem. The company is losing money.  Clearly that trend has to be reversed and changes must be made, and as we live in a world of change, the postal service cannot escape.</P>
    <P>The employment of temporary and <Col N="1308" /> part-time staff is well established in the provinces.  That arrangement works well and presumably An Post are satisfied that a similar arrangement would work well in Dublin.  I read that the postal service worldwide employ temporary and part-time staff to deal with peak periods and staff taking leave of absence.  If the Revenue Commissioners have a massive amount of mail to be delivered, there is additional overtime or additional temporary staff are brought in.  If Gay Byrne conducts a competition on his &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, it means increased mail for An Post.  This is also the case at Christmas time and St. Patrick's Day.  When I worked in the postal service we were given small amounts of overtime.  One might apply for two hours overtime, but might only get 20 minutes.  However, there was always provision for temporary staff, particularly at Christmas time, to deal with parcel post.</P>
    <P>There are indications that the EC is becoming deeply involved in the postal service and that the EC may wish to introduce liberalisation, in other words, the well established national postal monopoly seems to be coming under some threat.  No doubt the Minister has her own views on this and will make them known to the Commission at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The dispute which is disrupting the postal service is most unfortunate.  I appeal to the management and unions to be as flexible as possible and to get back to the negotiating table.  The longer the dispute, the more deeply entrenched views become and it is the workers and their families who will suffer in the long term.  I appeal to all concerned to get back to the negotiating table and try to come to an agreement; they will eventually reach an agreement, so why not try to do so this week?  The dispute must not spread to the country.</P>
    <P>We heard from a previous speaker how the dispute is affecting business, particularly small businesses, and industry.  As one who has a small tourist related industry, who has invested a lot of time and money and employs a number of people, I want to tell the Minister that this strike <Col N="1309" /> is definitely affecting me.  Were it not for FAX and modern technology, the tourist industry and the tourist season, which God knows is short enough, would be in grave difficulties.  This dispute is benefiting nobody, so why not get back to the negotiating table?</P>
    <P>Figures are bandied around in the media and I have heard that one section of the postal service is getting a lot of money for their services.  That must come to an end sometime, and if it has to be now, let it be now.  I am sure those people are not unreasonable.  I am sure they want to play their part and to secure their own jobs and those of their colleagues in the long term.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to all concerned to get back to the negotiating table and let common sense prevail.  This is 1992 and everybody's view has to be taken into account.  Everybody involved has a responsibility to come back to the negotiating table because it is only through communication that this dispute can be resolved.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for An Post are not confined to the mail service.  The company continue to serve the whole community by providing a wide range of services.  Social Welfare recipients appreciate the important role the company play, An Post provide a wide range of savings services, An Post collect television license and help operate the national lottery.  There is evidence that An Post are a professional company and can provide a wide range of services in a highly efficient manner.  I have no doubt but that the staff wish to see this continue.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with Senator Costello when he said that the north inner city is seriously affected by this dispute. An enormous number of postal service workers come from the north inner city. I have an uncle-in-law who worked in Sheriff Street for many years.  The unemployment position in that area is so serious that it is hard to believe this is the Ireland of 1992.  I concur with Senator Costello's plea about alleviating unemployment in the north inner city.</P>
    <P>The Granby Row Post Office is to close without prior notice being given to any <Col N="1310" /> business in the area.  This is not good enough.  Some of the residents were notified but businesses were ignored.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendment to the House and hope that by this time next week the postal dispute will have been resolved.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas ar dtús leis na Seanadóirí as ucht an rún seo a chur os comhair an Tí agus de bharr go bhfuil deis agam labhairt faoi na cúrsaí atá ag cur as dúinn ar fad chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis An Post, agus leo siúd atá ag obair, pé acu an ag obair mar bhaill den fhoireann atá siad nó mar bhaill den fhoireann bainistíochta.  Ba mhaith liom anois deis a bheith agam na fíricí mar atá siad faoi láthair a chur os comhair an tSeanaid.  Níor mhaith liom tosnú ag caint faoi dhaoine go pearsanta, go háirithe daoine nach bhfuil anseo agus in ann iad féin a chosaint, ach deileáilfidh mé le cuid de na rudaí a bhí le ag rá na Seanadoírí go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators who participated in the debate.  On 20 February 1991, in the course of a debate on a motion on An Post's reorganisation proposals, my predecessor gave a detailed report on An Post's financial problems and the need for changes in the postal service.  Unfortunately, An Post's loss-making problem continues and the need for remedial action becomes more urgent.</P>
      <P>An Post have suffered financial losses since 1989.  Their accumulated losses to end 1991 amounted to £13.8 million and the company are projecting a loss of £8.5 million for 1992.  Their annual overtime bill is £21 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this juncture, I will outline what has been done to facilitate the management-union negotiations on recovery measures for An Post.  Early last year my predecessor arranged for the drawing up of a Government/Irish Congress of Trade Unions formula for the necessary management-union negotiations.  At a later date and in accordance with that formula, he arranged for the negotiations to be held under the auspices of the Labour <Col N="1311" /> Relations Commission, with a view to drawing up proposals to achieve break-even in 1992.  The commission devoted considerable time and effort to this exercise and, in addition, set up an independent tribunal, in agreement with both sides, to make recommendations on An Post's recovery proposals; on certain priority proposals by 15 November, 1991 and on the balance by 31 January 1992. I understand that a total of 41 meetings took place since March 1991.  I regret that, despite all these initiatives and efforts, it has not been possible for management and unions to reach agreement on any significant measure to reverse the loss-making trend in An Post.</P>
    <P>A formula drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission last October, following an industrial dispute in An Post, made provision for deferment of payment of the first phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to postal staff from 1 November 1991 to 1 February 1992, subject to the ability of the company to make the payment.  As the company's financial fortunes had not improved in the meantime An Post could not make the payment on 1 February. However, the company reviewed their position in the light of their worsening financial problems and the genuine concern of postal staff about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> payment.</P>
    <P>An Post decided to proceed with their priority proposals with effect from 27 April and made the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> payment retrospective to 1 November, 1991 to their staff on 15 May 1992.  The proposals include the employment of 250 temporary and part-time staff to reduce overtime levels in the Dublin area and maintain the quality of the mails service as the leave season commences.</P>
    <P>I must refute the claim that An Post are attempting to exploit workers in any way by recruiting temporary and part-time staff.  Already, as Senator Cassidy pointed out, the company employ over 300 temporary and part-time staff in the provinces with pay and conditions agreed <Col N="1312" /> by the Communications Workers Union. All over the world post offices employ temporary and part-time staff because it is the most effective means of matching staff to work levels.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the unions are resisting the implementation of these recovery measures.  Such action will aggravate an already difficult financial situation in An Post and delay the implementation of urgently-needed recovery measures.</P>
    <P>I also want to refute an impression or a perception, and in these days of mass media communications perceptions and notions of ideas are very important, that in some way An Post propose to dismiss postal workers or lay off people.  No such proposal has been put by An Post management. The proposal has been to employ 250 extra people in a temporary capacity.  I would not like it to go abroad that An Post, in some way, were proposing that in the Dublin north inner city area people who are working in Sheriff Street should be made redundant and that the Government and the Minister were going along with that notion.  Let me dispel that impression.</P>
    <P>The development of modern telecommunications services and courier services is providing, as Senator Cassidy pointed out, keen competition for An Post.  The European Commission adopted their Green Paper on the Development of the Single Market for postal services last week.  The paper, which is a discussion document and the lead-up to the drafting of proposals for Community action in the postal sector, envisages the introduction of possible liberalisation measures.  Senators will understand that this could place a further competitive pressure on An Post and other postal administrations in the European Community.</P>
    <P>Our postal service plays a major part in the economic and social life of the community.  It also provides very important agency services particularly in the disbursement of social welfare payments and in attracting funds for the national savings services.  A protracted industrial dispute in the postal service in 1979 <Col N="1313" /> caused serious hardship to the staff as well as to customers.  Also, the economy suffered serious damage.  The community cannot afford a disruption of postal services at this stage.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the unions involved to consider the gravity of An Post's financial position and the danger of causing long term damage to the postal service.  Postal charges were increased in 1990 and 1991 to generate much-needed additional revenue for An Post but the increases were not sufficient to resolve the company's financial problems.  Further general price increases at this stage could not be justified.</P>
    <P>All Governments since An Post were established in 1984 have set their face against subsidising the postal service.  The taxpayer simply cannot afford it.  The pressure from all sides of the House is to reduce the tax burden, not to increase it. A subsidy would be a disincentive for An Post, and their staff in the pursuit of ways and means of reorganising the postal service and of reversing the loss-making situation as well as gearing up the service for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.  Cost-cutting measures in An Post cannot be avoided if the future of the company and their employees is to be secured.  If An Post were to continue on the same basis as they have up to now, at the beginning of 1995 we would not have a postal service and therefore we would not have employment for any of An Post's current employees.  I cannot allow that kind of situation to develop.</P>
    <P>I have received the report of the consultants appointed by my predecessor to study the socio-economic implications for rural communities of An Post's proposals for closure of sub-post offices and the installation of roadside letterboxes.  I will arrange for publication of the report in due course.  An Post are not proceeding with these proposals.</P>
    <P>An Post's present proposals have been examined by the independent tribunal set up by the Labour Relations Commission, as agreed by both sides.  I understand that the tribunal, comprising senior representatives of ICTU and the FIE and chaired by public service arbitrator, Mr. <Col N="1314" /> Hugh Geoghegan, S.C., unanimously made recommendations which An Post have accepted.  What the company are proposing appears to be fully in line with the recommendations of the tribunal and does not go outside the scope of their recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the disruption in mail services caused by the postal dispute.  It is causing problems as Senators Cassidy, Upton and Costello outlined, for business and it is also damaging our international reputation.  I am keeping in close touch with the whole situation.  I am making every possible effort to ensure that the dispute ends at an early date and that the postal service can resume its full and proper role in the economic and social life of the community.</P>
    <P>The Chief Executive of the Labour Relations Commission met both sides for discussion over three days last week but unfortunately sufficient progress was not made between the parties to effect a settlement of the dispute at that stage.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Labour Relations Commission are seeking elaboration from the tribunal of their recommendations. When the commission have received the elaboration they will consider what further action can be taken to help resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will remain in close touch with the situation and I hope that the commission's initiative will lead to further negotiations.</P>
    <P>I refer to remarks made by Senator Costello at the beginning of the debate. I have been very careful in this dispute to look at the issues.  Anybody who knows me well would know that I have a reputation as a straight talker.  I do not waffle around the edges, I come straight to the point.  I have been a straight talker from the very beginning of this dispute.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is helpful to either side in the dispute to start personality bashing.  To call for a man's resignation who is not here to defend himself, or to ask a Government to dismiss him, is an unwarranted attack on an individual who cannot respond.  Emotive language and emotive debate will not help at this stage. <Col N="1315" /> We must ignore personalities and deal very carefully with the issues.</P>
    <P>It is easy to get backed into a corner in a dispute because certain people backed me into the hardline corner.  I have been interested in the tenor of the telephone calls to my office and the messages dropped into my home in Galway.  Regardless of how what is said, it all boils down to a very central question &mdash; which side of this disute is the Minister on?  Is she on management side, which is what Senator Costello in effect was saying?  I want to put on the record something I have said on a number of occasions publicly &mdash; I am on the side of the national interest, I am on the side of the taxpayer.  As Minister, I have no choice.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello talked about difficulties in An Post being related to bad management decisions.  I watched a current affairs programme on television last night and I clearly heard the chief executive of An Post accepting that there were bad management decisions in the past. He accepted that there was fault on both sides, that is what I would expect any good professional manager to do.  I do not think that is in dispute.  What we must focus on are the issues involved in this dispute.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators talked about the non-interventionist attitude of the Minister. Since I went into politics in 1975 I have always been a great believer in Ministers not intervening until it is absolutely necessary.  The trade union movement and employers, and particularly the Congress of Trade Unions, have gone to a lot of trouble to set up labour relations machinery and I feel very strongly, as a former member of a trade union, that the labour relations machinery should be allowed to operate.  The Labour Relations Commission have been involved and there have been results.  We have had the results and recommendations of the tribunal.  The Labour Relations Commission machinery continues to be available.</P>
    <P>I accept and support efforts by both sides to sit around the table.  At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe it <Col N="1316" /> is the Minister, the Government or any individual member of the Government who will resolve this dispute.  It will be resolved by both sides sitting around the table and using the existing labour relation machinery that we all worked so hard to ensure was there.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made here and publicly of the consultancy costs paid by An Post.  To put it on the record, it is fair to say that a large percentage of the consultancy costs were associated with the computerisation of the counter services to improve and extend the range of services to An Post customers, in particular to those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  I do not think any Member would say An Post were wrong to invest in the computerisation of counter services to enable them to be competitive in the post-1992 era when we will be flooded with competiton from the telecommunications end and from other sources as well.</P>
    <P>People have been saying I was not prepared to talk to the unions.  I want to put it on record that I went to Tralee last week to the Conference of the Communications Workers Union; I went from my home in Galway last weekend to the Conference of the Communications Managers Union.  At a time of dispute, it would be the easiest thing in the world if the Minister responsible for the company in dispute with their staff stayed away from the conference.  I feel it is important for whoever has ultimate political responsibility to meet both sides, to go to the conference and listen to what people are saying.</P>
    <P>Many people had a lot to say on the margins of both conferences.  Any utterances I made at either venue were straight talking about the issues and encouraging members of both trade unions to come to the table and negotiate with management.  I am hopeful that when the Labour Relations Commission receive the elaboration of the tribunal's recommendations it will be possible once again for both sides to come to the table. I encourage management and the trade unions to do that.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, this dispute <Col N="1317" /> can only be resolved to the benefit of everybody by both sides sitting down and using the tried and tested industrial relations machinery.  I will work very hard to ensure that every assistance is given by the Labour Relations Commission and others to bring both sides together so that An Post will be viable and restored to a financially healthy state. Working together, everyone, and in particular the Government and I, must ensure that An Post can face the implications of the Green Paper which that just been published by the European Commission on the liberalisation of the postal service and the competitive factors and that they will be in a financially healthy state and capable of taking on the competition and beating it.  That is my attitude and that is what I want to achieve for the ocmpany and their staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The matter before the House is of crucial importance and deserves every consideration.  I am disappointed with the amendment because I do not think it has addressed the issue we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most concerned about the people who are affected by the dispute.  They want immediate action.  One of the Minister's points was that she should not intervene until it was deemed absolutely necessary.  Obviously with any dispute it is difficult to intervene with the toing and froing.  The time has arrived for the Minister to intervene given the fact that she has overall responsibility for An Post, but if not by her by her colleague, the Minister for Labour.  Whether he meets both sides individually or collectively is not my concern.  The main concern is that this dispute be ended as expeditiously as possible.  Small industries, businesses and firms are affected as are individuals who are not getting their post.  I know measures have been taken to try to get around the difficulties.  I know people who depend either wholly or in part on a pension from Newcastle.  The postmen have shown goodwill in this area.  Even those who have been suspended have <Col N="1318" /> gone out of their way to try to see that social welfare cheques are delivered and for this they are to be commended.</P>
    <P>In any dispute there are rights and wrongs on both sides.  I am not going to go into a litany of various matters or An Post's rationalisation plans but there will be changes.  It would be foolish to think that change would not take place in certain areas and that work practices devised years ago would remain the same.  Both sides probably recognise that.</P>
    <P>Direct intervention by the Minister is required and is necessary at this time.  I do not think this matter can be delayed. Some resolution of the difficulties and problems must be found and there must be an evenhanded approach.  Management must recognise that the bull in the china shop approach will not wash.  Obviously in certain areas in Dublin there have been difficulties.  Certain practices there will have to be looked at and examined. Massive losses cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>We must look at how An Post has developed, how it will develop in the 1990s and into the next century and the plans there are to improve it.  There have been many improvements.  Efficiency was mentioned.  An Post have offered a great service with a higher percentage of letters and parcels being delivered either the next day or within a day.  I compliment the staff who work at the various levels who achieved this.  They sift through oceans of mail and ensure that despite possible difficulties in relation to handwriting and so on, the bulk of letters arrive on the due date.</P>
    <P>This problem must be resolved.  Either the Minister or the Minister for Labour should intervene.  I agree with what has happened in relation to the Labour Relations Commission.  Some matters are being looked at and it seems to be a long drawn-out process.  There are many people who cannot afford to wait &mdash; small businesses and individuals depending on English pensions cannot afford to wait. What we need is an immediate resolution of this dispute and not just, in the Minister's words, &ldquo;Keeping abreast of the situation,&rdquo; telephoning now and again to see how the situation is progressing. <Col N="1319" /> What we need is a Minister who will sit down with both sides and discuss the issues with them.</P>
    <P>Unlike the bank strike where there seemed to be an awareness of the problems and when there were difficulties there was a Minister on hand, this dispute is drifting along.  Maybe the problem is a long way from Galway.  I suppose until some postmen go on strike down there that it will not be brought home to the Minister.  I am sure the Leader of the House has had representations made to him in relation to the difficulties experienced by many individuals.  As public representatives we are aware of the difficulties it poses for people.  Tonight we must stop the rot.  We need the intervention of the Minister and we need it now.  I appeal for discussions to be held with a view to resolving the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate this evening.  It strikes me at the outset that once again, unfortunately, we have a very difficult and delicate situation with regard to the internal negotiations that must be gone through in some of our major companies and all of the attendant matters that tends to raise in the context of major and substantial change in any organisation. It is never easy to get all sides to agreed on what is the best direction.</P>
      <P>Everybody has the right in the first instance, particularly from the union's point of view, to protect their members and the jobs involved.  As a Government and as a country we are all trying to create more jobs.  When one looks at a rationalisation programme that involves perhaps the shedding of jobs one is always wary of the difficulties that are directly involved.  Reference was made earlier by my colleague, Senator Upton, to Waterford Crystal and he likened the similarity of the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kenneally to the House this evening.  He comes from my constituency in Waterford.  It is good to see him here involved in this debate.  There are realities that must be faced.  Some drastic <Col N="1320" /> mistakes were made by management in the past.  Equally, there have been mistakes by unions in the past but that is no benefit in trying to move forward particularly in the case of An Post.  It is quite clear to me and it is probably quite clear to everybody in An Post that technology has advanced rapidly in the past number of years not alone in their industry but in many other industries.</P>
    <P>Communication nowadays is about speed: the faster one can deliver the message by Fax or telephone information is crucial.  Most of that is done electronically now but in the past a larger workforce was required.  It is now such a heavily burdened industry in the telecommunications area, which is developing practically on a daily basis, that this organisation in order to protect the people who work in it will have to make changes and alterations.  This is particularly so in the context of growing competition not alone in this country, of which An Post are fully aware, but also in a European sense.  This is leading to redeployment of people.</P>
    <P>If a company is not able to compete at the sharpest end, it will continue to row backwards, mount debt and become less viable.  It is in the interests of all in the workforce and in management to ensure that the workforce are allowed to participate in a company to ensure that the company's financial base is improved and that they are allowed to develop and invest further in their core business.  That will protect jobs in that company.  For example, many people in Waterford Crystal would say that if technology had been phased in over the years, the present impasse and difficulties might not have arisen.  That also applies in some respects to the people in An Post.</P>
    <P>The reality is that no Government, irrespective of who is in power, can afford to continually use taxpayers' money to subsidise a system that should be capable of at least breaking even, and probably making substantial profits which should be reinvested in the company to ensure that the company have the greatest opportunity in the marketplace because they are the biggest and sustain the <Col N="1321" /> greatest share of the activities in the communications area.  That is basically what it is all about.  A company cannot expect to be subsidised when they should be in a position to make profit.</P>
    <P>The cost of overtime in this company is £21 million, a huge amount.  This raises the question, which as a member of the jobs forum I am sure will be on the table: who is going to define employment and who should be employed?  We have 300,000 people unemployed and a wealth of work to be done.  Somehow, over the last decade, we have failed abysmally at all levels of Government to bring those two equations together.  I ask people who are in full time employment if it is right that so much money should be spent on overtime when many other jobs &mdash; part-time or through job sharing or some other method &mdash; could be created to take people out of the social morass.  This problem is not peculiar to Dublin or anywhere else; it exists in Waterford, Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The definition of employment will have to be answered by both management and unions.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to put down a marker in this debate and say that companies with substantial overtime requirements should not use so much of their funds paying overtime but should employ more people on a full-time basis and help to reduce our massive unemployment figure.  This will have to be looked at seriously.</P>
    <P>In the context of the situation in An Post two things are required &mdash; a reduction in the level of overtime and a definition of the employment that is available in the company.  There may have to be many part-time workers. There will always be peaks and valleys in the postal service which will always need to employ many people but perhaps not on the basis on which people have heretofore been employed in that or in other organisations.  I am not trying to single out An Post.  This is a problem that is running through many different industries in private industries, State industries or whatever.</P>
    <P>On the question of ministerial intervention &mdash; and I have learned this the <Col N="1322" /> hard way &mdash; irrespective of who is Minister, ultimately, it will be the people involved who will solve this dispute.  I dislike third party intervention because it may lead to what can be termed by one side as a forced solution.  I prefer the people involved in a dispute, no matter how difficult or painful the arguments and debates, to reach a conclusion and for both sides, to understand where they are going and what the outcome of their agreement will be after long, hard and sustained negotiation.  There is no need at this stage for the Minister to become involved.  In too many cases, ministerial intervention is perceived as the first option but it is only after all other procedures have been exhausted that a Minister should be involved.  At this juncture, that is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I urge all those involved in this dispute to get together and try to find a way forward.  The people who will pay the price in this dispute are those who work there.  Finally, I ask people to bear in mind the difficulties being created for so many small industries who are struggling and the damage this dispute is doing to tourism, etc.</P>

    <P>This issue is not as simple as it has been presented either by the Minister or in some of the comments that have been made since then.  I want to clear the cobwebs in a number of areas.  As a member of the executive council of the ICTU, it is important to put on the record that as late as this morning the executive council of ICTU, by unanimous vote issued full support for the Communications Workers Union and what they are doing in this dispute.  I wish to place it on the <Col N="1323" /> record that were it not for the CWU there now be an all-out strike because management are doing nothing, they are acting irresponsibly, they are, in effect, almost operating a lock out.  They seem to be trying to create an all out strike.  It is to the credit of the workers and the union that they have managed to resist that.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that we are an island state and by the end of this year we will be the only island member state in the Europe Community.  Because of our extraordinarily high telephone charges and transportation costs, there should be European support and a subsidy for the Irish mail services.  There is no doubt that we have a very strong case.</P>
    <P>In this dispute the media seem to have cast the union in a very poor role and I want to clarify a number of points.  I agree with Senator Cullen that this extraordinary overtime bill cannot be justified when the money could be used to create real jobs.  I want to put firmly on the record that the union and staff side have said that this is what they want.  What I was waiting to hear from Senator Cullen and the Government side was that we were not talking about casualisation, which is simply another words for the exploitation of workers without security of tenure.  We have not heard any proposal from the management side to replace overtime with real jobs, but hear a proposal to replace overtime with casual staff.  I want to make it clear that Members of this House have not been confused by this effort to fudge the edges between casual staff and temporary staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the independent tribunal set up by the Labour Relations Commission and the fact that it had set out four principal proposals.  It proposed the phasing out of overtime, the relocation of some of the Dublin, the closure of productivity deals and there should be an agreed ratio between temporary and full-time staff.  I want to put it on record that the union side accepted these proposals.  The management have now turned around and taken on casual staff but they are pretending <Col N="1324" /> to the general public, and to the Government, that these casual staff are, in fact, temporary staff.  There is no comparison between the two.  They are two quite distinct and different roads which are clearly understood, and have been clearly understood, by management and staff for as long as they have been dealing with each other.</P>
    <P>Casual staff in An Post are people who are employed at Christmas time to help with the extra mail, they work on a week to week basis.  Temporary staff have a contract of employment for a specified period.  They take up a position until it is decided whether permanent staff are needed.  This is similar to the teaching area and the difference between substitute and temporary jobs.  They are two different and distinct things.  This distinction has not been made clear in the media.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Cullen said here tonight but he is being misinformed by people who say the union are not prepared to address the overtime issue &mdash; they are and they have said so &mdash; and that An Post are prepared to take on extra staff.</P>
    <P>Casual staff are employed on a week to week basis and at the whim of the next level of management.  They are at the mercy of the people above them and they do not have access to the support of labour legislation like the Unfair Dismissals Act, etc.  It is a unacceptable status to grant any worker and it does not fit into any of the definitions given by the social partners &mdash; that is, the Government, unions and employers &mdash; as to what we mean by employment.  It certainly is not taking people on on a casual basis. Everybody has said that.  There is work to be done.  There are real jobs there. Let us hear proposals from the company to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Communications Workers Union have put forward a series of proposals which have agreed a ratio of temporary to full-time staff; they propose that it should be on a two to one basis.  I do not have the time to go into detail but it is important to recognise that what is happening here is an attempt by management <Col N="1325" /> to close the union, to create an all-out strike and to lay off staff who have proved themselves to be flexible, adaptable, successful and highly productive.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder there is a lack of confidence between management and union at this stage.  How can the union trust the management who are trying to introduce casual contracts and pretend they are temporary contracts?  That is not the case and if nothing else comes out of this debate, let us all be clear about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she was on the side of the taxpayer and I welcome that but I want to put one thing on the record. Every worker in An Post is a taxpayer. Every one pays his or her tax on a week to week basis, and I would like to see the Minister on their side.  For all that she is being backed into the hard line corner, I know her well enough and long enough to know that she will also listen to an argument and put forward a point of view.</P>
    <P>The workers in An Post are being badly treated.  The trade union representing An Post workers are being badly misrepresented in the media and publicly.  It behoves us as elected representatives to ensure that there is a service provided, that the company treat their workers properly and as a company operating in the semi-State area we must ensure that our responsibility to the workers are fully discharged.  The union are prepared to talk and be flexible.  They are prepared to talk about a ratio between part-time and permanent staff.  I would now ask where are the management?  What have they to say to us?  Let us hear from them and clear away the cobwebs.  Let us get rid of the myths and get down to business. Let us deal with the workers in a dignified and proper way.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator.  An Post are an extremely efficient organisation. I have before me the <i>Evening Press</i> of 14 May in which there was a report of the remarks made by EC Commissioner, Filipo Pandolfi, who indicated that we among a very small group of countries in the European Community, have actually met the target of 90 per cent next day deliveries.  We have already a very efficient and good service.  God be with the days of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> when a letter posted on one side of the bay reached the other in the afternoon. The evidence of that is in the text of <i>Ulysses.</i>  Still the present day operation is very efficient.  Many other European countries only reach 15 per cent of this quota.</P>
      <P>There is a suspicion among a number of people that what is happening here is an attempt at casualisation, what could be regarded roughly as a sort of designer strike cemented by management with the intention of breaking unions.  There is a very curious pattern emerging with the banks, RTE and now An Post.  The ordinary consumer is caught like a nut in a nut cracker, right in the middle.  I speak with some feeling because I am organising an international James Joyce symposium, a very prestigious event.  We are expecting 1,000 scholars from all over the world.  We have 500 registrants already and the remaining 500 applications are caught up in the post, not becuse of the workers' action but because of management intransigence.  It is very difficult to deal with organising banks, accommodation and so on, and this particularly affects a country like ours where we are dependent on tourism.</P>
      <P>People have been suspended without pay.  I find it extraordinary that people working in the post office system are not getting their pay, although An Post appear to be able to pay the casual workers they have brought in as strike breakers and I would like the Minister to answer that.  How can the strike breakers be paid but not the people who are working, who are not in a dispute and have not been suspended?  That is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suspensions must be lifted.  Wages <Col N="1327" /> should be paid immediately to those who are working.  The Minister should intervene. Unfortunately she has damaged her position by appearing to come down sharply on the side of the employers and this kind of macro management should be got rid of.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words about this very serious dispute.  It is serious in the sense that our dole queues are very long and they are getting longer by the week.  The dispute is causing hardship for employers who are trying to keep people in work.  It is unfortunate and will mean that other people will lose their jobs.  I appeal to both sides to come together as soon as possible to sort out this sorry mess but I hope it will not be at the expense of the excellent service that has been provided by staff in all the post offices in rural Ireland.  I hope that this dispute will not be fixed at the expense of the people in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Services are limited enough in rural Ireland and the people who run the average rural post offices are paid peanuts. We appreciate the service An Post give us in rural Ireland and also in larger post offices.  We are getting an excellent service and we intend to hold on to it.  I hope the settlement will not hinder that service.  I appeal to the common sense of the people &mdash; we hear of a person getting £40,000 overtime pay in the sorting office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason for that?  With so many people unemployed that is unfair.  I am quoting from the papers.  The taxpayer will have to foot the bill if this dispute is not sorted out. The cost of postage is high and people cannot afford to carry any further burden of personal taxation.  The Government <Col N="1328" /> cannot afford to sink this country any further in debt.  The national debt is already enormous.  I hope common sense will prevail and that it will not be at the expense of the excellent service we get in rural Ireland from post office officials.  I am totally opposed to letter boxes at the end of the road in rural areas because it would be unfair to expect people living in isolated areas to walk a mile to pick up a letter.</P>
      <P>The dole queues are long and everybody wants to shorten them.  The people listening to us have families and I appreciate that a strike brings hardship.  The sooner it is sorted out the better.  I appeal for common sense in the national interest.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members to express my concern and my hope that the postal dispute will soon end.  Everyone knows our economy is made up of small businesses, each of them depending on day-to-day payments whether for Government contracts, state payments or whatever.  The postal service plays a vital role in keeping small businesss alive.  Everyone realises we have had a very efficient service until now.  I was proud to hear that Ireland has one of the most efficient postal services in Europe and the highest percentage of next day deliveries.  The people in the postal service must bear in mind that there is no future for them or their families if the service must depend on subsidy from the hard pressed taxpayer who is already paying for millions of pounds lost in Irish Rail and Irish Shipping and through intervention in various endangered organisations.  It is not on. The economy of the country must stand on its feet.  Workers here are not as good as the German, British or French workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every public representative is concerned for the future of the postal service. I am concerned about a threat to close central post offices in Donegal and Lifford. The only case I can make to retain a central post office in Lifford is on the grounds that I can say to any Minister that Lifford post office is a central and viable post office.  I say to workers in Sheriff Street, Lifford, Donegal, Kerry and elsewhere, &ldquo;Look to your future and to the future of your families.&rdquo;  If the post business is economically viable it will thrive if workers are sensible, adopt technology and use it to compete with the rest of Europe.  That is the only future for our first-class postal service.  I spoke to a prominent trade union representative recently who said: &ldquo;I fight very hard for my workers but I would never take them out on strike.  I have a record of never having them out on strike.  I get the best deal possible but I have to be sensible at the end of the day <Col N="1330" /> about who is going to pay.&rdquo;  That is very important in the current situation.</P>
    <P>The postal workers can continue to blame An Post but they must gain public support.  Taxpayers ask where tax is being spent.  There is no future for any service not able to stand on its feet.  Irish workers are capable of providing a first-class service and I hope they will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I refer to one section of it.  The Minister referred in her speech to the consultants appointed to study the socio-economic implications for rural communities of An Post.  She said she would publish the study soon and then she made an important statement: &ldquo;An Post is not proceeding with these proposals.&rdquo;  The proposals were for the closure of sub-post offices and the installation of roadside letter boxes.  Rural Ireland must welcome that commitment.  It is an important statement that has been missed by many. I will refer to it later.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the workers in An Post for their excellent work over the years.  It is disappointing that An Post is now involved in a serious industrial dispute with grave national implications. One must be careful in dealing with the issues involved as negotiations have not been completed.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in industrial relations for over 20 years and I cannot understand why a company would not pay members of its workforce who are working during a dispute.  They should be paid.  These people are giving their services to the organisation, they may have to pass pickets, which can be very embarrassing and then they are punished by not being paid.  This does not make sense in any industrial relations milieu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why suspensions should take place.  Surely it is important that as many people as possible stay at work and out of dispute.  Management are alienating many of the workforce which makes for heightened feelings when suspensions take place; suspensions might be the wrong term.  It <Col N="1331" /> looks more like a lock-out of certain members of An Post.</P>
    <P>High levels of overtime have been referred to and I have seen some figures for this.  It is accepted in industrial relations that overtime should not be guaranteed in the workplace.  If overtime becomes a customary practice, negotiations should take place between management and unions to sort out the position.  I will not elaborate as it might interfere with discussions between the parties.</P>
    <P>Negotiations should take place about overtime and agreement should be reached in a fair and equitable fashion between the sides.  There should not be a unilateral decision by either side that (1) they are going to withdraw overtime or (2) they will not accept the approach of the other side.  I do not accept that overtime should be guaranteed in any organisation.  It is understandable that it contributes to one's standard of living and should therefore be part of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The problem with the present dispute is that it affects large sections of the community and if it continues it will affect employment.  At present it is affecting the tourism business in Kerry and possibly elsewhere.  Hoteliers are frustrated and concerned about the present situation. Many people from abroad who would book with them are unaware of the situation in Ireland and bookings or correspondence are trapped in the post.</P>
    <P>Small businesses use An Post to collect debts and they too, are affected.  People try to pay a bill as late as possible which puts additional pressure on a small business. People who wish to improve their credit management and delay payment by saying that the letter is in the post or that they are unable to forward it through the post have the opportunity now to do so.  If small businesses collect their debts themselves it is an extra cost on them.  As a result of this dispute jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right to say that she should only get involved as a last resort but that time has now arrived.  The next stage will probably be the closure of <Col N="1332" /> An Post throughout the State which will precipitate a crisis.  Nobody wants that, so while there is an opportunity to defuse the situation the Minister should intervene because the interventions of the industrial relations commission to date have not proved successful.  This dispute has gone on too long.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that she will not close rural post offices. The closure of post offices would contribute to destroying the fabric of rural Ireland which has suffered mass emigration and migration to the Dublin area. The postal service is a key service with which a community can identify.  Six weeks ago when a rural post office was closed in Carrigkerry the effect on the community was unbelievable.  Carrigkerry is in a remote rural area where 80 pensioners availed of the services of the local post office.  These people now must travel three to five miles to collect their pensions on Friday.  They were used to the service in their local area and it was customary for the postmistress to check up on anyone who failed to collect a pension and to deliver it personally. Those pensioners must now get somebody to drive them to Newcastlewest or Ardagh to collect the mail.  The case was brought to the attention of the Minister who did not see fit to intervene with An Post other than to make the normal representations.  The activity and commerce which rural post offices brought to villages were important.  People came to the local village to do their shopping and to have a drink and a chat; the village was the centre of the community.  With the closure of the local post office people now must travel to Newcastlewest a larger town where the service will be more impersonal.</P>
    <P>I do not support Senator Dardis' contention that the post office must make a profit in every area.  There is a social dimension to the postal service which we must recognise and which is enshrined in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems as though Senator Norris appreciated that point. He was going so rapidly that I am sure he condensed a three minutes' contribution into two.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House but I am disappointed that the Minister for Communications did not see fit to stay on for the entire debate.  It will not be possible for us to raise this issue in Private Members' time for another six months. The least she might do was to stay for the entire debate to hear what was said by all Senators.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  The general tenor of the remarks from all sides was that we should seek a speedy resolution to the dispute and that the strength of rightness lies with the postal workers.  There has been strong criticism here of management's approach to the dispute.  I was delighted at the extent of support expressed for the postal workers and for the Communications Workers Union.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has, at last, indicated that she wants to see this dispute resolved through negotiation and encourages all sides to get involved and that An Post is not going to proceed with the closure of sub-post offices throughout the country or the introduction of roadside letterboxes until the results of the investigative study are published and presumably followed by a public debate on that report.  That is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The tone of the Minister's reply was unsatisfactory however and out of line with the final remark that she was being fair to all sides.  Her reply does not contain a good word for the union while there are large pats on the back for management. In her reply she said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refute the claim that An Post <Col N="1334" /> is attempting to exploit workers in any way by recruiting temporary and part-time staff.  Already the company employs over 300 temporary and part-time workers in the provinces with pay and conditions agreed by the Communications Wokers Union.</P>
    <P>Employing casual workers in the sorting office in Sheriff Street was never a tradition and there is a world of difference between temporary workers and casual workers in the area of rights and entitlements. One has no rights and entitlements as a casual worker; one does as a temporary or part-time worker.  What the Minister said is not accurate.  She put it wrongly when she said: &ldquo;The proposals include the employment of 250 temporary and part-time staff to reduce overtime levels&rdquo;.  Clearly the employment of 250 casual workers is being suggested by An Post.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the unions are resisting the implementation of these recovery measures.</P>
    <P>She is disappointed with the unions and satisfied with An Post.  The Minister, despite the statement, is taking sides in the dispute.  She is not intervening in an attempt to resolve it but is intervening in the dispute on behalf of one side.</P>
    <P>It is unforgiveable that the Minister allowed casualisation to go through while the Communications Workers Union was balloting on proposed changes on productivity and casualisation in relation to the deal put forward following the independent tribunal.  The nub of the issue was whether casualisation should take place.  The Minister allowed casualisation to be introduced at a time when the union was balloting its members on the issue. That adds fuel to the fire because no trade union can allow workers to be exploited. There were 150 full time vacancies and a large number of temporary staff could have been given contracts, but what did management introduce?  It introduced casual labour without rights, displacing people with entitlements to secure employment.  That is totally unacceptable from the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> The Minister criticised me for referring to the chief executive officer.  I make no apologies for referring to the chief executive officer and to management because the problem begins at that source.  The dispute began because of proposals in 1987-88 on voluntary redundancy. The result of that higgledy piggledy approach to reducing staff was large scale overtime which has given rise to the present problem where vacancies have been filled and a large amount of money is spent on overtime.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a dispute in An Post over payment of the 6 per cent negotiated by the CWU.  At that time An Post refused to grant that entitlement until such time as the viability plan were introduced. But after a two day dispute and a ban on overtime by workers, management agreed to pay the 6 per cent. They agreed to look for a break-even and the trade union agreed.  An Post agreed to pay the 4 per cent agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in February of this year.  It was paid on 15 May during the dispute; nobody has received the money yet.  We are talking about 4 per cent plus 3 per cent that has not been paid when workers in other organisations have received 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is important that the parties go back to the Labour Relations Commission for clarification on any of the matters.  On 27 April, there was a unilateral statement from An Post that they were going to cease the productivity deals.  Let us not overlook a certain irony there.  The productivity deals came about because of the 1987 bonus and consolidation which was not what the unions wanted in the first place, they did not want this approach to it.  Secondly, An Post declared it was going to introduce 250 casual workers and third it would close Sheriff Street.  All that was done without allowing the unions to go through the process negotiated with the industrial relations commission which was to have a ballot and to return to the Labour Relations Commission in order to deal with it.  Any changes of this magnitude must be dealt with through negotiation <Col N="1336" /> and through balloting.  It is not sufficient for An Post to accept them; the workers must accept them as well.</P>
    <P>I have no problem in calling for the resignation of the chief executive of An Post.  He has left a trail of destruction through Guinness, Dublin Bus, An Bord Gáis and has done untold damage to industrial relations nationally as well as causing the loss of thousands of jobs. The best words to describe him are serial company killer.  He is doing nothing for An Post which had a £3.1 million overrun last year.  Now we have a £3 million loss per week because of the present dispute. One thousand three hundred staff have been suspended or locked out; 2,600 workers are unpaid.  The union went to the High Court and got a decision that the seven workers who took the action should be paid and that An Post was wrong.  An Post are now appealing this decision to the Supreme Court.  Those are not the actions of a body intent on achieving a negotiated consensual solution to this matter.</P>
    <P>I understand that 200 postmen and women in the Foxrock, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin areas of County Dublin who were due to be paid by An Post have just had their wages withheld.  These workers are working normally in an area called the survey branch which has a separate administrative structure.  There is no reason they could not be paid, yet An Post refused to pay them.  This is a callous approach by An Post to people doing a day's work who do not have access to any social welfare payments.  They and their families are being victimised by An Post. I cannot come to any conclusion other than to call for the sacking of the chief executive, Mr. Hynes, if he is not prepared to resign.</P>
    <P>I always find it very strange that any process of rationalisation, whether a company is making money or losing money, begins and ends with the shedding of jobs.  In this era of extremely high unemployment, 281,000, we should be looking a bit more sympathetically towards how we are going to rationalise procedures <Col N="1337" /> without first and foremost saying, as has been said in this case, 20 per cent of the employees are going to lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot just wash her hands of it all.  She cannot act like Pontius Pilate, say it is not her responsibility and, at the same time, weigh in on behalf of An Post.  We have reached a crisis situation.  We must have Ministerial responsibility and Ministerial intervention. Otherwise An Post will be so <Col N="1338" /> severely undermined it will be very difficult to pull the pieces together again.  In the interests of An Post, of the workers, the business community and the entire community, I call on the Minister to get involved as an honest broker in this issue. She must let it be seen quite clearly that she has the interests of the nation and the workers at heart as well as the interests of management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the time and trouble to come into the House to listen to this debate this evening.</P>
      <P>As the terms of the Adjournment Motion indicate very clearly, there is a great deal of concern among many people in the Dublin area in general about the proposal to construct an incinerator at St. James's Hospital.  That concern extends throughout the city.  It is particularly strong close to St. James's Hospital, in Rialto and in the areas south of the canal.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the environmental impact study should go ahead.  I understand there is an obligation to conduct such a study and that is going to be done. It is also very important that the results of the environmental impact study be published and that its terms of reference should be made available.  The public wishes to know when this study will be completed and to what extent the information available will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The manner in which this country has implemented the EC directive which requires that such studies be carried out is unsatisfactory.  The Minister is only too well aware that Article 3 of that directive has not been fully implemented here. Accordingly, there is no obligation on this country to make all the details available. I would ask the Minister for a commitment that those details will be made known.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also that we should have full information on all the alternatives and all the options for the disposal of clinical waste.  It is very important that the decision should be reached only after those alternatives are fully explained and analysed and after the implications of all the options are made known.</P>
      <P>Concern is not confined to the residents who live in the general area adjoining St. James's Hospital.  I understand 700 members of the staff of St. James's Hospital have signed a petition asking that this proposal should not be implemented, that the incinerator should not be located there.  Of those 700, I am sure very many would be medically qualified, many would have nursing qualifications and scientific qualifications. These people are particularly well informed on the risks which arise from the disposal of clinical waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is only too well aware of the dangers attached to incineration, and the likely production of toxic chemicals. <Col N="1341" /> I suggest to the Minister that the full implications of the effects of small doses of toxic chemicals, or potentially toxic chemicals, are not well understood.  We do not have an adequate level of data to be able to speak with certainty or confidence about the long term implications of low levels of exposure.  Of particular concern is the effect and impact of the incineration of PVC materials, substances which give rise to a whole series of chemicals, in particular dioxin, which is of major concern.  However, I would not limit the concern just to dioxin.  A whole series of chemicals is involved.</P>
    <P>People are worried about the long term effects of this proposal, the effects of exposure during pregnancy and the danger to young people, which could impact on them later on.  One has only to look at the studies on stilbestrol which was used with great confidence some years ago.  We are now seeing all too clearly the terrifying effecs which that has had on the daughters of mothers who were treated with it during pregnancy.  I would like the Minister to take those concerns into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Upton for sharing his time with me.  I do not intend to restate the problem as it has been presented by Senator Upton.  We are asking the Minister to listen to the voice of the people in the locality.  The attitude of the people in the area is not just that it should not be in their back yard.  They do not seek to push it into somebody else's back yard either.  They have taken a very responsible attitude towards this, but their needs are not being met.</P>
      <P>This matter also shows some serious flaws in legislation.  It shows that the commitment to an environmental impact study as required under the EC directive is not responded to adequately in Irish legislation.  The type of EIS implemented in Ireland does not quite comply with the detail of the EC directive.  That point needs to be addressed and is a matter of concern to the local people who wonder about the adequacy of the study that will be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> This is an unhealthy option.  The creation of dioxin and other toxic chemicals causing a difficulty and will continue to do so.  As well as being unhealthy it is the easiest option.  It does not address the issues which have been addressed in many other countries.  In California, for example, a ban has been put on any extra incinerators in the past five years.  In Denmark, the amount of incineration has been reduced by 70 per cent in recent years.  There is a different way of doing it which should be examined and accessed. An Irish company, at present, is attempting to provide an alternative to incineration. In the context of job creation, that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The local people do not know what is going on.  They do not know who decided on this, what exactly has been decided, what process will take place or how much material it is proposed to have disposed of in this new incinerator.  Neither has there been any technical explanation of the precise process to be implemented. The local people want to listen, to hear and to address this problem.  They are being fobbed off.  That may not be intentional but it is the message that is coming across.  There have been meetings and interaction with the community but there has been a total lack of detail in the information provided.  It has been said to the local people that this is a state-of-the-art model of incineration, this is a space age model, they do not have to worry.  If that is so, they are going through a lot of unnecessary worry at present.  Somebody should explain in technical terms the precise procedure it is planned to put into operation here, so that they can have an assessment made from their own point of view with reference to their own resources.  That is the least that needs to be done and if that is not done quickly, there is a danger that people will take a more polarised position and it might be far more difficult to make progress on this issue later.</P>
    <P>People are now open to at least hear the case, listen to the reasons, get all the details and to move on from there.  There is no safe place to do this type of operation and it is also clear that it is not <Col N="1343" /> covered by the planning regulations. Under the planning regulations it would appear that the use of an existing, ordinary incinerator or dump can be changed overnight to an incinerator which will produce toxins without any need for planning approval.</P>
    <P>I know that a planning application has been lodged, but that begs the question as to what happens after the planning process has been gone through and what will be the position down the line.  We have heard tonight that local people want reassurances about what is going on and who are seeking information.  They have looked at what happened in other countries with a view to protecting the environment and the people, and to dealing with this issue in the most humane and environmentally friendly way possible. That has not been done here.</P>
    <P>The possibility of reducing the toxic elements in the materials to be incinerated has to be addressed.  The prospect of alternative ways of dealing with certain materials rather than simply mass incineration needs to be addressed.  New forms of disposal have to be considered. None of these things has been done at this point.  People want to be reassured and to have the facts, if there is a better way of doing it they want to know about it, they want to know what is being proposed and the risks involved.  Those are fair questions and I hope that the Minister tonight and, perhaps, in further discussions down the line, will clarify the position and insist that local people meet the people in the hospital and elsewhere who can give them the information they require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to this important issue and I thank Senator Upton for raising it and Senator O'Toole for his contribution to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department and the health agencies are currently re-examining the options for disposing of hospital waste in the light of proposed new stricter EC envirionmental emission standards. <Col N="1344" /> The two main current methods of disposal are incineration for clinical waste and burying at tipheads for non-clinical waste.  Others technologies which are under investigation for the disposal of clinical waste include steam sterilisation and a grinding and chemical disinfection process.</P>
    <P>Hospitals, by the nature of the medical treatments which are performed in them, will produce waste which is bacteriologically dangerous and must be made safe.  The most common method used internationally of rendering such infectious waste harmless is to raise it to a temperature which will destroy all living organisms.  This has traditionally been done in the hospital incinerator.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the incineration of hospital waste gives rise to products of combustion which must be discharged into the atmosphere.  With the present generation of incinerators, these products will frequently include visible smoke and can cause atmospheric pollution. There is no way of avoiding the production of infectious waste from hospitals and so the challenge is to render it safe while not causing pollution.</P>
    <P>I am aware that criticisms have been made from time to time in relation to the arrangements currently in force for the disposal of hospital waste.  Some of these critisms relate to the use of incinerators that are alleged to be defective or inadequate. Many of the hospital incinerators currently in use have been stated to be incapable of reaching the required temperatures for efficient operation.  I accept that many of these criticisms are justified. The fact is that many of our hospital incinerators are not geared to the level of performance required to meet today's rigorous standards on a continuous basis. These standards are becoming more demanding year by year in response to society's increasing concern for the environment.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not disputing the fact that there are problems associated with present incineration arrangements and, while I cannot anticipate the policy on waste disposal that will emerge from my Department's studies, cost considerations <Col N="1345" /> would tend to suggest a solution based on a smaller number of centralised facilities around the country.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been received for the installation of a central incinerator at St. James's Hospital to dispose of the clinical waste from all Dublin Hospitals. Some of the arguments in favour of a central incinerator are as follows: the cost of scrubbing, filtration and monitoring on each hospital site would be prohibitive; heat recovery is possible and valuable; 24 hour operation is possible, leading to cleaner operation and a smaller incinerator; and better mangement and supervision is possible.</P>
    <P>The proposal to locate a central incinerator at St. James's Hospital arose from technical and economic considerations, including the following: a building, 45 metre high flues and site road network are already there; St. James's has a large requirement for heat.  An annual saving of £90,000 is possible on the present fuel bill; St. James's is itself one of the largest producers of clinical waste.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the public concern which has been expressed by and on behalf of the residents of the areas surrounding St. James's Hospital, unfortunately, due to other commitments, my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy John O'Connell, cannot be here this evening, but I understand he had a meeting with a representative group of residents on 2 April and was able to assure them, as I assure you now, Senators, first, that no decision has been taken to proceed with a central incinerator at St. James's Hospital, second, that if such a decision to proceed were to be taken, then the project would be the subject of an environmental impact study and a full planning application and, third, that the residents will be kept fully informed at all stages.  In addition, as I have said already, I have initiated a study of locations for central incinerators and of alternative processes to incineration.</P>
    <P>No decision will be taken to proceed further with the proposal for a central incinerator at St. James's Hospital until the Minister and I have carefully examined our Department's option appraisal <Col N="1346" /> of a range of solutions to the problem of disposal of clinical waste.  This whole question is extremely complicated and my Department are in constant touch with the Department of the Environment in relation to the feasibility of different waste disposal options in the context of EC Directive and draft directive requirements.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator and his colleague again for raising this important question. I am aware of the understandable concern of other Senators, including Senators O'Toole and Costello, and of the local residents in relation to this central incinerator proposal and I can give a categorical assurance that these concerns will be taken fully into account in the formulation of my Department's future policy for the disposal of hospital waste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Like everybody else I was delighted to see him becoming Minister.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I put down this motion is that some years ago I lived in Thailand for approximately nine months. I have a special regard for Thailand and its people; you could not meet nicer or more friendly people anywhere.  The events over the past few days were tragic and, hopefully, the situation will not deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years a military type officer class has grown up in Thai society.  There have been, approximately, 17 military coups since 1932.  The aim of this military class is to get their hands on power and they do not like anything that might disturb the cosy arrangement which has been in place since, approximately, 1932. Because Thailand has changed dramatically in economic terms over the years, it is now one of the more successful countries in that part of the world.  In fact, it is one of the few countries in that area that has been a huge exporter of food for many years.  That has always <Col N="1347" /> been to its advantage because of the food shortage in so many other countries.</P>
    <P>Because the country has grown economically, the middle class people are demanding a normal democratic system of government to try to develop the country on an economic and social basis.  For example, in a recent election more than 50 per cent of the people voted, whereas normally approximately 30 per cent cast their vote.  The country is changing and there is huge support for change in Thailand at present.  This afternoon I spoke with some friends, one of them an Irish person, who live there and they told me there is great support from all people in Thailand, for change and especially for the former Governor of Bangkok, Mr. Scrimuang who is well respected and showed he is free of corruption which, unfortunately, has been almost a way of life for certain politicians and military officers in Thailand.</P>
    <P>There is great concern at the indiscriminate shooting of citizens in Bangkok and other parts of Thailand.  There is a TV and radio black-out at present and I gather this evening that some units of the Army are now approaching Bangkok. There is a great fear that this could lead to direct clashes between the ruling military people in Bangkok and other forces who do not go along with their policies.  This could have serious consequences for the people of Bangkok.</P>
    <P>The Government, in conjunction with the EC partners, should take a stand against the military governors in Thailand.  This conflict is having a huge effect on the tourism industry in Thailand. I believe tourists are not being allowed into the country for obvious reasons and that the tourists there at present cannot leave.  As part of our role in the EC, Ireland and the Minister should take a stand against what is going on and economic sanctions should be imposed against the military officers in Thailand to show them that the action they have taken in the past few days is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The people of Thailand want a democratic system and that is obvious from <Col N="1348" /> the numbers who have been out on the streets protesting over the past few days. We should give a lead here with our extra power in the European Community and tell the military people in Thailand that what they are doing is unacceptable and that everybody wants to see a democratic system restored once again in that country. It is bizarre that an unelected general can be elected Prime Minister but I believe that happened because people are nominated to the Senate in Thailand.  They can elect a Prime Minister with the MPs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for his remarks in welcoming me to this august body for which I have the greatest respect.  This is not my first occasion to be here as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I would like to distinguish my period in the Department of Foreign Affairs in the area of human rights whether on this island &mdash; which needs to be addressed from time to time &mdash; or human rights elsewhere in the world.  I would like to think that my term of office would be seen as an effort by Ireland to address the abuse of human rights of whatever kind anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to address the Seanad on the tragic developments that have taken place in Thailand over the past number of days.  I express my appreciation to Senator Ryan for his concern in raising the matter.  In his short term as a Member of the Seanad he has a distinguished record in the area of human rights and his concern in relation to this issue is consistent with that record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all shocked at the television pictures and the other widespread reports of the Thai army's brutal and violent suppression of the protesters in Bangkok <Col N="1349" /> who were calling for the resignation of General Suchinda from the office of Prime Minister.  Full details of the numbers of protesters killed and injured in the violence are not yet available but preliminary reports indicate that up to 500 people may have been killed, many of these reportedly shot by the Army, and hundreds more injured.  This brutal military response to legitimate and peaceful protest is unacceptable in any modern society.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our partners in the European Community have today issued a statement expressing our great concern at the recent tragic events in Thailand.  I accept that statements are no substitute for action, nevertheless, it is a strong and worthwhile statement and while it will not, necessarily produce a magic formula to stop the military junta in Thailand from oppressing the people there, it is an indication of the Community's concern for this serious and savage abuse of human rights.  Ireland fully supports this statement by the Twelve.</P>
    <P>We condemn the use of force by the military forces against unarmed civilians. We urge the Thai authorities to refrain from further violence and appeal for maximum restraint by all parties involved in the events.  We wish to see an end to the bloodshed and an early return to a normal situation.  We also call for a peaceful and democratic solution to the problems in Thailand as well as full respect for human rights, for which Senator Ryan rightly called.  Only a democratic Thailand, respecting fully human rights norms, can play a constructive role and contribute to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
    <P>In view of the present situation my Department are advising intending Irish visitors to Thailand to postpone their travel plans until such time as the situation there returns to normal.  We are, of course, in touch with our Community partners regarding developments in Thailand.  Like Senator Ryan who worked there for nine months, I, too, have been there on a number of occasions.  It is a magnificant country.  Bangkok is a beautiful city and the people are particularly <Col N="1350" /> gentle and hard-working in every respect and it is tragic to see what is happening to them at present.</P>
    <P>Thailand has made remarkable economic progress over the past decade, moving rapidly from a largely rural society to an increasingly urbanised and industralised one.  However, the political system, largely based on military influence, has not developed to meet the aspirations of the people.  The social transformation of Thai society has produced a politically more sophisticated middle class who are no longer satisfied with the existing political structures and are demanding a more responsive democratic government.</P>
    <P>A general election was held in Thailand in March and the coalition that came to power requested General Suchinda, who had not stood for election and was not, therefore, a member of parliament, to become Prime Minister.  The General's acceptance of this offer gave rise to widespread public demands for a democratically elected Prime Minister.  The fact that General Suchinda had stated in 1991, after he had led a coup against the previous government, that he did not wish to become Prime Minister fuelled public disenchantment with the existing power structures.  The recent widespread public demands for political change found a focus in the person of the former Governor of Bangkok, Chamlong Srimuang, a devout Buddhist, who has long demanded that the army leave politics to civilians.  Mr. Chamlong has now been detained by the military.  We hope that the Thai authorities will release him immediately.</P>
    <P>Reports today indicate that the situation in Bangkok remains tense.  Disturbances have been confined to the government office area and to the university in the east of the city.  Businesses and schools remain closed and hotel guests are being advised to stay off the streets.  Thai authorities, in reaction to the international outcry over this week's tragic events, may be considering taking the soldiers off the streets.  I am sure all in this House would welcome such a move as a first step in defusing tension in <Col N="1351" /> the city.  Reports from Bangkok indicate that the business community is deeply concerned and angry at the effect this week's events are having on the economy and are acting as a powerful lobby to find a solution quickly.</P>
    <P>We shall continue to follow developments in Thailand with the greatest attention. I hope that the responsible Thai leaders will ensure that this tragic situation is brought to end and that the Thai people's democratic wishes are fully respected.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to express my deep appreciation to Senator Ryan for raising this matter.  Issues of this nature are not raised often enough and I hope I will be in the Seanad from time to time, not necessarily on issues of this nature, but on issues pertaining to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for your kindness and courtesy and to the House for its attention.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a serious situation where patients are travelling 70 miles three times a week for the use of a dialysis machine, in other words, there is no dialysis machine in Cavan General Hospital.  This hospital cost £30 million to build but one ward has never been opened.  The shortage of clerical staff means that it takes five weeks for consultants' assessments to reach GPs.  Even a seriously ill person has to wait five weeks for a consultant's report because of clerical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital has been a great success <Col N="1352" /> and the number of admissions have increased, but there has been no corresponding increase in nursing staff. Medical wards 1 and 2 and the surgical wards should have 24 patients per staff member, but the ratio is 32 patients per staff member.  In the accident and emergency unit, where up to 1,300 patients received medical attention during January this year, there are only two nurses on duty over a 24 hour period.</P>
    <P>Finally, despite the approval of the health board, the ear, nose and throat unit has not been opened.  This is a great national resource, this £30 million project, is not being utilised to its full potential. That should not be the case and minor expenditure would correct it.</P>

    <P>I want to raise the decriminalising of suicide.  The Government, through the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, promised Seanad Éireann on 27 November last that a Bill decriminalising suicide would be introduced by last Christmas.  The Government failed in their commitment and despite numerous promises, six months later, we are still waiting the promised legislation.  Since the promise was made, an estimated 180 suicides have been recorded, with an estimated true figure of nearly 550.  It is a disgrace that this serious social problem is not being addressed or acknowledged by the Government.  A prerequisite to introducing anti-suicide measures is to recognise that suicide, and attempted suicide, is not a crime; it is a public health <Col N="1353" /> issue rather than an issue of criminal investigation.</P>
    <P>Last November the Minister for Justice acknowledged that the issue was important and he accepted the principles outlined in the Fine Gael Bill to decriminalise suicide and stated that the Bill was &ldquo;excellent, I take nothing from it&rdquo;.  I now ask the Minister to introduce a similar Bill.  A person who commits suicide puts himself beyond the law.  The presence of the stigma of criminality adds to the stress of the bereaved.  This stigma must be removed to bring Irish law into conformity with the views of the Irish people.  It is ridiculous to suggest, as does the present law, that people who attempt to commit suicide are people with criminal tendencies in the ordinary sense. They are actuated by a variety of motives, mental illness, despair, depression, feelings of acute rejection and sometimes intense loneliness.  The fact that an attempted suicide still remains a crime is an indication of the Minister's and the Government's, failure to introduce or to recognise that suicide must be regarded as a social disease.  The fact that suicide, and attempted suicide, still remain a crime is an indication of the Government's failure to understand or to recognise the outcome of research into the area and reflects a tendency in Irish society to view suicide as a scandal rather than a tragedy.</P>

      <P>In the present unemployment situation it is good to see that one area has a different problem.  We have virtually full employment in Cornamona, but unfortunately we do not have an electricity supply to match.  At present, the industries in Cornamona are serviced by a 10,000 volt supply but because it is insufficient for present demand and because of the £1 million development which is taking place in the timber mill, the problem will be exacerbated. This line needs to be upgraded urgently to a 20,000 volt line to ensure that employment is sustained.  With computers and domestic appliances in the area, severe disruption is being caused <Col N="1354" /> when the voltage drops and the electricity supply is inadequate to meet demand.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment to make money available to Kerry County Council for improvements to the Tralee-Dingle road. This is a national secondary road.  This narrow road is the gateway to the Dingle Peninsula, it is in very bad condition and has numerous dangerous bends.  A particularly bad bend at a humpback bridge at Derrymore has been the scene of numerous accidents.  The old Dingle-Tralee railway ran along a 15-mile stretch of this road.  Since the closure of this line in the late fifties only about 5 per cent of the old railway line has been utilised for road widening.  Now that Dingle Harbour has been developed with large fishing boats operating out of Dingle, large articulated trucks which service the fishing industry find it hard to navigate some of the bends on the road.  There is also increased tourist traffic in large buses.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to make funds available to Kerry County Council for major roadworks on this road over a five year period.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Central Statistics Office is coming to Cork bringing 400 to 500 jobs with it.  I wish McNamara Construction of Ennis very well.  It is hoped this project will bring a windfall of £8 million to the city of Cork and give a badly needed boost to the Mahon area of Cork city where unemployment is exceptionally high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mindful that this company did an excellent job in the construction of the new Garda station in Anglesey Street. Unfortunately they stand accused on the <Col N="1355" /> basis that they did not use as much Cork labour as they might.  Cork city is bedevilled by chronic unemployment and there is an onus on this company to employ local people.  I challenge the company here tonight to employ in excess of 100 people in the construction phase of this enterprise.  They did not employ maximum local labour in the construction of the Anglesey Street Garda station and I remind them of a commitment already given that 100 local people would be employed on this project.  I ask the Minister for Finance tonight to ensure that local employment is generated by asking McNamara Construction to honour the commitment already given.  What is the point of an outside construction company coming to Cork and not using the skilled construction force available there?  Failure to do causes resentment.  I advise the company to be wise because there may be other projects and if they use Cork people well, we will look after them.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment to approve a water scheme for the Bantry region known as the Drumbro water scheme.  To quote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: &ldquo;Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink.&rdquo;  There are millions of barrels of water in the Atlantic Ocean, off Bantry but in 1992 there is an inadequate supply of water in the town and catchment area. Regrettably a scheme approved by Cork County Council and submitted to the Department of the Environment some months ago was turned down by the Department.  Despite this, rationing of water has occurred in this seaside town since March of this year.  The present supply is inadequate for domestic requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA requirements for the advanced factory means that no industry can locate in Bantry while the water supply is inadequate.  The valuable tourist industry there is jeopardised.  I have been told by hoteliers and guesthouse owners that water rationing applies between 12 midnight and 8 a.m., precluding <Col N="1356" /> the possibility of an early shower or bath.</P>
    <P>The water situation is a severe hindrance to the valuable mussel industry and to mariculture in the area.  Ninety eight per cent of Bantry people wish this scheme to go ahead and I understand that the scheme was not approved because a small minority who do not represent the area lodged a frivolous and vexatious objection which has placed the water supply for a catchment area of 7,000 or 8,000 people in jeopardy.  Water is a basic requirement and I urge the Minister to look seriously at this water scheme proposal which was agreed unanimously by Cork County Council.</P>

      <P>Tralee General Hospital has been starved of funding since it opened in 1984.  Commitments were given over the years with regard to extra funding but were never honoured.  The Minister, Deputy O'Connell, visited the hospital two weeks ago and had a meeting with the matron and members of the medical profession.  He was made aware of the very serious situation within the new general hospital and requested to make financial provision for the employment of an extra nurse in the theatre and to prevent ward closures over the next few months which create extra pressure on staff and patients.  As I understand it, the saving made by ward closures in one month according to current figures given to me some time ago is aproximately £20,000.  I find it outrageous that a ward should be closed with traumatic consequences for the public.  It also gives the impression that the hospital is being downgraded.</P>
      <P>A strong case has already been made for the installation of a renal dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital.  The Southern Health Board made a further submission within the last few weeks with regard to the dialysis unit in view of serious hardship experienced by Kerry patients making the long trip to the Regional Hospital in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the position of the Tralee General Hospital which he saw firsthand recently.  A special <Col N="1357" /> grant of £50,000-£60,000 direct to Tralee General Hospital would resolve many of its present problems.  I know that the Minister is a compassionate man and if there is any way around the financial situation I look to him to make the necessary funding available.</P>

      <P>I hope that my two minute's grievance has not been given in lieu of the long promised debate on air transport because I refer specifically to the Shannon status issue.  I ask the Minister why we have not yet received the decision she promised us immediately after Easter.  I am responding to the disturbing article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Monday which stated that one of her officials visited Atlanta to meet with Delta Airlines when, we are told, the question of direct access to Dublin was discussed.  Was that visit linked to the new options being looked at under a corporate plan from Aer Lingus?</P>
      <P>The Minister has ruled out any prospect of Exchequer funding for the Aer Lingus fleet replacement which the airline says is critical to its survival on the North Atlantic route.  When revealing that a corporate plan was being sought from Aer Lingus, the minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, also referred to options or alternatives which the airline could suggest for meeting its financial requirements.  If no State money is to be made available, the alternatives would be non-State and the suggestion is that private funding would be sought for Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delta Airlines is a healthy American airline involved in a dog fight with American rivals for a share of the European market.  It would certainly be interested in getting involved with a European airline, such as Aer Lingus, with an extensive European network and there is no doubt that Delta Airlines would have the ready money for such an investment.  I ask the Minister for assurances that deals are not being worked out for Aer Lingus over the heads of the people in the west of Ireland for whom the Shannon gateway represents the most <Col N="1358" /> vital lifeline for tourism trade and industrial investment.</P>
    <P>There is the cliché that &ldquo;a week is a long time in politics.&rdquo;  The Minister is making a record of her promises of a decision on the Shannon gateway issue. At the Spring Show she predicted a decision within days and I ask her to explain the delay.  She stated in February that uncertainty over the Shannon gateway issue was damaging investment confidence in the Shannon region.  That undermining of confidence is now being prolonged by the Minister and I ask whether she can give assurances that the decision on Shannon is not being put off until after the Maastricht Referendum so that a massive backlash from the voters in the west of Ireland may be avoided.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the interest of the House to a newspaper circulating in Ireland, printed in London called <i>The Independent on Sunday.</i> This paper is an important one for Irish people and recently it claimed that &ldquo;the IRA bomb that wrecked buildings in the city of London last month may have come from Letterkenny, an isolated frontier town in the Irish Republic's far north which conceals a sinister streak beneath the lively atmosphere of its long main street&rdquo;.  The article features a picture of a heavy machine gun and a picture of a Donegal Deputy which is unfair to the county because Donegal is not a haven for the IRA.  I urge this House to call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise this matter with the British Ambassador. This allegation is untrue and would cause havoc for a county like Donegal that is dependent on tourism for part of its revenue. There are many people in England that would believe this article to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The journalist from the UK who put the article together did it on the basis of scraps of news, in the laziest and lowest form of journalism.  The journalist responsible has written an article totally unfair to my county, to Letterkenny especially and to an elected representative of Donegal.  I ask for the support of the Members as I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to protest <Col N="1359" /> strongly to the Ambassador about the article.</P>

      <P>I commend the stand taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Deputy Andrews in calling for the withdrawal of the Parachute Regiment from Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The events of the past week in Coalisland and throughout the east and southeast Tyrone areas involving the Paratroop Regiment have caused great concern to right-thinking people of all political persuasions.  This regiment by its history of involvement in the regrettable events of Northern Ireland is totally unsuitable for duty there and all Members of this House should endorse the call on the British Government by Foreign Affairs Minister, Deputy Andrews, for the withdrawal of the regiment from the North.  Their training makes them unsuited for duty in Northern Ireland and for dealing with citizens there.  The patrolling of built-up nationalist areas is an insensitive action in the present political climate and the hostility prevailing against this regiment could lead to further loss of life.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to seek a renewed commitment from the British Government that army officers will be accompanied by the RUC wherever they come in contact with the general public and that disciplinary action will be taken against security force members whenever they go outside the rule of law.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 29 March, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Vast numbers of abortions in Russia are fuelling the cosmetics industry in the west with tonnes of placenta being used to make expensive face creams that claim to erase wrinkles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a bizarre and tragic trade lorry loads of refrigerated placenta are being exported to France where some are sold to cosmetic firms to make the fashionable face creams.  These beauty aids are sold in London at some of <Col N="1360" /> the most expensive shops, including Harrods, where the fact that they contain placenta is buried in the small print.</P>
    <P>No mention is made that the placenta comes from women rather than animals or from Russia where the abortion rate is one of the highest in the world.  The firms using the material in creams include ROC, a chic sub-subsidiary of the Louis Vuitton-Moet Hennessy group.</P>
    <P>The firms defend the use of human placenta on the grounds that it is rich in nutrients that moisturise and &ldquo;regenerate&rdquo; skin.  &ldquo;We were searching for an action (rejuvenating the skin) and that action according to our tests is accomplished by the use of placenta,&rdquo; said a pharmocologist at Roc's Paris headquarters.</P>
    <P>I come to the <i>Guinness Globe</i> issue of March 1992, the newspaper of Guinness Brewing Worldwide which made the following comment.  Guinness Plc has four sources of revenue.  They are: (1) Guinness Brewing Worldwide, its brewing company; (2) United Distillers, its spirit company; (3) Guinness Enterprises, which includes Guinness Publishing Limited, the publisher of the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> and (4) Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton (LVMH) the French luxury goods company which uses these placentas and which contributed £123 million to Guinness Plc profit.</P>
    <P>This trade using the pieces of the bodies of small unborn children torn from the wombs of Russian women to make fancy cosmetics for women of the west is horrific.  I call on Guinness to use their influence to cease immediately this barter in human flesh.</P>
