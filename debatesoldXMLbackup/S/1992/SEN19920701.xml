      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matters:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to examine the serious difficulties facing Irish ware potato producers who are now at a great disadvantage as a subsidy is being paid to growers in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to establish differing regional reference yields for winter and spring cereals under the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that a trained remedial teacher is appointed to North Brunswick Street primary school, Dublin 7, to cater for the substantial number of students who require remedial education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to extend the retirement option for members of an Garda Síochána up to and including the rank of inspector to 60 years of age for those members due to retire after 31 December 1992.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to delay the commencement of work on the interpretative centre at Luggalla, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan, Dardis, Costello, Neville and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators McGowan's and Dardis's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello, Neville and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Col N="1167" /> In view of the current vigorous attitude of the Taoiseach on the question of suing newspapers and other media on questions of alleged libel and defamation, and also in view of the Fianna Fáil Party's commitment to the establishment of a press council, and in view of the recent publication by the Law Reform Commission on civil defamation, have the Government any firm intention to bring in legislation on this matter and, if so, when?  Second, if not this session but early in the next session, could we have a full debate on the question of civil defamation?</P>

      <P>I have been asked the Leader of the House for some time if we could discuss the lack of local government elections.  I notice that the Taoiseach spoke yesterday in the Dáil explaining what subsidiarity meant, saying that it was about decisions being taken at the appropriate level.  If a decision is best taken at ground level, that is where it should be taken.  In other words, we are trying to stop the growth of the anonymous super State.</P>

Could I ask the Leader of the House, now that <Col N="1169" /> he has correctly adverted to the fact that the Green Paper is being printed and made available to us, when we can have a debate on the Green Paper?  The Minister had indicated that he is not going to discuss the matter publicly until after the summer period, but it would be appropriate, considering the amount of interest and expertise in education in this House, that we should have debate prior to the House going into recess.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Manning I think that we will get a chance to deal with the Fianna Fáil commitment to set up a press council before the summer recess.  When we come back, I have already indicated that we will have a debate on the laws related to civil defamation. With regard to the timing of the President's speech at 4.15 p.m. next Wednesday, I have no say in that.  The House will be adjourning at about 3.30 p.m..</P>
      <P>We can have a debate on Bord na gCon in the autumn and a Green Paper on Education.  We can bring that paper to the Kerry or Galway beaches to read over the summer months.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill amends the law of evidence in criminal cases in several important respects.  First, it makes admissible in evidence certain documents, including computer printouts, compiled in the ordinary course of a business or in the administration of a <Col N="1170" /> public service.  Second, it makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in cases involving violence or sexual abuse. Third, it sets out the law about the competence and compellability of spouses and former spouses of accused persons. It also allows unsworn evidence to be given by persons under 14 or mentally handicapped persons provided they are able to give an intelligible account of matters relevant to the proceedings.  And it abolishes the present obligatory warnings to be given to a jury by the trial judge about the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child, leaving the giving of a warning to the trial judge's discretion.</P>
      <P>These amendments are broadly in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in various reports. I refer to the reports on receiving stolen property, child sexual abuse, sexual offences against the mentally handicapped and the competence and compellability of spouses of accused persons.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill makes a number of exceptions to the rule against hearsay so far as documentary evidence is concerned. There are many such exceptions at present of which, perhaps, the most important are confessions by accused persons and certain public documents.  In general, our criminal procedure excludes documentary evidence partly because it is unsworn but also because it cannot be made the subject of cross-examination. This exclusionary rule applies to the defence as well as to the prosecution but it is the prosecution that has been most hampered by it, particularly when endeavouring to prosecute offences such as fraud and receiving stolen property where documentary evidence is particularly relevant to a successful prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of Part II will be of considerable help in this respect.  It makes admissible any documents that come within the scope of section 5.  These are documents that, in general, have been compiled in the ordinary course of a business.  The term &ldquo;business&rdquo; is given a wide meaning.  It includes businesses outside the State, such as banks, which <Col N="1171" /> might be unwilling to release officials to prove the contents of documents orally. It also includes public administrative bodies here and abroad.  For the documents to be admissible, the information in them must have been supplied by someone who had personal knowledge of the matters they deal with or who can reasonably be supposed to have had it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of exceptions. Documents that are already privileged for disclosure, such as a lawyer's advice to a client, are an obvious one.  Also excepted are documents prepared in contemplation of legal proceedings, such as witness statements, because of the risk that they may not be reliable.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill does include a number of documents connected with criminal proceedings whose inclusion can be justified on public interest grounds. The first relates to a sworn statement made by a non-resident &mdash; typically a tourist &mdash; who has been the victim of a crime and who has to leave the country before the offender is arrested.  The statement must be sworn in the presence of a district justice and will only be admissible if the tourist has died in the meantime or if it is not reasonably practicable for him to attend at the trial.  I think the House will welcome any measure such as this that will make it easier to bring to justice those of our citizens who prey on visitors and regard them as soft targets.</P>
    <P>I should digress at this point to say that we are taking the opportunity presented by the Bill to authorise criminal courts to take evidence from abroad by live television link.  This provision, in section 29, will further facilitate tourist victims of crime in giving evidence.</P>
    <P>There is a further category of documents prepared for the purposes of criminal proceedings that section 5 makes admissible.  This is a miscellaneous category and it deals with a number of what could be called records of an inherently reliable kind, such as maps, plans, records of directions given by Garda officers, records of handling exhibits and records of medical examinations.</P>
    <P>As a result of representations during <Col N="1172" /> the debate in the Dáil, specific provision has been made in the section to make a birth certificate evidence of parentage. Such a certificate is also admissible under section 5 (1), subject to proving that it complies with the conditions of admissibility spelled out in that provision, but there is an advantage in making the certificate expressly admissible, particularly in incest cases.</P>
    <P>This Part contains a number of safeguards to ensure that the basic fairness of procedures guaranteed by the Constitution is preserved in relation to criminal trials.  Advance notice is required to be given to the other party to the proceedings whenever it is proposed to tender documentary evidence so that that party can object to the admissibility of the evidence before the trial.  In that event, the question of admissibility will be decided upon by the trial judge on the basis of oral evidence being provided that the conditions of admissibility mentioned in section 5 apply to the documents, that is, that they were compiled in the ordinary course of business and so on.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that the documents are held to be admissible as coming within the scope of section 5, the court may decide that it would not be in the interests of justice to admit the evidence, for example, because there would be a risk of unfairness to the accused by reason of his not being in a position to cross-examine the person who supplied the information contained in the document. If the court does admit the evidence, it will, in the same way as it does with oral evidence, assess the weight to be attached to it.  Section 8 gives guidelines for the court when deciding whether to admit documentary evidence and what weight the evidence should be given.</P>
    <P>This procedure may seem complex and so it is, but that is how it should be in any case where the documentary evidence is seriously challenged.  Otherwise fairness of procedures would not be observed.  I would expect that in the normal case documents that are clearly authentic will be accepted and that unmeritorious challenges to them will be discouraged by the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Part III of the Bill makes it easier for young persons and other vulnerable witnesses, such as those with mental handicap, to give evidence in cases involving violence or sexual abuse.  Giving evidence in court, in the presence of the accused, with all the formality associated with a trial, is an ordeal for most people but it can be traumatic for witnesses in these particular cases and can result in prosecutions either not being taken or failing because the witness has broken down.</P>
    <P>The remedy adopted for this situation in several countries has been to provide for evidence to be given by live television link, and that is what is proposed in Part III.  The witness will sit in a separate room and her &mdash; it will usually be her &mdash; answers will be conveyed to those in court by a number of monitors.  She will only see the person &mdash; judge, counsel or solicitor &mdash; who is speaking to her at any given time.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises that even with this system there may be cases &mdash; say where a child is very young or nervous &mdash; where it would be necessary for questions to be put to the child through an intermediary. The intermediary will be appointed by the court and must be someone who is in the court's opinion is competent to perform this function.  Section 14 makes it clear, in effect, that the intermediary may either repeat the questions as they are asked by counsel or convey their meaning in words that are appropriate to the child's age or state of development.</P>
    <P>When an intermediary is used, the witness will not see or hear anything going on in court but those in court will hear the intermediary relaying the questions and see and hear the witness answering them.  The judge will have a separate monitor covering the whole of the witness room.  This is an entirely new technique in criminal procedure and it will require full co-operation &mdash; which I have no doubt will be forthcoming, as it has been forthcoming in other jurisdictions &mdash; from the judges and lawyers concerned.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission was convinced that such a reform is necessary if justice is to be done in cases of child <Col N="1174" /> abuse and the Government fully agreed with its recommendations in this respect. We are talking here of very young children who can give an intelligible account of events but who simply would not be able to face questioning by strange people, even with a monitor and even without the wearing of wigs and gowns. If we do not have someone interposed between the questioner and the child in these particular cases, we are conferring a degree of immunity on child abusers.</P>
    <P>I should add that in the Dáil the provision in section 13 allowing witnesses under 17 and those with mental handicap to give evidence through a live television link was extended to any other witnesses in sexual and violent cases, provided the leave of the court is first obtained.  It may be that the extended provision will not be brought into operation until there has been some experience gained of how the system operates with the under-17s.</P>
    <P>Money has been provided this year for equipping three courtrooms in the Four Courts with the necessary facilities and for providing a witness room and waiting room in the vicinity.  I expect that the equipment will be in place by next October. There is provision in the Bill for the transfer of cases to those courts from any Circuit or District Court district in the country.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is concerned with the competence of spouses and former spouses of accused persons to give evidence and it also sets out the cases in which they may be compelled to give evidence.  At present there is a great deal of uncertainty both as regards their competence and compellability.</P>
    <P>Section 21 makes spouses and former spouses competent in all circumstances, whether for the prosecution, the accused or a co-accused.  As regards compellability, they will be compellable at the instance of the accused.  A spouse will be compellable for the prosecution only for an offence involving violence committed against that spouse or for such an offence or a sexual offence committed against a member of the family.  That is the law as settled by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1988 in the JT case, but the <Col N="1175" /> Bill makes a spouse also compellable in the case of a violent or sexual offence committed against any person under 17. Former spouses will be compellable in all cases for the accused or a co-accused and also for the prosecution, unless the offence took place while the spouses were living together and the offence is one for which a spouse would not be compellable. Of course, a spouse who is jointly charged with the other spouse cannot be compelled to give evidence for the prosecution and the necessary saver is included at section 25 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These, again, are somewhat complex provisions but this is largely due to the need to achieve a balance between the protection of the institution of marriage, as required by the Constitution, on the one hand, and, on the other, ensuring that domestic violence and sexual offences against members of the family and other children are not left unpunished.</P>
    <P>The remaining Part of the Bill &mdash; Part V &mdash; contains a number of important provisions.  I have already referred to section 29, which allows evidence to be given from abroad through a live television link.  Section 27 allows the court to accept unsworn evidence from a child under 14 or a person with mental handicap if the child or person is capable of giving an intelligible account of events. Section 28 abolishes the present obligatory warning to a jury about the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child and leaves the matter to the court's discretion.</P>
    <P>Some disquiet was expressed in the other House and by the Law Society about these provisions, which give effect to recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, and particularly about the abolition of the obligatory warning.  I would point out that all that is being abolished is the obligation to warn the jury in every case.  It will be a matter for the judge, in his discretion, to decide whether to give a warning but he has a constitutional duty to ensure basic fairness of procedures and his discretion can <Col N="1176" /> only be exercised in conformity with this constitutional duty.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that this is not a party political Bill and it has been approached on that basis in the other House.  I look forward to an equally constructive approach from Senators and I, for my part, can assure them that I will give most careful consideration to any views they may express in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Our joint objective is to ensure that we make this Bill workable and produce the best Bill possible.  I received and accepted a number of very constructive amendments on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil and I look forward to an equally constructive approach and debate here in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its presentation to the House and to the Oireachtas is long overdue.  It is an important Bill, in view of the growing evidence of violence and sexual abuse against the most vulnerable in our State. It is important that legal procedures ensure that the culprits are brought to justice as far as possible.  It is important that structures are in place to ensure that the victims of abuse and sexual violence &mdash; the children and mentally handicapped &mdash; are in a position to expose the evidence and to give the facts without the level of intimidation that exists in our court procedures.  These procedures are intimidating even to people of mature years and at all levels of society.  Children and mentally handicapped cannot cope in a dispassionate way and expose the truth.  In many cases they are asked to do so in intimidating circumstances, often in front of people whom they know and members of their own family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill makes a fair effort in altering the court procedures to allow such people not to fear the court and tell the truth as they see it.  The spirit of the Bill in this regard should be generalised to all court procedures.  The Minister has made various comments about some of the archaic practices in our courts, and I welcome his reforming views.  It is archaic that spouses, or former spouses, of accused <Col N="1177" /> people are considered to be incompetent and not compellable to give evidence where there is sexual abuse of members of the family and violence within the family itself.  This is highlighted in situations of severe physical and mental violence against women and children.</P>
    <P>The perpetrators of such violence should be subject to the full force and vigour of the law and nothing must inhibit the full facts being laid before the courts. Part IV of this Bill endeavours to do this and in this regard, we must welcome it.</P>
    <P>Business organisations and methods of operation have changed dramatically over the last quarter of a century.  With this has developed a thriving business in white collar crime.  The Garda Síochána are severely handicapped by our laws of evidence in bringing to justice the people who commit such crimes.  The making of business records &mdash; and there are adequate safeguards in the Bill &mdash; such as computer records, etc., admissible as evidence will improve the situation but much more will have to be done.  A start has been made in this Bill but much more must be done to ensure that the perpetrators and those who commit white collar crime are brought to justice.  My party have done much work in this area and have a document on the need to control white collar crime.</P>
    <P>Crime against tourists and those who visit our country is one of the meanest and more despicable actions of our criminal community.  Perpetrators of such acts know there is litle chance of their being brought to justice because the victim has left the country and is not in a position to bring evidence to court or, more correctly, these cases are shelved because the Garda know these people will not be available to give evidence.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a system whereby visitors to this land of a thousand welcomes who are assaulted or robbed can give sworn evidence in the presence of a district justice before leaving the country and which is admissible in court, will assist to improve the conviction rate for such cowardly crimes.  I would ask the Minister if there is a procedure for cross-examination <Col N="1178" /> of the evidence given by a witness in front of a district justice which is later admissible in court.  The fact that victims can now give evidence through a live television link-up &mdash; a sensible use of modern technology &mdash; and that witnesses will be cross-examined by way of a television link-up, is to be welcomed.  I also welcome the introduction of this system which brings some semblance of justice to the area of tourist crime and endeavours to control this dastardly criminal activity against our visitors.  It is too much to expect that we can eliminate such crimes; the best we can hope for is to control it.  In view of the fact that our crime rate last year increased by 8 per cent, and indications this year are that there will be a similar increase, our visitors are bound to be at risk.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us, like similar Bills that have come before the House, has its origins in the report of the Law Reform Commission Consultation Paper, No. 32 of August 1990.  This sets out proposals for eliminating the outdated paraphernalia of our courts.  It is recommended that wigs and gowns be abolished.  I know the Minister has expressed views on this matter which we welcome, and perhaps he will use this occasion to comment further.  I fail to understand why barristers are still, as we enter the 21st century, forced to wear wigs while serving in our courts by order 119, Rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Court.  Many barristers would choose not to use such apparel if the choice were theirs.  It is silly and inappropriate that women barristers are asked to wear male apparel to undertake their work in our courts.</P>
    <P>Wigs became popular for men in 1624 because King Louis XIII of France chose to wear one.  As a result, wigs became a distinctive class symbol for over a century. With the French and American Revolutions of the 18th century, the spirit of equality that prevailed at the time swept away the wearing of such wigs.  It is sensible in this age to abolish wigs and gowns in our courts.  I welcome the Minister's expressed views on the matter and hope that the advocates in our courts <Col N="1179" /> will look the same as the rest of us and that this outdated system of wearing wigs and gowns will be abolished.  Senator O'Donovan agrees with the idea, being a solicitor, although he would not need false hair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>There is growing concern at the level of violence against children and mentally handicapped people.  In 1984, 88 allegations of child sexual abuse were reported; in 1989, five years later, 1,241 cases were reported.  This is a startling figure and I believe only touches the surface of the problem.  I believe that, because we have now a more open society and are more prepared to discuss this problem, children and family members are more conscious of the evil of such vile acts and are more prepared to report them to the authorities.</P>
      <P>We must welcome and encourage such developments.  We must carry out more research into the whole area of child abuse and child violence.  We must try to discover the real level of child sexual abuse, because I believe we have only touched on the problem.  The statistics of reported crime from 1985 to 1988 indicates that there has been an increase.  We must try to establish why such abuses happen and develop/anti-child sexual abuse programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to an excellent report on violence against women drawn up by the Mid-Western Health Board, Adapt House in Limerick and the Policy Research Centre of the National College of Industrial Relations.  It is in two volumes &mdash;&ldquo;Breaking Violence in the Home&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seeking Refuge from Violence&rdquo;. Having read it, I consider it is a revealing report and shattering in many ways.  It would be an excellent document if we were discussing violence in the home; this is called &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; often softens our view of it.  This report is a shocking relevation <Col N="1180" /> of extreme violence against women. While I agree there is violence at different levels, the people involved in this report and in this research were in Adapt House Limerick, a refuge for women and children who have experienced violence and are forced to leave the home.</P>
    <P>If we carry out similar reseach into sexual abuse on children and violence against children and the mentally handicapped, it would be a means of opening the subject, investigating it, learning to understand it, correcting the situation and educating the victims and perpetrators of violence about the need for help and assistance.</P>
    <P>The report draws up a profile of the women who use the Adapt refuge but not the men who perpetrate of violence against them.  The profile describes these women in terms of their background, age, martial status, number of children and socio-economic circumstances.  By providing essential information on characteristics and patterns of usage among the women who use the Adapt refuge, the first study enables key issues to be identified relating to effective policymaking and intervention strategies. These key issues are further explored in the second study based on indepth interviews with a sample of the women from Adapt.</P>
    <P>The report of the second study describes the development of violence in intimate male/female relationships, the nature and pattern of the violence experienced, the impact violence has on its victims and the nature of the help sought and the kind of agency response obtained.  This second report also includes a detailed review of previous research carried out in the area of violence in the home.  It is an excellent report and should be a basis for further reports. Similar research should be carried out in the area of child abuse and child sexual abuse.  We need to know the level of such sexual abuse in the home and why it happens.  We need an indepth analysis of cases of child sexual abuse and proposals to deal with the problem.  We need proper therapy programmes for dealing <Col N="1181" /> with children who have experienced sexual violence.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence of a cycle of violence, that people who experience violence as a child become violent when they enter a relationship with their married partner.  We must endeavour to break this cycle of violence.  We need to carry out research and provide therapy for people who are experiencing violence and sexual abuse.  There is evidence that with proper therapy and proper psychological help children can learn to break this cycle of violence and be treated for the trauma they experience.</P>
    <P>The law must take its course against the perpetration of physical and sexual violence in the home which is known as domestic violence.  I do not like the term &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo; because it softens it. Some of the information in this report would make some of the violence on the streets look tame in comparison with the extreme nature of violence perpetrated against some of the women.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is to allow a child to feel at ease when giving evidence and enable him or her to recount the events as they occurred in their own way and to enable the truth to be revealed in a relaxed and non-intimidating fashion. The use of TV linkage is important in that it allows evidence to be given outside the precincts of the court.  The child should be removed totally from the precincts and the atmosphere of the court to a different building; some would say we should remove them from the court for their own physical safety because of the conditions of some of our courts but this is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>Where video contact or TV contact is being made and evidence is given how well does cross-examination operate? Will the defending solicitor or barrister be in a position through the medium of television to actually cross-examine the child's evidence?  I presume that will be the case although it is not explicitly stated in the Bill.  Some concern has been expressed about this but one does not know how it will operate until we see it in action.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on how the cross-examination <Col N="1182" /> of witnesses will operate in practice. Given that we accept that evidence should be given by children through the TV link, that facility for the giving of evidence should also be allowed for all victims of rape and sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The giving of evidence by a person who has been raped or sexually abused is a traumatic experience.  In too many cases the accused is known to the victim, and in some cases can be a member of the victim's family or a family friend.  This increases the stress felt by the victim in giving evidence.  In all cases the victim must be physically present in the courtroom which is most intimidating for a person who is giving evidence and is being cross-examined in the case of a rape or a sexual assault.  The proposals in the Bill providing for live linkage in giving evidence, with the witness separated from the confines of the court, should be extended to women who are giving evidence in cases of sexual violence and rape.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why a woman over 17 years of age, who finds it an appalling experience to have to walk into the intimidating atmosphere of the courtroom and give evidence while being watched by the person who raped her, cannot give the evidence through television also. Anybody who has experienced this &mdash; and I have discussed it with a few &mdash; finds it most traumatic to face the person who has attacked or raped them and to give evidence in his presence.  If it is justifiable to allow a person of 16 years of age give evidence through a video link, surely it is justifiable to allow a person of 18 years of age a television link in the cases of sexual abuse and rape?</P>
    <P>While we welcome the approach of removing the intimidating atmosphere in giving evidence, we must ensure that in our zeal to protect children and girls we do not create a situation where the presumption of innocence until the person is proved guilty &mdash; which is the cornerstone of our judicial system &mdash; is not reversed to a presumption of guilty.  A person must always be presumed innocent until proved guilty.  The person must not be assumed to be guilty as soon as anyone <Col N="1183" /> makes an accusation of sexual abuse or rape.  Cases arise from time to time where false allegations are made.  This has been know to happen especially in family disputes where a spouse alleges sexual or other violence against a partner to obtain custody of the children.  We must ensure that our system, while attempting to protect children and women, does not interfere in any way with the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty in our courts.  Otherwise, we could have serious miscarriages of justice which would result in persons being committed to prison for acts they did not commit.</P>
    <P>Part IV which deals with the competence and compellability of spouses and former spouses to give evidence is long overdue.  It is time we moved away from the outdated 19th century concept in the case of the offences outlined in the Bill.  It will assist in obtaining convictions in cases of family violence.</P>
    <P>White collar crime has been a growth area for some time.  This problem has not been addressed properly in the past.  The Garda Fraud Squad have been denied the resources and the expertise to deal with it.  Consultants in accounting, management and the legal profession should be available to the Garda in their efforts to investigate and combat white collar crime.  Until this is done, we are not serious in trying to tackle the growing level of white collar crime.  We must give the necessary resources to the Garda to ensure that people in white collars and three piece suits are subject to the same rigours of the law as all who engage in illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I note the statement and the concerns of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Eamonn Barnes who, in a speech in February 1991, addressed the inadequacy of the Irish criminal justice system in coping with the whole area of serious fraud.</P>
    <P>We welcome Part II which allows for the use of modern documentary evidence to be admitted during criminal proceedings. We look forward to its speedy introduction into law and the necessary ministerial decisions in introducing the <Col N="1184" /> various sections of the Bill.  There have been criticisms especially of the Child Care Act and the failure of the Minister for Justice to introduce the necessary ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Finally, I urge the Minister, when the Bill is enacted, to proceed as quickly as possible to make the necessary ministerial order, so that the legislation will be available to the courts and to the people responsible for bringing prosecutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, to the House and compliment him, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn and the staff of the Department in producing this Bill and bringing it before the House so quickly.</P>
      <P>The fact that the final report of the Law Reform Commission, on which this Bill is based, was not published until September 1990 augurs well for the speed with which this matter was dealt with &mdash; the Bill was introduced within 18 months to the Dáil.  A compliment must be paid to the Department and the Ministers for acting so promptly.</P>
      <P>As the Bill states, we are dealing with criminal evidence and the amendments proposed are confined to criminal law rather than civil law.  The Bill can be categorised into three main areas.  First, making admissible in evidence information contained in certain business and administrative documents, such as computer printouts, etc.  We are living in an age where computers are an everyday facility.  Modern technology is such that the courts and the Department must move with the times.  Computer printouts are an everyday occurrence.  Most offices and administrations use computers in their day-to-day business.  Even accounting systems are computerised.  It is important that such documents, which hitherto would not be admitted in criminal cases, will now be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Bill facilitates the giving of evidence by people under the age of 17 and by people with a mental handicap of any age in cases of child sexual abuse and violence in the home, by allowing <Col N="1185" /> the evidence to be videotaped, by direct TV link or by an intermediary appointed and recognised by the court so that these people will not be intimated by the court system.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by my colleague, Senator Neville, if an adult has to go to the District Court for a relatively minor offence like dangerous driving or drunk driving, he may be intimated by the court system.  As a lawyer the courts are part of my life.  A court appearance would be traumatic for a child of six, seven or eight years or for somebody with a mental handicap who for years may have been sexually abused in their home or beaten. In line with the Law Reform Commission Report and, this is the practice in European countries, in America, Canada and Australia, new facilities, such as direct TV link, video recording and the taking of evidence by an intermediary or official appointed and recognised by the court will be used.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his announcement that the direct TV link in the Four Courts will be in operation by October.  Coming from the south I recommend that this operation be extended nationwide as soon as possible to Cork, Galway, etc.  It is important that other courts, apart from the Four Courts, would have these facilities and as time progesses and we see how they work, they could be extended to most circuit court centres.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with the competence of spouses and former spouses to give evidence, sections 22 and 23 deal with the compellability to give evidence at the instance of prosecution; section 24 deals with the compellability to give evidence at the instance of the co-accused.  The general rule of thumb was that, on the one hand, the Constitution imposed an obligation on us to protect the citizens and, on the other, the recognition that a marriage is a special circumstance where a husband or wife, or a former husband or wife, should not give evidence or be compelled to give evidence against each other in criminal cases.  The Bill proposes in such circumstances that this provision <Col N="1186" /> be amended.  I will elaborate on this issue later.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment and to put on record my gratitude to the Law Reform Commission for the excellent work they do in general, and particularly for the number of reports which led to this Bill.  This Bill brings into effect recommendations relating to evidence in such matters as child abuse, domestic violence and other offences which, regrettably, seemed to become prevalent in our society in the eighties as statistics reveal an alarming rate of child abuse and domestic violence.  Up to now because of our restrictive rules of evidence in many instances those people responsible for child sexual abuse and domestic violence, among other things, were unable to be brought to trial; and, if and when brought to trial, in many cases acquittals were easily obtained on technical and flimsy grounds.</P>
    <P>Too often we hear of the rights of the criminals and the protection that must be given to such people brought before the courts on criminal charges.  As a practising lawyer myself, I understand there has to be a balance and that a balance is sometimes difficult to achieve.  There are many people who feel there is too much protection being given to the criminal, that they have too many rights, that a person accused of crimes &mdash; in many instances serious crimes &mdash;&mdash; gets off on technicalities and that our justice system is more in favour of the criminal than the victim.  According to Article 43 of our Constitution, there is a duty on the State by its laws to protect as best it can all our citizens from unjust attack.  This Bill tries to ensure that we protect the most innocent people in our society, children, people under 17 years of age and people with mental disabilities etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with areas such as receiving stolen goods and the competence and compellability of spouses as witnesses in certain cases.  As the law stands, there are serious encumbrances as far as children are concerned as witnesses in prosecution cases.  Particularly in the area of physical or sexual abuse, the child may be seen as too young to <Col N="1187" /> give evidence or may be intimidated by the appearance of lawyers wearing wigs and gowns, by the overcrowded courtrooms, people in uniforms, etc.</P>
    <P>I fully concur with my colleague, Senator Neville, when he states that the day has come to do away with the wig and gown and the undue formality attaching to courts, certainly as regards children's courts, and such matters covered here where children may have to give evidence.  The Bill deals to a large extent with this and must be welcome.  It may be a step towards getting rid of the wig and gown formalities, as far as barristers are concerned in the not too distant future.  I feel it serves no great purpose and I share Senator Neville's views that it is a matter the Minister and his Department might look at for the future.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is to allow children to give evidence without too much red tape and cutting out of the drama of courtrooms.  After all, the prime objective of any prosecution or of any system of justice is to ensure that as far as possible justice is done.  As far as children are concerned, or indeed mentally handicapped people of any age, formalities, courtroom dramas and red tape should as far as possible be set aside, and this is proposed in this Bill.  The Law Reform Commission in their report and the extensive research they carried out also looked at the situation in other European countries.  It is noteworthy that the final report of the law commission in the area of child sexual abuse, among other things, was published in September 1990. As I said already, I think the Government and the Minister have acted with great diligence in bringing this Bill before the Houses so quickly.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for a person under 17 to give evidence by live television link in cases of sexual abuse or physical abuse against children.  This is a new and welcome development in the circumstances where child abuse is a growing perversion in our society.  As my colleague, Senator Neville, said, the full statistics are not really known and we may be only hitting the tip of the iceberg. <Col N="1188" /> We have to take special steps to protect the weaker people in our society, the young and the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>In appropriate cases questions to such witnesses as children may be conveyed through a competent person or an intermediary appointed and recognised by the court.  This is important, because in some of the debates in the Dáil it might have been suggested that any person could go in willy-nilly and question a young person who had suffered the trauma of sexual abuse.  That is not the case.  The person or intermediary appointed will be one recognised by the court and will be a competent person.  The Bill also specifically states that while giving evidence no wigs or gowns will be worn.  Again, this is an endeavour to ease the situation for the witness who, most likely, will be a child.  It also provides for evidence to be given by way of videotape.  Again, the judge will have a discretion as to whether the tape can be allowed in full in evidence, partly allowed or, in the case of an objection being raised, it may be totally disallowed.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the judge has a discretion.  From personal observation I am of the view that because of our excellent education system and so on, children seem at a younger age to be much more intelligent and more capable of understanding.  I think that now a child of nine or ten is probably more intelligent, more aware and more up to date than, say, I was when I was 12 or 13 years of age.  My six-year old son has computer games and he can do practically anything with them.  When I was his age we did not have them, but I feel that children now at the age of eight, nine, ten or 11 years of age are more aware of what is going on.  They are more up-to-date in technology and so on than we were at that age.  Under the old system a child giving evidence had to go through the trauma of understanding the meaning of taking an oath.  The criterion was that the judge would have to ascertain whether they were capable of telling the truth, distinguish between truth and lies, etc. These formalities were often intimidating to young people.  The decision now is that <Col N="1189" /> the judge can decide in a given case if a child, who may be as young as six or seven years of age can in simple language understand what is going on and if they are intelligent enough to give their evidence. The judge has discretion there. They do not have to be brought in, asked if they understood the oath and go through all these formalities.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the rules of evidence and our system of justice have completely underestimated the ability of children to give evidence, understand the truth and deal with testimony when questions are posed in a way appropriate to their stage of development.  The Law Reform Commission have guided us down this road. For many years practising lawyers, the system of justice and the State were of the opinion that children had not a clue how to give evidence and could not comprehend matters.  We are now accepting in this Bill that that is not the case and that in given circumstances a child of six or seven years, or maybe even younger, can in their own manner give a truthful explanation of a certain scene, whether it is in the home in relation to violence or child abuse, that can be comprehended and the judge has the discretion to accept this for what it is worth.  That is an important step.</P>
    <P>In criminal proceedings up to now the judge was obliged to warn the jury that the conviction of an accused person before the court by the uncorroborated evidence of a child was not safe.  Now, as the Minister rightly pointed out earlier, this has to some extent been set aside; but what is important is that the judge still has the discretion.  The judge may still direct the jury.  If he feels that the evidence of the child may be unsafe he may direct the jury in a certain way, but the obligation on the judge has been removed.  If the judge feels that the child, or perhaps a mentally handicapped person, has given their evidence in a fair way, then he has the discretion not to issue this warning to the jury.  This must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague, Senator Neville, I think sexual abuse of children has been <Col N="1190" /> underestimated for many years.  Our archaic rules of evidence have been built up from the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries to the present day.  Even though they have been updated from time to time there is still room for improvement.  It is not very long ago since there was a case in Waterford &mdash; this was referred to in the Dáil &mdash; where for a frivolous and technical reason a person accused of serious charges of sexual abuse went free from the court.  I understand that one of the proofs then required was that a birth certificate proving that a particular man was the father of a child would not be allowed in evidence.  Arising from representations in the Dáil, that situation has been amended and now a birth certificate will be taken for what it is worth as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of what is stated on it.  I think that is an important step.</P>
    <P>If we look at statistics in relation to how many children phone Childline about physical or sexual problems in the home, it is now accepted that many children &mdash; some as young as five years of age &mdash; use this method to highlight their problems.  This indicates the necessity for us to proceed with vigour and haste to ensure that the terrible trauma and crime of child sexual abuse can be done away with.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to set out clearly the circumstances in which a spouse, or former spouse, of an accused person is competent and can be compelled to give evidence.  An example is that the Bill varies somewhat from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this regard.  I understand the Law Reform Commission in their report wished the <i>status quo</i> to be retained, whereby the spouse would not be compelled to give evidence against the other spouse in a criminal charge. However, it should be noted that when this recommendation was made by the Law Reform Commission the case known as The People <i>v.</i> J. T. had not been dealt with.  In this case the court held that any provision that a wife was not a compellable witness in charges against her husband on sexual assault on his daughter would be unconstitutional. <Col N="1191" /> Consequently, and prudently as far as the Government, the Minister and his officials are concerned, they have now decided to act on this High Court decision and have taken cognisance of this very important decision in the Bill, so that the wife of an accused is compellable to give evidence in the case of domestic violence or sexual offences against a child of the marriage.  It should be noted, however, that these are the only instances where a spouse of an accused can be compelled to give evidence for the prosecution.</P>
    <P>The position of former spouses is also set out and they will be compellable for the prosecution in the same way, except where the offence in question was committed during the period of the marriage and whatever kind for which a spouse would not be compellable.  It provides that the spouse of an accused will be compellable for the prosecution and accused only in cases of violence or sexual offences.  It is in these narrow categories that a spouse can be compelled to give evidence, but will be compellable for the accused in every other case.  The differentiation here is that the accused may force their spouse to come into court to give evidence in relation to such an event and only in very certain circumstances can the prosecution or the DPP compel the spouse to come in, and these have been set out clearly in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with documentary evidence.  This recommendation is again based on the report of the Law Reform Commission.  These provisions would be vitally important in the attempt to prosecute offences such as fraud or what is now known as white collar crime. The new proposals put in place remedy deficiencies in our criminal procedures caused by the fact that at present documents are not admissible as evidence. There is at present no provision for the allowance of computer print-outs and such records, financial or otherwise. Having regard to the important part computers play in our modern society, in administration and in commercial business, this amendment is prudent and welcome.</P>
    <P>However, in case one thinks we are <Col N="1192" /> going too far, the Bill has built into it certain safeguards in regard to the introduction of documentation evidence.  For example, if it is proposed by the prosecution or by the accused person to tender documentary evidence in a trial, the Bill clearly sets out that 21 days notice must be given to the other party.  They must be informed of the intention to introduce a computer printout, or certain documentary evidence, such as a birth certificate, a map or a Garda Síochána report.  Then the other party can come back and, provided they do so within seven days of the trials they can lodge an objection.  If such an objection is received, then the prosecution can decide to summon the witness to the court to give evidence <i>viva voce</i> or by direct verbal evidence.  In other words, if we are warned that this documentary is not to be accepted for one reason or another, or that part of it is not to be accepted, then the prosecution, by being alerted to this can bring the witness before the court to give direct evidence under oath.</P>
    <P>Even with documentary evidence, it is important to know that the court has a discretion here also.  The court also may require oral evidence to be given in any matter stated or specially given in relation to such documents.  Section 8 sets out that no documentary evidence will be admissible by virtue of section 5 if the court is of the opinion that in the interests of justice the whole or part shall not be admitted.  The court, in their discretion, can decide that in the interests of justice a certain document, or part of a certain document, or paragraphs of a certain document, may not be admitted.  This section sets out the consideration and criteria the court must have regard to in reaching decisions on this point.  In a nutshell, the admissibility of documentary evidence will be a decision for the court in any trial; and if in the interests of justice it ought not to have been admitted, then it is the court who shall decide in the circumstances of any given case what is to be admitted or not admitted.</P>
    <P>I commend the Law Reform Commission on their recommendation in <Col N="1193" /> relation to receiving stolen property. These provisions will be vitally important in the attempt to prosecute offences such as fraud or white collar crime.</P>
    <P>This Bill has followed closely the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in a number of areas and I compliment the Minister on that.  One example was the birth certificate issue. Another was the extension of the television linkage &mdash; not necessarily confining it to those under 17 or the mentally handicapped but to cover, say, a case where a woman has been severely sexually abused, raped etc.  In other words, evidence by television link to the court may now apply to people beyond the age of 17, which was originally envisaged.  I have read and studied the debates in the other House where the Bill was welcomed by practically all parties.  The Minister and his Department in a number of vital areas, have accepted recommendations and brought in amendments which are incorporated in the Bill before the House here today.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent piece of legislation. It is an important step, particularly for the protection of the young, the less well off and for the mentally handicapped in our society.  The manner in which this legislation was brought before the Dáil &mdash; and this must not be forgotten &mdash; within 18 months of the final report of the Law Reform Commission indicates the concern of this Government in relation to reforming legislation.  I have pointed out in previous debates that much new legislation under the heading of justice has been introduced in the last two or three years.  I believe that this Government and the Department of Justice are concerned.  I trust that they will continue to bring important reforming legislation before this House while this Government lasts, hopefully for another two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and belatedly congratulate him on his appointment.  I also welcome this Bill.  I consider it very important and timely and I agree with its provisions.  It is good to see proposals contained in the <Col N="1194" /> Law Reform Commission report being translated into legislation brought before the House.  That is what should be happening on a more regular basis.  I am glad the Minister has presented this radical reforming Bill in the area of criminal evidence.</P>
      <P>The major areas are outlined by the explanatory memorandum and in the Minister's speech.  Probably what is most important is that the substantial items in the Bill are reflective of the developments that have taken place in this country and other countries in terms of advancing technology and matters that have caused problems in relation to evidence given by young people, and particularly in relation to evidence being given in cases which involve a degree of sexual abuse.  All these measures are addressing real problems and this is what is important about the legislation.</P>
      <P>In the first area we will now have admissible in evidential form information contained in business and administrative documents, including computer print-outs and fax material.  This is a very important development to ensure that we can avail of the range of technological data to deal with problems, particularly problems relating to commercial fraud, various abuses in business enterprises, stolen property and so on.  In the past, this has been the area most neglected by our criminal law in trying to solve the enormous problems in what is normally called white collar crime.  It operates to an extremely large degree.  We have great difficulty identifying the degree other than that which is estimated and computed by businesses themselves.  We have only estimates or what is the view of Garda Fraud Squad, but it is unusual that such cases come before the courts because of the difficulty of dealing with them in evidence and ensuring that convictions can be obtained.  Obviously, there is enormous scope for a new emphasis in the area of fraud detection and proceedings in the area where fraud may have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, we have to think not only in terms of improving the evidence in documentary terms but also to ensuring <Col N="1195" /> that the Garda Force is adequately trained, resourced, staffed and with the proper focus to ensure that we can deal with this technological area.  We have a Garda Fraud Squad.  However, I have always considered it to be the Cinderella of the Force.  This is an area where we have to call on the Minister to ensure that the resources are provided to improve the Garda technology initially in the detection of crime and the first requirement is to strengthen the Fraud Squad and ensure that the resources are provided.</P>
    <P>In regard to the presentation of information, I am delighted that we can now avail of information on a live television link-up with a non-resident who may have been here as a tourist and has gone home but who had been the victim of a crime during their holiday.  There was a lacuna in this area for many years where prosecution for crimes committed depended on the return of the victim to this country.  This could be very expensive and invariably the visitor did not return.  Therefore, a crime committed against a tourist generally went unpunished. It is an interesting departure that we can now ensure that there is a TV link-up with non-residents abroad so that evidence can be given.</P>
    <P>We should be exploring more situations where we can assist people who have difficulty coming to the courts to present their information and their evidence. It is up to the court to decide how that information is admissible and the extent to which it is reliable.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the new laws of evidence applying to young people in certain proceedings relating to sexual offences, offences involving violence or the threat of violence, an offence consisting of attempting or conspiring to commit, or of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of, an offence mentioned in paragraphs (a) or (b).  Section 14 deals with where a person accused is under the age of 17.</P>
    <P>This area has given rise to very big problems about how best to present evidence <Col N="1196" /> in what has become an increasing area of judicial concern &mdash; the area of sexual abuse of a young person, the validity of their evidence and the trauma of giving it in an open court.  It is extremely important that the Bill should reflect those concerns and that young persons should be protected from having to participate in that hostile atmosphere and be, perhaps, intimidated and traumatised by the experience.  There has been an increase in the number of sexual offences commited and therefore it is important that legislation be introduced to facilitate the witness in the stand.</P>
    <P>Video recording of evidence, as provided in section 16, is a useful development. This has application throughout the criminal justice system at every level. It is as important in a Garda station where interrogation or questioning takes place as it is in being able to present evidence. The Minister might look into this.</P>
    <P>While the Law Reform Commission have dealt with the video recording in terms of court procedure, the Ó Briain Committee and Martin Committee have dealt with it in terms of the taking of evidence in relation to the offence committed while a suspect is in Garda custody and that this technological development would also be extended for the benefit of the Garda and the accused.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 14 and the giving of evidence through an intermediary, I would like the Minister to expand further on what is meant by that.  How it is envisaged that a witness will give evidence through an intermediary?  Will the intermediary be present in court, will they speak to the witness and come back into the court?  What type of procedure is planned and what type of person are we talking about?  What type of training will be given?  Will they be social workers, companions, members of the Garda Síochána or employees of the court?</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with the question of identification evidence, where the witness through a live television link may identify a person accused of an offence. As regards the question of identification, we have the tried and tested format of <Col N="1197" /> identity parades.  I wonder about the question of a person being identified at a distance by a witness in circumstances of this nature and whether a court appearance or an identity parade is necessary. It seems this will be a rather tenuous form of identification.  Will the court accept it as a valid identification or what standing will it have in the court?  I would like the Minister to elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>In Part IV the legislation catches up with the social and political developments, that have taken place in society in recent years.  I notice the expression &ldquo;former spouses&rdquo; is defined.  In this country, of course, there is no such thing as a former spouse &mdash; once a spouse a spouse forever &mdash; but it is defined in respect of a person's marriage where a decree of judicial separation has been granted or a separation agreement has been entered into.  Perhaps the words &ldquo;includes a person&rdquo; suggests that there are further categories.  I am not sure what other category there could be until such time as the Minister brings forward a new amendment to the Constitution in relation to the divorce issue.  That is the only way we will have a former spouse as such.</P>
    <P>As regards competence and compellability, there are interesting and indeed radical new developments.  Normally, defendants are male, and in the past they would have been almost exclusively male.  The spouse in such circumstances would normally be the wife. In the past the wife would have been considered subservient to the male and in that sense not competent to give evidence. Wives were very much the chattel of their husbands and, therefore, their evidence could not be relied on in law. That was one of the faults of society in the past but the situation is changing rapidly and it is now accepted that each person is an independent person in their own right, capable and competent of making decisions and giving evidence in an independent fashion without being subject to the beliefs, wishes and admonitions of their spouse.</P>
    <P>Society has changed and today a large percentage of people would not be married <Col N="1198" /> but would have a close relationship. In social welfare legislation the description is a common law spouse.  People live together in stable or close relationships. People were married or they were not married in the past but today that has changed and the distinction that existed in the law is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision enabling evidence to be given by spouses and former spouses even though I am not too happy with the definition of the wording or the interpretation.  It reflects the progress that has been made and it incorporates it into the rules on the giving of evidence in court.</P>
    <P>I am sure most of us received documentation from the Law Society regarding the dress of judges and barristers in court when dealing with cases.  I read the Minister's comments in the Dáil debate and I heartily agree with him.  We are introducing reforming legislation and we should ensure that the personnel who are the brokers in the judicial procedure in the courts do not intimidate people.  If we are trying to ensure that people do not feel intimated by court proceedings and procedures and feel comfortable when giving evidence, then it is time we also looked at the dress of those who are the main court participants.  From that point of view, wigs and gowns are long out of date.  I would welcome a much simpler form of dress.  We have taken the appropriate measures in our educational system.  The attempt to distance those knowledgeable participants from the ordinary person, be they the defendant, plaintiff or witness, should be dealt with. Either we should eliminate the present sartorial mode or else ensure that a much simpler mode is introduced.</P>
    <P>Representation has been made to me and, I am sure, to other Members from the Garda about their concern at reducing the retirement age from 60 years to 57 years.  The effect they say, would be that by 1995 the Garda Force would have been reduced by 1,000 over a ten year period.  The gardaí already have difficulty maintaining the level of detection in areas in which they were traditionally competent. With the new demands of this <Col N="1199" /> legislation and its implications, it will be much more difficult for them to expand their activities.  They are concerned that the existing retirement age of 60 should remain in force until there is a commitment to recruit greater numbers to the Garda Force.  I agree with that.</P>
    <P>In the last two years we saw an upsurge in crime levels.  As a representative of an inner city constituency, I am becoming more and more concerned with the levels of crime.  Burglary is much more common and there are high levels of serious antisocial behaviour in the city areas which are largely due to increased levels of unemployment.  While that is the situation, whether we like it or not, we will require a large Garda Force.  It would be wrong for us to include provisions in legislation that will require greater Garda competence, numbers and resources while insisting on an earlier retirement age which would mean experienced members would have to leave the Force; and I am assured by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, that they are loath to do so.  The Garda are very concerned with that apparent compulsory retirement age.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am delighted to see such radical reforming legislation come before the Seanad.  I wish the Minister well in putting the Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in the welcome they have given to this important Bill.  The legislative changes in which this Bill provides for will facilitate the prosecution of crimes involving child abuse, domestic violence, fraud and attacks on tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes a number of important changes in the law of evidence relating to criminal proceedings.  The sooner these provisions become law and come into operation the better.  In section 1 it is proposed that all the provisions, with the exception of Part III and section 29, will come into operation three months after the date of its passing.  The remaining provisions &mdash; the provisions contained in Part III and section 29 &mdash; will <Col N="1200" /> come into opeation on dates to be fixed by order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part III requires the installation of the necessary technical facilities in our courts before it can be brought into operation. I was pleased that the Minister said that money has been provided this year for equipping three court rooms in the Four Courts with the necessary facilities and for providing a witness room and a waiting room in the vicinity.  He expects that the equipment will be in place by next October.  That is welcome news.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Donovan that it would be desirable if the installation of these facilities in provincial court rooms were expedited as soon as possible.  I do not believe it would be desirable if cases for rural areas, particularly from areas far from Dublin, were sent to the Four Courts for a hearing.  I hope the necessary technical facilities will be put in place in the various locations as expeditiously as possible.  It is encouraging that some of these facilities will be in place by next October.</P>
    <P>This is work which could be put in train immediately in anticipation of the passage of this legislation.  I know that the provision of these facilities will cost a significant amount but it will be money well spent and will be seen to bring about a substantial improvement in our criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum points out that the Bill is based in the main on the recommendations of a number of Law Reform Commission reports &mdash; their report dealing with the competence and compellability of spouses as witnesses; their report on receiving stolen property; their 1990 report on child sexual abuse and their 1990 report on sexual offences against the mentally handicapped.  I endorse the gratitude expressed by Senator O'Donovan to the Law Reform Commission for the work that they do, and particularly for the contribution they made to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation, when enacted, will make it easier for children, young persons and persons with mental handicap to give evidence in cases involving sexual abuse and physical <Col N="1201" /> abuse.  There appears to be a very substantial increase in the number of cases of child abuse coming before the courts. Whether this is an indication that more cases are being reported or that more incidents of child abuse are taking place, is something that I do not think anybody can be absolutely sure about.  It would appear that the incidence of child abuse today is much greater than it was in the past.  One wonders what is the reason for this.  Could one of the contributory factors be that so much violence is shown on television?  This is an area where, as Senator Neville said, considerable research is needed and would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets out clearly the circumstances in which a spouse or a former spouse will be competent or compelled to give evidence against an accused person. This clarification was needed and is essential.  I welcome the fact that the Government in this Bill have implemented the decision of the court in the case referred to by previous speakers &mdash; the case of The People <i>v.</i> J.T.</P>
    <P>This Bill, when enacted, will also make business records and other documents such as computer print-outs, faxes and photocopies admissible in evidence.  This provision will facilitate the securing of convictions in cases involving fraud and such crimes as embezzlement and crimes which are generally referred to as white collar crimes.  It will also help to bring to justice persons who commit crimes against tourists.  These crimes are on the increase because tourists are seen as vulnerable and easy prey by criminals.</P>
    <P>In the past, many of the crimes committed against tourists went unpunished because once the tourists returned to their own countries they were not prepared to return to give evidence against those who perpetrated the crimes against them.  Consequently, the perpetrators of those crimes got off scot-free.  I am very pleased the provisions in this legislation will ensure that that will be the exception rather than the rule in the future.  Our tourist industry last year was worth over £1 billion to the country's Exchequer.  It would be a tragedy if this industry were <Col N="1202" /> put at risk because of the activities of a small number of criminals who had no regard for the rights of anybody, much less the rights of tourists.</P>
    <P>The changes the Bill provides for in relation to the admissibility of documentary evidence is necessary and welcome. The position at present is that documentary evidence, even if it can be shown to be reliable, is generally excluded because it falls foul of the rule against hearsay.  In the past this has resulted in the failure of prosecutions in many cases involving serious crime.  It also led to long, protracted arguments in relation to the admissibility of certain items of evidence and to long delays in the legal process.  The fact that this Bill clarifies the situation in relation to the admissibility of documentary evidence and spells out very clearly what is and what is not admissible and the discretion the court will have in relation to these matters is a considerable step forward and will be welcomed by everybody who is involved in the administration of our legal system.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill specifies the documents that are admissible in evidence. The safeguards incorporated in this Part of the Bill will ensure that when the legislation is passed there will be fairness in relation to the rights of everybody, including the rights of the accused.  As was pointed out by previous speakers, advance notice of 21 days must be given in the case of any documents introduced as evidence and if the other side wishes to object to the documents or to the evidence there is an opportunity to bring forward an objection.  That objection must be notified within seven days of the hearing and, of course, the court has discretion to exclude any documents when the interests of justice dictate that it should do so.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for a number of changes that will make it easier for young persons, children and persons with mental handicap to give evidence in sexual abuse cases.  The purpose of these changes is to help those witnesses to feel more at ease when giving evidence. As previous speakers said, it must <Col N="1203" /> be a very traumatic experience for vulnerable young people such as children and those with mental handicap to give evidence in a courtroom where they are surrounded by all the medieval trappings associated with the court system. The reforms in this Bill whereby evidence can be given by a live television link, the fact that questions may be conveyed through an intermediary and it will not be necessary for the victim to identify the accused again in court if the victim has already done so in the examination of the offence, and also the fact that video recordings of evidence and statements taken during the preliminary examination of the offence may be admissible as evidence, will make it easier to secure convictions in such cases and will make it easier for children and vulnerable young people who are giving evidence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill.  It is another step in reforming our criminal justice system which is desirable and necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on Second Stage of the Criminal Evidence Bill and especially for the general welcome the Bill has received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville asked whether there was provision for cross-examination of people who give evidence from abroad. The short answer is, yes.  In these cases the witness will be examined and cross-examined just as if he were present in court.  For comparison purposes it will be the same as a television anchorman interviewing somebody elsewhere in the country or abroad.  Senator Neville also urged that evidence should be given through a television link in all cases of physical or sexual abuse.  As a matter of fact, I introduced an amendment on Report Stage of the Bill during its passage through the Dáil which would allow people over the age of 17 in these types of cases to give evidence through a television link.  The difference between that provision and the provision relating to people under 17 is that we envisage that it will be the norm <Col N="1204" /> that people under the age of 17 will be allowed to give evidence through a television link unless the court sees good reason to the contrary.  In the case of a person over the age of 17, an application will have to be made to the court and the court will have to decide on all the circumstances.  It will not be the norm, but the court can allow it if it is convinced that the interests of justice require it.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville urged that child witnesses be kept away from the court building. I fully agree with this.  In Dublin where the system will be introduced initially, the witness room will be Áras Uí Dhalaigh.  However, it may not be as easy to arrange when the system is extended to circuits outside Dublin that the child will be kept away from where the main action is taking place.  If it is not possible to do this outside Dublin, and the witness is accommodated in the court building, great care will be taken to ensure that the witness does not come into contact with the accused entering or leaving the building.  Soon enough, with advances in technology, the witness will be able to give evidence from a centre far removed from the courthouse.  In the United States, for example, doctors now frequently give evidence from a hospital room which is removed from the courtroom by up to 100 miles.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville was also concerned to know if the defence will be able to cross examine the witness through a television link.  The short answer is yes.  The examination in chief, cross examination, etc., will take place just as if the witness were present in court.  The only difference is the witness will be removed from the actual courtroom and the examination will take place through a television link. In effect, the only thing which will change will be the physical location of the person who is being questioned.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked me to expand on the role of the intermediary and the kind of person the intermediary will be. Briefly, the intermediary will sit with the child in the witness room and relay the questions to the child, either exactly as they are phrased or in a form which is intelligible to the child considering the <Col N="1205" /> child's stage of development.  It will be for the trial judge to appoint the intermediary and to be satisfied that she is competent, I use the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; as, generally speaking, the intermediary will be a woman.  No doubt, the trial judge when he is appointing the intermediary will take into account, first, her personality, is she good with children, and then he will take into account factors such as whether she has the necessary intelligence to appreciate what her role will be.</P>
    <P>In practice, we would envisage that the judge will instruct the intermediary before she brings the child into the witness room.  The judge will point out what exactly she is to do or what she is not to do.  For example, he will make it very clear to her that she is not to distort the questions being asked.  If the intermediary does not render the questions faithfully or put them as they are asked, counsel, who will be in contact with her over an audio link, can tell her to rephrase the question.  If the rephrasing is not satisfactory, counsel can have the question rephrased again or the judge can intervene at any stage.  The judge can see the entire happening in the witness room on his own monitor so he will be to totally in control of the situation from beginning to end, just as obtains at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan urged that a television link be extended nationwide and Senator Mullooly was also concerned about that point.  I want to say very clearly that that is my intention.  It will be installed in Dublin by next October and provision is made in the Bill for trials to be transferred to Dublin from an area where the facility is not provided simultaneously. It is our intention that the facility be extended to the rest of the country as quickly as possible.  Naturally, the senior Minister in the Department of Justice will be having consultations with our colleague in the Department of Finance on that matter because it will cost money.  It is our intention that it be extended as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the offences of rape, rape under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, <Col N="1206" /> aggravated sexual assault and attempts at those offences must, at present, be tried in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin. They are the offences which generally will involve the use of this technology and as they are tried in Dublin anyway, the technology will be immediately available. Next year I hope and expect that the system will be extended to a court in the south of the country, about which I am very glad, and one in the west, in the light of the experience gained in the operation of the Dublin system.  After that I envisage that a review will take place of the requirements in each Circuit and District Court district having regard to the likely number of cases to be handled by the courts in that area.  Regard would also be had to the possibility that witnesses could give evidence from locations which would be far removed from the place where the actual court proceedings are taking place.</P>
    <P>On the question of barristers' dress, the House will recall that an amendment was proposed on Committee Stage in the Dáil which would have resulted, in my opinion, in the anomalous situation that for all proceedings taking place under the criminal evidence legislation, it would not be legal to wear wigs or gowns.  I consulted with the Bar Council about this and they informed me that they were undertaking their own review at the moment.  They may possibly recommend to the Bar as a whole that some form of gowns should be retained and wigs discarded.</P>
    <P>I adopted a conservative approach in this regard.  I am probably the most conservative Member of either House in this regard.  Rather than allowing this anomalous situation to be created, I allowed the Bar to get on with their own review, but I said in the Dáil, and I reiterate now, that if the Bar do not come forward with proposals by the end of the year we will have to take steps to alter or even totally remove the relevant rule of the Rules of Superior Courts.  I believe, as do those of every shade of political opinion in both Houses, that the wearing of 17th century dress is no longer appropriate to modern conditions in our courts.  I would point <Col N="1207" /> out to the people who advocate otherwise, that the operation of that rule of the Rules of the Superior Courts does not apply to vacation time.  The courts are often very busy during vacation time; barristers plead cases on both sides without wearing this paraphernalia and the sky has not fallen in.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as a result of legislation in 1989, the wearing of wigs and gowns is banned for family law cases.  Again, we have no evidence that the interests of justice were damaged; in fact, all the evidence suggests the contrary.  Third, the District Courts are occupied by solicitors every day of the week arguing cases.  They are not required to wear wigs or gowns and, again, the interests of justice are in no way damaged.</P>
    <P>The Bar have put forward spurious arguments, in my personal opinion, that gowns should be retained to prevent discrimination that might arise where people earning £200,000 a year might be able to dress better than people earning £200 a year at the Bar.  That has caused no problem in the solicitors' profession. It has caused no problem in practice during vacation sittings of the superior courts.  I think it is a spurious argument.</P>
    <P>As I also want to take into account the feelings of the members of the Bar and the feeling of the Bar as a whole, I am prepared for the moment to let them get on with their own review.  If that review is not completed and if some logical and reasonable proposals are not coming forward and being adopted by the end of the year, I reiterate what I said.  I am not doing so in threatening way, I am merely pointing out that 17th century dress is entirely inappropriate as we approach the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions to this debate.  The debate in the Dáil and the points made here on Second Stage will help us to improve the Bill.  As I said at the outset, it is not a political party issue.  It is a landmark change in the law of evidence.  It contains some very radical reforming measures which we will have to depend on the courts, to implement in a logical and <Col N="1208" /> intelligent manner.  I have no doubt they will do that.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get this right and we are now at the stage where we have the legislation as right as we can ever make it.  I thank the Senators for their contribution to that process.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the present favourable opportunities for the attainment of peace in Northern Ireland, urges the Government to do their utmost to promote the process of political accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been requesting a debate on Northern Ireland in this House for months.  Indeed, I was astonished to discover that it is over two years since we had a substantial debate on Northern Ireland in the Seanad, making allowances, perhaps for occasional statements, but as far as I can ascertain it has been <Col N="1209" /> that long since we had a full debate on Northern Ireland and I welcome the opportunity given to me here tonight.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is an unsuitable time to raise this issue, that the Northern talks are at a very sensitive stage, but we have heard this unconvincing line for a long time.  I have lost track of the number of times we have been told that a particular time was unsuitable or insensitive and I no longer accept this line of talk.  I do not think anything we say here will drive anyone away from the conference table.</P>
    <P>First, we must have a proper appreciation of our own importance in this regard and second, we are too deferential to prickly sensibilities.  We are not talking about prima donnas who may rise up and start off at some unwise word from us. We are talking about spokespersons who speak urgently about an overwhelming demand for peace in Northern Ireland. Nothing we will say here tonight will drive them from that table.  A candid expression of our views can only help the Government and all those involved in the talks and that is why I tried to phrase the motion in as non-controversial way as my temperament permits.  Generally speaking, I propose to follow a non-controversial line, although I hold very strong views on certain aspects involved in this.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government side for not putting forward an amendment.  That was a gesture of goodwill, a recognition of the seriousness and importance of the motion and their acknowledgment that I would not use it for publicity purposes.</P>
    <P>When I speak about favourable opportunities being presented for peace, I really believe that.  I know there have been other false starts but this time there has been an extraordinary conjunction of events.  Providentially, there has not been a terrorist-related death in Northern Ireland for about seven weeks, despite the best efforts at times of the IRA. There has been a falling off in the retaliatory violence of the loyalist para-militaries and there has been an extraordinary yearning for peace which is palpable and is expressed in many diverse <Col N="1210" /> ways through cross-community prayer gatherings, power-sharing in Derry, various cross-Border enterprises, the continuing good work of Co-operation North and the enterprise begun by the imaginative editors of <i>Fortnight</i> magazine initiated in 1992 which is an attempt again to articulate the accommodation process.</P>
    <P>We must also pay tribute to the work of President Robinson.  No one could have anticipated the immeasurable contribution she is making at the moment to reconciliation in Ireland.  In fact, that threadbare word &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; really is very true in her case and long may she continue to do that good work.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is more acutely aware than I that we had an historic day yesterday; the presence of the Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party at yesterday's talks, no matter how tentative the subject matter, symbolised the removal of a considerable obstacle. Again, unlike his colleagues in the talks he is not going to incur the odium of a breakdown of these talks.  There is a tide in the affairs of Ireland that must be taken at the flood; the opportunity must be seized.  Historians are not generally given to using the word &ldquo;historic&rdquo; for obvious devaluing reasons, but this is truly an historic moment.  I rise here tonight to actually support the Government as well as to urge them to do their utmost to promote the accommodation process.</P>
    <P>There will have to be compromise all round.  There can be no accommodation on this island, no co-existence, no <i>modus vivendi</i> unless there is compromise.  The unionists must recognise that there has to be an Irish dimension of some kind.  I blame myself for not having sufficiently stressed in my various contributions to debates on Northern Ireland, the need for unionists to recognise this reality.  I have been, perhaps, over-intent on emphasising the rights of their position, but they must accept that there has to be some Irish dimension, not as a gesture to Dublin over-lordship, but as recognition of the political realities in their midst which they have, alas, ignored for far too long.</P>
    <P>For our part we must find our own way <Col N="1211" /> to compromise.  I make the point to the Minister that of all the parties to these negotiations, in one way we have most to give because we have little to lose.  Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that there is peace in Northern Ireland and that the parties there come to an accommodation.  Surely we will then not push a particular territorial interest which may appeal to our sentimentality, to the self-indulgent fantasies of certain backbenchers, to armchair generals?  I would prefer perhaps the more homely phrase, súgán corporals, but that is really as far as it goes.  It would be no skin off our nose to greatly modify Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  That is the kind of compromise we will have to make.  After all, what do Articles 2 and 3 represent except 19th century nationalism at its most intense, the kind of nationalism which recently, in the context of the Maastricht referendum campaign, we were urged to drop as a sign of immaturity, not least by the SDLP?</P>
    <P>Although it does not properly concern the motion, I would like to advert to the fringe factor of Sinn Féin who have been clamouring at the door for a long time for a place in these talks and who would like to be sitting at that table, but who by their attitude, have imposed on themselves a self-denying ordinance.  Much has been read into a recent utterance by one of their spokespersons, but not until Sinn Féin unequivocally renounce the IRA campaign and dissociate themselves from the IRA campaign can their presence be considered at the conference table, and only then in proportion to their electoral strength in Northern Ireland. There has been a lot of unthinking commentary that somehow those involved in violence must be part of the solution, as if having the gun and the bomb, and supporting the gun and the bomb, entitles one to a place at the conference table.  We must totally reject that madness because that is the kind of anarchy that gives hostages to fortune, which might one day rebound on ourselves, apart from its intrinsic unjustification.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I put forward this <Col N="1212" /> motion in a non-controversial spirit.  We in the South have long been saying to the Ulster unionists that when the day comes that they talk to us and sit around the table, they will be surprised how generous we are.  The day has come and it is time to show that generosity and that we are capable of making the historic compromise without which there will be no peace in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I second the motion.  It is appropriate that it was placed on the Order Paper in the name of my colleague, Senator Murphy.  I agree with him on a number of matters.  First, I welcome the fact that the Government have chosen not to attempt to amend this motion.  On most occasions, as the Minister will be aware, the Government, playing the paraliamentary game, seek to amend motions.  I remember this happening once in relation to a debate on Northern Ireland &mdash; the debate on a motion I proposed condemning the attacks on the Belfast-Dublin rail link and requiring the IRA to call off their campaign and to cease their attacks on the passengers and workers of the railway.  I made the point to the Leader of the Government party in the House that by altering the motion, they would be diluting it because what we were doing was getting it through the Dáil, the Seanad and as many of the county councils as possible throughout the Thirty-two Counties in order to demonstrate the lack of support for the violent campaign of the so-called IRA.  I am glad to say that on that occasion also, the Government were amenable and withdrew their amendment.  I agree with Senator Murphy that it is very good that this generally positive motion was not diluted or tampered with because it is non-controversial.  It urges support for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, who I am glad to see again in the House, has played a crucial role in the present phase of these talks.  I cannot imagine that we will hear any great disclosures, but we will all listen with interest to the nuances of what the Minister will have to say here tonight. Senator Murphy used the word &ldquo;historic&rdquo;. <Col N="1213" /> I read through the three Dublin newspapers and every one of them used the word &ldquo;historic&rdquo; in relation to these talks.  In my opinion, that is justified in terms of the symbolism of what happened yesterday.  I speak from the non-Roman Catholic tradition which, I am glad to say, is properly respected and cherished in this part of the country.  If one message from what I say could go out to my coreligionists in the Anglican Church in the North, it is that they would be quite safe in a Thirty-two County Republic and that there is no danger to their moral or political well being should they opt to come in.  It is like saying: come on in, the water is lovely.  We have to tempt them; I do not think we can coerce them.</P>
    <P>I speak as an Anglican, but the Reverend Paisley and most of the unionists are seen as coming from the more extreme fringes of the reformed tradition. The Reverend Ian Paisley, in no sense has ever spoken for me.  However, I recall his previous fulminations of &ldquo;O'Neill must go, Chichester Clarke must go;&rdquo; everybody must go.  He was endlessly negative to the point of appalling boredom.</P>
    <P>Now at last, with this extraordinary symbolic gesture, by sitting down with representatives of his fellow Irish people in a room in London he was broken a symbolic log-jam and despite the fact that I have no sympathy with his policies, I respect that gesture and its significance cannot be over-stated.  If there was ever anybody who was going to stand outside that room and picket &mdash; I have seen him picket with extraordinary impertinence the great cathedrals of my religion to which he does not belong when he thought were selling out to Rome and so on &mdash; it would be Reverend Paisley who would be raising the hysterical temperature in Northern Ireland.  I am very glad he did not do that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy that it would be utterly wrong to suggest that a debate on this House could destabilise what is, admittedly, a sensitive situation. It is a sensitive situation but there is not great sensitivity displayed on the streets of Belfast or Derry.  If we allow a vacuum <Col N="1214" /> to exist without having proper ventilation of these issues in the Houses of the Oireachtas, we are simply handing over to the gunman, something I would very much regret if it were allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution must be looked at.  I read in the newspapers that this was one of the things that Dr. Ian Paisley insisted on.  I do not share his views, but I agree with him on that point because they are not what we used to consider an inoffensive tissue of pretence, they have been judged by a series of recent constitutional cases to be an active and dangerous element.  If you read those cases together it is clear that they are a constitutional imperative, I use the judge's words &mdash; and that, in certain circumstances, extra-territorial acts of violence can be justified if they do not take place within the Twenty-six Counties. In my opinion that is a charter for the IRA.  Something must be done about Articles 2 and 3.  We proposed in this House before &mdash; and I put it to the Minister again &mdash; that a simple alteration should be considered &mdash; in any attempt to realise this aspiration for unity, the use of violence shall be prohibited.  That is a nice simple form of words which would have the effect of defining into aspiration what is discovered by the Supreme Court to be a constitutional imperative.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to what Senator Murphy said about the IRA.  I disdain the IRA, I guard them with contempt and dislike on a principled basis, not as individuals.  One has to attempt to show Christian charity even towards these people, even those who appear to have threatened my life on a number of occasions, but you can never be sure whether these threats originate from the people they are opposed to.  Nevertheless, I welcome what Mr. Gibney said at Bodenstown.  It indicated a tentative putting out of feelers, in particular, the notion that there would have to be a prolonged period of peace before the British army withdrew from Ireland.  That was an interesting suggestion because it indicated that consideration was being given at some level within those organisations to a ceasefire. <Col N="1215" /> I note also with concern that here has been a certain drawing back from this recently.  A gloss is being added and it has been indicated that this period of peace would only come about after a specific British declaration to withdraw, which I think is unrealistic, but at least it is interesting and they should be encouraged and included in the talks.  Invitations must be given to Sinn Féin at some stage. It is an extremely delicate political matter because were it to be too bluntly suggested, particularly by the Irish Government, that would in my opinion probably end the talks completely.  However, an Independent Member who comes from the Protestant tradition, who has strong associations with Southern unionism can say this in a way that should not destabilise matters.  It is more important to talk than to kill; the old phrase about Jaw Jaw being better than war war is accurate in my opinion and Sinn Féin represent about 30 per cent of the vote.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy that you cannot give people a seat at the table simply because they have a bomb and a bullet.  On the other hand, in international diplomacy, as the Minister knows well, frequently this is what cynically does occur.  Sinn Féin are entitled to some degree of consultation because, regrettably or not, they represent 30 per cent of the people.  I do not like what they say but they have a right to say it. The illustration I have always used is, if I live in a house in the middle of a row with a neighbour on each side and one of them starts smashing my windows, there is damn all point in my going to the person who is not throwing the stones at my window complaining how dreadful it is that the fellow on the other side is smashing my windows.  You try to include people in the process in order to defuse a dangerous situation.  I welcome what has been said, cautiously.  I think it no harm for someone who does not have governmental responsibility to indicate that there are people of goodwill who believe that there should be some inclusion of his point of view, however regrettable it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> I welcome the courage of the various Presbyterian and other Ministers who met with representatives of Sinn Féin. They have my full approval for so doing. It is important that they should be encouraged.  It was from this series of meetings that the speech at Bodenstown and other encouraging noises emerged.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the work they have done.  We are going to have to look for a solution. I remind the Minister of what I said about Articles 2 and 3 and, perhaps, he would consider that suggestion.  It may be a complicated one, but I think it is quite a good idea.</P>
    <P>I will finish with this point.  I spoke about an act of political symbolism on the part of Reverend Ian Paisley and I think that is true.  We have to be sensitive to the tribal need for symbolism of the two communities in Northern Ireland. This may be a completely way out suggestion, but I believe there is a number of ways in which this could be addressed. One is the possibility of envisaging some degree of co-operation between all the Thirty-two Counties; in other words, a kind of united Ireland in some vague form, that would satisfy the nationalist community.  On the other hand, why should this re-unified unit not apply for some sort of association with the Commonwealth because you then give to the unionists the capacity to feel they are in some form of direct connection with what is most symbolically potent to them, the British Crown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my gratitude to Senator Murphy and the seconder of the motion, Senator Norris.  As Senator Murphy has said, there is never a suitable or unsuitable time to discuss any of these issues and I do not see this as necessarily an unsuitable or inconvenient time.  Certainly, I appreciate the responsible and non-controversal fashion in which they put down the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded by this debate to outline the Government's view of the current talks.  I am particularly <Col N="1217" /> glad that the debate is taking place at a time when the long-awaited transition to Strand Two of the process is about to take place.  On behalf of the Government, I greatly welcome the proposal by Sir Patrick Mayhew this afternoon that Strand Two should now be launched and the reported acceptance of this proposal by all concerned.  The Government look forward to working actively and constructively in Strand Two, under the independent chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, with a view to ensuring the decisive contribution which Strand Two must make to the outcome of the talks process as a whole. Strand Two, which involves the two Governments and the four parties in Northern Ireland, is a very important and integral part of the process which was agreed on 26 March 1991.  We are very pleased that this crucial phase of the talks has now been reached.</P>
    <P>We believe that these talks offer an historic opportunity to begin the work of healing the misunderstandings and antagonisms that have so damaged relationships on this island, and between these islands, over the centuries.  We have the chance, with imagination and goodwill, to start building a basis for an honourable, equitable and lasting accommodation between the two traditions.  We have the opportunity for a new beginning that can help signal the end of the strife that has caused so much suffering and hardship to the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would mislead the House if I said we were certain of success or that the task ahead would be an easy one.  The discussions to which we are all committed will be complex, arduous and lengthy. Once launched, however, the process of dialogue will, I hope, acquire its own momentum.  I believe there is a growing acceptance that political dialogue alone offers a way out of the tragedy of Northern Ireland.  There is a responsibility on all sides to work together to achieve political arrangements which will enable the people of this island to live together in partnership and trust.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective throughout <Col N="1218" /> has been to establish a clear and realistic basis for this process and one which would most assist a successful outcome. It is for that reason that the two Governments and the participants have taken such care to put structures in place which would enable discussion not only of the different relationships we have to consider but also of their inter-relationship to each other.  It was for that reason that we agreed that the talks must be framed in the context of the three sets of relationships and for that reason also that we determined that nothing would be agreed until everything is agreed.</P>
    <P>To protect the position of all participants, it was also agreed that absolute confidentiality would be maintained at every stage of the discussions in all three strands.  That brings me to the point that was raised by Senator Norris that I would have a difficulty, as it were, going into the depth of the discussions.  I take his point in that regard and accept that he respects my position, having regard to the confidentiality required.</P>
    <P>It would perhaps be easier if it were otherwise but the Government firmly believe that &ldquo;a new beginning for relationships&rdquo; must address all the different dimensions.  It must, fundamentally, be grounded on respect for the aspirations and sense of identity of each tradition. Both are entitled to respect in equal measure.  Both involve allegiances that transcend the confines of Northern Ireland and no real or durable accommodation is possible unless framed in the context of the wider dimension of relationships within Ireland and between the two islands.  In accepting this reality as the basis for the talks, I believe all sides have already taken a significant step.  The challenge that lies ahead for all of us in translating this acknowledgment of the requirements for true enduring accommodation and partnership into structures that will reflect these realities.</P>
    <P>As confirmed in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, both Governments have fully accepted that the aspirations of each tradition are legitimate and both must be accommodated.  The fundamental basis of the present talks is <Col N="1219" /> the need to devise institutions that can accommodate each tradition and take full account of their legitimate aspirations. That is why we must address all the relationships involved and that is why the Governments and the parties have agreed the present process and its structures.</P>
    <P>It is central to this approach that neither tradition should be placed in a position of privilege or special status against the other.  Both must be treated on an equal basis so that neither feels threatened or challenged by the other.  After all the suffering and pain of recent years, I believe there is now widespread acceptance that this is the only way forward and that trust and equality must be the basis of any new arrangements that emerge from our joint discussions.  Any new institutions can have value only if they are based on the accommodation of differences and give full expression to the rights and aspirations of each tradition on this island.</P>
    <P>Unionists and nationalists have to share this island.  We have to respect the other's position and understand and respect the aspirations of the other.  We have to accept that we will not agree on some things but that the view of each is fully legitimate and must be acknowledged and respected.  We have to learn to live in partnership and equality on the island which we share.  We have to realise that diversity can be enriching rather than threatening and that no barriers are immutable to people wishing to live together in a relationship of trust and mutual respect.  I believe that, whatever the difficulties and challenges yet to be faced, and they are very real and very many, the present talks process is taking place because all of us have learned these simple but hard truths.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government consider the value of the exchanges in the talks, and the prospects of their success, will depend on the degree to which they embrace the real scope of the problem.  We must base our negotiations on the conflicting aspirations and identities as each tradition itself perceives and defines them, not in <Col N="1220" /> the form the other tradition might find it convenient for them to be.  We must make our solution fit the problem, not seek to define the problem in terms of the solutions we are prepared to offer. Our approach to the agenda will, therefore, be both flexible and comprehensive. It is one of the agreed ground rules for the talks that it will be open to each of the parties to raise any aspect of our relationship, including constitutional issues, or indeed any matter which it considers relevant.  We will seek to ensure the talks are a framework for the fullest possible consideration of all the factors which affect the tragic and intractable problem we have to grapple with.  We would hope they will permit a balanced examination of both sides of all the issues which divide the two traditions in Ireland and, ultimately, indicate the ways in which these difficulties can be resolved.</P>
    <P>There is much that can be built on and much on which we already agree.  We agree on the fundamental position that a change in the status of Northern Ireland can only take place with the consent of a majority of its people.  We agree that differences between the two traditions can only be accommodated by mutual agreement and accommodation and that any new institutions must reflect this reality.  We agree that those who practise violence in support of political change are our common enemy.  We all condemn without reservation the IRA and all their works and pomps.  We agree in rejecting their futile activities which purport to build a new Ireland, not on respect for different traditions and aspirations, but on foundations of hatred and bloodshed. They are our common enemy and their greatest fear is that, together, we can succeed in reaching understanding and accommodation between our two traditions.</P>
    <P>The goal of reconciliation between the two major traditions in Ireland will, I believe, be significantly assisted by a clear recognition of the substantial common ground which exists between both and between the two parts of Ireland in many areas of practical, day-to-day concern.  It is important that we build on the things <Col N="1221" /> which already unite the people of the island, North and South.  We have joint concerns about the future prosperity and development of the island in the new European context.  If maximum advantage is to be taken of the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead in that context, it is essential that Northern Ireland should be developed economically in close conjunction with the rest of the island.  Only an approach of this kind will permit the full potential of the economy to be realised in both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully conscious of the responsibility that rests on us as on all sides in the current process.  We will do our full part to ensure that the endeavours of all participants in the current process will prove worthy of the hopes invested in us by people of both traditions who now want to put an end to misunderstanding and division and reach towards a new beginning.  We will do our utmost to put Northern Ireland firmly on the path to peace and the island as a whole on the road to that reconciliation and partnership which has eluded us for so long.</P>
    <P>I have listened very carefully and with great attention to the remarks by Senators Murphy and Norris and what they said about the constitutional issue, and more particularly Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.  We must agree that it is not the views of the Government or even the Oireachtas which will be decisive in this regard.  This is an issue on which our people as a whole must pronounce, if or when a question is put to them in a referendum.  Such a referendum would touch on very deep issues and my belief is that it could raise very strong passions.  It would have to be very carefully considered in all its aspects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to put down a marker that if these issues are put to the people, passions will be raised.  The Senator quite properly asks what is new and my response is that nothing is new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have to be very carefully considered <Col N="1222" /> in all its aspects.  In general, it would be important to ensure that any amendment we might propose to the people would not appear to be a denial of the right of people born or living in Northern Ireland to be Irish.  Any proposals which seem to go in that direction would, I believe, meet with very considerable opposition.</P>
    <P>Second, I believe that there remains a strong aspiration to unity by peaceful means and by agreement.  Anything which was interpreted as a denial of that aspiration would also meet with much opposition and passion.  We have indicated that constitutional issues are on the table in the talks and we expect that all sides of the constitutional aspects of the problem will be discussed.  It would be our hope that the outcome of the talks would be based on respect for both traditions, not a denial of either, and that any constitutional proposals which might emerge would be in that spirit.</P>
    <P>With those words I conclude my contribution to what I believe was a very important motion, helpful, worthwhile, supportive and non-controversial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Andrews, for coming into the House this evening as part of what must be an extremely busy schedule.  He does the House a great service by coming here and I would like to thank him sincerely for his mature and dignified handling of a very sensitive issue to date.  Indeed, he is not just the ambassador of the Government but of all of us at this most important juncture in relation to these talks and I personally feel very comfortable with his representation of us.  I sincerely wish him well in what can only be a very difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is welcome and very timely.  For over 25 years now the tyranny of extremism has stopped the process of normal dialogue between the different communities in the North and between the North and South.  All politicians are answerable to an electorate and inside each electorate are extreme views, but the mass of the people in this case are sending a very clear message.  They want <Col N="1223" /> the culture of violence brought to an end, a culture that has stultified their growth, both socially and economically, for so long.  In all parties in the North there is a stream of opinion looking for reconciliation, a reconciliation of people, of hearts and minds and not the amalgamation of territory or land.  I take the point already made by Senator Norris and Senator Murphy that if and when Articles 2 and 3 stand in the way, we must be prepared to face up to them and tackle them.  I am sure the Government will have the support they need from the vast majority, if not all, in both Houses in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>Real progress to lasting peace will only be achieved with the establishment of routine talks, talks that are so routine that they are no longer newsworthy, no longer attract headlines pointing out their historic nature.  Yesterday's meeting with Reverend Ian Paisley was historic and deserved the headlines.  We must get to the stage where dialogue and talks are so routine between all the communities involved that they no longer make the newsprint or the media generally.  The talks process must be developed, the present strands must be developed to the stage that there are monthly meetings on the second Tuesday of every month or the first Tuesday of every month or whenever, and these meeting must take place regardless of what other issues distract us in terms of our political lives and political agendas.  Only when it gets to that stage of routineness will real progress be made. From routine talks will follow structures which will allow the people of Northern Ireland to live their lives peacefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said there is a growing acceptance that political dialogue alone offers a way out of the tragedy of Northern Ireland.  I wish I could agree 100 per cent with him.  I sincerely hope he is right and that my misgivings are wrong.  I must say what I am thinking at this point.  I feel the churches have an enormous role to play in the North, as well as political dialogue. Political dialogue will bring the churches a long way down the road.  I must categorically <Col N="1224" /> state that I would like all the churches in Northern Ireland to abandon sectarianism.  While we each must respect the other's views, we must look to the churches and education systems and ask whether a major contribution towards ending sectarianism does not lie in their hands.  I feel it does.  I hope the Minister's statement is categorical and definitive.  I hope that political dialogue alone would offer the way out.  I feel the churches have a role, and if they have, I wish they would get on with it.</P>
    <P>For talks to become routine none of the communities must feel threatened. While the Anglo-Irish Agreement gave the minority nationalists a sense of confidence and of belonging, the first Article of that agreement states categorically that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until the majority wishes.  This undertaking, which is from both Governments here and across the water, should be a guarantee to the Unionist community in relation to their concerns about the status of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>To turn to the specific wording of the motion &mdash; and I commend Senator Murphy, Senator Norris and colleagues for tabling it in Private Members' Time &mdash; the particular part of it that interests me is the recognition of the present favourable opportunities for the attainment of peace in Northen Ireland. Senator Murphy went through many of the areas that he reckoned made this particular moment more favourable than others, and I agree with him.  To use his words: there is a palpable yearning for peace both North and South of the Border and I suspect across the water as well, even though I would not have experience of it there.  I also recognise President Robinson's major contribution to reconciliation in this area.</P>

      <P>I recognise the historic nature of yesterday's meeting with Reverend Ian Paisley.  As the UK are about <Col N="1225" /> to take over the European Presidency and as we continue in Europe to work towards European Union, the UK during their six months term will make a contribution to the uniting of the hearts and minds of the people in Northern Ireland. Here in the South there is a politically favourable opportunity for the Government to contribute towards peace in the North.</P>
      <P>On other occasions, during the New Ireland Forum and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Government of the day did not have all party support in the South for what they were trying to achieve towards peace and reconciliation in the North.  I still recall Deputy Brian Lenihan's trip to the United States to speak to Tip O'Neill and Ted Kennedy while the Government here were trying to get the Anglo-Irish Agreement in place.  One must compare that behaviour with the enormous support this Government have from Fine Gael, from all the parties and from Independents, for what they are trying to achieve.  The atmosphere that the present Government enjoy adds further credence to Senator Murphy's expression that we can recognise the present favourable opportunities for the attainment of peace.  The opportunities are here as well as in the North and the UK.  Tha must be recognised for what it is.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris &mdash; maybe through a slip of the tongue &mdash; stated that the men of violence represent 30 per cent of the people in the North.  That is not so.  I feel that was a slip of the tongue and I would not like that to go uncorrected.  We would have far greater problems if the figures were anything approaching 30 per cent. Thankfully they do not and God knows the problems are big enough in the North.</P>
      <P>We support the motion unreservedly. If there is anything any of us can do to help the process of promoting political accommodation in the North, the Government need only ask.  We can sin by omission as well as by deed.  We all have to give time and energy towards resolving the greatest tragedy on this island at present and for some decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> The Government have not found the leaders of the parties and Independent Members of both Houses wanting in terms of support, as evidenced only today at Question Time in the Dáil with a very sensitive questioning of the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, by Deputy Barry, Deputy Spring and Deputy De Rossa.  I wanted to say that in passing.  In this House too, in any way we can help to promote the Government's efforts at this time, we will be delighted to do so.</P>
    <P>I support the motion, as do all my colleagues.  I commend the Minister for his sensitive handling of this very difficult issue and for representing all our views to date.  I wish the talks speedy success. As I said, they will become successful when they become routine, when the difficulties in arranging dates from Strand One to Strand Two and in selecting the agenda for Strand Three are forgotten and there are monthly, if not weekly, meetings between the parties involved so that real peace and reconciliation can be brought in to the lives of all of those residing in the North, many of whom have been touched by the appalling tragedies.  There is hardly a family who have not been touched by the tragedy of the bomb and the bullet over the last 25 years.  Would that their misery could be brought to a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <P>For many months have been attempts to have debates in this House on Northern Ireland.  Inhibitions have been placed on having a debate. Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Governments have problems when the Opposition Members side ask for debates on matters of vital importance, national issues, Government policy and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was brought in by the Independents and there were people who thought it should not be discussed because the timing might not be exactly right.  Of course the timing is never right for tabling a motion.  One puts down a motion and hopes it is taken at a particular time and it depends on who decides on the timing as to whether in concept it is right or wrong.  The only amendment we would put in would <Col N="1227" /> involve a slight change in that instead of urging the Government to do their utmost to promote peace, we would congratulate the Government on the efforts they have made to promote the process of political accommodation.</P>
    <P>Like the other speakers, I congratulate the Minister for coming to the House this evening and keeping us up to date with what has happened in the very delicate political process which has taken place over the past few months.  A very difficult and delicate process has taken place. People have talked about the historic meetings that have taken place yesterday; the Minister suggested these were historic in small &ldquo;h&rdquo; terms but I would not use a small &ldquo;h&rdquo;.  The two Government representatives met with the elected members of all sides of the political spectrum in the North, statements were made and the position was set out. Everybody at the meetings yesterday agreed the statements were made from a sincere point of view and with a view to progressing to the next stage of the search for peace in the North.</P>
    <P>In these talks we can have all the verbiage in the world but basically what we are talking about is a search for peace on this island.  The word &ldquo;peace&rdquo; cannot be taken away.  We cannot accept that we will have atrocities, that parents will lose their children and families will lose their brothers and sisters.  In the process of a peacefull solution to the problems in this country we must be acutely conscious of the fact that we are talking about the repercussions on a family following a death.  There is much sorrow in a family when a member dies from natural causes; it is impossible to conceive the sorrow caused when there is a death by other than natural causes.  In the process towards peace we are seeing a process where people can live in a peaceful environment.</P>
    <P>We live in a troubled world.  Eastern Europe is breaking up; and we see the problems that exist in the Third World. At such a time would it not be fantastic to think that we in Ireland might be able to resolve our problems, even though we <Col N="1228" /> have been in a problem area for many years.  We might be able to tell the people who are now getting into conflict that there is no future in conflict.  People should sit down and talk out their problems. It might be regarded as a pipedream but it has begun to be a reality.</P>
    <P>The constitutional parties in the North are now sitting down together; perhaps there are problems that will be difficult to resolve in the future but as long as they are talking there is hope.  The use of violence should be prohibited, according to Senator Murphy or Senator Norris, but how can you prohibit the use of violence? The men of violence will be violent.  They have to be marginalised in society.  It is said that a long period of peace has to ensue before there can be an accommodation to withdrawal of troops in the North.  Again, it is something that we would wish for, but we want to see Sinn Féin as a constitutional party withdrawing their support from the IRA.  I make no bones about the fact that I abhor every activity of the IRA; I suggest there are many people on the republican side in the North who support Sinn Féin from an historical and an emotional point of view who also abhor what is happening because of the IRA.  Sinn Féin should be included in the talks in future, only after they make a declaration of their absolute consent to constitutional methods to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a rapid change taking place in the international environment.  Foreign policy matters are becoming more and more a matter of deep interest and importance in this island and in other areas.  I am glad there are last signs that there will be a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs established and within the ambit of that Joint Committee we can discuss foreign affairs matters much more relevantly.  More Members can participate rather than have <i>ad hoc</i> motions tabled.  It is essential that this Joint Committee should be set up as soon as it is possible.</P>
    <P>The talks that are taking place at present are not the beginning of the end of the problems that we have in this island <Col N="1229" /> but at least they are a beginning.  For the first time in many years I see on all sides an agreement to talk which will lead to a peaceful resolution of the problems of the North.</P>
    <P>I was asked this afternoon why I was to talk about the North, since I live in Kilkenny and am not involved in the problems of the North of Ireland.  As a Kilkenny man I have as much interest in the resolution of the problems in this island as anybody else, whether they be in Belfast or Derry, Cork or Donegal. The Minister said that everything is on the table in these talks; nothing is excluded.  The tyranny of extremism should be eliminated from this island and that tyranny is not only an armed tyranny of extremism.  There are many people in this island who by their words have created more tyranny than the people who have fired bullets or thrown bombs. The extremism of words has been much more dangerous than the tyranny of extremism in the military sense.</P>
    <P>This debate proves that no Government in the future should have any qualms about raising sensitive matters in this House. They should have no qualms about raising matters about the North or about any other place.  This House has always been a House in which matters of sensitivity have been debated sensitively.  I commend the Members who introduced the motion and the Minister for his response, even though I would delete the word &ldquo;urges&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;congratulate&rdquo;.  This debate will do nothing to hinder the talks that are so essential to the resolution of the problems and to the attainment of peace and justice in this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Independent Members for putting down this motion and welcome the Minister to the House.  It has been some time since we had a debate on Northern Ireland.  I recollect a time when a request for such a debate was made almost daily, but, thankfully, we have been given time and it could not be more opportune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to note from the Minister's <Col N="1230" /> remarks the announcement that there has been agreement to launch Strand Two of the talks; that is a milestone in the negotiations.  I am glad to hear the approach the Minister is adopting in seeking to accommodate all the aspirations, identities and traditions on this island.  Arising out of that, the totality of relationships will be dealt with and everything will be on the table for discussion. As a people we will have to make decisions on constitutional, legislative and other matters.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister said: &ldquo;Once launched, however, the process of dialogue will I hope acquire its own momentum&rdquo;&mdash; that is fine, but I am disappointed with the next line which reads: &ldquo;There is, I believe, a growing acceptance that political dialogue alone offers a way out of the tragedy of Northern Ireland.&rdquo; I could not agree with that statement.  Political dialogue is one way out of the tragedy of Northern Ireland, but political dialogue cannot operate in a vacuum and anybody who thinks that people talking at a political level will be sufficient to resolve the situation is not a shrewd, seasoned, political operator. There are a host of other areas to be considered &mdash; the role of the church and State &mdash; the role of the church is a major one &mdash; the role of education, the role of people in the workplace, the role of the business community and the role of Europe in the context of the new developments we have just voted on. These are major matters of concern and if they are neglected, political talks could easily fail to achieve their objective.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note we are all agreed right across the political divide in the Republic to how we should move forward in seeking to resolve the problem in Northern Ireland.  It is ironic that the major political parties came into existence because of a division of views as to how the tragedy of Northern Ireland should be resolved.  Perhaps it is a straw in the wind that the two large political parties in the South may be thinking of coming together once the question of the civil war politics has finally been eliminated. <Col N="1231" /> The Sunningdale Agreement was the first significant development between Britain and Ireland and made a certain amount of progress in a very short time. This wonderful opportunity was lost because of political indecision by the British Prime Minister of the day.  The New Ireland Forum was the first serious cross party attempt to get a common strand of relief in a way forward in relation to Northern Ireland.  Arising out of that, the Anglo Irish Agreement subsequently became an agreement between the two sovereign states to jointly deal with Northern Ireland, but the flaw in that agreement was that the third major participant was omitted.  Now we have what I regard as the essential components in any attempt to get a final solution.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the motion that we have a favourable opportunity at last to attempt to get a final solution to this problem because the three groups &mdash; the Irish Government, the British Government and the four political parties, the Alliance, the DUP, the SDLP and the Official Unionists &mdash; are represented at the talks and have agreed to dialogue in relation to the establishment of new structures that would see an end to the terrible tragedy and conflict in Northern Ireland.  We have progressed in political terms, despite the tragedy of the last 22 years of conflict.</P>
    <P>There has been a lack of progress in other areas, especially in our attempts to integrate either the churches or the education establishments.  The strong commitment to denominational education in the North is supported by the churches.  Much more can be done in terms of ecuminism and in terms of an integrated education commitment by the churches than we have had hitherto. Inter-church links at every level including areas for which they have responsibility, particularly education, are extremely important and I would like to see the same level of progress being made there as I hope will be made in the Strand Two dialogue that is about to take place on the political scene.</P>
    <P>Another major bone of contention in <Col N="1232" /> Northern Ireland is the serious levels of discrimination in the workplace.  Only last week we saw what happened in Queen's University, at the highest academic level, where there had been discrimination and compensation had to be paid to people who should properly have been recruited.  We must ensure that all anti-discrimination legislation is strictly enforced.  I would like to see if not the McBride Principles then the equivalent enshrined in a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland &mdash; in Europe as well as in America workers have civil rights, in terms of recruitment and employment. Of course we can contribute in terms of our training, inter-school relationship through Co-operation North.  Our education, training and vocational systems can co-operate in terms of work experience across the Border and by inviting them to the South.</P>
    <P>The European dimension is very important and should not be lost sight of. New trans-frontier/trans-border funding is available, which has enabled the Ballyconnell Canal to link Lough Erne and the Shannon.  Now there should be much greater scope for business, tourist and cross-Border links between the two sectors.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to acknowledge what I regard as the positive developments that have taken place.  The Civil Righs Movement have contributed enormously to identifying the problem, have pointed the finger at inequities which existed, at gerrymandering in the political system and at discrimination in the workplace.  I pay tribute to John Hume most of all who because of his broad perspective in an Irish context, his appreciation of both traditions and his appreciation of Ireland and its place in Europe and the world, is indefatigable in bringing about a situation where people are coming around the table to talk at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will make one reference to Senator Lanigan's contribution.  We have to address the question of the men of violence.  What has happened so far has been the result of the positive strain in Irish politics; there has always been a <Col N="1233" /> negative one also which I eschew.  We must put pressure on the political spokes-people for the men of violence to get involved in the dialogue and to ensure that they are not left out totally because, essentially, they still represent a certain segment of the population.  We must see that violence is renounced and that they are involved in the dialogue process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to debate this motion.  Whatever about the fact that we have had to wait a while to have this debate on Northern Ireland, it is very timely to have it now.  It is at a time when we are feeling a little optimistic about the future there and perhaps it was worth waiting for this particular opportunity.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, for facilitating the debate and coming in to listen to various views.  As Senator Doyle said, the Minister has a very busy schedule.  That is not to say I do not also welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, to the House.</P>
      <P>During the past while what we have seen from this Government has been the pursuit of the right course.  There has been a degree of flexibility which has been acknowledged by our colleagues north of the Border also.  It has in part been responsible for the success of the talks so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always maintained that we should have a degree of openness about the future and acknowledge that in this whole arena there are no winners, that everything has to be on the table so that structures can be found to encompass the needs of all sides of the divide.  We have to acknowledge that a security policy and political structures will not isolate the terrorists.  There also has to be a climate where the people within the communities reject violence as a means to an end. Our party, and indeed most parties, have always supported the need to establish common ground in Northern Ireland so that politicians can start to work together.  It was historic, as Senator Murphy said earlier, that the Democratic <Col N="1234" /> Unionist leader, Ian Paisley, took his place at the talks with the other constitutional politicians yesterday.  I am sure he availed of the opportunity to tell both the Minister for Foreign Affairs Deputy Andrews and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, what he expects and wants to happen in the future.  I would like to believe he would reflect the great longing for peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We only have to look at the results of the general election there to realise how deep is that great longing for peace. Many of us at the time welcomed the increase in the vote for the constitutional nationalists &mdash; in particular the election of Dr. Joe Hendron &mdash; because we believe it gave a clear unequivocal message to the Provisional IRA and to Sinn Féin that violence is not the answer. Politicians are reflecting the common message &mdash; which I hear from all sides of the community every time I go North &mdash; that there is a great longing for peace and a genuine recognition that there is no going back.  We cannot afford to go back.</P>
    <P>I ask the proposers of this motion &mdash; indeed Senator Doyle raised the question as well &mdash; what can we do to help, not just at governmental level but at a personal level?  We must continue to work on a personal and private basis, as many Senators and many of my colleagues do, to build up trust, to show we reject the militarism of Sinn Féin.  It is an important symbol and we talked about it in this House at one stage.  Sinn Féin are now banned from using the Mansion House for their Ard Fheis.  I congratulated the Dublin city councillors at the time for taking that courageous stand, but symbols, however well intentioned, are not sufficient.  Practical actions on our party are also necessary, such as telling the Garda about arms and substances that are still to be found in the Republic, and realising we have a responsibility for fellow Irish people no matter what part of the island they live.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy when he said that not until Sinn Féin have totally rejected violence should they be given the opportunity to join in the talks process. <Col N="1235" /> That is not to say they should be barred forever from joining the talks. The opportunity lies in their hands alone. We are now approaching a time in the North which is generally referred to as the marching season.  During the whole talks process, perhaps, there could be a little breather so that both sides could examine their approach to this season to ensure that emotionalism does not take over and that the symbolism of certain traditions in this country can have its expression without causing problems.</P>
    <P>We have just come through a very historic period in our own history, the very successful conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty referendum.  In the other House tomorrow there will be an important debate on the Lisbon Summit.  In January 1993 we will have the coming into effect of European Union where borders between countries will be abolished except in our own country which will have one of the last borders of the European Community.  I believe the outcome of the Maastricht referendum can give us courage to face the future.  Part of that should be to use our new openness and energy to create a society we can be proud of and which people north of the Border will be eager to join.  That type of society would be one in which individual freedom of conscience is a proud reality and not an empty assertion, where the rights of women are respected and understood, a pluralist society which would reflect all the widely differing views and experiences that add up to the sum total of what we are.  That is a way in which we can contribute to the peace process.</P>
    <P>I have already said we must be open and generous.  It would be useful to describe certain criteria which must inevitably form part of a solution in the widest possible terms.  In the main I see these as being the devolution of powers to constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland operating in some type of power-sharing assembly or executive; a recognition of a defined role for the Irish Government in tandem with the new relationship between the two islands of Ireland and Britain; a guarantee of protection of the <Col N="1236" /> minority interest in Northern Ireland and in particular in the mechanics of any assembly which is formed.</P>
    <P>Although we always hesitate to be too optimistic, we should grasp at every opportunity to bring about a successful and just solution.  This is a very critical time, it is a time to show courage and leadership and a time to be prepared to take very difficult decisions.  We have another opportunity to do away with the leftover poison of history and to start thinking of the Northern opportunity. The latter word is contained in the motion because it seems that at least the bitter entrenched weariness that has characterised so many approaches to this issue is giving way to a tentative openness shown by the agreement to open Strand Two of the talks.  We should wish all the parties well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we have the opportunity to discuss this motion tonight.  Senator Murphy cannot be thanked sufficiently for choosing it.  I feel a little peeved because the debate itself should have been taken in Government time.  However, there is a great openness about the debate and I do not want to create division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the only Member of this House with an office and a regular workplace in Belfast.  The Minister of State and I &mdash; in another life &mdash; are members of the same union, a Thirty-two County union &mdash; with an office in Belfast.  I have 5,000 members in the North.  During the year one of the members of my union who was a victim of the violence in the North was buried as were a number of pupils, including one who was killed in a terrorist attack on a bookie's shop on the Ormeau Road.  I work with people who work very close to violence.  The aspect of the North with which I find most difficult coping is on a Thursday or a Friday evening when I am leaving Belfast and the Provos phone four different places and say they have planted bombs there.  Thankfully, most of these calls are hoaxes.  However for two hours workers, commuters, people leaving offices, schools, and shops are delayed in traffic.  Two hour traffic jams <Col N="1237" /> are regular occurrences.  People from this side of the Border sit there fuming, wondering if we will be in Dublin in time for a meeting, whereas for the people in the North it is a fact of life and does not even warrant a mention in the news.  The Provos go to extraordinary lengths to stop the North-South train.  I have never understood why they do that.  It might be a good idea to allow Gerry Adams time on RTE to explain their actions.</P>
    <P>I want to make a political point.  Reference was made earlier to Sinn Féin support and the support for violence in the North.  It is important to recognise that they are two different things.  We must learn from a debate of this kind that slogan shouting is of no use and as the previous speaker said, we can all take heart from the election of Joe Hendron in Belfast West.  Admittedly, Joe Hendron won the election in Belfast West, but it must be remembered that Gerry Adams increased his vote.  It was the transfer of unionist votes, for strategic reasons, to Joe Hendron, which elected him.  The worrying part was that Gerry Adams' vote increased.  This is extraordinary in the light of all that has happened.  It points the finger at all of us that we are failing to get our message across.  It is not good enough to stand up at any forum and say because somebody voted Sinn Féin they support violence.  It is unfair to say that a vote for Sinn Féin is a vote in support of violence.  I know many people in the North who vote for Sinn Féin but oppose violence, and their only answer is their frustration with the political process or their viewpoint is not being represented. Therefore they cast their vote outside the political process.</P>
    <P>I always watch where the votes go in the North.  Two years ago John Hume, as Leader of the SDLP, sat around the table with Sinn Féin; I think every party in the south objected.  I remember meeting John Hume, as an NUI graduate, who is a constituent of mine, and Senator Murphy during those talks.  Every party leader was opposing him.  The reality was that in the European elections which immediately followed those talks, the Sinn Féin vote went down and the SDLP <Col N="1238" /> vote went up because they were forced to put forward their views to make their own judgment.  I do not want to go into that particular argument but it is important to remember that as long as we keep them outside the political process, everybody who feels that the political process is not delivering on peace will tend to vote for those outside the political process.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; I am a member of the Executive Council &mdash; will start another peace initiative later this year.  Some months ago we succeeded in organising the greatest anti-violence protest arranged in Belfast for quite a while in response to the brutal murdering of the eight Protestant workers at Teebane Cross earlier in the year.  We almost forget these atrocities as one follows another.  It was significant that the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, representing half a million workers on this island, spoke in Belfast against the killing of Protestant workers in the North.</P>
    <P>We are the largest teachers' union in the North of Ireland; the second largest is the Ulster Teachers Union, set up in 1914 or 1915 because the INTO took a line in support of ICTU's predecessor. It is particularly poignant that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions now leads the thrust for peace.  The trade union movement has a very clear role to play in this area and I hope politicians will realise that.  Unlike every other group, the trade union movement has no vested interest. The churches and the political parties, the two main groups from whom we would expect some initiative, clearly would be identified with particular sides, attitudes and positions.  The trade union movement should be pushed to the fore in this initiative.</P>
    <P>Peace movements come and go; they last as long as the energy and initiative is retained by those pushing them, but we need to push the cause of peace through an organisation like the trade union movement which has its own structures and which takes this as one of its objectives. I will be coming to this House and writing to Members of the other House in September asking that all Members of <Col N="1239" /> both Houses sign the pledge for peace which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is distributing to every worker in the North and &mdash; it is hoped &mdash; to every worker in the South because I think this is one of the keys to peace.  This is not a Northern problem; acquired peace is a problem for everybody.</P>
    <P>A speaker here earlier today asked; who is he, coming from the South, to speak about the problems of the North? One of the first things I would say to anybody who does not have experience of the North of Ireland is, watch out.  The first time you speak for the man from Belfast or the woman from Derry they may ask what you know about their problems when you are living in Dublin, Kilkenny or Cork.  Those people do not deserve any support, they should be confronted immediately.  That is what has kept too many people in the South too quiet for too long.  My experience is that a person from Dublin can know as much about Derry as a person from west Belfast, and most people from west Belfast do not know on what side of the Erne Enniskillen is situated.  The North is not an entity.  There are different people and different areas, and Belfast is as far from Derry as it is from Drogheda.  These are the issues that we have to keep to the forefront.  A demand for peace requires activity, not passivity.  That is why I would ask people to support the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the pledge for peace in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask that we accommodate differences, promote pluralism and tolerate contrary aspirations.  There is nothing wrong with being unionist and being Irish.  There is nothing wrong with being Irish and aspiring to a united Ireland. There is nothing wrong with one group of people in this island aspiring to being part of the Commonwealth and another group aspiring to an independent united Ireland.  Peace will come by bridging the gap in the society in the North and that must begin at every level.  It must begin at the maternity hospital, the school, the housing estate, the workplace, churches and at every level where people work, <Col N="1240" /> operate and live.  As politicians we must make this clear; repudiated violence and play an active rather than a passive role in promoting peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion and the Government's commitment to the talks.  Talks did not just start today.  In March 1991 agreement was reached between the Irish and British Governments and the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, namely, the Social Democratic Labour Party, the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and the Alliance Party on conditions that would permit political talks to take place.</P>
      <P>In setting out these terms in a statement to the House of Commons on 26 March 1991 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that the objective of the talks was to achieve a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the people of these islands.  The talks would, accordingly, take place on three strands corresponding respectively to the three relationships.  It was accepted by all the parties that nothing would be finally agreed on any strand until everything was agreed in the talks as a whole. To allow time for the talks to take place, both Governments agreed that there would be an interval from 26 April to 16 July between the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>Substantive talks eventually began on 17 June and continued until 3 July 1991. They came to an end on that date as it became clear it would not be possible to launch the other strands of the talks before the end of the pre-arranged gap between the conference meetings, that is, before 16 July.  The delay in beginning the substantive talks was caused by various unionist demands regarding organisational aspects of the talks, including the venues for Strand Two, the chairmanship of Strand Two and procedural guidelines for the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thereafter, efforts were made by both the Irish and British Governments over a period of several months to bring the parties back to the negotiating table.  A <Col N="1241" /> complication caused by the unionists' desire to reserve their position on a continuation of talks in the event of Labour winning the British general election was finally removed in March 1992.  The threat of difficulties arising from the possibility of a minority British Government being dependent on unionist support was averted by the Tories clear victory in the April 1992 election.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 27 April, the two Governments agreed that in order to facilitate a resumption of talks there would be no further meeting of the conference before the week beginning 27 July 1992.  The basis for resumed talks would be the same as that agreed by all participants last year and set out in the statement made by the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons on 26 March 1991.  The two Governments have publicly reaffirmed their commitment to the principles and terms of that statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs also signalled the readiness of the two Governments to consider a short postponement, by one or two weeks, of the conference envisaged for the end of July should this seem desirable in the light of progress made and on the basis of a unanimous request from the parties.</P>
    <P>The present position is that talks commenced in early May on Strand One, which involved the four parties, the SDLP, Alliance, Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party, and the British Government.  The Strand One talks have been chaired by the Secretary of State at Parliament Buildings in Stormont. Discussion has centred on proposals for new institutional structures which the parties have tabled.  The SDLP paper, details of which have appeared in the media, envisages a consultative assembly and a six-member executive commission, comprising three elected Northern Ireland members and nominees of the British and Irish Governments and the European Commission.  The other parties have proposed different models of an assembly with a system of committees.</P>
    <P>Following a Strand One plenary meeting <Col N="1242" /> of 12 June, the Secretary of State issued a statement stating that in the light of exchanges between the party leaders he had asked the Irish Government to join with him in inviting Sir Ninian Stephen to convene a meeting attended by representatives of the two Governments and the four parties to discuss a possible agenda for Strand Two of the talks.  The Secretary of State also proposed that the two Governments should hold a meeting on Strand Three formation, which observers from each of the parties would be invited to attend for at least part of the time to give preliminary consideration to the issues likely to arise in that strand.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government were not, of course, involved in the discussions which led to the proposals of 12 June but, when consulted, accepted them immediately.</P>
    <P>The first of these meetings took place in London on 19 June.  The Irish and British Governments were represented at official level and second-tier representatives attended from the parties. Agreement was reached on a possible agenda for Strand Two.</P>
    <P>The second of these meetings took place in London on 30 June.  The meeting was co-chaired by the two Governments. The Irish Government were represented by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews and accompanied by Government officials, while the British Government team was led by the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew and Mr. Jeremy Hanley, the Northern Ireland Office Minister involved in the talks.  Agreement was reached between the two Governments on a possible agenda for Strand Three. The observers spoke at that meeting, one of them being the Democratic Unionist Leader, Dr. Paisley.  Dr. Paisley, by addressing that meeting signalled a significant change in attitude as mentioned by a former Senator and is to be congratulated for attending the meeting and speaking at it.  As the Government then said, the way is now clear for Strand Two. The Minister in his speech said that this had now started.  He also said: &ldquo;I greatly <Col N="1243" /> welcome the proposal by Sir Patrick Mayhew this afternoon that Strand Two should now be launched and the reported acceptance of this proposal by all concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the commitment of the Government, and particularly of the Taoiseach, to these talks and to the whole process involved in Anglo-Irish negotiations.  The Taoiseach when elected said he looked forward to working with the British Prime Minister &ldquo;to try to end the cruelty and this continuing conflict&rdquo;.  He said he felt &ldquo;diminished as an Irishman&rdquo; because of the killings in the North.  These are the words of a man who is committed to this process.  He said: &ldquo;we must put no limits to what we would do to change all that&rdquo;.  He said the door would always be open for unionists and he was very familiar with both the unionist and nationalist traditions having had business contacts in the North before entering politics.  &ldquo;There is nothing new for me to find out about either side&rdquo;, he said.</P>
    <P>In his Árd Fheis speech on 7 March 1992 he said:</P>
    <P>Nothing can call into question the fact that Northern nationalists, and indeed unionists to the extent they themselves choose, are as fully and unquestionably Irish as any person in this island.  The policies of this Government will always start from that reality.</P>
    <P>I am personally committed to exploring every avenue in order to try to put an end to this aching national misery.  Because ultimately, this misery is the misery of people; people who happen to live on this island.  For that reason, I would like &mdash; from this forum and on your behalf &mdash; to speak tonight to the unionist community to speak directly to them because they are a community that I know can make a magnificent contribution to the fuller development of this island once peace is restored.</P>
    <P>These are the words of the Taoiseach who is obviously committed, as are the <Col N="1244" /> Government, to seeing that peace comes about by entering into political dialogue. Senator Costello said he took issue with the Minister when he said there is a growing acceptance that political dialogue alone offers a way out of the tragedy in Northern Ireland.  Senator Costello may have emphasised the word &ldquo;alone&rdquo; too much and not political dialogue.  We have so much violence and other means that we must look to political dialogue to forward the whole process.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Doyle referred to the role of the Churches.  I do not think there are any churchmen anywhere in the world who work harder than those in Northern Ireland.  The Pope in his famous address in Drogheda asked the men of violence to lay down their arms. Cardinal Daly works hard as did Cardinal Ó Fiaich and the leaders of the other Churches.  Every time there is an atrocity they go to the place where people have been hurt.  They visit them at home, continually appeal to the men of violence and they talk to them.  To suggest in any way that the churchmen are not playing their part, as Senator Doyle did, is scraping the barrel.</P>
    <P>Every weekend I drive through the Six Counties on my way home and I am forcibly reminded of the sad situation that exists in that part of our country. One cannot go from Cavan, Fermanagh or Monaghan into Armagh or Tyrone without being confronted by armed forces and that is very sad.  People who visit often do not notice it but people who visit for the first time are shocked by what they see.  Anything that contributes to a solution of this problem must be encouraged. This is not the time to go into it but there is violence on both sides.  There is still discrimination on a massive scale and the only way forward is through political dialogue.  The Government are committed to this, as are the Taoiseach, and Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice. I subscribe to this motion and hope that these talks continue.</P>

      <P>In replying to the motion, I want to say how glad I am that so many good contributions were made <Col N="1245" /> and for the positive spirit in which they were made.  My only regret is that in a House where we have been calling for a debate on Northern Ireland for a long time more Senators did not contribute.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is one of the eccentricities of being an Independent Senator that I would have to disagree with some of the things my seconder said.  Senator Doyle has already drawn attention to Senator Norris's mistake in saying that Sinn Féin stood for 30 per cent of the electorate.  I think what he had vaguely in mind was that their support runs to about maybe 30 to 40 per cent of the nationalist portion of the electorate but their overall electoral backing in Northern Ireland is somewhere like 10 to 11 per cent, roughly the same standing as the Alliance Party. I repeat again that there can be no fudging on the circumstances about the admission of Sinn Féin to the conference table. They cannot be admitted to the conference table as long as they condone, support and endorse the Provisional IRA campaign of violence.  If they are kept out, as Senator O'Toole seemed to suggest, it is they who are keeping themselves out.</P>
      <P>It is also not right for Senator Norris to suggest that somehow in other places the men of violence have eventually gained admittance to the conference, that it is a fact of life, that one has to do a deal with the man who pokes a gun at one.  Well, not so in a western parliamentary democracy where there are plenty of other outlets for people to express their views.  There is no place anywhere for the men of violence, and certainly not in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad that many Senators drew attention to facets I did not have time to go into myself.  The role of the churches and the clergy was referred to by a number of Senators.  The talks that have taken place between the clergy and the paramilitaries in recent months have done a lot of good.  These are quite acceptable.  There is a big distinction there.  It is right and proper for clergymen to talk in a Christian spirit to people who must be shown how wrong their actions are but that is very different from saying <Col N="1246" /> they have to be brought to the political conference table.  Senator Doyle properly, and very discreetly, made the point that this is one occasion on which there is all-party support which has not been true of previous initiatives in the last decade.  I think the Government should be very happy with the level of support they are getting.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan reminded us how a word like &ldquo;peace&rdquo; is an empty abstraction unless we remember the grief and bereavement of so many tens of thousands of families right across the North. It is to the ending of that situation that we must lend our efforts.  Senators Costello and Keogh pointed to the other areas in which we must all contribute.  Senators Costello and O'Toole referred to the central role of the trade unions.  Indeed, it could be said that had it not been for the solidarity of the trade union movement across the community divide in the last 20 years, the carnage would have been a great deal worse.  I take all those points.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister his due, when he said political dialogue alone will solve this problem, I do not think he meant to exclude all these other considerations.  I think what he meant to say was that in the context of violence only political dialogue will make a contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon reminded us that the SDLP have put forward a very far-reaching and imaginative proposal.  The trouble is that as long as Articles 2 and 3 remain and the intent that the unionists read into them, proposals like that of the SDLP will be interpreted as a stalking horse for territorial aggression.  My hunch is that if we were to make the imaginative gesture of changing these Articles then, who knows, the SDLP proposal might be well considered by the unionists.</P>
    <P>While the Minister was perfectly right in saying that a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 would be divisive and passionate &mdash; I asked him what else was new &mdash; nonetheless, let us suppose that we could put such a referendum to the people in a context where it had all-party backing, where there was a genuine breakthrough in the North between the political parties <Col N="1247" /> and a real promise of settlement and accommodation, I think our people would be sufficiently generous to say: &ldquo;of course we will accept this compromise. Of course, we do not want to make a territorial demand in the North and will accept any reasonable contribution we can make to peace&rdquo;.  It is selective to say that such a referendum would be divisive. People here would be prepared to make that kind of contribution because they are very grateful they have been spared the agony of the North.  We have all suffered the side-effects of what has been happening but in the Republic we are relatively fortunate.  I think people would give thanks for that good fortune by making their contribution in any final settlement.</P>
    <P>It has been a privilege for me to introduce this motion.  I want, belatedly, to thank the Minister.  I was less than gracious on a previous occasion when he came back from Oslo but passions were running high during that referendum campaign.  I think the contribution he made tonight, particularly his off-the-cuff remarks about Articles 2 and 3, were very interesting and useful.  It is a time for cautious optimism, as the newspapers have been saying, but the day will come when peace will come.  That long running sore will be healed and Ireland will benefit inestimably.  At this stage we can only wish the Government well in what is an enormous effort but not an impossible one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's presence in the House for this matter on the Adjournment.  It confirms my confidence in him and in his attitude towards the farming community and it is consistent with the concern he has been demonstrating so much recently.</P>
      <P>The matter I want to raise is the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to examine the serious difficulty facing Irish potato producers who are now at a great disadvantage as a subsidy is being paid to growers in the United Kingdom. I was alarmed to read an article in the <i>Farm Weekly,</i> which is circulated in Northern Ireland, which states:</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland has announced that, following consultation with the Ulster Farmers' Union, it has been decided that the support price for the 1992 ware potato crop should remain at £46 per tonne and any support operation will be limited to a maximum of 60,000 tonnes.  The target area for Northern Ireland planting in 1992 was fixed last August at 11,750 hectares.</P>
      <P>Since that article appeared, there has been a clarification, and the subsidy may not be paid in the North of Ireland, but it is being paid to growers and producers in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potato industry is of some value to the Irish economy and we very often hear people expressing concern about the decline in agriculture, in tillage and the tonnage of potatoes being imported either in processed form or as ware potatoes ready for the table.  The housewife is horrified at having to buy imported potatoes.  The perception seems to be that the Irish producers are not capable of grading their potatoes and presenting them on the market in a way that is attractive to the housewife.  That is totally wrong.  The producers in Ireland have been working at a very serious disadvantage for years.  Most European countries have a potato policy and have <Col N="1249" /> support for potato storage.  This in itself is a vital area in so far as most of the producers of potatoes in Ireland are small producers.</P>
    <P>If you have a very large milk quota you would be a fool to be working at tillage and producing potatoes.  In some areas &mdash; for example, my county &mdash; there has been a tradition of producing potatoes. That is probably why I am concerned and why I am still here after 8 o'clock on a Wednesday evening.  There must be a concerted effort to tackle this issue.  This has been said many times to different Ministers and different Governments.  I believe the good intentions are always there but I am not sure why we cannot come to grips with the problem and save the potato industry.</P>
    <P>We had one of the best export seed businesses in Europe and we lost it.  I will not go over the reasons for that.  The members of the Potato Marketing Board sat on their high stools in Merrion Square while we lost a valuable industry.  The Minister is not responsible; he was not in charge and I am sure he deplores this development as much as I do.</P>
    <P>In 1989, in view of the serious plight of the potato growers, I raised a matter on the Adjournment in which I called on the Minister to press for an EC potato policy to protect the industry.  The same year, An Bord Glas came out with a programme for development of seed potatoes which said:</P>
    <P>The Bord, in the light of its examination of the sector, has decided the following Programme.  The Programme is expected to result in a doubling of certified seed potato sales to 40,000 tonnes over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Sadly, that did not happen.  It is no pleasure for me to stand here and say that.  This is an admission that we have all failed and I do not know why.  It continues:</P>
    <P>This will also have beneficial impact on the ware sector as well as increasing seed exports to 25,000 tonnes.  The development of the industry in a structured <Col N="1250" /> way is projected to create 50 new jobs in this sector over a five year period.</P>
    <P>Sadly, this did not happen either.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the new Minister for Agriculture and Food to bring fresh thinking to the issue.  I am highlighting the fact that, before we read the announcement of a subsidy of £46 per tonne for ware potato producers in the UK, we had a problem because people who are delivering concrete slabs and products from the North and the South to the UK are looking for a load for the return journey.  Potatoes are being brought in from Scotland, record ware potatoes were being dumped here at the end of the season at prices with which those who stored potatoes to the month of June found it impossible to compete, even though this was one of the best years in the past five years for the potato producer.  The price collapsed at the end of the year because the Scottish farmers dumped their surplus potatoes on the Irish market.  It would be very easy for them to continue to do that and I can see no good reason why they would not do it if they are going to be subsidised.  The transport costs less than £10 per tonne. If you take a container load of potatoes across weighing 30 tonnes, £10 per tonne pays the boat and covers the cost.  With today's modern equipment it only takes half an hour or an hour to load or unload a truck with a forklift.  For trucks returning from the UK, Scotland or wherever it is good business to bring back a load of potatoes.  If you add all those factors, they spell crisis to me.</P>
    <P>I am interested in a small company that tendered to supply potatoes to the Army. At the end of May, the Army cancelled the contracts of every single supplier in the south of Ireland because of one bad supplier.  Many people who had very satisfied customers and suppliers were left in the lurch.  Many small merchants were storing potatoes to fulfil the contract with the Army up to the end of June and just like that, the Army cancelled the contracts.  What did they do?  They bought Cyprus potatoes at £400 per tonne.  Cyprus is outside the EC.  It is <Col N="1251" /> astonishing and we could hardly believe it.</P>
    <P>There is no point in criticising people and saying who was guilty of neglect.  I am glad to have the opportunity to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to please look after the potato sector and not to mind the people who think they have it under control. They have failed.  The aims laid down in their statements made three years ago have not been achieved.  We are losing an industry.  We will all be embarassed, including the Minister, to see the day when every country in Europe will have its brand name on a bag of potatoes in every supermarket and shop in this country. At least I will have done my best.  I will have tried to do something about it, to take it seriously and, I will have expressed my opinion.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to study this matter more closely than any of his predecessors or An Bord Glas and to recognise that we have a difficulty at present.  The fact that the UK producer will receive £46 per tonne for ware potatoes is very serious and we have to face it.  I have confidence in the Minister and I have no doubt he will recognise that I would not be raising this matter if I did not have a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to this motion.  I know of Senator McGowan's interest in the potato industry; I have often heard him speak about the matter on public occasions and he has also spoken to me privately regarding it.  I concur with him that the potato industry has been in decline for a long number of years, not alone the industry itself but various aspects and particularly the quality of potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the matter he has raised here, I would like to say that the UK Potato Marketing Board operates a scheme whereby a limit is set on the area to be sown under potatoes and growers are charged a sizeable levy which is used to fund the withdrawal of potatoes from the market when market prices drop below a set trigger price.  The potatoes <Col N="1252" /> that are withdrawn are denatured and then sold back to the grower at a nominal price to be disposed of for animal feeding. I understand that potatoes were withdrawn in two regions of the UK during the month of June.</P>
    <P>The UK action has had no effect on the Irish market except possibly to ensure that dumping of low priced British potatoes on the Irish market does not occur.  The market here is stable and producer prices have been quite satisfactory. Yields of first earlies were good but as there has been very little rainfall in the past four weeks crop yields from second earlies are down.  Present indications are that there should be supply/demand equilibrium during July and that prices should hold at or about their present levels. Potato consumption is also affected by the exceptional warm conditions of recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The farm-gate value of Irish potato output ranges from £40 million to £50 million per annum.  Responsibility for the potato sector lies with my colleague, Minister Hyland, and since taking office he has devoted much time to meeting people and discussing interests with those involved at all levels of the industry whether at producer, processor, wholesaler, retailer or consumer level.</P>
    <P>I am well aware the potato business is challenging and competitive and has its difficult periods.  However, considerable improvements have taken place and are continuing to take place in the structure of the sector resulting from Government initiatives.  These include the setting up of An Bord Glas as a State agency with a mandate to promote the development of the sector.  I have studied An Bord Glas's published programmes for the development of the seed and ware sectors.  These are realistic programmes that are already being implemented and I will continue to oversee the implementation of these programmes.  I will personally look at them now in the light of the problems which have been brought directly to my attention by Senator McGowan, particularly if any programmes outlined are not being met or adhered to. <Col N="1253" /> In the past year we saw the establishment and official recognition of the first four potato producer groups in this country under an EC-assisted scheme. This co-operation among growers is a new development and one to which I will be giving every encouragement.</P>
    <P>Under the EC scheme for grant assistance for the processing and marketing of agricultural produce, three projects involving new potato storage of 6,000 tonnes have recently been completed and a further six projects have been approved for grant assistance and are at present under construction.  Under the EC-aided operational programme for rural development 137 potato projects have been approved.  These projects will attract a total grant aid of £2.1 million and I understand that about 80 per cent of these projects are expected to be completed this year.  Senator McGowan will be pleased to hear that 37 of these projects with grant aid of £625,000 are in his own county of Donegal.  This aid is geared mainly towards on-farm investment for the provision of new storage, the improvement of existing storage and for storage-related equipment, all aimed at improving potato handling facilities and ultimately improving potato quality, because a quality product is essential to meet competition from whatever quarter.</P>
    <P>I will look personally into the specific matters raised by Senator McGowan. This is an important industry and we have made a number of mistakes, including the overall neglect of the industry for many years.  In terms of varieties for particular projects, we have been quite negligent in that area also.  I thank Senator McGowan for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister has attended personally this evening, given his very onerous schedule and the fact that he has just come back from Luxembourg.  I congratulate him on his role in the conclusion of the Common <Col N="1254" /> Agricultural Policy reform package and on the fact that it has now been legally brought into effect, as I understand from yesterday's proceedings.</P>
      <P>We have just discussed potatoes and it must be a record for the House to discuss in succession two matters relating to tillage.  That in itself makes the evening a noteworthy one.  One of the problems with the potato industry has always been that the cost per tonne produced is uncompetitive compared to other countries. That is a basic problem.  It is a huge lost opportunity that we could produce a variety of the quality of cara and not be able to exploit it to our national advantage. Some other countries seem to have been able to exploit it more effectively than we have.</P>
      <P>My motion refers to the need to establish for Ireland differing regional reference yields for winter and spring cereals under the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package just concluded.  My particular concern in raising this important matter is the effect of the reform on the cereal growers in the country and on agri-industry associated with cereal growing.</P>
      <P>Cereal growers &mdash; I have to declare a vested interest here as I am one myself &mdash; frequently feel they are the neglected sector of Irish agriculture &mdash; I presume the potato growers feel the same &mdash; and that their interests are something sacrificed to win concessions for livestock farmers.  I recognise the importance of the livestock sector within our agricultural economy and our economy as a whole, but it is worth recording that grain accounts for about £200 million of farm output and for many thousands of jobs on the output side in the handling and processing of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to the establishment of regional reference yields, even to the extent of treating the country as a single region for the purposes of determining the level of compensation to be received by growers. Multiplying the reference yield by the standard payments agreed by the EC will give us the rate of compensation which will apply to cereal growing.  I welcome <Col N="1255" /> some of the changes that have been made in the packaging and in particular the removal of the upper limit of 230 tonnes.</P>
    <P>For the average Irish cereal grower, in the average Irish field, producing the average Irish crop &mdash; if such a person exists &mdash; the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package will be neutral.  By 1995-96 that person should be in much the same position as he or she is today.  The trouble is that this average person is very difficult to find.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the national benefit, if there is a single reference figure, of having that figure as high as is possible.  However, my principal concern relates to the effect of adopting a single overall reference yield for different types of growers.  On the grounds of pure equity, it is very important to have separate figures for winter and for spring cereals.  That is a view widely shared within the industry by bodies like IGAMA and the IFA, and it has been put forward at the conference which was run on Common Agricultural Policy reform by the Department.  Unless this is done, efficient high yielding winter cereal growers will lose out and low yielding spring cereal growers will benefit.  It should be the objective of the EC and of national policy to endeavour to see that as many producers as possible benefit.</P>
    <P>Ideally, each crop should have a reference yield, with separate figures for winter wheat, winter barley, winter oats and for their spring counterparts.  I accept that that would create enormous difficulties; it would reduce distortions to an absolute minimum, but at the very least a distinction should be made between winter cereals and spring cereals as individual groups.  This would not have the effect of increasing national outputs of cereals because I realise that would not be desirable.  It would be equally undesirable to reduce national output.  I am convinced that a single reference yield will have that effect for cereal crops and that there will be an undesirable effect of reducing output and returning us to overdependence on a single crop &mdash; and that single crop is spring barley.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> I do not believe that would be in the overall national interest.  It would not be helpful to the pig and poultry producers or to the objectives of filling our needs from our own resources on the island as a whole.  A lot of progress has been made in recent years in cereal growing technology and that would be lost.  We are competitive in yield and cost per tonne compared to most of Europe and we should not lose these benefits.  Our competitiveness has been highlighted in the recent NESC report on Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for adopting the type of approach I am advocating.  There are already differential yields, as far as I am aware, for winter and spring oil seed rape and there is a separate regional yield for French maize.  Even if there were no precedent, equity would dictate that we should be able to argue a strong case for having winter and spring cereals treated separately.  In passing, I also support the view that the quota should apply to the individual and that it should be a producer's quota rather than a landowner's quota.  That view would probably be shared by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I also stress the urgency of finalising this matter for cereal growers because we are just a fortnight away from harvesting winter barley and already those of us who are winter cereal producers are having to make decisions about how we are going to conduct our cropping schedule for the coming year.  That makes the matter one of urgency.  Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister and his officials to press to have separate regional reference yields for winter and spring cereals so that, as far as possible, distortions can be eliminated and the balance and competitiveness of cereal production in Ireland can be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that Senator Dardis has raised this important matter and I am pleased to be available to respond.  I fully agree with what Senator Dardis said about the desirability for Ireland of having the option of applying different regional yields for cereals.  This <Col N="1257" /> option is desirable because of our very high proportion of low yielding spring cereals compared to that of other member states where winter sowings predominate. If a single average yield is applied, the effects of our production pattern, which, as I have said, is unique in the Community, would be to penalise winter cereal growers and to over-compensate spring growers.  The result might well be a swing from high yielding winter to low yielding spring production on the part of some producers.</P>
      <P>As our present production is broadly in line with market requirements, any decrease in production would have a significant impact on our cereals industry. It is also fair to say that input costs are higher for winter production of cereals and any significant swing to spring production would have a detrimental effect on our fertiliser and chemical industries. For these reasons, throughout the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform, I have endeavoured to achieve the right for Ireland to differentiate our cereals yield on a winter spring production basis.  However, it was not possible to obtain this in the legal texts which were agreed at the Council meeting in Luxembourg yesterday.  I can assure Senator Dardis and the House, however, that the matter has now been taken up at a high level with the Commission and I have personally taken the matter up with Commissioner MacSharry because it is the single most important issue in the overall Common Agricultural Policy reform which needs to be straightened out now.</P>
      <P>Ireland's case for separate winter-spring regional yields will be pursued when the Commission's detailed rules for the operation of the new cereals regime are being discussed in the coming weeks. I left no stone unturned in pursuit of a satisfactory outcome to that matter because I accept the case the Senator has made and the case that has been presented to me by cereal growers.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of making that statement and giving that assurance to the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to express the need for the Minister for the Marine to examine the feasibility of developing Buncrana harbour in County Donegal, on the grounds that my county is quite isolated and is one of the most peripheral areas in Europe.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable, when we have funding for various infrastructures and from regional development funds, to ask that one of the ports in the area should be developed.  In that whole area from the North right across to Sligo, Buncrana is the major port with the potential for development.  On one side of County Donegal we have seven major military bases which makes things difficult, to put it mildly.  We have no port and no railhead. On the other hand I see a loan has been obtained for Waterford harbour. The European Investment Bank has granted Waterford Harbour Commissioners a £10 million loan for the improvement of facilities at the port and a new terminal capable of handling 250,000 tonne containers, to be built downstream. The European Investment Bank is investing very substantially in Waterford and I applaud and support that development totally.  The same need can be established at Buncrana in Donegal and I call on the Minister to recognise and to lend his support to an application which will be prepared in the near future.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for the Environment to provide the necessary funding to bring the Dublin-Limerick-Tralee national primary road up to national primary road standard. This road is the gateway to the south-west serving half the counties of Ireland with branch roads leading off.  It is the main artery to Dublin from the south-west and is probably the busiest national primary route in the country with heavy traffic.  At 190 miles it must be the longest national primary road in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I travelled to Tralee via the Limerick-Dublin national primary road, a two way journey, about 70 times a year.  From <Col N="1259" /> Tralee it is approximately 190 miles to Dublin and to call 60 per cent of this road a national primary road is absurd.  We should be ashamed of its condition. When I leave Tralee on my way to Dublin, I would need a co-driver to read all the warning signs on the road such as: danger; black spot; slow, slippery surface; danger, bad bend; slow, acute bend. Unfortunately, there are very few signs saying: slow, major roadworks.  At present, the latter signs can only be seen in Limerick and in Newbridge.</P>
    <P>I am now asking the Minister for the Environment to plan exactly what section of this road is to be a priority over the next couple of years.  Money should be provided to Kerry County Council at least to upgrade the road from Tralee to about two miles on the Dublin side of Castleisland.  Money should be provided both to Limerick and Kerry County Councils to build a new bridge at the county boundary over the River Feale and upgrade the approach road from Kerry and Limerick to the Feale Bridge. All the way to Dublin there are stretches of this road which, to say the least, are no better than ordinary main roads.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to outline them all but, after a fast drive out the Naas dual carriageway, Naas by-pass and motorway, traffic grinds to a half after leaving Kildare town and as far as Portlaoise. This part of the route would want immediate funding to upgrade it.  As a priority in the whole route, work should be carried out first to make safe places where there are black spots.  I urge that this work be carried out immediately and I also urge the Minister to do his utmost to obtain Structural Funds to help to carry out the work I have outlined.</P>

    <P>It is about time that the same services should be provided on the non-Gaeltacht islands as have already been provided on the Gaeltacht islands.  On the Aran Islands, I am glad to say, there are air strips, etc., which ensure that modern communication methods are available to the islanders.</P>
    <P>Tá an áis seo an-tábhachtach.  Tá sí saor agus d'fhéadfadh na hoileánaigh iad féin tabhairt faoi agus í a thógáil.  Ba cheart tosaíocht a thabhairt don obair seo.  Is mian liom a fháil amach cén Roinn a bhfuil an fheagracht orthu faoi na nithe seo a chur as fáil do na hoileáin atá taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for the Environment to approve the Glenville group water scheme in Ardagh, County Limerick.  All the work has been completed on this scheme at local level and it is waiting approval from the Minister for the Environment.  I would also like to ask the Minister to make funds available to construct the scheme in 1992.  The scheme itself is not very big and would not be of high cost to the Department.  It will cater for 10 people and include agricultural holdings and domestic houses.  It is unacceptable in 1992 that any house in the country should not have fresh running water. Some of the houses I refer to have underground storage tanks and are obliged to draw water for domestic purposes.  That is totally unacceptable in 1992 and I ask the Minister to approve the scheme and provide the funds to commence construction in this year.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 July 1992.</P>
