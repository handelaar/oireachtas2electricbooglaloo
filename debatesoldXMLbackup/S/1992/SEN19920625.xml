      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to issue guidelines to local authorities regarding the adoption and rescinding of resolutions regarding the licensing of amusement halls.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that the inquiry instituted into the case of the Tallaght Two, 18 months ago be completed without delay; and that the findings be made public.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is Items Nos. 1 and 2 to be taken between now and 2 p.m. and Item No. 3 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.  With the agreement <Col N="930" /> of the House, it is hoped to take all Stages of the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, 1992 and the Committee Stage of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill, 1992.</P>

      <P>That is agreed.  I am concerned, as I am sure all Members of the House will be, about the statements from the North this morning that there may be a hold up in the talks and that the fault may lie with our Government; I do not necessarily accept that is the case.  It would be right to let it be known from this House that we hope there will be no hold up.  The talks have made progress so far and we give our good wishes that the talks will get back on the rails as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Manning, I, too, am very concerned about the apparent impasse which seems to be developing in relation to the talks in Northern Ireland.  I am not anxious to moralise but it is important that the Government should be as flexible and sensible as possible and use their imagination to try to reach a solution to the difficulties which are arising.  It is encouraging that progress has developed to the point where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is encouraging that some progress has been made.  I hope this will not create a prolonged and serious difficulty. I ask the Leader of the House when we can expect a debate on the motion to establish a press council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about the North of Ireland process.  I will not expand on it.  I understand there are a number of motions on the Supplementary Order Paper dealing with the North of Ireland so perhaps the Leader would consider having a full debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other point relates directly to the Order of Business.  It relates to Item <Col N="931" /> No. 13 on today's Order Paper and that is the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989, Order for Second Stage.  I raise this because again yesterday in the Dáil in the discussion of legislative business, a Minister, Deputy Brennan, indicated it was not appropriate for them to deal with a series of amendments to change &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; and so on.  He suggested the only way to do it was by way of the kind of Bill I have on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>In a previous session the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, made exactly the same point and said he would be prepared to accept such a Bill.  We are a democracy but there is no sign from the Government that they are prepared to allow legislation to flow from the Opposition and in particular from the Independent benches.  It would be welcome if the Government side would indicate that they would take a simple Bill that could go through in about an hour which would resolve a problem that continually occurs in both Houses.  It would indicate there is a degree of consensus democracy in this country which has been lacking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Manning and Upton, the Taoiseach knocked that suggestion on the head in the past two days and made it quite clear that the Government would not, in any way, be a stumbling block to progress being made in the talks.  I share their views that we are hopeful the talks will get back on the rails again.</P>
      <P>With regard to motion 47, I said yesterday it would be taken in the next Fianna Fáil Private Members' time which will probably be about two weeks time. With regard to Item No. 13, given the amount of legislation we have to deal with between now and the recess there will not be time to discuss that item.  We will sit next week four days starting at 12 noon on Tuesday to deal with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Evidence Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 15 and 16, to delete the definition of &ldquo;the Appeals Board&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Appeals Board&rsquo; means the High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment.  It was put down because of our concern that the provision for an Appeal Board may be unconstitutional.  I understand there may be some constitutional difficulties in relation to the way this is structured. There was a case in the seventies which would suggest that this may be so.  For those reasons, I move this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put Senator Upton's concerns to rest in relation to the constitutional aspect.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello expressed concern that the provisions of the censorship of Films Act, 1923 and the Video Recordings Act, 1989 which provided that a person who was dissatisfied with a decision of the censor may appeal the decision to the Censorship of Films Appeals Board and that this may be at odds with Article 34 of the Constitution. I am satisfied the Senator need have no concern in that regard.  The legitimacy of bodies such as the Film Appeals Board is well established.  Where such bodies are concerned with administrative determination there can be no conflict with the provisions of Article 34 of the Constitution. Article 37 of the Constitution allows for the exercise of limited judicial powers and functions by such bodies.</P>
      <P>Article 37 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Whether the power being exercised by the Censorship of Films Appeal Board is administrative or is of a limited judicial nature might be arguable but it is not unconstitutional.  There is no necessity, therefore, for the amendment proposed by Senators Upton, Costello, Harte and Ryan.</P>
    <P>In any event, at a practical level, it would be entirely inappropriate that the High Court should become involved in the type of function performed by the Censorship of Films Appeal Board.  That would be ludicrous.  When the provisions of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 are fully operational, up to 1,000 new video releases a year will be submitted to the censor and 15,000 videos already on the market will need to be classified.  If a small fraction of the decisions made by the censor on those videos result in appeals it will represent a significant volume of work and this is at a stage when we are already under pressure to increase the number of judges because of delays in hearing cases in the High Court given the volume of business already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 25, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultaion with representatives of the film industry, film societies and film views associations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to provide that <Col N="934" /> the Minister should consult with representatives of the film industry, film societies and film views associations when he is appointing assistant film censors. That is desirable.  It is important that there would be consultation with these groups.  There has been a great deal of concern over the years about the manner in which film censorship and censorship generally has been conducted.  Some of the film societies, film views associations and the film industry have been among the more progressive elements in Irish society.  They would have a valuable contribution to make in relation to the appointment of film censors and it would be worthwhile if the Minister were prepared to consult them and if that were written into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike being negative but I cannot accept this amendment because it would introduce a very unwieldy element into the process of appointing assistant censors.  I can see no justification for it.  The task of the official censor and of the proposed assistant censors is to examine films and videos in an objective manner in the light of the criteria laid down in the relevant legislation. The official censor is appointed by the Minister under section 2 (1) of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923.  There is no provision for consultation with the film industry of associations with film interests.  The House would agree that those appointed to the office have performed their duties in an exemplary manner.</P>
      <P>The system of appointing persons to the office of official censor and to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board has worked very well up to now and, consequently, I do not see the need for change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who hire or buy video recordings come from all walks of life and it would be my intention that the persons to be appointed as assistant censors would be practical people with a commonsense attitude who would be unbiased and able to perform their task objectively.  I do not see that consultation with the film industry or with film views associations will assist me in this regard. <Col N="935" /> It would be fair to say that such groups might find it difficult to be objective in such matters.</P>
    <P>The film industry and those associated with it have been satisfied with the approach taken by the various persons who have filled the post of official censor down through the years.  I am not aware of any demands by them for a change in the system.  I remind Senators that under the provisions of the Bill the assistant censors who will be appointed will work under the general supervision of the official censor and he will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the standards under which they will operate.</P>
    <P>This amendment will introduce delays, prevarications and disputes into the system.  If the Minister has to consult representatives of the film industry, there will be disputes among them as to who will be consulted, the film societies and film views associations.  As the amendment is drafted, the Minister can consult whoever he wishes among those associations and naturally that is going to lead to resentment and people will say if they had been consulted they would have told the Minister something different.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the meaning of the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  Consultation is a very useful process but it is usually engaged in by people who want to find out something or who wish to get the views of other people.  If we write into legislation an obligation to consult without any obligation to take the recommendations of those consulted into account, it is unnecessary bureaucracy and will cause unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>I believe legislation should be up to date and that the law should reflect reality not what some people would like it to be or think they would like it to be.  It should reflect real life.  I am making no particular criticism of Senator Upton when I say this but I am opposed to what I call nuisance legislation, that is, legislation which is introduced to solve a problem which does not exist.  If there is a no problem, there is no need for the legislation because there is nothing to solve. That may create other problems later.  If <Col N="936" /> lessons are to be learned from recent events, that is one lesson that is patently obvious.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we did not have a problem in relation to abortion but we amended the legislation and now we have a problem. We introduce legislation and sometimes constitutional amendments to solve problems we do not have and the result is that we create problems for ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a degree of truth in what the Minister has said.  To take an analogy from the medical world, even the most useful and appropriate drugs tend to have side effects from time to time but that is not normally put forward as a reason for not using them when they are properly prescribed.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's attitude to consultations.  I agree that they cause delays; sometimes they cause disputes and a certain degree of aggravation but they also have a pleasant side.  They involve people; they may enlighten people and help to point the way forward. I thought we had gone through a few days of national consultation and consensus where most of the major parties and all the Leaders got together for a chat.  This wonderful era &mdash; admittedly it was a short era &mdash; was very pleasant while it lasted.</P>

      <P>As regards the Minister's remarks about these people being objective, perhaps they are but are we all not prisoners of our past, an embodiment of our biases and so on?  I would be concerned at the idea of anybody involved in the arts being objective.  One person's pornography is another person's art.  I think there is a lot to be said for having wide consultations.  Indeed, if there is a criticism to be made of this amendment it is that it is not framed wider to extend the levels of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> We have a fairly unpleasant history in relation to censorship.  As we look back on that history, most of us would agree that much of it was stupid and idiotic and should never have happened.  At one stage, one of the definitions of our better artists and writers was their works that were banned here.  I believe that if the groups mentioned in this amendment were consulted, it would help.  I cannot see any problem with it.  I accept what the Minister says about delays and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not rule out consultation.  He said there was nothing in the section which precluded him from having consultation with any of the bodies or individuals mentioned in the amendment if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4), line 17, to delete &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;salary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I introduced this amendment because I have been concerned about a development in private industry and business for some time where employers contract themselves out of their legal obligations to their employees by calling them contractors and paying them a contract or a piece rate.  This practice began to develop after the introduction of the 1977 Acts which were designed to protect employees and to give them a proprietory right to their jobs, which is only just and fair.</P>
      <P>Employers can get out of their legal obligations by employing people as contractors and either paying them piece rates, day rates or whatever and they are not responsible for PRSI or PAYE.  In the Bill, we are introducing this system into the State sector.  We will pay people on contract to look at videos or films and evaluate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated this morning that on average about 1,000 videos will be viewed each year.  Under those circumstances, I do not see why permanent assistant censors cannot be appointed, <Col N="938" /> paid a salary and become part of the public service rather than employing people on a contract basis.  How does the Minister propose to remunerate the people who will act as assistant censors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that panels of assistant censors will be appointed on a part-time, temporary and non-pensionable basis. They will be paid on a fee per hour per video work examined basis.  I do not see why the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo; should be there instead of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.  If they are salaried they are part of the public service and they will have the other rights of a full-time employee in the public service.  As proposed here, they will be part-time and temporary. They will not have any pension rights and they will not have a career in the public service.  They will be working for the public service on contract basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be open to correction on this, but even if we substituted the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo; for &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; it still would not necessarily make them part of the public service.  I understand there are people working in the public sector who are on salary and still not part of the Civil Service, and subject to the normal conditions, pension rights, right to security of employment and so on in the public service, in the ordinary sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville made a reasonable point about people contracting out of their obligations.  I can assure him that the reason the term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;salary&rdquo; is used here is not to aid, abet or create situations where people can contract out of their obligations. The term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; was specifically included in section 2 (4) of the Bill in preference to the term &ldquo;salary&rdquo; in order to provide the widest possible <Col N="939" /> scope in terms of the manner in which assistant censors might be employed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of factors involved in the video industry and in the examination of videos which indicate that assistant censors should not be appointed on a full-time permanent basis.  For example, the video business is subject to peaks and valleys which means that more videos will need to be examined at certain times of the year than at others.  Also, during the first years of operation, the existing backlog of videos on the market will have to be examined and this will require extra assistant censors who need not be kept on when the backlog has been cleared.  In addition, experience elsewhere indicates that persons employed in the censorship of videos maintain consistently better standards of judgement if they are used for short periods and given long breaks.  I think Senator Neville will appreciate that point.</P>
    <P>Scope should be allowed, therefore, for the employment of assistant censors on a varied basis as circumstances dictate, for example, a contract basis for a definite period of time or on a whole-time or part-time basis as the need arises, or a blend of both systems.  In the case of part-time employment, fees might be a more appropriate method of payment than salary.  Indeed, it might also be that a fee per film examined might be an appropriate basis for payment.  It will not be possible to determine all these issues until the examination of videos gets underway and we learn from experience what is the best method of approach.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, to keep the term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; in the section rather than salary as it is a much wider term and will allow the method of paying the assistant censors to be tailored to the manner in which they are employed.  In other words, we are not ruling out the possibility that some assistant censors may be on salary.  That may be the decision of the Minister.  Some people may be on a part-time basis, some people may be on a fee basis or on a contract basis.  The system will have to be up and <Col N="940" /> running to determine the exact method of payment for the different assistant censors or, if the Minister decides, different categories of assistant censor.  If the Minister decides to keep people on a semi-permanent basis perhaps they will be salaried but the reason the term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; is used is to allow for the widest possible flexibility.  Experience will teach us the best method of employing them and from that we will decide how to pay them.  That is why we have deliberately maintained flexibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says but I wanted to highlight my concern at what is happening with regard to employers contracting out of their obligations under the 1977 Act and the various industrial relations Acts.  I would be afraid that the State would condone that.  The State should legislate to ensure that it does not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;In section 7 (2) of the Act of 1923, the words &lsquo;indecent, obscene or blasphemous or because the exhibition thereof in public would tend to inculcate principles contrary to public morality or would be otherwise subversive of public morality&rsquo; are hereby repealed and &lsquo;grossly degrading as regards the portrayal of women&rsquo; substituted therefor.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic reason for tabling this amendment is concern that the wide scope of the definitions which are used here &mdash;<Col N="941" /> indecent, obscene and blasphemous. None of us would be in favour of what would be indecent, obscene and blasphemous but the difficulty is the concepts of these motions will vary in each individual. As I have said already, one person's idea of art is another person's idea of obscenity and indecency.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned about matters which would &ldquo;be otherwise subversive of public morality&rdquo;.  What does that mean? Does it cover, for example, the capacity to make films on issues such as divorce, contraception, homosexuality and so on. We have a history of anomalies in these matters.  I understand that a film called &ldquo;Whore&rdquo; by Ken Russell was banned in this country but a play based on the film &ldquo;Bondage&rdquo; is now being performed at the Project.  Such anomalies still exist.  I would like to see the definition tightened up considerably and made more explicit. We have suggested one definition.  I do not pretend for a minute that it is the only definition but we have simply put it forward as an item for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point about public morality.  Whenever the Government of the day bring forward legislation in the social area the standard argument against it is that it is contrary to public morality, as if public morality were some sort of a chemical element &mdash; I know the Senator is interested in science &mdash; that could be analysed in the laboratory and one could say exactly what it comprises.  Public morality is a notoriously elusive concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading Senator Upton's amendment, I note that he confines it to what is grossly degrading as regard the portrayal of women.  I am all for equal rights for women but I am not going to elevate them to a higher status than the rest of us mere mortal men.  The proposed amendment would narrow the basis on which a film could be refused a certificate by the censor allowing its public exhibition to one issue, that is, that it contained material grossly degrading as regards the portrayal of women.  It would not permit decisions to be made on matters which would be grossly degrading as <Col N="942" /> regards the portrayal of children or men. It would not permit decisions to be made on films which depict acts of gross violence towards children, men and animals or which would be likely to stir up hatred against groups or persons in the State on account of their race, colour, nationality, sexual orientation, etc.  The existing provision permits decisions to be taken in relation to those matters.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Senator Costello in his contribution on Second Stage criticised the wording in section 7 (2) of the 1923 Act on the basis that it was too wide and left too much discretion to the censor. Whether one would agree with his views in this regard largely depends on one's own views on the legitimacy of censorship <i>per se</i>.  Senator Costello would argue for no censorship or, at most, very limited or restricted censorship and his views on the wording of section 7 (2) are understandably coloured by this attitude. However, we live in a democracy, as was recently demonstrated, and the vast majority of the population do not I believe share this view.</P>
    <P>Most people do not wish to see grossly offensive, violent or indecent films on public view.  They are happy to have films vetted by the official censor by reference to the criteria set out in section 7 (2) of the 1923 Act.  I accept that those criteria are broad in definition but this is unavoidable. What constitutes the norms of public decency or public morality are extremely difficult to define in exact legal terms and obviously change from time to time.  The factual position is, however, that over the years censors, through the interpretation of the existing provisions in the light of prevailing public opinion, have been able to set standards of censorship which, to a great extent, have been broadly acceptable.  This is evidenced by the small number of appeals against decisions of the film censor in relation to the number of films submitted. For example, in the period 1980 to 1991, 4,378 films were submitted to the censor and 32 of his decisions on those films have been appealed.</P>
    <P>We can argue one way or the other about it and about the concept of public <Col N="943" /> morality, etc. but there is nothing as persuasive at the end of the day as hard evidence.  The hard evidence is that, by and large, the system has not caused grave anxiety, disquiet or irritation and that is evidenced by the tiny number of appeals that have been taken in the context of the vast number of films that have been submitted to the censor.</P>

      <P>To take the last item which was raised by the Minister where he suggests that the very small number of appeals lodged is an indication of a minor degree of concern about things, I suggest that the lodging of appeals against films is something akin to the manner in which people go about obtaining loans of money.  If the Minister or I felt it appropriate to obtain a loan from somebody, the last people we would go to are those who do not have any money.  In other words, the lodging of an appeal will be very much determined and coloured by the prospects of that appeal succeeding.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer and I know practically nothing about the law, but I understand it is a very foolish matter to appeal against the judgements of Mr. Justice Costello because I am told they are unappealable.  One does not have a hope because of the way they are formulated.</P>

I accept that it is somewhat restrictive but we are simply focusing in on the most important aspect of concern.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's remarks about morality analysts, I could not agree more.  We have no shortage of them.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 1, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the ascertainment of the contents of the postal packet without opening it (by electronic means or otherwise)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to broaden the scope of the Bill.  There are, I understand, scanners and various imaging techniques available which allow the contents of an envelope to be examined without actually opening the envelope.  The Bill simply precludes the subjects of this legislation from opening envelopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wide range of imaging techniques and they are very effective.  Many play a very worthwhile and valuable role in the area of medicine where it is now <Col N="945" /> possible to get images of every part of the body, which is more difficult to obtain than the contents of a postal package. This amendment is designed to preclude people from getting around the legislation through the use of appropriate imaging techniques.  I do not think there is any purpose in having this legislation if it is possible to circumvent it by the use of appropriate modern technology.</P>
    <P>A series of such scanners have become available in the last number of years &mdash; ultra-sound, infra red imaging and so on, which are widely used in medicine and other areas.  If I remember correctly, in some kidnap cases it has been possible, through the use of appropriate imaging techniques, to discover where the people were held, and the number of people holding them.  A fairly good attempt could be made at figuring out who exactly was holding them and for how long they had been held.  I am concerned that this Bill would allow for the use of those techniques which would circumvent the provision in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will sympathetically consider this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider it. The amendment, if accepted, would on the face of it give greater powers of interception of postal packages to the Garda and the military than envisaged in the Bill although if in ascertaining the contents of the postal packet without opening it, the packet is in any way detained or delayed, the intent of the amendment would be covered by the present definition.  The security forces have not asked for the powers envisaged in the amendment in this case.</P>
      <P>In deference to what the Senator has said, I shall make inquiries between now and Report Stage to see whether anything further is required.  The Senator has a point and I will look at it.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 14, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;the contents or existence of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My concern relates to the fact that it would be possible to monitor the numbers dialled by an individual.  That would not be covered under the terms of this Bill.  If the numbers dialled are monitored they could provide useful or compromising information to somebody seeking information to which they would not be entitled.  I understand it is easy to monitor the numbers dialled on a private individual's telephone.  It would be a very easy way to get around the principle embodied in this Bill that people are entitled to their privacy and that these matters should not be interfered with.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the logic behind what Senator Upton said.  However, his amendment may not be necessary.  The substance of it is already covered in the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; and in section 13.  If a telecommunications message is <Col N="947" /> being intercepted under the provisions of this Bill, it would be understood that the contents of the message were being listened to or recorded.</P>
      <P>There is also no need to include in the definition the question of the existence of a telecommunications message.  It is covered by section 13 (2) of the Bill which puts the disclosure of metering information and any other information relating to the use of the telecommunications service on a statutory basis.  Metering consists of the use of a device which registers the numbers dialled on a particular telephone and the time and duration of each call.  This process is mainly used by Bord Telecom Éireann for the purpose of ensuring that subscribers are correctly charged but the information obtained from it is on occasion disclosed to the Garda to assist them in criminal investigation.  This is done at present by An Bord Telecom in compliance with the common law duty to assist the police in the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
      <P>Therefore, while I fully accept and appreciate what Senator Upton is saying, if he goes back and looks at the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; and also section 13, particularly section 13 (2), he may conclude that the amendment, strictly speaking is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  If the amendment is unnecessary, fair enough, but I would be concerned that it would be possible to monitor the numbers dialled by an individual and that would not be rendered illegal by the provisions of this Bill.  The information obtained simply by knowing the numbers an individual dials on a regular basis provides useful information about that individual which should be kept as a private matter unless there are very grave reasons for not doing so.  I take the general comments made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> In page 4, between lines 23 and 24, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or</P>
    <P>(c) the use of an electronic eavesdropping device to record a communication by a person to another person without the consent of either person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment.  It seeks to include in the Bill the use of electronic eavesdropping devices to record a communication by a person to another person without the consent of either person.  Really what we are talking about is the phenomenon which seems to be growing in this country and worldwide where people bug conversations held with other people.  It is totally unacceptable that that should happen without the consent of the person whose conversation is being recorded.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for this at present because some telephone answering machines have a facility where, by simply pressing a button, a conversation can be recorded.  That is grossly unfair to somebody on the other end of a telephone line who might be conducting a conversation in a casual manner.  The contents of their conversation could be played back to them which could be embarrassing and put them in a compromising position.  In some states in the United States of America there is considerable concern about this and the law bans that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>If one is telephoning somebody, one must be aware that the conversation could be recorded.  It is worse when one engages in conversation with somebody to find that person is rigged with electronic gear so that the contents of the conversation can be played back or transmitted to somebody sitting in a control room and who is monitoring the details of the conversation.  It might be possible to plant a bug in somebody's car or on their clothes through the use of appropriate devices and, if so, everything they say over a period of time could be monitored by someone in a control room. <Col N="949" /> That is a totally unacceptable interference with the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  We have had a series of very unpleasant and public incidences in relation to this matter in the past number of years.  I do not want to rake over that ground.  My concern is that this should be stamped out.  To be fair, my concerns would mainly be in relation to business activities where people in the business world may make statements on an off-the-cuff basis and have them played back to them.  To be honest, I have often made remarks about people which I would not like to be played back.  I have sometimes done so to add a bit of colour to conversations which were otherwise somewhat dull but that type of thing can be compromising.  It is totally unacceptable and I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to what Senator Upton is trying to achieve. However, the Bill as drafted is concerned with the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages in certain circumstances and subject to the controls specified.  Telecommunications is taken to have a wide meaning.  It covers telephone calls, telex messages and telegrams. However, it is wide enough to include a system of electric signals without wires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acceptance of this amendment, however, would extend the scope of the Bill to what is commonly known as bugging devices.  As I understand it, what we are dealing with are unauthorised devices attached to telephones.  My understanding of Senator Upton's amendment is that it would extend the scope to a bugging device attached to a wall of a premises which would be able to pick up conversations in the room, including one side of a telephone conversation. It is outside the scope of the Bill.  I have consulted my officials to see whether that sort of activity is illegal in itself.  While I understand that to tap into somebody's telephone and listen to their telephone conversation is a criminal offence and illegal, the situation is less certain, I am <Col N="950" /> sorry to say, in relation to those types of device where something is planted or hidden in a house.  That should be made illegal.  My recollection is that if one can establish that somebody committed trespass in order to gain entry to the house or committed an offence under the Forcible Entry Act, the Garda would have a role in such a case and one might also take a private action for trepass.</P>
    <P>It is something that will have to be taken on board but the advice available to me is that it will have to be taken on board in a different context to this Bill which deals with a specific brief.  I agree with what the Senator said and it will have to be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Upton.  In the business world people can get a very unfair advantage.  We have seen this &mdash; not in this country &mdash; in major takeovers and transactions on stock exchanges.  There could be an enormous advantage for people who have advance advice.  Can a fax machine be bugged? This fax machine is the new postal package and it is most efficient.  It cuts down on letters from Australia or America.  In the past it took a week to send letters to those countries but now it only takes two minutes.  I do not know if the fax machine is foolproof but if it is it is another major plus in conducting business and conducting conversation for the future with the result that the bugging machine may not be as effective as it was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister seems to be ruling out the amendment.  Would he have another look at it to see if anything can be done to include it in the Bill?  Senator Cassidy introduced another aspect which had not occurred to me, but I am particularly concerned about recording telephone conversations when somebody does not know that is happening.  I suspect that goes on quite a bit in the business world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also very concerned about the use of bugging devices where somebody simply equips themselves with an appropriate microphone and walk up to somebody and engage them in conversation <Col N="951" /> and then set about creating a combination of circumstances which will compromise them.  There are 101 different ways that can be done.  It can be done in public houses where people are drinking alcohol or it can be done in a certain social environment where people behave in a manner which is different from the way they would behave in a normal business environment.  In the past, and in the culture that most of us were brought up in, you were advised that the written word remains: <i>Verba volant, scripta manent</i>.  That was the advice given.  When you wrote a letter particularly to do with business or legal affairs, you wrote it in full knowledge that what you had written would remain, that it would be a record and you would have to live with that in the context of what developed later.  However, that is not how people, particularly in this country, conduct conversations.  Many people in this country in all walks of life conduct conversations in a rather colourful manner.  Much of the time what is said is not really meant but when it is played back and things are taken out of context it can be very compromising.  It is those kinds of concerns that I am trying to cover in this amendment.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at the amendment and see if anything can be done within the limitations of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to look at it.  Senator Upton has made a fair point and I think it merits consideration.  In relation to the specific questions Senator Cassidy asked, I do not know the technical answer whether a fax machine can be bugged; all I can say is if it is possible to bug a fax machine that is covered by this legislation.</P>

    <P>In page 4, line 32, after &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and also includes a message propagated by electro-magnetic radiation <Col N="952" /> including fibre-optics, microwave or radio&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to broaden the definition of telecommunications to cover things like electro-magnetic radiation, fibre-optics, microwave and radio waves and so on.  We introduced this amendment primarily as a way of ensuring that these types of communication are covered by the Bill, and we have also introduced it as a way of trying to discover whether these types of communications are covered by the 1983 Act which established An Bord Telecom. If they are covered by that Act, well and good.  We do not have anything to worry about.  We are simply introducing this amendment as a precaution to ensure that these developments in technology which, of course, are ongoing are covered by the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to the previous amendment, the meaning of the word &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; is very wide. Section 3 of the Telegraph Act, 1869, defines &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;... any message or other communication for transmission by telegraph&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is defined in the same Act as including any apparatus for transmitting messages or other communications by way of electric signals. That definition is understood to be wide enough to cover a system of electric signals with or without wires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that a particular method of telegraph was not invented or contemplated at the time the definition was enacted does not prevent that method from falling within the terms of the definition.  Therefore, it appears that &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; includes a message propagated by electro-magnetic radiation including fibre-optics, microwave or radio.  However, in deference to the amendments submitted by the Senator and the points he has made, and in recognition of the fact that it is a very technical area, I will undertake to consult the Department of Communications before Report Stage to see if, in the light of this amendment, the definition of interception <Col N="953" /> as it relates to telecommunications is adequate.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 35, to delete &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of full age&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We introduced this amendment to keep the present various definitions in relation to the age of majority in some degree of harmony.  People are now given the vote at 18 years and I am puzzled why people who would be allowed to vote should not be covered by the terms of this Bill until they reach the age of 21 years.  I would be interested to hear why that should be the case.  All we are trying to do is to create a degree of record in relation to the present concept of the age of majority and we have used the term &ldquo;of full age&rdquo; as a way of coping with any developments which might take place in relation to that concept in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition in this section describes the offence not the person who commits the offence.  That is the first point.  The criterion is not the offender's age; it is a question of whether, if the offence were committed by, for example, a 50 year old he would be liable on first conviction to imprisonment for five years or more.  The offender or suspected offender could be a 16 year old who might not be liable to imprisonment at all.  The reference to 21 years has the merit of making it clear that what is being referred to his an offence which if committed by, say, a 50 year old, could on first conviction be punishable with imprisonment for five years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to note that section 2 (3) of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, provides that in any statutory provision passed on or made before the commencement of that Act, a reference to 21 years has effect as if it were a reference to full age &mdash; in other words, 18 years of age. There are exceptions and among references to 21 years of age not affected is any statutory provision relating to <Col N="954" /> prisons, to St. Patrick's Institution or to any other place for the custody of persons. Under section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, a person between 16 and 21 may be sentenced to be detained in St. Patrick's in lieu of a term of imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a lawyer, I am puzzled by the Minister's reply which seems to be very technical.  As I understand it, what the Minister said is that we are working our way back to the concept of somebody being 18 years of age through a long and winding legal process. I wonder if it would not be easier for the average person who might take to reading this type of Bill if we simply said &ldquo;of full age&rdquo; rather than saying &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo; and then having to consult three or four other Bills before we finally work our way back to the fact that it actually does cover people who are 18 years of age and older.  If that is not the case, then it opens up the possibility of people over the age of 18 years and people under the age of 21 years being tempted to involve themselves in this type of process in the knowledge that the provisions in the Bill would not be as severe in terms of the sanctions which would be meted out to people who engaged in telephone tapping, interfering with post, etc.  That would be undesirable and particularly so in the context of our young people at present who are very well informed in terms of electronics. Indeed, some of the people more capable at hacking into computer systems as far as I am aware are computer students and electronic engineering students, many of whom would be under 21 years of age.</P>

      <P>In page 4, lines 42 to 44, to delete subparagraphs (ii) and (iii).</P>
      <P>The basic reason for the introduction of these amendments is the fact that the items we are seeking to delete are very vague and are open to all sorts of interpretation. We would be very anxious that the notions, the ideas and the concepts which are covered in these definitions would be covered in a more specific manner than is the case.  What is a substantial gain?  For some people, a substantial gain would be a substantial amount of money; for other people a substantial gain would be a very small amount of money.  Where do you draw the line in such matters?  I certainly hope it would be possible to be a good deal more specific in relation to the provisions outlined here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, it does look rather vague.  However, section 4 which sets out the conditions justifying interception for the purpose of criminal investigation provides <i>inter alia</i> that the offence being investigated must be a serious offence.  The definition of &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; in section 1 sets out the conditions that must be satisfied before an offence will be considered to be serious for the purpsoe of interception. An offence is defined as serious if it is one for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for at least five years and which involves loss of life, serious personal injury, serious loss of or damage to property or a risk of this; substantial gain; or if it is an specially serious offence of its kind.  Such offences committed abroad or attempts, incitement or conspiracy to commit such an offence are also included.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; in the Bill is already very restrictive.  For example, the British definition of &ldquo;serious crime&rdquo; in the 1985 Interception Act states that a crime shall be regarded as serious if</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In page 5, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;No interception shall be lawful unless carried out under and in accordance with an authorisation under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to close off loopholes in the law whereby it would be possible to make interceptions under the terms of another Act.  In other words, interceptions could be lawfully made outside the scope of this Bill and that would allow a way to get round the provisions of the Bill.  Under the various other Telecommunications Acts, it might be possible to intercept post or indeed to intercept telephone messages and that would completely destroy the purposes of the Bill and would provide a back door way of continuing with unlawful interception despite the introduction of this Bill.  That is the primary reason for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the spirit of what Senator Upton is saying but I think on reflection he will agree with me that, strictly speaking the amendment is unnecessary.  Sections 84 and 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 make it an offence to intercept postal packets and telecommunications messages.  Therefore, all such interceptions are unlawful, apart from when they are carried out under one of the exceptions referred to in these sections. One of the exceptions is that the interception was carried out in pursuance of a direction issued by the Minister for Communications under section 110 of the 1983 Act.  Under section 110 one of the directions which the Minister may issue either to An Post or Bord Telecom is &ldquo;to do (or refrain from doing) anything which he may specify from time to time is necessary in the national interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of this Bill provides the link between the 1983 Act and this legislation. It provides that a direction by the Minister for Communications, if it is one requiring an interception, shall be given or remain in force only if and for so long as there is in force an authorisation by the Minister for Justice applying to the interception.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to make unlawful interceptions carried out at the request of a person who is receiving obscene phone calls or where an interception is necessary as part of operational duties where, for example, a telephone line is being installed or maintenance work is being carried out on it. Therefore, as the substance of the amendment is already covered by existing legislation and this Bill and it would have other very undesirable consequences. I do not feel disposed to accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 5, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Basically what we are trying to do here is to ensure that there would be some judicial involvement in the giving of authorisation and we are suggesting that for a number of reasons.  First, we feel it would be an appropriate way to do it but, in addition to that, I also understand that the European Court of Human Rights suggested, as distinct from demanding, that there should be judicial involvement in the types of authorisations covered in this part of the Bill.  I also understand this is the case in the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a minute that what they do in America should set the headlines for what we do here but I think it is an important point and it is particularly important in the context of the suggestion which was made by the European Court of Human Rights.  Unfortunately, I do not have the date of the judgment although I have a recollection that it might have to do with a West German who was involved in some case at the European Court of Human Rights. That is the main concern and the principal idea behind the introduction of this amendment.  Essentially what we are seeking to do there is to have a judicial involvement.  We have suggested that it should be by way of High Court involvement <Col N="959" /> but the essential point is that it should be judicial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Under one of the safeguards being introduced in this legislation a High Court Judge will be involved.  It is basically a question of policy.  The task of deciding whether a communication should be intercepted in particular circumstances or if the security of the State is endangered, is essentially an executive function and has been regarded as such by every Government since the foundation of the State.  Indeed, it is so regarded in other jurisdictions.  I cannot think of any jurisdiction, certainly any democracy, and democracies are all we are talking about in this context, where matters relating to the security of the State are endangered is other than an executive function.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have the advice and recommendation of a nominated officer of his Department to assist him in making his decision.  A judge would not have such assistance.  It would be most undesirable to involve the Judiciary directly in secret operations relating to the investigation of crime or the security of the State.  The more logical and reasonable approach is to have the authorisation issued by a member of the Executive and to have a member of the Judiciary oversee the system.  There are other pragmatic arguments against giving a judge power to authorise interceptions but I am basing my argument on principle and I need not go into them here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 is unworkable as it refers to the giving of the authorisation. I am opposing amendment No. 11 on the grounds that it would not be appropriate or practical for the Minister to consult the judge before deciding on every case. However, where the Minister is doubtful about a particular application, maybe because of some comments by the judge in his report, he may consult the judge. That seems quite sensible and I see no reason to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, it may not always be feasible for the Minister to consult with the designated judge before a warrant is <Col N="960" /> issued.  In cases of exceptional urgency the Minister may give an authorisation orally, but in such cases, of course, the authorisation must, under subsection (2), be confirmed by the Minister as soon as possible by a written warrant.</P>

      <P>In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Where an authorisation ceases to be in force, the person whose communications were interpreted under the authorisation shall be informed by the Minister of the fact of the authorisation unless the Minister considers that to do so would jeopardise a criminal investigation or prosecution or the security of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially what we are trying to achieve with this amendment is to ensure that if someone's phone has been tapped and it is found that there is no basis for a criminal charge, in other words if the person is innocent of whatever they are suspected and the tapping process does not provide any useful information, and if it is then discontinued because it was found to be useless or not providing the evidence being sought, we are suggesting that the person whose phone was tapped should be informed that they had been under surveillance for some time and the surveillance did not reveal anything which was illegal or unacceptable.  In other words, if someone's phone is tapped and the results of that tapping have turned out to be negative, that person should be informed that that had happened rather than putting people under surveillance and not giving them any information about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment as to accept it would run counter to what the Bill is attempting to achieve.  It is probably fair to say that the underlying approach of this Bill is that nobody has a right to know whether their phone has been lawfully tapped whereas everybody has a right to know that there has or has not been a contravention of the Act in relation to them.  It would be a serious weakness in the system of interceptions if persons could find out, or as this amendment suggests, be told, that authorisations had been given in relation to them.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that if people could gain access to such information, even in the circumstances envisaged by the amendment, it would be questionable whether the system of interception could survive as an effective system.  There is no injustice to the person whose communication was intercepted in not readily knowing whether there was an authorisation.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides the specific remedy of the complaints referee where a person believes there was an interception of his communications.  Where a person believes that a communication sent by him or to him has been intercepted he may make a complaint to the referee and ask to have the matter investigated.  The referee will investigate whether an authorisation for interception was given and, if so, whether the provisions of the Act relating to the application were complied with.  If the referee finds there was a relevant authorisation but that there was a contravention of the specified provisions in relation to the authorisation, he must notify the person concerned of his conclusion and report his findings to the Taoiseach.  Among the matters he may then do is recommend the award of compensation which the Minister, as I read the section, will be obliged to pay. If the referee concludes that there was no contravention of the specified provisions of the Act relating to a relevant authorisation, he will notify the complainant to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any authorisation given under this Bill will be given in the knowledge that that authorisation can come under the scrutiny <Col N="962" /> of an independent judicial authority of high standing.  That is the surest guarantee that authorisations given under this Act will be proper authorisations and that the Minister's approach to this will essentially be careful and conservative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that the approach will be careful and conservative. I also think it is fair to point out that we have provided some important exclusion provisions in this amendment. We have suggested that the amendment would not apply where the provision of the information would jeopardise a criminal investigation or prosecution or the security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>You can look at it the other way.  The idea of providing certain powers to the Minister is to intercept communications when a serious crime is suspected, when a serious crime is in process or when the security of the State is in danger.  The legislation, as I understand it, puts the present common law position on a statutory basis and introduces two very comprehensive new safeguards into the system.  On reflection, if you look at the safeguards and the way they are spelled out it will be very easy to resist the temptation to abuse the powers which the Minister is being given under the legislation.</P>
      <P>The fact that it is going to come under independent judicial authority will ensure that if there is any flagrant abuse that will come to light.  That is specifically why that particular safeguard is put in there.  The other safeguard is to provide a remedy for the person whose rights have been interfered with by his telephone being improperly tapped or his communications interfered with.  As the law stands &mdash; and this is not being interfered with by the legislation &mdash; a person whose communications have been improperly interfered with would have a right of action for a constitutional invasion of his privacy.  There is a recent precedent for that; the action was upheld and damages were awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Senator Upton will agree <Col N="963" /> that not everybody can suddenly decide to take a case to the High Court because of the costs involved.  This legislation would provide a simple and speedy remedy &mdash; not an alternative but an additional remedy &mdash; for the person aggrieved in those circumstances.  I read this legislation this morning and the safeguards are comprehensive.  Even as things stand, abuse of the system has not been great.  If you look at the history of the State since 1922, abuse of the system has not been widespread.  When you put those safeguards in to a situation that has not been widely abused, the danger of flagrant abuse in the future will be minimal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I tend to agree with the Minister.  We are talking about investigating serious crime as defined in the Bill.  If one were to generalise the spirit of this motion as it affects all criminal investigation it would mean that anybody who came under investigation by the Garda and was found innocent of any offence would be entitled to be informed of the fact.  The safeguards in the Bill are adequate to cover the concerns people might have and to go any further than that would create considerable difficulties for criminal investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We can interpret this in a number of ways.  If a person who has a reputation of being up to no good has been informed that his phone has been tapped and the results have been negative, in many ways it might put them on guard that what they are at is unacceptable and it might be advisable to desist.  In other words, they may feel they are under suspicion and they may begin to change.  The strongest factor that prevents people from committing crime is the knowledge that they will be found guilty.  That is far more important as a deterrent than savage sentences.  It is possible to interpret this matter in a number of ways.  I accept the points made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned when the Minister talks <Col N="964" /> in terms of the number of abuses of the telephone system in this country over the years having been very small.  I suspect the abuses which were grave may have been very small in number but I am sure the Minister has heard the story of the postmistress in a post office in a part of Ireland that I will restrain myself from naming, who during the course of a telephone conversation between two subscribers when one suggested you had better be careful about what you say because these phone calls are listened to interjected and said: &ldquo;They certainly are not.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is introduced as a safeguard for those people who legitimately carry out telephone tapping under the provisions of this Bill.  It is introduced to safeguard them from prosecution under various sections of a variety of other Acts of the Oireachtas &mdash; the Post Office Act, 1908, the Wireless Telegraphy Acts of 1926, of 1990 and of 1983 and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  The concern here is that the people <Col N="965" /> who legitimately carry out this type of work under the provisions of this Act may be subject to prosecution under another Act.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  The implementation of an authorisation shall intrude on the communications of the person concerned only to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the object of the authorisation.</P>
      <P>(2)  Communications by members of the Oireachtas made from Leinster House, or communications between lawyer and client shall be immune from interception, and any copies of such communications made shall be destroyed immediately upon their nature becoming known.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two items covered under this amendment.  One is a straightforward, sensible provision which suggests that the <Col N="966" /> interference during the tapping of phones should be confined to a minimum.  I understand this has also been suggested in a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights.  I may have been mistaken when I spoke about a German taking a case.  It was in relation to this matter that a German national took the case.</P>
    <P>In the second part of the amendment we are suggesting that some communications should be privileged.  Communications made by Members of the Oireachtas from Leinster House should be privileged.  Statements which are made in the House are privileged and we are suggesting that that privilege should be extended to matters covered by way of communications from Leinster House. We are also suggesting that communications between lawyers and clients should be exempt from interception.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a long-standing acceptance that information given by clients to their lawyers in the pursuance of their legal business is privileged and are seeking to extend the provisions of this Bill to cover that aspect.  It is mainly of concern in relation to dealings which lawyers would have with their clients, and the possibility that telephone messages could be intercepted legally in those circumstances. This would introduce an unnecessary level of caution in the manner in which lawyers deal with their clients where it would be necessary for the client in all circumstances to come to talk directly to the lawyers rather than conduct the same business over the telephone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parts to this amendment and I will deal with them both separately.  I agree with Senator Upton that communications should only be intruded upon to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose for which the authorisation is sought and given in the first place.  However, the Bill is designed in such a way that the substance of this amendment is achieved. For example &mdash; and these examples are not exhaustive &mdash; a warrant has duration of only three months, unless extended <Col N="967" />&mdash; when all the original reasons for the authorisation still exist at the time.</P>
      <P>Under section 7, the Commissioner or Army officer can have interception stopped before the three months are up when they are no longer required.  Section 12 deals exclusively with restrictions of disclosure of the existence of authorisations and of the contents of any communications intercepted.  Therefore, the substance of Senator Upton's amendment is already well catered for.  When the courts are interpreting legislation, what they tend to do is not just look at the section, subsection, line or word to be interpreted but they look at the content of the legislation to get the drift of the legislation. It is obvious to me looking at the drift of those sections that the approach is a minimalist one.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment seeks to make Members of the Oireachtas when in communication from Leinster House or in communications between a lawyer and client, immune from interception.  Presumably, it is authorised interceptions the Senator is talking about.  It is unacceptable to pick out two groups and make them immune.  It would also be unconstitutional.  Why not include other persons, for example, doctor and patient, accountant and client?  There are many other examples.</P>
      <P>Interceptions under this Bill can only be authorised for the effective investigation of serious crime and in the interests of the security of the State.  It does not matter who is plotting a crime or subverting the State, whether it be a Member of the Oireachtas, a lawyer or his client.  I know it is unlikely in the extreme that the persons referred to in the amendment would ever be involved in the activities mentioned but I argue that it would be invidious, and possibly unconstitutional, to make any exceptions. Therefore, I cannot single out TDs, Senators and lawyers and deal with them in a different way to the rest of the world.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Chief of Staff of the Permanent Defence Force.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment speaks for itself in that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána must sign the authorisation.  The same thing does not apply to the Defence Forces; the Chief of Staff of the Defence Force is not required to sign the authorisation for the tapping.  Because it is such a serious decision and for reasons of consistency, I would welcome the Minister's views on why the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces is not the designated person, when the Garda Commissioner is in the case of the Garda Síochána?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 sets out the procedures which must be followed before the Minister for Justice may issue an authorisation for interception.  An application must be made in writing by the Garda Commissioner where the authorisation is for the purpose of criminal investigation.  Where the authorisation is in the interests of the security of the State it must be made either by the Commissioner or</P>
      <P>an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who holds an army rank not below that of colonel and is designated by the Minister for Defence for the purposes of this Act,</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete those words I have quoted and to replace them with the words in the amendment.  I cannot accept that applications for authorisations from the Defence Forces should be made by the Chief of Staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> The position of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in this respect are not comparable.  There are many senior officers within the Garda Síochána who have responsibility for preventing or investigating crime in particular areas or of preventing or investigating particular types of crime.  Similarily, in security matters operational responsibilities do not devolve on one officer alone.  It would be intolerable if all these officers could apply direct to the Minister for Justice for authorisations for interception.</P>
    <P>The position in the Defence Forces is totally different.  There is no need for application to be channelled up to the Chief of Staff as usually they would be coming from one source &mdash; a senior military officer who would be designated by the Minister for Defence for the purposes of the Act.  That office would, under section 6 (1) (c), have to submit any application to the Minister for Defence who would in turn have to make a recommendation in writing supporting the application.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think Senators will agree that there is no need for applications from the Defence Forces to come through the Chief of Staff.  It would add an unnecessary layer of repetition to the application process.</P>
    <P>Also, as with all procedures in the Bill, the designated judge, with his power of investigation, will be in a position to ascertain whether the provisions of the Bill in this respect, as well as in every other respect, are being complied with.</P>

The Minister spoke about the dangers, difficulties and problems associated with consultation.  It would be disingenuous of me to start quoting those remarks back to him now, because I was using the other side of those remarks when I was trying to make my case.

It is the President of the High Court who allocates business among his brother judges in the High Court.  I can see no reason, given the nature of the duties that the judge will be taking up, that the President should not consult with the Minister.

It will be his decision whom to invite.</P>

    <P>It would be out of the question that the designated judge should be a judge of the Supreme Court, although that possibility was in the original Interception Bill, but it was deleted for the following reason. Having regard to the duties which would be imposed on the designated judge <Col N="971" /> under section 8, there could be no question of such a judge, having been invited to act, taking part in any criminal trial or in any appeal from a criminal trial.  This is because of the nature of the information concerning persons believed to be criminals or engaged in criminal activities which will come to the notice of the judge.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, the Supreme Court judge could not be invited to carry out the task.  It is most desirable, unless for very special reasons, that, in particular, criminal cases including appeals direct from the Central Criminal Court to the Supreme Court and references to the Supreme Court from the Court of Criminal Appeal, be tried by a full court. It would be undesirable, therefore, that one particular member of the Supreme Court should at any time be unavailable for taking part in such cases, which would happen if a Supreme Court judge was the designated judge.</P>
    <P>What they seem to be saying is that the Supreme Court is the direct court of appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If there is a criminal appeal from that court to the Supreme Court, it is the usual and accepted practice &mdash; and there are very good reasons &mdash; that it should be heard by a Supreme Court of five judges.  Sometimes the Supreme Court can sit with three judges but in appeals involving points of criminal law, it is felt it is most desirable that the five judges should sit.  If the designated judge was a Supreme Court judge, it would mean that they would have to revert to three because he would be unable to sit in on those appeals because of the information that came to him during his duties as a designated judge for the purposes of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to specifically designate a judge for a fixed term such as five years.  He will hold office in accordance with the terms of his designation and this could be for a term which is suitable to him.  His views would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not allow for ex-judges to act as the designated judge.  It is possible <Col N="972" /> that the judge the President of the High Court might want to invite would be within five years of retirement and the Act would not wish to frustrate the President by making it impossible for his choice to be designated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (a), line 19, to delete &ldquo;two years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I feel, especially in the earlier period, there would be a need to get credibility for the implementation of the legislation.  An annual report by the referee should be completed rather than at vague intervals, as it says in the present Act, of not more than two years.  We should firm up on that requirement.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister undertook on Second Stage to look again at the two yearly interval timescale in relation to section 8 (2) (a) to see if there was any case for reducing it to a one yearly interval. I have come to the conclusion that there would be nothing to gain from such a reduction.  It would do nothing to improve the Bill or, more particularly, the interception scheme which forms the core of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention of the Bill to give the designated judge as much flexibility as possible in performing his functions under the Act.  It is in keeping with his independent role that he should be free to decide how best to perform those duties. However, because of the important role the judge would have in controlling the functions of the Minister for Justice in respect of interceptions and the central <Col N="973" /> place of his report and his review of the operation of the Act, it is proposed in the Bill to place a stated maximum timescale between the production of those reports. The Bill proposes intervals between the reports of not more than two years, as the judge thinks desirable.  Of course, this means that he can report at intervals of less than two years.  This is in accordance with giving him flexibility in deciding when, and for what reason, he wishes to report, the only restriction being that not more than two years may relapse between one report and another.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of this amendment could have the effect of the judge reporting every year to the Taoiseach rather than on occasions where he considered appropriate or desirable.  I contend that the provisions of the Bill in this respect are the most appropriate for a person of a standing of a senior judge who will be an experienced and responsible person who can be relied on to carry out his duties in the most appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 simply would not work.  Reports under subsection (2) (b) are in addition to the reports under paragraph (a).  They would arise in relation to any matters which the judge considers should be reported.  These reports are unlike periodic reports in that they will have nothing to do with time or time-scales. They will arise only when issues arise in relation to the Act which are considered by the judge to require reporting to the Taoiseach.  Therefore, placing any timescale on these reports would not seem to me to make sense.</P>
    <P>In addition to the reports under subsection (2) (a) and (b) and the specific circumstances they would cater for, under subsection (4) the judge has the additional power to communicate with the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach on any matter concerning interceptions which he considers desirable.  The Senator may not fully agree with that, but to me it makes sense.  You are dealing with a senior member of the Judiciary who will know what to do.  The fact of the matter is that the two year designation does not mean that the judge comes in and makes his report on a standard <Col N="974" /> basis every two years.  He could come in on 26 December, and on 26 December two years time he could come in with another report.  He can report as often as he likes but we would not envisage that at all, of course.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I would anticipate &mdash; and I am just making a guess as to how the legislation will evolve in practice &mdash; that if you compel the judge to report on a yearly basis it may be that in some years he would have nothing at all to report.  As I say, he can report as seldom or as frequently as he wishes.  The only guideline or requirement is that not more than two years must elapse between one report and another.  I think that it is sufficiently flexible, particularly in view of the character of the person who will be doing the reporting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 9 to 16, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to deal with a recurring theme, not just in this Bill but in a whole series of Bills, including the Electoral Bill.  It makes the sweeping statement that if an authorisation is invalid then the findings of that authorisation will not be declared null and void or, for that matter, will they constitute a cause of action at the suit of a person affected by the authorisation.  In many ways what this provision seems to do is to give, as it were, a free hand to people who are involved in unauthorised interceptions and that is unacceptable.  In many ways they seem to be free from prosecution, and indeed free from sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deletion of section 9 (1) would run counter to the policy underpinning this legislation.  Subsection (1) <Col N="975" /> provides that a contravention of the specified provisions of the Act or a failure to fulfil the conditions specified in sections 4 and 5 will not make a relevant authorisation unlawful or constitute grounds for court proceedings but this will not affect any cause of action for the infringement of a constitutional right.  I have already said that.  This provision expressly allowing a cause of action for the infringement of a constitutional right recommends a significant change from the 1985 Bill to which Senator Upton's party were a party.  The 1985 Bill was agreed by the Fine Gael-Labour Government. It did not give any right of action at all.  We are allowing here an action for the infringement of a constitutional right. The background is as follows.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the High Court gave its decision in the case of Kennedy/Arnold <i>v.</i> Ireland and the Attorney General.  The court held that the unenumerated personal rights guaranteed by the Constitution include a right to privacy in respect of telephone conversations and the right to hold such conversations without deliberate, conscious and unjustified interference and intrusion by servants of the State.  The court added that the right to privacy is not an unqualified right.  Its exercise may be restricted by the constitutional rights of others and was subject to the requirements of the common good and to public order or, that word again, morality.  In the light of that decision there would be a risk of a successful constitutional challenge to the Bill if it sought to preclude a cause of action for a breach of the provisions of the Act. Hence the changes that have been made make the provision of section 9 (1) inapplicable to a cause of action where a breach of the provisions of the Act also constitutes a breach of an individual's constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A restriction on the complainant's right to take proceedings in the courts in so far as that is possible is necessary because of the need to preserve the essential secrecy of the system of interception and to prevent criminals or subversives from instituting proceedings as a &ldquo;fishing <Col N="976" /> expedition&rdquo; to find out whether or not their communications are being intercepted by the authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (b), lines 22 to 24, to delete &ldquo;the Circuit Court, a judge of the District Court or a person who is for the time being a practising barrister, or a practising solicitor, of not less than 10 years' standing&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are really suggesting here that the functions covered in this part of the Bill should be confined to the High Court. We are not very concerned about Circuit Court Judges or District Court Judges being involved.  That is reasonable enough, but we would prefer a higher level of status through the involvement of the High Court.  We are particularly concerned that the people who are involved should be practising solicitors or barristers.  Certainly, where the Judiciary are involved they have a solemn obligation and indeed a very well merited reputation for being fair and objective in all the matters with which they deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not want to cast aspersions on practising barristers or practising solicitors of more than ten years experience, some of these gentlemen are straightforward political hacks of the highest order of &ldquo;hackery.&rdquo;  They are to be found outside polling stations.  This is quite a legitimate function.  There is nothing wrong with that and, dare I say, some of these chaps support me and some are friends of mine.  I do not think it is a good idea that these type of folk should sit in judgment on matters which would be considered to be exceptionally sensitive, which they can be in certain circumstances. We had the case, to which the Minister alluded a few minutes ago, which was a clear example of a very sensitive <Col N="977" /> matter.  I would not like to think that some of these straightforward political partisans would be appointed to investigate, referee and make judgments on the guilt or innocence of certain people, who could be their political opponents or perceived to be their political opponents.  This, of course, would be relevant in the case to which the Minister alluded.  It would be most undesirable if that were allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that it would happen in all cases because I am sure it would not.  Indeed, in case I am misinterpreted, I want to say I do not see any problem with most barristers and solicitors sitting in judgment on these matters.  I am sure they are fair minded and have experience dealing with the law and difficult issues.  The potential exists for the appointment of political hacks to sit in judgement on very sensitive matters and I do not think that possibility should exist.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill was a good one.  It set about introducing a level of fairness and protection for ordinary citizens who are going about their business in a legitimate manner.  If disputes arise it is highly desirable that the people who referee those disputes should be beyond reproach, and nobody should have any doubts as to their independence.  Lest I seem exceptionally critical of political &ldquo;hackery&rdquo; may I say there are a number of political hacks, who would be fair if they were acting in the role of referee but the public perception would not be like that.  If somebody who has been clearly associated with a political party is appointed to referee a dispute, that is unacceptable no matter how fair minded that person is because his credibility will be compromised and regardless of his decision, certain elements of the public simply will not accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Upton. This is one amendment the Minister should take on board.  The credibility of the Bill and of the complaints referee system is very important to the spirit of the Bill.  The Minister spoke about a <Col N="978" /> senior judicial person as the designated judge, and the same applies here.  The more senior the person the more credibility the system will have.  I do not want to discuss political hacks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Upton that the appointment of a political hack as a referee would damage the credibility of the complaints referee system. No doubt Ministers might appoint somebody who is favourable to them, who has assisted them or their friends.  For the credibility of the complaints system, a member of the Judiciary should be the complaints referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Upton is unhappy that solicitors or barristers of at least ten years standing be appointed to the responsible position of referee to investigate whether an interception under this legislation has been validly authorised. The Senator is happy, on the other hand, with the Judiciary being appointed, with Circuit Court judges or High Court judges.  We have to ask ourselves who are Circuit Court judges, High Court judges or, Supreme Court judges but people who have been practising at the Bar for a minimum of 12 years.  Who are district justices but people who have been practising at the Bar or practising as solicitors for a minimum of ten years?  If a person can be appointed to sit in judgement in any dispute that may arise, even when a man is on trial for the most serious crime, and if that person's qualification for the office he then holds is that he has practised at the Bar for 12 years, I do not see why somebody who has practised at the Bar for ten years should not be able to act as a referee in these types of cases.  The point is not really valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of political &ldquo;hackery&rdquo; I take the Senator's point but we must not work from the assumption that members of the legal profession, or any other profession who are involved in politics, who have a sense of public duty <Col N="979" /> and public commitment and are perhaps actively involved, should be disqualified. I would argue the opposite case.  When appointing a judge, I would prefer to appoint somebody who had an interest in public life and public affairs, and demonstrated that interest by activity, rather than somebody divorced from reality, who confines himself to a dusty office or law library and who would spend all his time prancing around the Four Courts wearing 17th century dress.  It is more important to appoint people who are in touch with reality.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 seeks to restrict the office of complaints referee to a High Court judge.  That is unacceptable.  In the context of my opposition to amendment No. 18 alone, this amendment would be unacceptable.  The roles of designated judge and complaints referee are totally different and it is only right that they should not both be High Court judges. The designated judge will be keeping the operation of the Act under review.  His is an overview responsibility, ascertaining whether these provisions are being complied with and reporting to the Taoiseach. The role of the referee will also be very important but it will be different.  It will be one of investigating complaints and would be suited to the categories of persons specified in section 9 (2) (b).</P>
    <P>I am opposing amendment No. 24 and, as amendment No. 25 is to some extent consequential on amendment No. 24, I am also opposing it.  The person who will be appointed to be the complaints referee will be appointed for a term of five years and will then be eligible for re-appointment. It will not be a question of employing a person or a different person every time a complaint is made to investigate that complaint.  The person who accepts appointment to the office of referee will be taking on, and will have to be prepared to take on, a long term commitment. Anytime within the period of five years, or maybe longer, he will have to be in a position to carry out an investigation.  Of course, it remains to be seen how many investigations will be necessary as that cannot be predicted at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Given long term commitment to the job, it is only right that the Taoiseach should not be too restricted in who he can appoint.  It will be important to get the right person with the necessary legal experience who can make the commitment in advance to the job.  Of course, that person might well be a judge of the Circuit or District Court.  All subhead (2) (b) does is to give the Taoiseach greater options when making the appointment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 is partially consequential on amendment No. 24 in that if persons other than a Circuit or District Court judge were unable, due to amendment No. 24, to become the referee, the question of remuneration would not arise.  That is because under Article 35.3 of the Constitution no judge shall be eligible to hold any other office or position of emolument.  However, they can receive expenses so, regardless of the fate of amendment No. 24, of paragraph (d) (ii) will have to stay.  However, the question does not arise as I am opposing amendment No. 24.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply does not, unfortunately, allay any of my fears which centre on the credibility and acceptance of the decision of a certain type of barrister or solicitor who can be appointed.  I do not dispute that a number of those I have termed political hacks, who are barristers and solicitors, would be fair.  I accept that many of them would give a fair decision but some of them would not.  The trouble is that there will be people who will say that as they belong to &ldquo;the other crowd&rdquo; that will compromise their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fairly significant difference in relation to judges, barristers and solicitors. Judges do not any more have to depend on obtaining briefs, they no longer have clients.  Accordingly, the amount of money that will flow into their pockets will not be influenced by certain business elements and the interests and concerns of their clients.  My worry about the provisions here is that it will allow for people who are closely identified with political parties to referee.  I do not think that is desirable.  I believe that whoever <Col N="981" /> is appointed should be seen very clearly to be away from the political process.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in the Minister's remarks about judges how they became judges and so on and I agree with many of his remarks.  The practice certainly seems to bear it out because many of the people on the bench have had a history of knocking on doors, standing outside polling stations, writing leaflets, writing policy matters and all that.  To be fair to these people, once they got on the bench they have been quite fair.  I do not have any objection to the way they have behaved themselves over the years. Broadly speaking, one could not but admire the way they have carried on. One also could not but admire the way they were able to distance themselves from their past background and the honourable way they faced up to their duties and obligations to be fair and balanced. I believe that is true of people who made their way onto the bench from a background of activity with the whole series of different political parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Upton I am not happy the Minister has not accepted our proposal.  Is it true that the Judiciary are appointed by the politicians but since the foundation of the State they have established a credibility and an independence which has served the State well.  We are asking the Minister in the light of that record to give this section of the Bill dealing with the complaints referee a status and standing with the public which will make it fully acceptable.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Upton, I believe there will be questions asked about the appointment of barristers and solicitors, why they were appointed, and an investigation into their background.  Any semblance of a conection with a political party will be paraded, as Senator Upton said, as an incorrect appointment for political reasons.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister should look again at the amendment.  It would enhance the legislation and status of the complaints referee in the view of the people with whom it must obtain acceptance.</P>

      <P>I can recall about a year and a half ago a senior counsel who had practised at the Bar for some 20 years who was closely associated with a political party; in fact was election agent for one of the candidates in the past two general elections.  He was appointed to the High Court bench on a Friday and on the Monday he was trying a man for murder.  If somebody 48 hours after being appointed could sit in judgment on a person who was on trial for murder, I do not see why a person could not on appointment sit in judgment in these sort of cases.  However, in deference to the views of the Senators I will look at it again.</P>
      <P>We are not trying to set up an industry of political hackery in the country.  We are saying there is only a limited number of judges.  From that limited number there are certain judges who spring to mind immediately &mdash; like Senator Upton in an earlier context I will resist the temptation to name them &mdash; who would be entirely inappropriate, as experience has, unfortunately, shown us, to act as referees for the purpose of this legislation so we are down to a small number.  All we are doing is giving ourselves extra options if we need to call on some experienced solictiors who have a high standing or experienced members of the Bar.  That is what we intend.  If we have to go outside the Judiciary they are the kind of people we intend to approach.  I envisage the Minister will approach the Judiciary in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I can give the House that assurance but in deference to Senator Upton and Senator Neville and to the fact that we are serious about this legislation, I am prepared to reconsider the matter.  I am giving no commitment now but I will reconsider what they have said between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that if the referee concludes that an interception took place but no relevant authorisation was in force at the time of the interception, he should make a report to the Taoiseach, and he would be entitled to direct that any copy of the communications which were intercepted would be destroyed and he would also be entitled to make recommendations in relation to compensation.  I understand that the Bill is quite restrictive in relation to information which can be made regarding tapping. For example, if the tapping was not authorised by the Minister, I understand that all the person who was the subject of that tapping can be informed is that no breach of the Act took place in a certain set of circumstances.  I believe that to be undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is concerned with authorised interceptions only.  Where an interception took place without an authorisation that interception would be unlawful.  The role of the complaints referee <Col N="984" /> is to investigate a complaint that a person's letters or telephone calls have been improperly intercepted on foot of a warrant issued by the Minister for Justice; in order words, to find out whether there has been a contravention of the specific provisions of the Act relating to the giving of the authorisation by the Minister for Justice for the interception of messages.  It is not a function of the complaints referee to investigate unlawful interception of letters or telephone calls.  Such an interception would be an offence under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 and would be a matter for investigation by the Garda in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong for a quasi-judicial person, such as the complaints referee, to trespass into the area of Garda investigation. He would not be equipped to do so.  However, there is a world of difference between the investigation of procedures and the investigation of an offence.  If a referee in the course of investigating a complaint comes across evidence that an offence has been committed he would be in the same position as any other responsible citizen.  He would have to decide for himself whether to tell the person affected by the offence. It can reasonably be assumed &mdash; this is what we would expect &mdash; that he would always bring the matter to the notice of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda authorities.  It is considered there is no need to spell out specifically how a person of the standing of the referee should behave when he comes across evidence of a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>It is a common occurrence for the courts, when they suspect in the course of civil proceedings, that an offence has been committed by some party, to direct that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is no reason to think that the complaints referee will act in any way differently.  Similar considerations apply in relation to the review of the system by the designated judge if he comes across evidence of an offence in the course of his review.</P>

Bearing in mind the spirit of the refereeing process and the spirit of the legislation itself, where a serious offence was not committed, I cannot see why he would not adopt any of these three options.  I believe he should apply the three options in section 6 (3) rather than be in a position to pick and choose which he would apply.  I do not see why he wouild not apply the three options rather than one or more at his discretion.</P>

      <P>Section 9 (6) gives the referee power, where he concludes that there has been no contravention of sections 2, 6, 7 or 8 (2) of the Act but that the offence that gave rise to the interception was not a serious one, to refer the question whether the offence was a serious offence to the designated judge for his determination.  If the judge agrees that the offence was not a serious offence, the referee is obliged to notify the applicant and report his findings to the Taoiseach.  He also has the option to quash the authorisation, direct the destruction of any copy of the communications intercepted pursuant to that authorisation and recommended the payment of compensation to the applicant.  In other words, the referee would proceed in the same way as he would if he found <Col N="986" /> that there had been a contravention of the relevant provisions.</P>
      <P>It could well be the case that the Minister <i>bona fide</i> and reasonably believed that the offence, for which the authorisation was applied for, was a serious offence.  The referee and designated judge could form a different opinion.  It might all hinge on, for example, an interpretation of &ldquo;substantial gain&rdquo; in the definition of serious offence.  In such circumstances, where everything else is in order, the referee might consider that the award of compensation was not warranted. In another scenario, the warrant may have expired or be about to expire when the complaint was made and the referee might consider that the question of quashing the authorisation was irrelevant or, the material in the copy of the intercepted communications might simply not be worth destroying.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there could be many reasons the referee, in a particular case, might not want to order one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (6) (a) (iii) and the provision allows him that flexibility.  Of course, it might happen that there was a blatant abuse of the Act in that the offence was clearly not one that could be reasonably described as serious and, in those circumstances, the referee could recommend the award of compensation, destruction of copies and quashing of the authorisation.  It is a matter of discretion.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would make two general comments on the power of the referee in this respect.  It is the intention of the Bill that the referee and the designated judge perform their functions in an independent manner without interference from any quarter.  They can perform these functions with the maximum amount of flexibility.  The powers of the referee that we are now discussing reflect that independence and that flexibility. Should the referee interpret his functions in an unreasonable manner the designated judge will be in a position to report on that to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 31 to 39, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Basically, our concern is that this subsection might be unconstitutional.  If the provisions in section 10 (3) interfere with the judicial process in relation to the specifications regarding who shall not be compellable to give evidence in any proceedings. My understanding is that the courts have the capacity, the right and the entitlement under the Constitution to compel people to give evidence.  The reason for the amendment is to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We expanded the situations in which people can be compellable as witnesses yesterday in the debate on the Criminal Evidence Bill. In deference to Senator Upton's point I want to explain in some detail the purpose of subsection (3), which is an integral part of section 10.  Section 10 is complementary to section 9 in that its purpose is to preserve as far as possible the secrecy of the interception system by requiring the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for the prosecution of certain offences relating to the interception of communications and restricting to some extent the giving of evidence in civil proceedings that would reveal the existence of an authorised interception.</P>
      <P>The system of authorised interceptions could not function successfully if the existence or non-existence of a warrant, or even an application for one, could be readily ascertained by way of, or in the course of, legal proceedings.  It is in the interests of the State that where authorised interception occurs, disclosure of the fact that a warrant has issued is kept to the minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides that prosecutions <Col N="988" /> for offences under the Acts mentioned, other than those brought by the Minister for Communications, An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann, may not proceed beyond the remand stage without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent criminals or subversives from engaging in fishing expeditions in order to find out if their communications are being officially intercepted by instituting a private prosecution for unlawful interception against, say, an employee of An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann.  If such a prosecution were allowed to continue without restriction the employee concerned might be forced, in the course of his defence, to reveal that he had been authorised to intercept.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) relates to civil proceedings arising from allegations of unlawful interception of communications. It imposes certain restrictions on pleadings or introduction of evidence that might prematurely reveal the existence or otherwise of an authorisation for interception.  The purpose of these restrictions is, like subsection (1), to preserve the secrecy of the interception system by preventing civil proceedings being used as a fishing expedition to discover whether communications are being, or have been, officially intercepted.</P>
    <P>I now come to subsection (3) which provides that, apart from criminal proceedings for an offence of interception, no person can be compelled in proceedings to give evidence or information to a court or body or to produce or disclose documents that might tend to show whether an authorisation had been given or an application made for one.  This restriction does not apply to the giving of information or production of documents to the designated judge or the complaints referee.  The subsection does not prevent a person from voluntarily giving evidence or producing documents to a court.  It would, of course, be a matter for the authorities concerned to decide whether it would allow one or their officers to do <Col N="989" /> so.  In other words, it provides another safeguard against attempts to use legal proceedings for the purpose of discovering whether, for example, an authorisation had been given, that is, a socalled fishing exhibition.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Upton's point about constitutionality, we have consulted the Office of the Attorney General who are not omnipotent in those matters but they have advised us that, constitutionally, it is all right.</P>

      <P>In page 15, before section 16, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may make regulations to enable this Act to have full effect.</P>

    <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the Minister may make regulations to enable this legislation to have full effect and it also makes the usual provision that they would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the standard format.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point Senator Upton is making but I can reassure him there is no need for this. There is no commencement provision in the Bill nor are there any provisions which would require regulations in order to give effect to the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), lines 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Post and Telecommunications&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down out of a concern for brevity, which is in keeping with the anxieties of Senator Fitzgerald. All we are suggesting is that the Title of the Bill seems unwieldly.  We are suggesting that the Title be &ldquo;Posts and Telecommunications Bill, 1992&rdquo;.  That would tidy up the name of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider the suggestion and if he is unable to accept the Title we proposed, perhaps he would consider an alternative Title which would not be as long winded and obscure as this is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill regulates the interception of postal packets and telecommunications. Senators will note that the definiton of &ldquo;communications&rdquo; in section 1 means either a postal packet &mdash; which covers letters, postcards and parcels &mdash; and telecommunication messages <Col N="991" />&mdash; which cover telephone calls, telex messages and telegrams.  Again, in the long Title to the Bill, specific reference is made to postal packets.  If the amendment were to be accepted there would be an inherent possibility that the provisions of the Bill would only apply to post and telecommunications.</P>
      <P>That is contrary to the long Title in the Bill I think.  Senator Upton was saying that if we change the short Title there would be nothing to stop us changing the long Title.  I do not want to restrict the matters to which the Bill relates.  We know what we want included in the Bill and we do not want to introduce anything that would in any way delimit or exclude things we want included.  We will look at it to see if we can tidy it up without giving rise to that difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming.  My initial comment on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is that it is not as bad as it might have been, but it is not as good as it could have been. The present state on Common Agricultural Policy reform reminds me of <i>Alice in Wonderland,</i> words mean what the speaker wants them to mean, not <Col N="992" /> necessarily what the listener normally understands the English language to mean.  In this world of make-believe the Minister for Agriculture and Food when welcoming the changes in the sheep premia &mdash; which were incidentally conveniently announced on the day of the referendum count &mdash; proclaimed that it would help the farmers' cash flow problems. To the rest of us the cuts meant an annual reduction in transfer of resources from Brussels to Ireland of £23 million and a cut in farmers' incomes of approximately £30 million per annum.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Commissioner MacSharry does not appear to see the agreed reforms as others see them.  For example, the Commissioner's objectives in the Common Agricultural Policy reform programme were a more equitable distribution of the Common Agricultural Policy support between larger and smaller farmers; a reduction in the Common Agricultural Policy costs; a more balanced market with the burden of adjustment being placed on intensive producers; a more competitive agriculture industry; a more environment friendly agriculture, etc.  I regret to say that in all of these objectives he has failed totally or partially in the final agreement as it emerged.  Nevertheless, the Commissioner actually appeared to believe what he was saying when he boasted of his success to the world and challenged the US to match his achievements. Britain and the US were the first to react. Their interests are diametrically opposed to ours and it is interesting that they both praised the outcome.  That, in itself, is a sufficient warning to us of what is in store for our small producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of a more equitable distribution of support between small and larger producers was a very worthy one but, unfortunately, it failed, now the larger producer will be better off producing less, while the smaller producer will be still receiving the crumbs and will be worse off in the sense that a small producer, because of all the quotas now in place, can never become a large producer. This, in turn, will make it virtually <Col N="993" /> impossible to bring young new blood into farming.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner set out to achieve this objective with a combination of reduced prices and producer compensation based on modulated support but, one by one, the modulation proposals were rejected.  All cereal producers now, whether producing 10,000 acres in the Paris Basin or 100 acres in Kildare or Wexford will get compensation at the same rate.</P>
    <P>The dairy cow premium on the first 40 cows was withdrawn.  Likewise, the proposed ceiling for premia payments of 90 suckler cows and 500 ewes on lowland or 1,000 on hill land were rejected.  Thus, the larger producers in Britain and mainland Europe will continue to get the lion's share, perhaps even a larger share than heretofore, of Common Agricultural Policy support.  In the make-believe land of Brussels that is seen as a success.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Common Agricultural Policy costs which was the Commissioner's second objective, it is now quietly admitted in Brussels that the Common Agricultural Policy costs will rise by about £2 million per annum. Regarding a more balanced market, the objective was that the burden of adjustment would be placed on intensive producers; in other words, factory-type farmers.  With minor exceptions, all producers will get the same level of compensation regardless of intensity of production, while the factory-type farmers &mdash; the livestock farmers &mdash; will get a windfall in the form of cheap feed because of the cheap cereal policy now embarked upon.</P>
    <P>With regard to having an agriculture industry that is more environment friendly, small concessions are made to the environment in terms of encouraging more extensive grassland production. However, the real danger to the environment, as we know, is from large pig and poultry units in Ireland and large cattle feed lots elsewhere.  I am not talking about grass-fed animals, but rather grain-fed animals kept in huge feed lots and this practice is set to increase as a direct result of the cheap grain policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> In a world of increased liberalisation of trade it is fundamentally important that European agriculture be more competitive. Unfortunately, these reforms do nothing to enhance our competitiveness. On the contrary, the general thrust is anti-competitiveness.</P>
    <P>For Ireland in particular our comparative advantage with cheap grass for red meat and milk production will be seriously if not totally eroded by the cheap cereal policy.  Within the Community, Ireland is unique for the dependence of its economy on red meat and milk, roughly 37 pence in every £1 of net exports, and unique for its dependence on grass for the production of these products. A cheap cereal policy would put all this in danger first, by making white meat &mdash; poultry and pork &mdash; relatively cheaper than red meat &mdash; beef and lamb &mdash; and, secondly, by eroding our comparative advantage with grass by making cereals cheaper for those relying more heavily on cereal feed, particularly the Danes and the Dutch.</P>
    <P>A cheap cereal policy in the US resulted in beef production shifting into huge feed lots in the sun belt states and away from the grass ranges of the north. The same could also happen in Europe with cattle fattening going to feed lots in the Mediterranean area, fed by cheap grain from the Paris Basin and the Po Valley.</P>
    <P>The compensatory payments that have been talked about are dangerous.  They constitute the biggest risk for Ireland. Our biggest risk now is that too much of the farmers' income in future will be in the form of compensatory payments, and hence vulnerable to the whim of the Community taxpayer.  There is no legal obligation on the Community to continue these payments.  Last week's cut in the sheep premia &mdash; which was seen as a model for compensatory payments &mdash; does nothing to enhance my confidence that compensatory payments will last.</P>
    <P>European farmers are losing their livelihoods for exactly the same reasons that millions of workers lost their jobs in Europe in car production, steel production, shipbuilding and various other <Col N="995" /> industries as a result of new technology, increased imports, change in market demands and so on.  Those workers did not get compensatory payments, they just got redundancy.</P>
    <P>I doubt if those people will accept that farmers alone should continue to get an annual payment in the form of compensatory payments.  The taxpayers too, particularly when they realise that the lion's share of the Common Agricultural Policy support is going to a minority of farmers, will make demands that the money be spent on better health care, housing, education, roads and job creation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is still no agreement in the GATT negotiations that the compensatory payments are acceptable to the US anbd the CAIRNS Group, in other words, that they should go into the green box.  If they are not acceptable, in my view they will be sacrificed as the Community will not risk failure in the GATT on behalf of agriculture which now accounts for less than 2.5 per cent of Community GDP, Risks for the 97.5 per cent would be too high a price to pay for the 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we should remember that, politically, farmers are a minority in the Community.  They are outnumbered by almost every other sector in the Community, even by the unemployed &mdash; in this country, they are outnumbered by more than two to one by the unemployed, but in almost every other country farmers are also outnumbered by the unemployed.  I predict that when the pressure comes &mdash; whether from GATT, the taxpayers or the employed &mdash; they will be prepared to sacrifice these compensatory payments.</P>
    <P>The most plausible selling point for the Common Agricultural Policy reforms is that food will be cheaper &mdash; and it should be.  However, the experience since 1977 when prices to farmers, in real terms, dropped by nearly 40 per cent without a corresponding drop in food prices, should give us reason to think again. Price cuts to farmers in the past were invariably accompanied by increased <Col N="996" /> marketing margins to the middlemen at the expense of the consumer.  It is imperative that the benefits in terms of lower food prices be fully passed on to the consumer; otherwise, nationally we will be losing out at two levels, at farm level and consumer level.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in voicing these opinions and I am not speaking politically rather than as an academic.  Some other people hold the same view.  For instance, the editorial in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 28 May states:</P>
    <P>Amidst all the relief that a deal on the Common Agricultural Policy has finally been implemented are we in danger of confusing the wood for the trees?  While the reaction to the successful conclusion of a deal is hardly surprising, it might be a better idea if we closely examined the details of the compromise and their implications for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The absence of any milk quota cuts and a milk price reduction of just 2.5 per cent seems like good news for Ireland.  It is also possible to put a positive construction on the 29 per cent cut in cereal prices and the fact that Irish farmers will receive some compensation for losses suffered as a result of the MacSharry deal.</P>
    <P>That is about as far as the good news stretches.  When looking at the Common Agricultural Policy deal it is not a good idea to look at Ireland in isolation.  We are after all just one among 12 within the EC.  It is when one takes a pan-EC view that the picture looks far less rosy.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the proposed price reductions in the Irish agricultural staples of milk (2.5 per cent) and beef (15 per cent) are far less severe than the 29 per cent price cut prescribed for cereals, the fact remains that the cereal price cuts will work against grass-based Irish agriculture. Sure, Irish animal feed costs will fall but as our farmers need to use far less animal feed in the first instance the benefit will be far less than that accruing <Col N="997" /> to the more intensive Continental farmers.</P>
    <P>The effect of this loss of relative competitiveness will be to further increase our dependence on Intervention. Ultimately, if Irish agriculture is to have any future, it will have to wean itself from its Common Agricultural Policy addiction.</P>
    <P>It would be naive to assume that last week's deal will do any more than temporarily postpone the clamouring of the US and others to dismantle the Common Agricultural Policy.  The bout of self-congratulation the deal unleashed is likely to be proved premature sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>My conclusion would be that these reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy will be damaging to the longer term health of Community agriculture in general and disastrous for Irish agriculture in particular.  If the compensatory payments do not last &mdash; and I cannot see them lasting &mdash; the commissioner's reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy will make Cromwell's efforts to shift the people off the land look like an amateur, crude and abject failure.</P>
    <P>In regard to the various commodities in the agreement &mdash; for example milk, the commodity in which I have greatest interest &mdash; I was pleased that at least for this year there are no cuts in the quota, but I note that cuts of 1 per cent are proposed for 1993 and 1994.  I was astonished that two other countries got an increase in their quota, although this is not stated in the information document I have from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I do not know who has forgotten that we had written into the quota agreement in 1984 that Ireland would get priority in the event of an adjustment upwards in quota; that appears to have been forgotten in the most recent deal.</P>
    <P>As I said, the biggest changes will be in the cereals sector.  While for the moment we will be getting compensation, regrettably, I do not think that will last, but even more serious is the impact it will have on our competitiveness, the erosion of our comparative advantage and the <Col N="998" /> fact that it will make poultry and pig meat much cheaper, thereby challenging our beef and mutton on the market and displacing much of it.  Already red meat is under pressure for a variety of reasons, including health, price and so on, but to significantly bring down the price of pig meat and poultry meat would add further pressure.</P>
    <P>I also referred earlier to the fact that producers, regardless of size, will be compensated at exactly the same rate.  Surely it is not equitable that farmers with thousands of acres in East Anglia, the Paris Basin or the Po Valley will get the same levels of compensation per acre as smaller producers and the Irish are very small producers.</P>
    <P>The beef sector is very important, beef being our single largest item of production and export.  As has already been noted in several places, there will be a 15 per cent cut in prices over a number of stages.  Much has been made about the increased premia, but it should be remembered that the premia only applies to male animals; therefore, 50 per cent of the total cattle population is automatically excluded.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, however, to note that in calculating stocking rates in order to qualify for premia, heifers will not be taken into account.  This will make it easier to maintain a reasonably respectable stocking rate and still qualify for the premia payment.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction the special grant of 60 ECUs or £52.32 where the animal is slaughtered between 1 January and 30 April, but I doubt if this will have the desired effect; it will help, but I doubt if it will make a significant difference. That benefit will simply be passed back to the store producer and the farmer will have difficulty making the profit he should on winter fattening.  The clause whereby the farmer must have 40 per cent of his stock slaughtered in a certain period in autumn in order to qualify for the grant seems unnecessarily restrictive.</P>
    <P>With regard to intervention &mdash; and this is where we could have our biggest problem with beef &mdash; the cut in the amount to be purchased into intervention <Col N="999" /> from 750,000 tonnes in 1993 to 350,000 tonnes in 1997 will put great demands on our ability to market.  The safety net intervention will be retained at 60 per cent of intervention price, but this would be a sacrifice price.</P>
    <P>The sheep sector is of growing importance here.  I am surprised that the British Minister for Agriculture got away with his demands to have no upper limit put on the number of ewes.  Admittedly, beyond 1,000, the level of premia for ewes will be reduced, but that does little to control the output of animals.  The huge increase in sheep flock numbers in Britain combined with imports is the direct cause of the collapse in prices for farmers here.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to note that there is an early retirement scheme for farmers, although I doubt if this will be a success. I believe it will fail just as those in the past failed.  I would prefer if an effort had been made to introduce long term leasing.  The main reason farmers are not prepared to give up their farms is that, in rural Ireland still, a person without property is a person without status.  If they could hold on to the ownership and be compensated adequately for a long term lease, this would be the best prospect we would have of bringing young, vigorous people into the farming industry. That is something farming is urgently in need of as the average age of farmers is now far too high.</P>
    <P>The outcome of Common Agricultural Policy reform has not been as bad as we all expected earlier in the year, but from Ireland's point of view it is not as good as it should have been.  My difficulty with the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is that Ireland is being punished far more heavily than any other Community country.  The reforms will weigh much more heavily on Ireland.  No other country in the Community relies so heavily on agriculture for its economic health or on milk, beef and lamb exports.  Those are the commodities that run the greatest risks as a result of these reforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Senators for their contributions, <Col N="1000" /> and particularly Senator Raftery. I will bring the points raised to the attention of the Minister, who spoke at the start of this debate.</P>
      <P>The sheep premium reduction, which has caused a major controversy in the past week, was first signalled as far back as 1989 at a Council of Ministers meeting and has been the subject of ongoing discussions since.  The Minister outlined yesterday that he intends to take up the issue at a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels next week and will be fighting to ensure that sheep farmers here are protected as far as possible.</P>
      <P>We welcome the fact that there will be no cuts in the milk quota this year.  While the position for 1993 and 1994 is still uncertain the fact that the Minister has ensured there will not be any quota cuts in 1992 is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>At most of the functions I attended since I took up office some months ago, there have been many requests for a special premium for winter fattening. The Minister is to be complimented on securing that premium which, in my opinion, will overcome the problem of seasonality and should help people involved in that area of farming in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>In my area of responsibility as we move away from intervention, it is important that we develop the food industry.  In my short time dealing with the food industry I have discovered that many reports are gathering dust on shelves in the Department, but what is needed is an action plan.  I hope that many recommendations in the Culliton report, which deals comprehensively with the food industry, will be implemented.  A special Cabinet subcommittee are studying the Culliton report at present with a view to implementing an action plan as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 340 million people in the EC to whom we now have an opportunity to sell our quality raw material.  There is no doubt our farmers are producing quality goods in a clean environment, but unfortunately, from the farm gate onwards, these products are losing value.  I would <Col N="1001" /> like to see more companies like Water-ford Foods, Avonmore Foods, Dairygold Co-operative and the Kerry Group, who have done tremendous work in the past five years, expanding and developing into the UK and EC markets.  I would also like to see them participate in joint venture projects with companies in the EC to market and sell our products abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery and others referred to the fact that the benefits are not always passed on to the consumer.  This is an area of great concern.  Even the reduced lamb prices which farmers are being paid at present are not reflected in the price to the housewife and many housewives maintain they are being ripped off.  In the Common Agricultural Policy agreement, much emphasis has been placed on benefits to the consumer, and it is important that those benefits be passed on to the consumer.  Deputy O'Rourke, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, with special responsibility for Trade and Marketing, and Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture and Food, have had discussions in regard to setting up a monitoring committee to ensure that benefits are passed on to the consumer as quickly as possible. That is most important.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery made the point that the Common Agricultural Policy agreement is better than we thought although perhaps not as good as it should have been.  Certainly from our original negotiating position the Minister did a good job in ensuring that the benefits to Irish farmers were protected as far as possible. We have come a long way from the original suggestions from Brussels and I think we will see major benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy reform in the years ahead for farmers and consumers.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to the Minister and to the departmental officials the other issues raised.  We will get a response for the Senators who raised matters in the debate the previous day and again today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I bring up the subject of the need for the Minister for Justice to issue guidelines to local authorities regarding the adoption and rescinding of resolutions regarding the licensing of amusement halls because in my area of Bray, for successive years, there has been a resolution before the council which has failed to ban the slot machines in Bray by a tied vote.</P>
      <P>I believe there is need for ministerial instruction, inteference or tightening up of the rules because the gaming machines lobby is too strong.  It is difficult for politicians at local level and at urban council level to stand up to the rather over-zealous lobbying of gaming machine owners who put too much pressure on them which they find very difficult to resist.  I think the way they have behaved in Bray and in other areas is contemptible.  They do it by a mixture of the carrot and the stick; by this I mean they use the stick if anybody criticises them.</P>
      <P>I received a solicitor's letter recently from the Irish Amusement Trade Association for making vague criticisms of their activities and suggesting that slot machines should be removed and should no longer be allowed in Bray.  I find it particularly reprehensible that criticism is immediately reacted to by threats to go to law.  I also think it would be appropriate if this was made public.  In the light of what is happening in the beef tribunal at the moment, the Irish Amusement Trade Association should also be required to make public their contributions to political parties and to individuals. That is something no one should be frightened of revealing, and they should be open about it but they are such a strong lobby that those contributions should also be open to the public.  Until that is done I believe the Minister should intervene with either far stronger guidelines or slot machines, which are a reprehensible activity, should be abolished from Bray and other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this because I believe they are a <Col N="1003" /> social evil and I have believed this for a long time, particularly because of a case that happened in this House which underlined the sort of misery that was going on in these arcades.  I remember it well.  I think it was before their abolition in Dublin in 1985 but it may have been after that that I went to a meeting in this House of a member of the staff who told Members of the Dáil and Seanad of the misery caused to him and his family by his addiction to these machines.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute here to Fr. Peter McVerry who did sterling work highlighting the appalling downfall of individuals as a result of their addiction to these machines.  It was largely as a result of his work that they were banned in Dublin.  Thankfully, a right decision was taken to ban them in Dublin because some people were addicted and because of the misery they caused; they were banned also because of illegal activities.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the effect of banning them in Dublin was to export a great deal of this problem to Bray in County Wicklow.  As a result, Bray has become the urban centre of slot machine activity in the greater Dublin area and in County Wicklow.  Unfortunately, this reflects badly on the town, has an adverse social effect on the town and has an adverse effect on the environment.  It creates a bad image.  Although it is bad for the image of the town, I do not think that is the principal reason.  It is bad for the people who play them because of the effect on their families.  The individual who called this meeting in the Oireachtas all those years ago told us about the misery suffered by his family, about the poverty inflicted on his family and the fact that he was involved with money lenders.  He had to get into money lending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would prefer if the Senator did not refer to any member of the staff of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an anonymous individual. Many public representatives were <Col N="1004" /> at that meeting but I take your point, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>One of the great problems in the Bray area has been that while proprietors of these gaming machines have been prosecuted on many occasions, the fines have been derisory &mdash; £50 &mdash; the Garda in Bray are undermanned and cannot spend their time constantly surveying the activities in these amusement halls to see whether they are breaking the law.  The real difficulty is that this is a cash business. There are no receipts for people who go into arcades or amusement areas and play the slot machines.  They play with cash.  It is undetectable how much they win or lose.  We do not know how much the owners are making but we know they are huge amounts of money. People play with coins and they do not get receipts.  We know there are huge amounts of money involved and we know they will fight very hard to retain this privilege.</P>
      <P>The principal worry to which I refer, which I think the Minister might address, is that the machines have been adjusted; although the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act only allows a 2½p minimum and a 50p maximum amount, the machines are adjusted so that the best are accumulated and all sorts of ways are found for bypassing the spirit of that Act.  There are also serious difficulties and worries about whether under age members of the public walk into those places and play those machines.  It is a grey area which is not enforced and is unenforceable.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to put further pressure on the local authorities, but it is my contention that the principal problem is the existence of activities of this sort which cause misery and unhappiness to many families.  I ask the Minister if there is anything he can do as a matter of Government policy to ensure that they are removed.  Will he give an instruction to Bray Urban District Council that they should follow the fine example of Dublin and remove this social evil from the body politic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul <Col N="1005" /> síos ba mhaith liom leithscéal an Aire Dlí agus Cirt, an Teachta Flynn, a ghabháil os rud é nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas bheith anseo tráthnóna.  The position is that the law in relation to gaming is contained in the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986, and in particular Part III of the 1956 Act which governs the licensing of amusement halls and fun fairs for gaming purposes.</P>
      <P>In order for gaming to be lawful in an area it is a matter in the first instance for the appropriate local authority to pass a resolution under section 13 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 adopting Part III in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area. Once such a resolution is adopted it is then a matter for interested persons to make applications to the District Court for a certificate authorising the issue of a gaming licence by the Revenue Commissioners. A person intending to apply for a certificate authorising the issue of a gaming licence must notify the local Garda Superintendent and publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in the locality of his or her intentions.</P>
      <P>At the hearing of the application before the District Court, the Garda Superintendent for the locality or indeed any other person who appears to the court to be interested, may appear and may produce evidence in relation to the application.  Furthermore, the court in considering the application must have regard to the character of the applicant, the number of gaming licences already in force in the locality, the suitability of the premises, the manner in which the applicant has conducted his or her business in the past and the kinds of gaming proposed to be carried on.  The decision of the District Court in the matter may be appealed to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Having in the first place passed a resolution adopting Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 it is open to any local authority subsequently to rescind any resolution in accordance with the procedures set out in section 13 of the 1956 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that in excess of 80 local authorities passed resolutions adopting <Col N="1006" /> Part III of the Act.  However, following expressions of public concern about the dangers of slot machines, approximately half of these authorities rescinded their earlier resolutions.  I am familiar with this in that my own local authority, while I was a member, rescinded Part III of the 1956 Act.  This is a good example of local democracy in action.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the members of local authorities, being in close contact with the people of the area, are best placed to make a judgment in such sensitive matters of local interest.  Councillors and Town Commissioners have used this power sensibly over the past 30 years or so and I am not aware of anything which would justify a change in the present position nor warrant the Minister for Justice issuing guidelines to the local authorities concerning the adoption or otherwise of Part III of the 1956 Act.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the remarks of Senator Ross particularly in relation to Bray, the adjustment of machines, not adhering strictly to the legislation in relation to a bet of 2½p and a pay-out of 50p and the damage this is causing.  I will bring his comments to the attention of the Minister but I have to point out that that there is no provision in the legislation requiring or authorising the Minister for Justice to issue any directive.  There is no provision there and despite what happened in Dublin, or indeed in many other counties, like my own county, it is a matter for the local authorities and the 1956 Act appertains to this.</P>
    <P>Most members of local authorities are very well informed as to the wishes of the majority of the people in their localities and are quick to perceive any changes in these views with the passage of time. The issuing of guidelines from a central authority such as the Minister for Justice to the local authorities in these matters would not, in my opinion, be appropriate. However, the Senator can be assured I shall bring his strongly held views to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister.  In view of the serious public concern which is constantly being <Col N="1007" /> expressed particularly in Bray about the activities of the owners of the slot machines, would the Minister consider recommending to the Government that the contributions these people make to political parties or to individuals should, along with those in the Beef Tribunal, be made public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is referring to the activities of the users.  If the Senator brings them to my attention or directly to the attention of the Minister for Justice we will certainly take a decision in relation to the activities to <Col N="1008" /> which he refers.  If he includes that then I will put it to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <P>What about the contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter for the Minister when the Senator can give some details and more precise data. It is very easy to make bald statements. If Senator Ross lets us have some specific details, it will be a matter for the Minister to decide if he should pursue the matter and I am quite sure he will do so.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 12 noon on Tuesday, 30 June 1992.</P>
