      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House, may I take this opportunity to wish the many Senators on both sides of the House who will contest the Dáil election every success and a good campaign.  I am sure many of them will be elected.</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle, I am considering giving you a day's canvassing. We will be sorry to lose some of the very fine people here but if that is what they want I wish them well.  I know we will probably meet later but for the three weeks ahead we may not do so. That is a matter, of course, for the Leader.  I would like to thank you for your co-operation over the period I have been in the Chair and to wish success to all who are seeking election.  I call the Leader of the House.</P>

      <P>Items 1, 2 and 2(a) on the Supplementary Order Paper, and Nos. 3 and 4.  Notwithstanding, anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings on the Fourth and Fifth Stages of item No. 2 and on the motion of concurrence with the earlier signature of the Bill by the <Col N="1014" /> President and on the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages of item No. 3, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.30 a.m. and 1 p.m., respectively, by one question, in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to item No. 3, include only Government amendments; item No. 4 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and business shall be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  I am suggesting 15 minutes per person on item No. 4 in the afternoon on the Aer Lingus debate, if that is agreeable to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, the arrangements for today are acceptable.  This is, as you all know, the last effective meeting of this Seanad.  We may meet after the Dáil election but that is unlikely &mdash; this is our <i>nunc dimittis.</i></P>
      <P>This Seanad has been in the news more often than most of its predecessors and sometimes for reasons that were controversial. They may not always have been the best reasons but in spite of that this has been a very good Seanad.  It has been marked by a spirit of co-operation and an attempt to carve out a new and distinctive role for this House.  There was also an attempt to reform some of our procedures.  Without making any contrast, the work of this House was carried out in a good spirit without rancour or bitterness.  We showed the capacity to work across party lines and to co-operate in the national interest.  People were able to say hard things on policy matters without generating any personal bitterness across the various divisions in the House. We should mark that point.  A great deal of that is due to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to your spirit and fairness in the Chair and also to the Leader of the House who has tried very hard to generate a good spirit of work and co-operation in the House.  Like yourself, a Chathaoirligh, I wish well to anybody who finds himself or herself facing the electorate either 21 days or 90 days from now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated at another time, I always find it difficult to accept <Col N="1015" /> that this sort of sympathetic closure should take place in this House when the other House decides to finish its business. This is something I have never agreed with.  However, I am a pragmatist and recognise that people will have commitments in other areas during the next number of weeks.</P>
      <P>I want to put one thing on the record because some of what I said yesterday may be misinterpreted.  It is in order for any Member of any House of the Oireachtas to have an ambition to have a seat in another House.  I have never had any difficulty with that.  My only difficulty has been to see this House playing second fiddle.  I have been opposed to that.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>As this is the final sitting before the Dáil general election, may I ask for two things which I would like to see taken on board by the Leader.  Whatever about my suggestion yesterday for a simultaneous nomination day for both Houses &mdash; which I know will never be conceded &mdash; I think it is fair to request at this stage that, as early as possible, we have the timescale for the next Seanad election so that we can make a judgment on it.  I would ask the Leader to ensure that the Department of the Environment give us those dates as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As this is the last sitting day, I would like to put on record my appreciation of the co-operation which has been shown at all times &mdash; even at difficult times &mdash; by the Whip and the Assistant Whip on the Government side, as well as the Whips on the other groups.  I would like to record my appreciation in a special way to yourself, a Chathaoirligh, and to the staff of the House for their support in getting the business done.  Never has reasoned debate and proper committed consideration which has been the mark of this House, been more important.  There has been good humour while hard things were said, but nevertheless there was reasoned debate.  I hope that any discussion outside over the next number of weeks does not diminish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at an earlier stage of the sittings of this House that it is very sad that so <Col N="1016" /> few young people look at politics as a profession.  Surely we can ask that all sides of both Houses over the next number of weeks in the Dáil and Seanad general elections, should conduct themselves in a way which shows politics as a profession to which young people might aspire for the good of democracy and for the good of the country.  This House can show the lead in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reached the end of the road.  I think this was a good Seanad. I enjoyed being here.  The standard of debate was comparable to that in the other House, and, comparable to any other parliament I have listened to.  It is particularly worthwhile that we began the process of reform.  It is very important that we recognise the need for reform. We have taken the first steps even if we still have a long way to go, but the fact that we recognise the need for change is important.  There is considerable potential for the next House to take on developments which were initiated here.</P>
      <P>In particular, I want to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the courteous, kind and pleasant way you have conducted this House while in the Chair.  Everybody agreed on that.  It is a great tribute to you and has been a very important factor in the way the House worked.</P>
      <P>I want to say the same to the Leader and to the people across the way who are involved in running the House, the Whip and the Assistant Whip and others.  I would like to say a special word of appreciation to my colleague from Clare, Senator Honan.  I do not think I would be able to revisit the county if I did not do that.  I also want to thank and pay tribute to our colleagues on this side of the House who, as far as I was concerned, were very kind, obliging and courteous to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish everybody who works in the business of contesting elections the best of luck, whether it is the election to the Dáil or the Seanad, or both.  In your own case I sincerely hope that on your way to Athlone from Wexford you will stop into Dublin South-Central, perhaps for a half day, and take me around to <Col N="1017" /> improve the impression I hope to make on the people out there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record, first my thanks to you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courtesy, co-operation and kindness to me and to my colleagues, particularly since you have been in the Chair but also when you were Leader.  I also want to express my appreciation to the Leader of the House, the Whips and the Assistant Whips.</P>
      <P>This Seanad has been marked by reasoned debates.  We have seen a maturity of political thought which was impressive.  It nearly persuades me that our party's policy in relation to the Seanad should be changed &mdash; but not quite.  I say very humbly that the quality of thought and of speech-making, not to say the odd bit of jibing across the floor, was a revelation to me.  For the most part the jibing was in good spirits.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that young people should look to our Chambers. They look for leadership in the political arena.  I believe in consensus and co-operation and that spirit should be engendered in a House such as this.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I know you cannot canvass everywhere and I will not even dream of asking you to do so.  All I can say is, I wish my colleagues well, particularly those who have ambitions to the other House.  I have such ambitions, but I will remember with a great sense of gratitude my time in the Seanad, no matter what happens.  I wish those who remain in the House every success in their campaigns. Some may be going on to what are considered higher things.  I sometimes wonder if that is true.  I wish everyone the very best in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of the morning, I wish to point out that I have been in this House almost 12 years and I am beginning to realise that I am not a <Col N="1018" /> neophyte here any more.  Therefore, if I make mistakes they are always deliberate.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on the record that one of the reasons the House has been pleasant is your qualities as a Cathaoirleach.  I would like to associate myself with the expressions of appreciation.  Potentially troublesome Members, like myself in particular, are facing four weeks' suspension, if we are suspended at this stage. I put on notice that if I am back here after the election I have a clean slate and my capacity to take risks will be greatly enhanced.</P>

      <P>I could not help noticing the occupancy of what used to be the Progressive Democrats benches at the back of the Fianna Fail benches.  Is that an eviction or a change of allegiance on the part of those Members?  There is clearly a determination to squeeze people out over there.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, with your quite considerable indulgence, this morning I would like to stand and defend this House and to defend politicians.  I spent 12 years in both Houses.  I came in as an anti-Establishment critic but my impression of politicians is a lot better now than it was before I came into either House.  I have come to the conclusion that the problem we have is that we are human and every twist of our humanity is scrutinised in public.  Unlike many of those who scrutinise us, whose privacy and humanity is never scrutinised, every thing we do is subject to public scrutiny. We make our compromises in public; we make our mistakes in public; we show our weaknesses and our greed in public <Col N="1019" /> Everything we do is scrutinised in public. I invite those who criticise us to allow the same scrutiny of everything they do.  I think we would be shown to be not very different&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it would make much difference if I was suspended for four weeks at this stage, but do not tempt me.  It has just dawned on me that it does not make much difference whether I am suspended for four weeks. We will hardly be meeting between this and Christmas, in any event.  A Chathaoirligh, while I do not want to invite you geographically to canvass on my behalf, if you could persuade all the NUI graduates in Athlone to do the right thing, I would be very grateful to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to our own leader.  He did a magnificent job.  He approached it with great determination and effort to make a success of it and he created a sense of comradeship between the Opposition and himself. While he is a very serious and dedicated man, he approached his job in a lighthearted way and gave the impression that everything was easy to achieve.  I offer my congratulations to him and I would like to wish him success.</P>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to our Whip who did a great job and to all the Whips who in the past have made this House work in a very satisfactory manner.  We had worth-while debates.  I agree with Senator Maurice Manning that this Seanad was one of the best in a long time.  It met frequently and we did very good work.  The Cathaoirleach was largely responsible for our success and his predecessor also did his best when he was in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted when I heard Senator O'Toole say that he appealed to youth to take more interest in politics.  My final word, and I have said this on many occasions, is that I would like to see our national flag fly at every school.  Teachers <Col N="1020" /> should engender a greater love of their country in the pupils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Teachers should engender a greater civic spirit in the children and encourage them to take an interest in politics and in the life of the country. It would be a great day's work.  Again, congratulations to all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has thanked all and sundry.  As an indication of my appreciation for your own good qualities, a Chathaoirligh, I will also invite you to Dublin Central; it is quite close and we do not have far to travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was also delighted to see that Senator Keogh of the Progressive Democrats is rethinking her position in relation to this House.  I suppose a little spell in Government with Fianna Fáil makes people see a certain degree of reality.  We would certainly welcome her here to the Opposition benches, which I think is the appropriate place today.</P>
      <P>One point I will make and that is in relation to the workings of the Seanad. It is my first time in the Seanad.  I must say that in the course of the Seanad sittings I felt that its position was being strengthened <i>vis-a-vis</i> the procedures of the other House.  There was a considerable move towards reform of the Seanad and, as a consequence, some very substantial legislation was initiated here.  We have before us today from the Dáil legislation which initially received a very thorough examination in the Seanad.  That was perhaps the greatest development that took place. There was greater emphasis on major issues in this session and I would certainly like to see that development continuing in the next Seanad.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, tá mé a cheapadh gurb é seo an chéad uair a tharla sé i stair na tíre go raibh Cathaoirleach an Seanaid bainteach leis an síniú maidir leis an gCoimisiún Uachtaránachta agus ba cheart dúinn mar Theach ár mbuíochas agus ár gcomhghairdeas a chur in iúl duit as an bhaint atá agat leis an lá stairiúil seo.  Ba mhaith liom mo leithscéal a ghabháil leat faoi, b'fhéidir, nár iompair mé mé féin i gceart cúpla uair nuair a bhí mé ag troid ar son na teanga nó ar son m'fheisteas éadaí sa Teach seo.</P>
      <P>Tá gníomhaíocht ar bun agam faoi láthair, ó thaobh dhlíthiúlacht an Tí seo de i leith na Gaeilge agus i leith Achtanna an Oireachtais bheith ar fáil i nGaeilge.  Is trua liom go bhfuil deireadh leis an Teach agus nach raibh deis agam leanúint ar aghaidh leis sin.  Ach, é sin ráite, níl aon rud pearsanta agam in aghaidh an Chathaoirligh ná duine ar bith de bhaill choiste an Rialtais atá i gceist &mdash; cearta an duine amháin a bhí á bplé agam.  Go n-éirí le chuile dhuine anseo, iad atá ag dul ar ais ag toghchánaíocht don Dáil nó don Seanad.</P>

      <P>May I also thank the Leader of the House, Senator Wright, the Chief Whip and Senator Manning on our side of the House who has helped all of us new Senators with his gentle, firm approach to politics on this side?  Like Senator Keogh, I felt that debate in this House was very uplifting, and free from acrimony, except when we had political jousting now and then.  I wish everyone who is looking for a seat in the other House, including myself, the very best of <Col N="1022" /> luck.  I also wish good luck to everybody who wishes to continue here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by thanking the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy in the way he has conducted the business of the House since he took up office. At all times he has been fair and evenhanded in his dealings with Members. I would also like to pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach's staff for the way in which they have looked after us in this Seanad. Despite the fundamental differences that divide us, it is important on an occasion like this that I should say it has been my privilege to meet some of the finest people on both sides of this House.  It is also important to say that all of us, from whatever side of this House, feel that we are here to serve the people.  We have a belief in democracy and it is not unfair at times to defend the profession to which we belong.  The value of that profession has been manifest during this Seanad and it is no harm to say it.  To all colleagues, I wish them well in whatever they do in the future, whether it be in this House, the other House or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am one of the long serving Members of the Oireachtas; just one month from now I will be 22 years in the Oireachtas.  Despite the hard work and all that went with it, it was a very happy time for me.  I hope to be back here again for a further period of two, three, four or five years, or for however long the next Government will last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to you, a Chathaoirligh, for the excellent job you have done since you became Cathaoirleach.  I compliment the <Col N="1023" /> Leader of the House who performed excellently.  The smooth running of the House, the quality of debate and the amount of business we have got through have been contributed to in no small way by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, who proved himself an excellent Leader.  May I also pay tribute to the Leas-Chathaoirleach who was a major contributor to what happened here in the last term.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House and I realise there is a time schedule but nobody will be offended if I mention one small party we thought would never sit in the House.  They were the junior party in Government and they seemed to be opposed to this House.  I hope their time here has converted them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear two of them speak this morning and I hope we will hear no more putting down of the Seanad.  The three Progressive Democrat Members made a major contribution to the debate here.  I do not want to take from anybody's contribution but they put their hearts into it.  They spoke in every debate and made a major contribution.  I hope I am not offending anybody here when I say that their party gave us Government for the last three and a half years.  In 1989 it looked as if we would have a second Seanad election within a month or two because it seemed no Government could be formed.  Great credit is due to the Progressive Democrats for giving us Government for that period.  I hope that whatever combination of parties make up the next Government, we will not have another election for three, four or five years.</P>

      <P>I have a book with me called <i>Successful Marriage: A Family System Approach to Couples Therapy</i>, and it is recommended reading for the leaders of any future coalition, although I expect we will have single party Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach for the excellent way he conducted business while in the Chair and also when he was Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party here.  I do not want to single out the people to whom tributes would be appropriate but it is encouraging to hear the new evaluation of the Seanad from the Progressive Democrat members.  I sincerely hope that reflects the views of the Progressive Democrats generally.</P>
      <P>The contributions made by the members of the Progressive Democrats in this House, while people might have expected them to be casual and indifferent have been very informative and constructive.  The House owes them a debt of gratitude for that.</P>
      <P>I wish everybody in this House well in the weeks and months ahead, particularly in the context of the general election.  I hope those who seek election to the Dáil will be successful and that those who seek election to the Seanad will also be successful.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy, co-operation and help.  I would also like to single out the Leader of the House, Senator Wright, and to pay tribute to him for his excellent handling of affairs in recent times.</P>

      <P>Before calling the Leader of the House may I pay a very special tribute to him.  He was Whip when I was Leader, and he has been Leader for nearly two years.  His commitment to the House as Leader and as Whip has been above the call of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to Senator Eoin Ryan and to Senator Tom Fitzgerald in the Government Whip's office.  In a very quiet way they have done trojan work for this House.  May I also <Col N="1025" /> thank the group leaders, in particular Senator Manning, the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Liam Naughten, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, who has helped me in a great way.  You have all been excellent Senators and I wish you the best of luck in the future.</P>

      <P>The only question asked this morning was by Senator O'Toole about the timing of the Seanad election. I hope the Minister, who is in the House, will take note of that and get the information back to those who are concerned. May I take this opportunity to thank all the Members of what was a constructive Seanad.  We played a small part in democracy over the last number of years.  I want to put on record that one of the reasons the House was successful was the co-operation all the leaders on this side received from the Opposition Members. I would like to thank Senator Manning and Senator Cosgrave of the Fine Gael Party, Senator O'Toole representing the Independent group, Senator Upton of the Labour Party and Senator Keogh of our separated brethren for all their help in ensuring that we had a successful Order of Business most days.  I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues, Senators Eoin Ryan and Fitzgerald in the Whips Office for the excellent work they have done, to the Clerk and all the staff for the support and help they have given us and for putting up with me over the years, to the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach for their advice and support. They were rightly complimented this morning by all sides of the House.  I wish everybody success in whatever career they are pursuing.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that earlier this year we had extended and very useful debates on the different Stages of this Bill.  The measure was initiated in the Seanad and was subjected to a thorough and searching examination in its passage through the House.  I hope I am in order in saying that speakers in the Dáil were very complimentary about the work done by the Seanad in relation to the Bill.  It is my pleasure at this stage to report on certain amendments which have been made to the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I will sketch in very briefly what the Bill is about.  Its purpose is to consolidate, with amendments, the law relating <Col N="1027" /> to the election of Members to Dáil Éireann.  For the first time in the history of the State, the entire law in relation to Dáil elections is being brought together in a single statute.</P>
    <P>The amendments which have been effected in the Dáil will, I believe, be generally welcome in this House. Senators will be particularly pleased at the amendment to section 47 which relates to the deposit required of a candidate at a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>The existing deposit was fixed at £100 in 1923.  The Bill, as drafted, proposed to increase this to £500.  Many Senators, on both sides of the House, expressed disquiet, in varying degree, at the substantial increase proposed.  I am sure they will be pleased to learn that in the Dáil the Minister accepted a compromise suggestion that the deposit be set at £300.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 57 emerged from a consensus among the parties.  That section relates to the free postage facility for candidates at Dáil elections.  Existing law on this subject, which was reproduced by the Bill as enacted, entitles each candidate at a Dáil election to send, free of postage charges, one election communication to each person on the register of Dáil Electors for the constituency.  The amendment effected by the Dáil enables the election communication to be sent to each Dáil elector as at present or to any combination of such electors.</P>
    <P>The amendment will give more flexibility to candidates in the operation of the free postage facilities.  It will allow them to target individual electors, or households, or a combination of both. Under the amendment a candidate will be able to issue a letter to: all electors on the register for the constituency, or certain electors only, or each household, or certain households, or certain individual electors and certain households.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will provide for greater flexibility for parties and candidates and will enable them to use their resources to the best effect.  It may also result in a saving to the Exchequer, which <Col N="1028" /> must bear the cost of the &ldquo;free postage&rdquo; facility.</P>
    <P>Associated amendments to sections 167 and 170 effect corresponding improvements in the free postage facilities applying at Presidential elections and European Parliament elections, respectively. Consequential technical amendments were made in section 172 which relates to certain provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which have reference to postal arrangements at elections.</P>
    <P>A provision of the Bill which attracted a good deal of interest in this House is section 147 which prohibits canvassing and other political activity in the vicinity of polling stations.  The Dáil accepted a proposal that the prohibition should apply within 100 metres of the polling station rather than 50 metres, as originally proposed.  There appears to be general acceptance that this will make the provision more effective and, hopefully, will put an end to this unseemly activity altogether rather than simply moving it down the road.</P>
    <P>Again, there are associated amendments to section 172 relating to European elections and 174 relating to local elections. The provisions are applied to Presidential elections and referenda by sections 167 and 168 respectively.  I might add that the Minister gave a specific commitment that these provisions will be in force for the poll at the forthcoming referenda and, indeed, at any general election that may be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Section 121 (8) of the Bill, as originally drafted, provided that the returning officer would not transfer a surplus if the surplus, together with all other untransferred surpluses, could not possible give any continuing candidate a quota, could not save any candidate from elimination or could not save the deposit of any candidate. Outside these very limited circumstances, the returning officer would be obliged to transfer every surplus.</P>
    <P>Certain reservations were expressed in the Seanad about this provision, particularly by Senator Naughten.  Further examination of some concrete examples suggested that the provision as drafted <Col N="1029" /> would work satisfactorily and would be a definite improvement on the existing provision.</P>
    <P>However, we all know how tense the situation at a count can be.  Sometimes a candidate may find it difficult to understand why he or she should be eliminated when there is any surplus, however small, available for distribution.  The wise returning officer may well seek to release some of the tension by transferring a surplus, even though he may be aware that it can make no material difference. For this reason, the section has been amended to restore the discretion of the returning officer but within much narrower limits than at present.  The amendment does not fully meet the views expressed by Senator Naughten but should go a long way in this direction.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Dáil amended section 88 of the Bill which sets out the directions for the preparation of the ballot paper. The amendment provides that the top right hand column on the ballot paper, which is the space reserved for the official mark, will be darkened or cross-hatched in order to discourage electors from writing on the otherwise blank space.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we have this measure before us today and I will not hold up the progress of the Bill through the House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this Bill was introduced in the Seanad and was dealt with in great detail by Members.  It brings together all the laws in relation to Dáil elections for the first time in one statute. That is long overdue and one wonders why it was not done before this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 47 relates to the deposit required by candidates in Dáil elections.  I was one of those who felt that the deposit should be higher than the figure quoted by the Minister because I believe that people going forward for election who are unable to get 25 per cent of the quota and who are not able to come up with £500 are not serious candidates.  I referred to that matter on Second Stage. Very often candidates put their names on the ballot paper simply to cause confusion. On Second Stage, I outlined situations <Col N="1030" /> I experienced in my time as a candidate.  They did not affect me but other people lost their seats as a result of candidates, who did not even go out to vote, putting their names on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>I accept the wisdom of the other House and I will not make a song and dance about it here.  It has been agreed by the Dáil to reduce the deposit to £300.  It is an improvement but I think the sum is rather low.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment to section 57, prior to this one could send letters by free post to every elector but not to households.  This amendment is welcome.  This caused a major problem in a previous election when a political party decided to send literature to a household rather than to individuals and the election literature was refused.  The party was saving the State money by doing it in that way.  I welcome this amendment which will mean that candidates can now circularise literature to all electors on the register for that constituency, to certain electors only, to each householder or to certain households. That is an improvement and in the long term it will mean a saving.  We are all aware of the flood of literature we get at election time; I wonder how much of an impression it makes?  Very often political parties go overboard with literature and posters but in this age of television and of national and local radio those matters are losing their impact.  In the interest of the environment we should keep postering to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 147 prohibiting canvassing in the vicinity of polling booths, I have no difficulty with increasing the distance from 50 meters to 100 meters.  The 50 meter provision may be only moving the problem down the road but the 100 metres provision will clean it up.  This practice is dying out anyway. The Minister says in the &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo; of polling stations and the Bill says the &ldquo;curtilage&rdquo; of polling stations.  What precisely are we talking about here?  Where does the polling station begin?  Is it the room where the polling booth is, is it in the building or is it the edge of the <Col N="1031" /> grounds where the polling booth is?  I would ask the Minister to clarify this point.  In rural areas where polling is held in a schoolhouse, the schoolhouse may be 50 yards from the edge of the road.  I would ask the Minister to clarify this matter so that we will leave here clear in our minds as to what precisely we are talking about.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transfer of surplus votes, I expressed very strongly my personal view that all surpluses should be distributed, particularly where that was requested by a candidate.  While there is an improvement in that section, which I welcome&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I feel very strongly that a candidate in an election should have the right to demand that all surpluses be distributed.  I recognise that there is an improvement in this section of the Bill but I regret that the Minister did not go all the way.  I am not saying all surpluses should be distributed but where a candidate requests it, the right should be there.  This has given greater flexibility to the returning officer.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to put two questions to the Minister.  It is impossible for students at this time of the year, to get home to rural areas to vote.  In the near future we should examine the possibility of holding elections on Sundays.  People from my part of the country who are attending college in Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin are deprived of the right to cast their vote because elections are held midweek.</P>
      <P>When is it envisaged that the supplementary register will be introduced? Will it be introduced for the forthcoming election?  I appeal to the Minister to have it introduced for the forthcoming election. Every individual has the right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has agreed to reduce the deposit from <Col N="1032" /> £500 to £300.  I could not help doing a quick sum here.  Off the top of my head, the value of £100 in 1921, would be equivalent to about two years wages today; I suspect that the average working wage in 1921 was about £1 a week.  That would be equivalent to about £25,000 now.  It is terrifying sum of money and suggests that our democracy had a hefty element of discrimination in favour of the property classes which we have gradully got rid of.  I would not like to see us moving too far back in that direction.  There is the anomaly here; in the election I contested there is no deposit even though every candidate is entitled to free postage to send literature to 80,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>And many candidates would be able to pay a deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Senator Naughten is valid.  The chances are that every candidate in the election I contested would be able to put up a deposit and no deposit is sought.  My poor old university has to sell the register which has 80,000 people on it for a maximum sum of 50p because of an anomaly in legislation even though the university may be severely embarrassed financially by the cost of producing this enormous register.</P>
      <P>I have to say, Chairman &mdash; and in the spirit of the day you will probably let me away with it &mdash; it is a pity this opportunity was not taken to make provision for incapacitated voters on the Seanad panel. A blind person cannot vote on a Seanad panel because there is no provision for assisted voting for people who are physically incapacitated.  It is a pity that that anomaly, which has caused inconvenience, has not been removed.  I know of one illiterate city councillor and one blind city councillor, who was in Cork city, and in both cases they had no legal way of voting in accordance with the regulations because there is no provision in the Seanad Electoral Act to help incapacitated people.  It is an anomaly that could be dealt with expeditiously and appropriately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we <Col N="1033" /> are debating this Bill today.  The most important amendment is to section 47 to reduce the deposit from £500 to £300.  As Senator Ryan pointed out, when the £100 deposit was introduced in 1923 it was a huge amount.  At that time we were evolving into a democracy and women had just got the vote.  Since people received no salary for serving in Parliament there was a clear weighting in favour of the wealthy in parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>Now we are talking about a totally different era, and for the Minister to say this amount is very reasonable considering the changes that have taken place since 1923 does not take into consideration the present financial position of would-be candidates.  Many people would stand for election but they find it difficult to pay a deposit of £300 plus expenses.  We have not had an abuse of elections by frivolous candidates going forward.  We have had single issue candidates and many of them have shown that the electorate respected and supported their right to stand on those issues by electing them to Parliament.</P>
      <P>We should not tinker with a system simply because it may not have worked out well in the adjoining jurisdiction.  I would like the Minister to adopt the procedure used in many other European countries whereby a certain number of signatures may be put forward in lieu of a deposit.  That would be a very welcome development.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see that the area outside a polling station which must be kept clear has been extended from 50 to 100 metres.  There was an unnecessary amount of intimidation and hassle outside polling stations.  Electors who had already made up their minds had to run a gauntlet of people waving papers urging them to support certain candidates. Thankfully, that will not happen in the future and I welcome that also.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the Postal and Telecommunications legislation will give us a more flexible system as regards letters going through the post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we have the opportunity to consider the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1992.  The passage of this Bill is one of the requirements necessary to allow Ireland to ratify the Treaty on European Union.  The Bill is required because certain provisions of the Treaty on European Union must be made part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, Ireland has undertaken to ratify the Treaty on European Union by the deadline envisaged in the Treaty, that is, 31 December 1992. We held our referendum on 18 June and the Treaty was endorsed by a very large majority of the Irish electorate.  The President signed the Bill into law on 16 July. Yesterday, the Bill completed its passage through the Dáil.  The Dáil also agreed a motion approving the Treaty on European Union which was required under Article 29.5 of the Constitution to allow ratification of the Treaty.  The Seanad is being asked to complete consideration of the Bill today to enable the deadline of 31 December to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other circumstances we could have enjoyed a longer and more leisurely consideration of this Bill, but I am satisfied that since the signature of the Treaty on European Union in February the major issues involved in Ireland's membership of the European Union have been <Col N="1036" /> debated frankly and intensely.  In particular, the referendum campaign in this country allowed detailed consideration of the terms of the Treaty and of Ireland's future role in the European Union.  It allowed many of the fears of the future that inevitably will be raised to be aired and addressed.  <i>The European</i> newspaper concluded that Irish people were well informed about the Treaty in a recent survey.  This is not surprising given the level and intensity of the debate during the referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>Senators may wish to have an idea where other member states of the European Community stand in relation to the completion of their respective ratification procedures.  To date, Luxembourg, Greece and Italy have completed their ratification procedures.  France is in the process of depositing its instrument of ratification with the Italian Government. Of course, Senators will know the situation in Denmark, of which I will speak later, and in the UK.  In Belgium the Treaty is being discussed in Parliament at present and formal ratification is expected shortly.  In Germany, parliamentary consideration is underway and ratification should be concluded before long.  In Spain, following a vote in the Lower House on 29 October, the Parliament will meet later this month to give formal approval to the Treaty.  In The Netherlands and Portugal parliamentary discussions are likely to continue to December.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, one of the necessary steps to allow ratification of the Treaty on European Union is passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas.  Certain provisions of the Treaty must be made part of the domestic law of the State.  The provisions are those which affect the European Community Treaties.  As Senators can see, section 1 (1) of the Bill makes provision for Titles II, III, IV and relevant parts of Title VII to be made part of the domestic law of the State. Title II contains provisions amending the Treaty establishing the EEC; Title III amends the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty; Title IV amends the <Col N="1037" /> European Atomic Energy Community Treaty.</P>
    <P>The final provisions of the Treaty on European Union are contained in Title VII.  Certain articles of this Title are provided for specifically in this Act and certain others are not.  Where the Articles provide for action under the Union and not under the Treaties establishing the European Communities, a reference in the European Communities Act is not required.</P>
    <P>Section 1(2) of the Bill provides a Table setting out the complete list of the &ldquo;treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo;. Since the passage of the European Communities Act, 1972, amending Acts have been adopted by the Oireachtas on six occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (2) of the Bill amends section 2 of the European Communities Act, 1972 and provides for &ldquo;bodies competent&rdquo; under the European Communities Treaty.  Senators will recall that the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution made provision for these &ldquo;bodies competent&rdquo;.  The reference is to &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; which will not be &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; of the Communities.  These are the European Central Bank and the European Monetary Institute.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the institutions of the European Communities are defined in the Treaties as the Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors. Prior to the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution the legislative powers of these institutions only could have legal effect in Ireland.  Following the referendum, and provided for in section 2 of this Bill, measures taken by the two bodies defined in the Treaty on European Union may have legal effect in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the situation regarding ratification in the other member states of the European Communities. I would like to refer, briefly, to the position in Denmark.  As Senators know, the Danish people voted against the Treaty by a narrow margin in a referendum on 2 June.  Last Friday, the Danish Government presented the member states with proposals for an <Col N="1038" /> arrangement which would enable it to put the question of ratification to the Danish people.  We are in the process of considering these proposals.  In our consideration we are taking the following concerns into account: our interest in seeing the Treaty on European Union ratified and in operation at the earliest possible date; our willingness to help Denmark, so long as the steps taken uphold Community achievements and do not impede the dynamics of integration, and our commitment to no opening of the text of the Treaty as has been affirmed by the European Councils of Lisbon and Birmingham.</P>
    <P>Later this month the Foreign Minister of Denmark, Mr. Uffe Elleman Jensen, will be in Dublin to discuss these proposals. It is in everyone's interest to find a solution to the problems posed by the Danish vote and I look forward to Ireland making a full and positive contribution to the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues where the attention of the Community has focused recently.  I have described the situation with regard to ratification in the member states and the current position on Denmark. There are a number of other issues, some of which were discussed at the Birmingham Summit last month, to which I would like to refer.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, the importance of stability of exchange rates for the smooth functioning of a common market became very clear during the past few months. As a small open economy, Ireland knows the cost and barriers created for all by the different currencies.  Our exporters experience acutely the problems of currency fluctuations.  It is a measure of the progress we have made in recent years that our currency has maintained a strong position in the ERM in spite of the fall in the value of sterling.  Ireland intends to be in the first group to move to full monetary union.</P>
    <P>Structural Funds play a key role in helping to bring the less developed regions of the Community up to the Community average.  The Treaty on European Union provides that these will be reviewed and that a new Cohesion Fund, <Col N="1039" /> specifically for the four least developed member states will be established.  The Commission's proposals on future financing of the Community, the Delors II package, include provisions for the doubling of funds for these cohesion countries.  We are looking forward to the Edinburgh European Council in December when decisions on the future financing of the Community will be taken.  The aim is to have the Cohesion Fund in place early in 1993.</P>
    <P>Another area being examined at present in some detail is that of openness and subsidiary.  It has become clear, since the signing of the Treaty of European Union in February, that the Community must make a grater effort to inform its citizens of the work which it does on their behalf.  For example, the Maastricht Treaty has been described as a &ldquo;user unfriendly&rdquo; document.  There is no doubt that out of context it is difficult to understand. If sufficient time and energy is spent in analysing and discussing its different provisions and implications it can be understood, but I think that in future the Community will have to make a greater effort to present its legislation more clearly.</P>
    <P>In producing the White Paper, the short guide and the other informational material provided in the run-up to the referendum in June the Government aimed to make the Treaty accessible.  We are continuing our efforts to demonstrate the benefits of the Community and of the Treaty on European Union.  There is a plethora of complex policies and programmes which are vital to Irish interests and which are familiar to only a few people.  There is a great need to encourage more people to become involved and active in the issues of fundamental interest to us such as, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Single European Market, the GATT talks, the Structural Funds and Environment Policy.</P>
    <P>Our views on subsidiarity were made clear at the Birmingham European Council. We supported the insertion of the principle in the Treaty of European Union.  Subsidiarity can be a positive <Col N="1040" /> principle which helps guide the formulation of Community legislation but we do not agree that the principle of the Treaty on subsidiarity should be implemented at the expense of the existing institutional balance.  We do not agree that subsidiarity should be a kind of code used to undermine the status of the Commission or the achievements of the Community to date.</P>
    <P>As Senators can see from the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, no provisions are made to cover Title V or Title VI of the Treaty on European Union in this legislation.  Title V concerns provisions on a common, foreign and security policy where no requirement for domestic legislation is envisaged.  Title VI concerns provisions on co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs. Legislation may be required at some stage in the future to cover some of the articles in this Title.  However, no legislation is required, nor would it be appropriate, at this stage to cover the provisions of this Title.</P>
    <P>Closer co-operation in the area of foreign policy and on justice and home affairs is an essential part of this Treaty. The Community has yet to develop to a point where foreign policy and justice and home affairs matters can be the subject of full Community decision-making. We have not reached the same level of development in these areas as has been reached in the economic and monetary field.  Nonetheless, the Treaty represents a valuable step forward.</P>
    <P>Decisions will still be taken by the member states by consensus.  Implementation will be by national action and not by directly applicable Community legislation.  Nonetheless, the new arrangements for foreign policy and justice and home affairs co-operation will allow the Twelve to act together more effectively than has been the case to date.</P>
    <P>International conditions today require a strengthening of the mechanisms through which the Community develops common approaches in the foreign policy field.  From Ireland's point of view, an active forward-looking role for the Community gives us an additional opportunity <Col N="1041" /> to promote values for which we have traditionally stood on the world stage &mdash; the rule of law, respect for human rights, support for the United Nations, disarmament and the responsibility of the international community to address the problems of poverty and underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Treaty dealing with justice and home affairs represent also a significant development.  The challenge to the Community is to devise ways and means of generating greater economic activity, removing barriers to trade and the movement of people, goods, services and capital so that the people of Europe can benefit.  We must ensure also that as we remove these checks, alternate systems to detect criminal activity are in place.  The Community must ensure that its great achievements are not exploited by the criminal elements of society.  The provisions of the Treaty on justice and home affairs allow us to do this.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one other element I would like to address today.  The Community is not a static organisation. Already a number of countries have applied to join the Community/Union. The Lisbon European Council agreed that the interested EFTA countries were in a particularly strong position, following the European Economic Area Agreement, to pursue their case.  It was agreed at Lisbon that official negotiation could begin once the Maastricht Treaty has been ratified and the Delors II package has been agreed.  We look forward to the realisation of this step with the EFTA countries with which Ireland has excellent relations.</P>
    <P>As for other possible applicants, the Treaty on European Union provides that any European state whose system of government is founded on the principle of democracy may apply to become a member.  We look forward to further enlargement when the economies of the former eastern European countries are sufficiently developed to allow for the obligations of membership.  In the meantime the Community will continue to <Col N="1042" /> develop the range of relations it has with all its European neighbours.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate in this House today.  The issues involved in this Bill are important.  Discussion in this House represents the culmination of a major national debate which, given the vital importance of the issues involved, rightly involved the people in the June referendum.  Our approach to the Community has been reinforced and enhanced by the national debate over recent months.  I am sure the discussion here today will be a further important contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister back from his travels in Australia and Somalia and to compliment him, and the President, for doing an excellent public relations job for Ireland. I would also like to thank him for coming to this House despite the busy schedule he has at the moment, given all that is happening.  I sincerely hope we will have an interesting debate here on this important issue.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the passage of this Bill is one of the requirements necessary to allow Ireland to ratify the Treaty on European Union.  We had a referendum earlier this year and the Irish electorate indicated, very strongly and enthusiastically, their ambition to be part of European Union.  The Danes, by a small majority voted against it but we should recognise that they were in an entirely different situation from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, they are net contributors to the Community budget while we are among its biggest beneficiaries. Secondly, with regard to market, they are located ideally within the Community, between the Community and Scandinavia and between the Community and eastern Europe.  There were many other reasons for their decision; they have the highest standard of living in the Community whereas we have one of the lower standards.  Failure to ratify the Treaty did not hold the same kind of threat to the Danish economy, and to their prospects of developing their economy, that it held out for Ireland.  The Irish electorate <Col N="1043" /> understood this and gave the Treaty very significant support in that referendum. I am glad the Minister cleared up the situation with regard to the member states who have ratified and are about to ratify the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister referred to the new bodies or &ldquo;bodies competent&rdquo; that must be included.  These are, primarily, the European Monetary Institute and the European Central Bank.  The European Monetary Institute will precede the Central Bank and when that happens we will undoubtedly have to bring our economic and monetary policies more into line with the rest of Europe.  We have been progressing towards that.  When the European Central Bank is in place, we will lose whatever autonomy we have, which is not very much in terms of monetary policy.  We are a country that never enjoyed much autonomy in that respect. Up to 1979, we fell into line with the British Central Bank.</P>
    <P>After we joined the EMS and the ERM, our room for significant changes in monetary policy was constricted.  I do not regret that.  When it comes to vote getting we have shown that we can be a little irresponsible as far as economic and monetary policies are concerned.  The Germans particularly have always had the good fortune of having an autonomous central bank and Holland has virtually an autonomous central bank and as a result politicians were forced to do what was economically correct rather than what was popular.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of how that has worked out for these countries versus Ireland.  I studied in Germany and Holland in 1960.  I was getting 10DM to the £ in 1960, today I would get about 2.5DM to the IR£; I was getting 8 guilders to the £, today the exchange rate is about 2.9 guilders to the IR£; I was getting 19 kroner to the £, today the rate is about 10.4 kroner to the IR£.  That is a measure of how successful their economies have been and how unsuccessful we have been because we were too closely linked to the British economic and monetary policies which have been a failure.  Since the <Col N="1044" /> Second World War, Britain has been in trouble when it came to their competitiveness, and their solution to their problems has always been to take the easy option of devaluing.  That is just a quick fix solution which leaves you in a worse situation.  Their exchange rate is down from DM10 to the £ sterling to DM2.4 to the £ and still they are unable to compete.  People need an autonomous central bank to impose the kind of discipline that, seemingly, politicians and people do not want to accept too readily.</P>
    <P>We have seen the havoc that can be caused by disturbance in the markets. Ireland was not forced to devalue but many people in Ireland are suffering, have suffered and will suffer as a result of the devaluation of the £ sterling against the IR£.  Some people working on very tight margins, who imported little or nothing from Britain and exported almost their entire production to Britain, have suffered a very serious loss of income which they will not be able to sustain.</P>
    <P>I am thinking in particular of the mushroom producers who, through their technology and their own excellent efforts, found an alternative farm enterprise which was so successful that in a short number of years, they managed to capture 35 per cent of the British market. These people import very little from Britain but they worked on tight margins. Their prices have dropped by 15, 18 and sometimes 20 per cent.  They cannot sustain that situation.  Hopefully when the markets settle the price of mushrooms will rise in Britain and these will survive as they deserve because they have been an example to all of us.  They were caught in a situation which was not of their making.  This is a classical example of what monetary instability can do for industry.</P>
    <P>However, there are many other reasons we need a single currency and a single bank.  We are paying interest rates which are far too high.  Our interest rates are high to defend our punt.  Our inflation rate is lower than that of Germany but our interest rates are much higher.  That is happening because we have to keep the <Col N="1045" /> punt in the country by paying premium interest rates.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are crippling industry. They are also weighing heavily on mortgage holders.  Sadly, listening to this morning's news, I heard of one person in Sligo, whose house is being repossessed, who committed suicide yesterday.  There are orders going out from finance houses to repossess homes and that is very regrettable.  Something must be done to delay the repossession orders and to help these people who have been caught by this surge in interest rates due to monetary instability.</P>
    <P>Working in different currencies adds a huge cost on industry.  The cost of currency exchange is frightening.  Of course, the banks do not want a single currency because they would lose all that income. I have quoted a case before of an exercise which a colleague of mine, who was in the European Parliament when I was there, did.  He went to his local bank manager, changed his money from sterling into the other 11 currencies and back into sterling. He got back 46 per cent of what he started out with having achieved nothing except keeping the bank manager happy. That practice is detrimental to industry.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects too, like the risk factors, which deter industry from investing and expanding.  There are the administrative costs of working in different currencies.  There are many more problems associated with it and we must find a way of getting over this instability, and of getting a single currency, whether that will happen in this century I am not sure, because of what happened recently. Because of the devastating effects of monetary instability, governments may decide to introduce a single currency as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We cannot avoid the fact that when there is a single currency we will have to bring the economic and monetary policies of the 12 member states more closely into line.  Otherwise, the strains, stresses and hardships will be too much to bear, particularly in the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned economic and monetary union and cohesion.  The Cohesion Fund is a non starter if the <Col N="1046" /> Union is not ratified by all member states. In that respect, I am particularly happy to see the Minister is willing to help the Danes and, as far as possible, solve their problem.  They are a great people and it would be a pity for Denmark and for the community as a whole if they are unable to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>Our nearest neighbour, too, has a problem.  They always had a problem accepting that they were part of the European Community.  They never really got over the shock of losing an empire.  As Dean Acheson said, they lost an empire and have not yet found a role.  Claud Cockburn I think, put it more aptly, when he said Britain is now too small for its shoes.  It is time they gave up the big boots and realised they need smaller shoes to play a smaller role in what is going to be a very important economic bloc on the world stage.  Britain can play if they get it into their heads that they can no longer go alone, if they pull together, ratify the Treaty as soon as possible, try to fall into line with the more successful economies and adopt the policies of the more successful economies in the Community.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister referred to openness and subsidiarity.  This word appears again and again.  It means different things to different people but one thing is clear, there is a need throughout the Community to have a better understanding of how the Commission functions. There is also a need for the Commission to cease making fools of themselves at times.  We now have a serious proposal from the Commission. At a time when we are getting rid of passports in the Community, they are now suggesting passports for cows.  They suggested that every field in the Community be numbered and that a geostatic satellite overhead watch what we do and what crops we plant.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of nonsense that ridicules the Community &mdash; regulations about the size of a tomato or the Euro sausage or more recently the suggested banning of a chemical that is added to feedstuffs, particularly for flamingos which they need to retain their natural pink <Col N="1047" /> colour.  The list is endless.  EC civil servants must be thinking of the weirdest and daftest schemes and they will cause the Community to be held up to ridicule, scorn and question.  We must get away from that as the Minister said to a more open and transparent kind of Community.</P>
    <P>The document produced in relation to the Maastricht Treaty was user unfriendly; that is the mildest possible expression I could use.  I do not know anybody who read it carefully except for those adamantly opposed to any form of union and those adamantly in favour of one.  Everybody else gave up after about Chapter II, including many Members of the House of Commons who admitted openly that they had never read it.  It was exceedingly difficult to read.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the British Government said that they had not read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there must be some way of phrasing the contents of that document so that it may be understood without one's having to work exceedingly hard at it.  The Minister also made reference to our fundamental interests under the Common Agricultural Policy, the Single European Market, the GATT talks, the Structural Funds and the environment policy and I am concerned about where the Common Agricultural Policy might be going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture and fisheries are our only natural resources and they were very undeveloped when we joined the Community. They developed reasonably well for a period after joining and then suddenly quotas were slapped on us and we have been frozen since in a developmental state significantly lower than that of richer member states.  In the same breath the people who have condoned this are talking about cohesion and the levelling up of standards.  How can we attain higher levels if our two most important natural resources are frozen at an inferior stage of development?  It is impossible and no amount of Structural <Col N="1048" /> or Cohesion Funds will compensate us for the disadvantage.</P>
    <P>We have 16 per cent of the Community waters but about 3 per cent of the fishing quota only.  We have a milk quota equal roughly to one-eighth per hectare of what the Dutch have.  Prior to the imposition of quotas, we had a comparative advantage in European milk production.  How can that be classified as fair?</P>
    <P>The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy punished Ireland more severely than any other EC country because it imposed punitive restrictions on our two main products, beef and milk. That was wrong and it is hypocritical of Community leaders to talk about cohesion and reducing differences while at the same time preventing us from providing what we can.  I feel sad that farmers who could produce a good living if given a chance are going to be dependent on a cheque in the post, on compensatory payments.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Walsh, who improved the deal we were getting out of all recognition but it is still in the form of a cheque in the post that depends ultimately on the willingness of Community taxpayers to continue contributing. I do not see that lasting.  Community taxpayers will begin to ask whether that money would not be better spent on health, housing or education but above all on job creation.</P>
    <P>Millions of people in the EC have lost jobs in steel, car manufacture, ship building and other industries for the same reasons as farmers, namely, new technology, increased imports and changing market requirements, but they received more than normal redundancy payments or whatever was worked out and no subsequent payment other than unemployment assistance.  They will inevitably ask why farmers should be better treated than all other workers.  Taxpayers are willing to make certain sacrifices so long as farmers remain on the land and do not swell the numbers of unemployed in cities and towns.  This measure will not succeed in doing that.  It may slow the farmer exodus but it will not prevent it and when Community taxpayers learn that they will <Col N="1049" /> quickly object.  Politicians will reply, &ldquo;I am sorry.  We made the agreement but&rdquo;. While all this is going on, wealthier countries, such as Germany, are paying their farmers and helping them in all sorts of ways that would be construed as a renationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Single European Market, there is much to be gained by industries that can survive.  This morning it was announced that Adidas in Cork will be closing because of the Single Market.  For industries capable of surviving and who are really competitive the advantages of the Single Market are huge but they must begin to prepare for it and those who had not begun some time ago have probably missed the boat.</P>
    <P>With regard to the GATT talks it seems we are damned if they fail and we are damned if they do not fail.  On balance, it is more important that they succeed but the outcome is likely to pose a serious problem for us.  Our exports of agricultural products, particularly milk and beef products, are heavily dependent on export refunds and Third World markets and if there are cut backs, our processing industries will be in serious trouble with consequences for farmers, employment and the general economy. Other industries will also be affected, such as the textile industry which employs about 22,000 people.  If there is free access to the Community for materials from low cost, cheap labour countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, etc., our textile industry could be in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Structural Funds are very welcome and I hope the renewed Structural Funds will be significantly greater than the funds running out in 1993.  Not for one moment, however, during the Maastricht Treaty debate where I advocated ratification did I believe or say that we would get a doubling of £6 million.  Whatever chance we might have had of achieving that has been blown by events in Germany and particularly by the cost of German reunification. I doubt if there is any prospect now of a doubling but I wish the Minister luck in trying to get as much of an <Col N="1050" /> increase as possible.  We will, of course, have the Cohesion Fund, although the size of that has not been determined.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of closer co-operation on foreign policy and on justice.  The Community has developed into an economic giant but it is still a political mouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <P>It could have exerted substantial influence on peace keeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia as well as elsewhere.  Its influence on peace keeping has been insignificant.  If we had had a common peace policy Germany might not have stepped in so quickly urging recognition or Croatia and Slovenia and fewer problems might have resulted.</P>
      <P>On our eastern flank we face serious and dangerous situations and not only in former Yugoslavia.  Some republics in the former Soviet Union are in danger of civil war between ethnic groups and these parts of the world hold large supplies of nuclear missiles.  A conflagration originating there could result in a serious world situation.  Europe stands looking at the scene, impotent, whereas if we could agree on a common stance we might exert some influence there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the removal of barriers to trade and the free movement of goods, services and capital. That certainly has advantages but there is a down side to everything and one that I have been conscious of for some time is drug smuggling.  Once you do away with systematic border checking we must seal the perimeter to keep out drugs. How do you seal the coast of south Cork and Kerry with our resources given all the inlets there where small boats might land goods which can then be transported unhindered throughout the Community? The State Solicitor in Cork said that there has been a considerable increase in drug trafficking there and recently one of our new residents in Kerry was arrested as a drugs baron in Holland.  This is a serious problem and will have to be faced.  The most effective way to do so is to get EC help for aerial surveillance, boat patrols <Col N="1051" /> and other measures because we do not have the resources necessary to patrol our most difficult coastline.  It is in the interest of all EC countries to prevent drugs arriving illegally in Ireland and I suggest that this matter be taken up again in the strongest possible way with our European partners.</P>
    <P>No reference was made to an institution of which I was a member for some time, namely, the European Parliament, nor to the democratic deficit.  People in Europe want increased democracy and more transparency in decision making. The Council of Ministers should reveal how decisions are arrived at.  People become suspicious when facts are concealed; when they are revealed people quickly lose interest.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I was at a European Parliament Committee meeting where Dr. Lester Crawford of the Food and Drug Administration of the United States gave evidence on a hearing on the hormone issue.  He was asked what confidence US citizens had in the FDA and he said that the most recent opinion poll in 1988, had shown 70 per cent confidence in the FDA.  If one conducted a survey in the European Community what confidence would people register in, say, the health protection mechanisms or regulations of the Departments of Agriculture or Health?  We saw what happened in Britain when the Junior Health Minister there said that every egg in Britain had salmonella.  The Minister for Agriculture, Mr. McGregor, denied this but people in the street were more inclined to believe the Minister for Health and the egg industry was decimated not only in Britain but in Ireland also.  People have no confidence in such statements.</P>
    <P>Dr. Crawford was asked why there was such confidence in the US FDA but not in the Community about Commission regulations and regulatory authorities in member states and he was taken aback by the question.  When he had thought about it he said that was probably on account of US openness where anybody can walk in off the street to the FDA, go <Col N="1052" /> through the files, photocopy material in relation to approval of a drug or other substance and walk out again.  He thought that that was probably the main reason for confidence.  Anybody could examine their methods, results and recommendations and no attempt was made to hide what they were doing.  He said that people showed little interest when procedures were open.  Europe should introduce greater openness and transparency.  In relation to the democratic deficit the European Parliament will have a large part to play in future in persuading people that they have a say in matters.  I hope that Ireland will see it that way.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the briefing MEP's received &mdash; and this occurred under two Governments &mdash; was deplorably bad.  It was not too serious before the Single European Act but after that, when we acquired powers to influence legislation through amendments to Community directives, we still received the same inadequate briefing on the day of the vote in Parliament but by then it was too late.  We needed briefing during the First Reading, on Committee Stage and certainly on Second Stage; to receive briefing when the Parliament was about to vote was closing the door after the horse had bolted.  The work was finished then and parliamentarians at that stage were not going to amend anything &mdash; or only very rarely.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the enlargement of the Community to include countries in Eastern Europe which I favour.  Enlargement has to have the approval of a majority in the European Parliament which is another reason that Parliament will play a more important part in future.  I remind the Minister that some Eastern European countries are going to present serious problems for us in the area of agriculture.  East Germany, Poland and, possibly, the Ukraine are making noises about applying and if included we will have another kind of headache to contend with in terms of supply and competition.  These countries in certain products, have competitive <Col N="1053" /> advantages over us that will create problems if they join.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless I favour making the Community as open as possible and in the meantime welcoming the EFTA countries who will be net contributors to the budget, who are paying to get into the European economic arena and who will help to bring up the general standard of the economies of the European Community. After that we will have to tread warily and make the Community more united and firmly established before we take on more members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House and to congratulate him on the excellent work he has been doing here and internationally. In this country the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; after the Taoiseach and possibly the Minister for Finance &mdash; is the most crucial Minister and as matters progress and develop in Europe, Foreign Affairs becomes one of the most crucial posts in the Irish Government.  This is especially true at the moment when crucial decisions are necessary on Maastricht and on the North of Ireland.  It is an extremely important and responsible position.</P>
      <P>The matters we are considering in the Community are vital to this country.  We are entering an open economy of 300 million people.  One of the major implications of this &mdash; and the Minister has played a major role here &mdash; is the increased openness of Irish society.  Not only has the Irish economy been transformed but society has been transformed for the better.  Change brings good and bad, but I hope for better and greater exposure to the wider European world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is the culmination of a debate that took place here and among the Irish public.  Most people have taken a close interest in Maastricht and in European Community developments. It is appropriate that there should be informed and detailed discussion and that ratification should be a democratic decision.  We have accepted it overwhelmingly in both Houses and we hope <Col N="1054" /> for a large majority among the people. That is right because democracy is an integral part of the EC and a requirement for membership of the Community.  It is right and proper that we have had a series of debates and a referendum in which we have clearly and unambiguously made up our minds in favour of the further development of the Community.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that we do not respect the Danish view.  Our democratic outlook enables us to respect the Danish people's right to make their views and reservations known.  As a small country we understand some of their reservations as regards sovereignty and various other matters.  Their historical background is that of a nation situated beside a major power growing stronger day by day.</P>
    <P>In coming to some agreement with the Danes, our Minister in meetings with his Danish counterpart may be able to help advance the clear wishes of the Danish Government and people.  There is no antagonism there towards the EC but there is concern about some aspects of the Maastricht Treaty as presented and other relevant matters.  It is going to be important for our Minister and the Danish Minister to find a mechanism which will enable the Maastricht Treaty to proceed.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of deep emotions involved, as we have seen in the UK; there is an almost schizophrenic attitude there in that many people there are probably opposed to European ideals.  They feel emotionally antagonistic to the idea of coming closer to the French or Germans while, at the same time, acknowledging the crucial importance of the United Kingdom economy with all its drawbacks staying in the EC.  They would admit also that it is essential to continue building closer associations with other aspects of Europe if they are not to become marginalised and peripheral to Europe.</P>
    <P>The British vote last night was very close and it may turn out to be a crucial turning point in the United Kingdom Government's attitude.  Regarding the German attitude to Maastricht, there has been much criticism of the European Bundesbank <Col N="1055" /> but it is doing what it thinks best for the German monetary and financial situation as it is obliged to do.  It was set up by law as an independent institution and has to act accordingly and responsibly. It was Government interference there that caused many of our present problems with their insistence that the virtually valueless Ostmark should be valued at the same level as the Deutschemark.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that the origin of the Common Market was not economic only as regards Germany or France.  It aspired towards political union and towards a universal ideal of future peace in Europe. That was the basis of it and the steel and coal industries were an initial <i>modus operandi</i>, a way of working together that gradually expanded into the full-blown European Community of today.  Let us not think of it purely in economic terms; there is much more to it than that.  We can sympathise with the basic ideals of Adenauer and others who founded the European Community.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the EC that I do not like.  Bureaucratic inanities have been mentioned.  I do not approve of the removal of the green passport &mdash; it is only a small thing but it would have been more tactful to allow us to keep our national passports, but adding some emblem to indicate that we are also European citizens. We have not given up our Irish citizenship, nor do we intend to.  There is no need to.  There has been unnecessary, unfeeling remoteness and interference by bureaucrats in Brussels who have not been answerable as they would be here, in Germany or elsewhere.  If nothing else, the Danes have done us a great service. They have shaken up that bureaucratic &ldquo;take us all for granted&rdquo; attitude.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy also with the topical subject of subsidiarity.  Not even Mr. Delors seems to be able to define it.  Our British colleagues seem to be trying to use it to escape from inevitable developments in the Community, or to pretend to be escaping from those developments.  The original idea was that as far as possible regional institutions and authorities <Col N="1056" /> should carry out functions and that is something which I support.  I would not like to see it used by countries trying to evade the Treaty obligations of Maastricht.</P>
    <P>In this country we need to be particularly concerned about the role of the European Commissioners.  We can criticise them on many counts but they offer <i>de facto</i> protection for smaller countries. I am not saying that we do not have our feet under the table at the Council of Ministers, but the Commission is very important in that it acts for the Community as a whole rather than for one or two powerful nations in the Community. Thus, it is more likely to benefit this country.</P>
    <P>Although I support the development of the European Parliament, I have some reservations about it.  We have excellent representatives there but the reality is that we will be a tiny minority in that Parliament, and even our tiny minority will be inevitably fissured.  The idea of the various parties here and in other countries joining together on vaguely similar ideological lines, or even sometimes totally different ideological lines, is artificial and does not necessarily relate to the situation on the ground.  Although I favour the European Parliament becoming more meaningful, we cannot reasonably expect to play a big role there when the Parliament, to a considerable degree, represents populations.  We have a tiny population compared to other member states.</P>
    <P>One cannot comment on this Bill without making some reference to the EMS and the European Monetary Union. These days the Lombard rate, the discount rate and the Bundesbank are becoming just as important to us as the LIBOR or whatever.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have had the financial strength to weather the extraordinary foreign exchange variations of the last few months is a great tribute to the development of our financial institutions and our economy.  Nonetheless we are in a precarious position where we are in between having a currency over which we have control to some extent &mdash;<Col N="1057" /> although less than we imagined &mdash; and having a common currency.  From the point of view of this country, the sooner we have a common currency the better, otherwise there will always be a risk of considerable financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>We have certain economic strengths and let us not forget them.  We are in a huge market and must be competitive, but we have succeeded in some ways &mdash; some are slightly artificial but nonetheless they represent success.  We are one of the few countries that has an export surplus with Germany.  We have considerable resources and our greatest natural resource is our people.  They are extremely adaptable, able and can compete in most circumstances in which they find themselves.  There are additional things which one would like to see but, given a level playing field, we can give a good account of ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have other natural resources.  I rarely refer in this House to personal areas in which I have some slight involvement or knowledge but I agree with the last speaker's remarks about agriculture and fisheries.  However, in relation to agriculture I would put more emphasis on the product rather than the producer. That is not to say that I do not have the greatest sympathy with the initial producers, the farmers, but from the point of view of a strong economy, it is the use we make of that produce, the added value, the sale of agricultural products rather than the &ldquo;raw beef on the hoof&rdquo; attitude, which admittedly has changed, that matters. In terms of our economy, we are not focused on the food business.  We still think in terms of agriculture, full stop, rather than agri-business which we should emphasise more.</P>
    <P>When the Channel Tunnel opens we will be the only island nation in the EC. Yet, we have no merchant navy.  We have a very brave, valiant but very small fishing fleet.  I have many friends in Norway and they just cannot understand that. It is an area which we need to look at seriously.  This Government appointed a Minister for the Marine, an area we need to develop.  It is a cultural as well as an economic matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> I will make one short reference to another natural resource in which I have some slight involvement and about which I sometimes think there is little understanding here, even in the highest financial circles, and that is, our mineral resources.  We have at present one of the largest zinc mines in the world.  Zinc is one of the essential metals for economic development used to a huge extent in the car industry and the construction industry but it has many other uses.  We have the fifth largest mine in the world which is already in operation and certain other mines are in course of planning and, hopefully, will come into operation in the mid-nineties.  At that stage we will be supplying between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the western European zinc market.  There is no other commodity in which we come remotely near that in percentage figure.</P>
    <P>In the world commodity ratings there are only two commodities in which we rank in the top ten.  If you ask higher civil servants, business people or politicians and others what those two commodities are, you will nearly always be given one correct reply and that is dairy products. I am one of those who believe the anti-milk products compaigns have been overdone. We are very lucky to have good quality butter and milk.  They are much better for your health than substitutes. Nonetheless to be in the top ten for dairy products, from an economic or financial point of view one, is not one of the best areas to be in at present.</P>
    <P>The other commodity in which we rank in the top ten is zinc.  Those are the only two commodities in which we rank in the top ten, and that is relying on one mine but the likelihood is that we will have a number of other significant world class mines.</P>
    <P>This is probably my last speech in this Seanad.  I hope it is not my last speech in any Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The talk about Europe is becoming extraordinarily peculiar.  I have a vision of Europe.  I am delighted I am part of Europe rather than part of some of the far less diverse and mixed cultures in the world.  The richness of European culture is its diversity of language, cuisine, history, religion and so on.  It has many things to be proud of and many things not to be proud of.  Colonial history is not something to be proud of but there are many things about Europe, such as the development of the welfare state and the European vision of the market economy that are altogether more humane and people-oriented than what operates in North America.  Those are European ideas that, in spite of the best efforts of those who lead our country, we have actually acquired in this country.</P>
      <P>The basis for any coming together of the peoples of Europe which is the phrase in the Treaty of Rome &mdash; the ever closer union of the peoples of Europe &mdash; must be based firmly on the enthusiastic consent of the people.  The problem that is developing in Europe is the degree to which devices and tactics are being resorted to in order to rescue the semicoerced agreement of the people for the enthusiastic acceptance of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will never forget the phrase the President <Col N="1060" /> of the European Commission used during the French referendum, when he said that those who opposed Maastricht were the devil's disciples who should either leave politics or change their opinions.  I do not think a man who even once resorts to that sort of language has my vision of democracy as his bedrock.  I resent it very deeply.  As one who opposed Maastricht, I have no intention of changing my opinions and, trusting to the good judgment of the intellectuals of the National University of Ireland.  I have no intention of leaving politics.  I find that sort of language by a European bureaucrat profoundly offensive.</P>
    <P>I was out of the country during the great currency upheaval and during the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  I was in Spain.  My Spanish is limited but functional and reading Spanish newspapers the vision of Irish influence that is talked about so much here was very hard to find since in terms of all their discussions about European affairs I found two lines in one Spanish newspaper over a period of five days which even mentioned this member state.  Every other member state, in particular Denmark, was referred to; whether we have lost any European individual identity or whether we are so insignificant I do not know, but in all the discussions about European concepts and Europe's future at the time in Spanish newspapers and on Spanish television, Ireland and the idea of some sort of common interest between the peripheral and under-developed regions was missing, to say the least.  That is where the question of the democratic deficit comes in.</P>
    <P>Let us get sorted out.  You cannot have half-way democracy.  Either you have democracy or you have not.  Democracy means that the power comes from the people and other people are allowed exercise it on their behalf under controlled conditions.  Anything else is not democracy.  For instance when there is talk about letting people, to use Senator Raftery's phrase, feel they have a say in the development of Europe, that is not democracy.  That is tyranny making a concession, the sort of thing that the <Col N="1061" /> Saudi royal family are thinking of allowing in Saudi Arabia.  They are going to allow the Saudi people to have a say.</P>
    <P>What we need to sort out in any future Europe is the very clear fact that it is the people of Europe who run Europe and that everybody else, Council of Ministers, Commission and bureaucrats, take their power from the people.  They do not gradually and slowly share a little bit of the power they have in these institutions with the people.  They fundamentally get rid of any idea that power in Europe comes from anything else other than the people of Europe.  That means a total restructuring of the institutions so that most decisions about difficult issues are not made in secret at Council of Ministers meetings, that most preparations for decisions are not made in secret at European Commission meetings. If we in this Parliament were to operate on the principle of how decisions are reached in the institutions of the European Community, in the Commission and the Council of Ministers, we would do most of our debating in secret and would not allow people hear us disagree. We would not allow people to know our position papers nor would we have healthy debate.  At that level Europe is inherently anti-democratic because it is secret.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental conflict between secrecy and democracy.  There are some things that need to be done in secret for security and other reasons but until the institutions of the European Community become democratic in their spirit, operation and ways of expressing themselves and until it is quite clear that they only continue with the will of the people and not by pressure, threat or institutional devices, you will never have a sense of Europe in the European Community.</P>
    <P>One of the classic areas where the European elite have led us up the garden path of anti-democracy is in the'eulogy for an independent central bank.  I find the gradually increasing idea that somehow politicians and Governments cannot be trusted with currency profoundly anti-democratic. Where does it end?  If the <Col N="1062" /> currency must be protected from the politicians, what comes next &mdash; the Army, law and order, industrial policy?  Why should the whole area of protecting the currency be separated from democratic accountability?  Who said it is any better? Who said the principles Europe has established in recent years to which we are adhering at enormous pain are necessarily the best way to run an economy?</P>
    <P>Let us remember what has happened in the European Community.  Over the 20 years we have been a member of the European Community unemployment has exploded all over Europe and, in fact, has increased more in other countries in Europe proportionately than it increased here.  Is it not time somebody looked at the bedrock of European economic policy?  It should have been debated during the debate on the Maastricht Treaty and it was not.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and I say this not as a matter of recrimination but as a matter of record, the conduct of the referendum in this country was a disgrace &mdash; there was bullying by, among other people, the European Commission about the consequences, threats about a rapid escalation in interest rates if we did not vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; were widespread, threats of the loss of large amounts of money were also widespread.  I am intrigued incidentally, as a kind of a worthwhile aside, that on the one hand virtually everybody in Government told us about the benefits that would come from the European Structural Funds while, at the same time, the economist the Government appointed to the Culliton Commission is one of the most outspoken critics of the whole idea of Structural Funds and thinks they are a bad thing.  The Culliton report, authored, presumably, with the man's economic wisdom, is supposed to be the new bible for development but the same economist who was the author of the Culliton report's economic provisions has scotched the whole idea in writing.  He said that all Structural Funds do is encourage public expenditure and that, to his mind, is a bad thing.  I would counsel those who are latching on to the Culliton <Col N="1063" /> report to be very careful about its economics.  They are written by an economist who, in my view, is to say the least slightly eccentric.  The fact that he is opposed to European Structural Funds is a fair indication of his degree of eccentricity.</P>

      <P>I wish to talk very briefly about the conduct of the referendum.  It was not a model of a democratic exercise.  It was a situation in which we were free to dissent. I almost got the impression from certain remarks by the Taoiseach during the referendum campaign that we should be grateful for the fact that we were allowed to dissent, as if this were a concession, but in every other way the freedom to dissent was not reflected in any institutional balance.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the news on RTÉ which carried, like a propaganda beacon one day one headline on every news programme, which was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had repeated that no economic alternative had been offered to the Maastricht Treaty.  I did not think that was much of a news story since he had been saying it for about six months at that stage but RTÉ decided that was the main news.  I rang up and said I would offer an economic alternative and I got two and a half minutes on the 1 o'clock news to deal with the economic alternatives to Maastricht.  I do not know what anybody else thinks but I do not regard that as democracy.  I do not regard it as the way to inform people or educate them but it is most assuredly not a debate about economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have to put on record the distaste of many people at the hijacking of the airwaves by the Taoiseach on the night before the referendum when he used <Col N="1064" /> power that should have been used for emergencies to foist his opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am extraordinarily consistent, that is my problem.  I cannot duck issues because they make life inconvenient.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the problem about time, but without being disrespectful, it was not I who used all the time.  The Minister's speech on Denmark, as much of the reporting in this country on Denmark, has been somewhat disingenuous.  The present position, as the last opinion poll suggested, is that close to 60 per cent of the Danish people would now vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; if the Maastricht Treaty were put to them again.  What the Danish Parliament has agreed to is a view on Maastricht which effectively says &ldquo;no Maastricht&rdquo; because they said there would be no common defence, no common citizenship and no common currency.</P>
      <P>I applaud the decisions of the people of Denmark.  Their economy did not go down the tubes, their interest rates did not go through the roof, and there has not been a massive increase in unemployment, which was predicted by the same threatening European bureaucracy I referred to.  Since Denmark will not ratify the Maastricht Treaty, the whole process is a charade because the Maastricht Treaty will never come into force in its present form.  We will either have another referendum or it will never come into force because we cannot reconcile the irreconcilable.</P>

Everybody knows my strong views on being a European but I would put down a marker that we should still hold on to all that is national.

    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> I am a European; I want to put on the record of the House that I want our country to be part of Europe.  It is well known that I did not vote for the Maastricht Treaty and there were many people who did the same.  However, Ireland is the one State that voted overwhelmingly for the Treaty.  I would like to have time to deal with the reasons, some of which were given by Senator Raftery and the Minister in his contribution earlier today. Ireland voted for the Maastricht Treaty whereas Denmark did not.  We saw last night in the British Parliament that there would not have been a majority if the people had a free vote.</P>
    <P>One aspect that went through all the speeches here today was that there must be more openness.  I want to see greater democracy.  It was said that Denmark did us a favour.  Of course they did but why were we not prepared to do it?  I believe we voted for Maastricht because of the economic benefits but I do not believe that is what Europe really means.  The Europe that we should be looking for today is one with a better quality of life and offering peace among nations.  We should not be going to Europe with a begging bowl.  Let us hope we have heard the last of this.  Let us play our part and make a contribution to a better quality of life in Europe and to peace among nations.</P>

They have been very helpful, extremely cooperative and, in the best tradition of the Civil Service, they have helped whoever was Minister, and that is as it should be. They were just and fair.</P>

      <Col N="1069" /> Senator Conroy's contribution was as usual incisive and analytical.  He has wide experience in a number of areas.  His comments were well made and well taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery served in Europe for a long number of years and his knowledge of the European scene is extensive.  His remarks were also much appreciated, well made and well taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has his own agenda and it is part of democracy that people are entitled to the views they express.  It would not be proper for me to suggest that Senator Ryan was out of order. Quite the contrary, if they are his views, so be it although I do not agree with them.  However that does not for one moment suggest that he is not entitled to make them.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald is a long serving Member of the Oireachtas.  I have known and respected him over the years.  His short intervention was succinct and to the point.  I am grateful to Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <P>The Irish people gave politicians a mandate to ratify the Treaty of European Union.  The Government have taken all the necessary steps to allow the State to ratify the Treaty of European Union but more steps remain to be taken.  It is fair to say that all that remains to be done in respect of the Bill is to put it through the Committee and Final Stages.  The Bill will then be sent to her Excellency, the President of Ireland, in due course. Again my gratitude for the helpful contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch as ucht an deis seo a bheith agam labhairt sa Seanad ar an ócáid deireanach agus mé i mo bhall den Dáil seo.  Tá súil agam a bheith ar ais go minic san chéad Dáil eile ag labhairt anseo mar Aire Rialtais.</P>
      <P>I am going to break all conventional debating ground rules by starting with a string of negatives.  First I am not anti-Aer Lingus.  I fly no other airline where possible, I do so preferably from Shannon.  Fianna Fáil founded Aer Lingus.  Fianna Fáil sustained Aer Lingus.  These are my roots.  I will always be true to them.  Second, I am not anti-Aer Lingus employees.  For me employees are the company.  That is why I always travel Aer Lingus.  That is why most people travel Aer Lingus.  We must build on that strength.  Third, I did not advocate massive redundancies.  I did the opposite.  I told the board I want maximum employment compatible with a viable company.  I also told the board that employment in Ireland is my first priority.</P>
      <P>Fourth, I do not want to downsize Aer Lingus to an Aer Aran operation, and I told the board so.  I told them to avail of new opportunities I have negotiated for them.  I have consistently advocated joint ventures and marketing alliances.  Fifth, I did not maintain the Shannon stop to damage Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus Central Representative Council, representing all Aer Lingus employees, the majority of them in Dublin, formally asked me to maintain the stop.  So did SIPTU and ICTU.</P>
      <P>Sixth, I am not forcing Aer Lingus to keep fares low for tourism purposes.  On the contrary, I have spent months pleading with them to put up their fares.  I want competitive fares, but I want more.  I want sustainable services.  Fares on Dublin/London are suicidal.  I have spent months trying to get sanity into the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> Finally, I am not ideologically opposed to equity investment in State bodies.  I am not the Minister responsible for such investment, that is the Minister for Finance.  He has said the Exchequer currently has no money.  If the Exchequer had money I would advocate investment in Aer Lingus provided it made commercial sense.  All parties in the Oireachtas accept this proviso, so do most sensible trade union leaders.  I also have an open mind on outside equity in the company if that would help it.</P>
    <P>I feel honour bound to stitch these facts into the record of the Oireachtas to counter the inaccurate leaks to media and to Aer Lingus employees.  These malicious leaks are not only damaging the company they are also causing unnecessary anguish to employees of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate what I said in the Dáil. The company has problems but there are solutions.  We will find them with the cooperation of Aer Lingus employees and the social partners.</P>
    <P>Let us first not just look at the company's problems in an honest and open way but also keep them in perspective. Aer Lingus has financial difficulties.  It has lost around £40 million on its air transport operations in each of the last two years and faces further losses of around £40 million in the current year. However, let us remember it is incurring these losses in a period of major recession.  In the past, Aer Lingus has been able to absorb losses on its air transport operations with profits from ancillary activities.  However, these have also been hard hit by recession and certain remedial action is called for there.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Aer Lingus is facing major changes in the international marketplace.  Aer Lingus is facing intense competition both on its transatlantic services, from indirect services over London, and on all European routes.  The Single Market conditions to apply in the EC From 1 January next will intensify competition further but it will also open <Col N="1072" /> new opportunities which Aer Lingus can and must avail of.</P>
    <P>These problems are real but soluble provided action is taken now.  I am satisfied that the board and management of Aer Lingus now recognise the scale of the task facing them.  The board have promised me that towards the end of this month they will submit specific plans to deal with the situation.  I will assess these and place them before Government.</P>
    <P>The board and I accept that Aer Lingus' services must be profitable and its fares competitive, if the long term survival of the airline is to be assured. A viable and developmental Aer Lingus will need to urgently address costs and prices.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus need to take action to ensure that its costs are at least as good as, if not better than best industry practice. All costs must be critically examined and ways and means found of reducing them where necessary.  If costs are not tackled, the consequences will be severe in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Most commentators accept this.  For example Deputy Garret FitzGerald, a well known supporter and a former employee of Aer Lingus, in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday expressed particular concern about the level of increase in unit costs of maintenance, overhaul, passenger service and general overheads in recent years.  Reducing costs in these areas needs to be addressed vigorously as a matter of urgency.  I accept that not all Aer Lingus costs are within the airline's control.  However, those which are must be tackled.</P>
    <P>While costs are important, so too are prices charged or yields.  Aer Lingus' long term interests are best served not only by competitive fares but also by economically sustainable fares which will provide the necessary resources for the long term development of the airline.</P>
    <P>I have, for some time, been very concerned about the low level of fares charged by both Aer Lingus and Ryanair on the Dublin/London routes.  You should all know my views that these fares are suicidal in the long term.  I have, therefore, been calling for an increase in <Col N="1073" /> the lowest fares charged by both airlines. Aer Lingus is the predominant carrier on the Dublin/London routes.  It has been given much greater freedom in its pricing policy on these routes in recent years.  If Aer Lingus will not or cannot increase its income by higher fares as well as cutting costs, it must cut the level of its operations.</P>
    <P>I hold these views strongly.  However, I have not imposed them on Aer Lingus. There is a board in place to run the company. I have emphasised to the board that I want to see Aer Lingus retain the maximum employment possible consistent with commercial viability.  This has been read in some quarters as placing Aer Lingus in an impossible position.  On the one hand, it is forced to keep current employment levels while it is also expected to produce a profit.  Let me clarify my position.  I want to see all solutions examined and costed.  The board can best judge its employment needs and how to meet them.  However, I do not want Aer Lingus, as a first resort, laying-off staff to cut costs if there are other solutions.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by a leading trade union official, who should know better, that my policy is to downsize the airline, not true, simply not true.  I hold the contrary view and told the Aer Lingus board so.  I want a strong and vibrant Aer Lingus expanding into new markets.  It has shown itself capable of doing so in the past.  It can do so in future by being once again better than its competitors in the marketplace.  This is the only way to long term survival.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that in the short term the airline may have to reduce frequencies on some services and cut out a number of its uneconomic services. However, I made it clear to the board that this is not to be the start of a general winding down of the airline.  I specifically told them that the US experience of deregulation shows that downsizing the airline is not the solution.  Let me reiterate my conviction that Aer Lingus can have a strong future if the right decisions are taken now in relation to improving competitiveness for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> I would now like to address the thorny issue of equity.  In a recent debate on Aer Lingus in Dáil Éireann, Deputies from all sides of the House agreed that there may be a case for funding provided there is a credible business plan for the company showing profit into the future.  That proviso is very important.  It must make commercial sense.  Money is not free; equity cannot be either.  We must get a return on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has already made clear on several occasions that the position of the Exchequer finances is such that the Government are not currently in a position to invest additional equity in semi-State companies, including Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It was against that background that the Taoiseach spoke about Aer Lingus engaging in joint ventures or strategic alliances where future expansion of Aer Lingus might be funded in ways other than direct State equity.  I expect the board to come up with its own views on this matter in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to set on the record as I did in Dáil Éireann, what the Government's air transport policy is.  I want to do so to nail the lie that we do not have such a policy.  We have an air transport policy which has been developed against the background of trends in the world economy in general and in world aviation in particular.  As with all Government policies for other sectors, our primary objective for our aviation industry is job creation.  We must be competitive in international markets if we are to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>Our approach to air transport policy is, and has been, based on this philosophy to prepare the Irish airline industry for the European Single Market conditions which will apply from 1 January 1993. My Department will then no longer have any control over the allocation of routes between carriers who meet certain criteria. We will also have no power to prevent any EC nationals from establishing an operation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have been preparing for this eventuality by strengthening the Irish presence on existing air routes to and <Col N="1075" /> from Ireland and by opening new opportunities for our airlines to compete in international markets.  I have done so through the negotiation of new and extensive bilateral agreements and, within these, the pursuit of fifth freedom rights to further widen access to markets for Irish airlines</P>
    <P>Since assuming office, I have concluded six new bilateral agreements with Austria, Hungary, Belarus, Malaysia, Russia and Bulgaria.  That is not a bad start for eight or nine months.  In addition to route rights for the airline, I have personally instructed my officials to seek extra business opportunities across the whole range of activities that the Aer Lingus group are involved in.  To this end, a senior Aer Lingus official is part of the Irish Government's negotiating team.</P>
    <P>The second priority in our aviation policy has been to provide and develop top quality infrastructure for our airlines. We will continue to ensure that our airports are of the highest international standard and have the capacity needed to meet the growth in traffic arising from future economic growth.</P>
    <P>We have backed this policy with resources.  Substantial investment has been put into the State airports in recent years to enable them to keep pace with traffic growth.  In the four years to the end of 1991, investment in infrastructural improvements amounted to £82 million. The projects funded in recent years included a new runway, a multi-storey car park and extension of the departures and arrivals levels at Dublin Airport.  We also financed the extension of the terminal building and of the main runway at Cork Airport, and a new self-drive car park at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>An additional £30 million Exchequer money has been invested in high technology radar and communications equipment which have revolutionsed Irish air traffic control systems.  Irish controlled airspace is now among the most modern in Europe.</P>
    <P>The continuing growth in traffic, particularly at Dublin Airport which is reaching capacity levels due to the success <Col N="1076" /> of our policies, will necessitate further substantial capital investment in infrastructure in the years immediately ahead.  We will make that investment. We will provide over £138 million in the period up to 1996.</P>
    <P>Projects planned at Dublin Airport include a major extension of the passenger terminal, construction of a new passenger handling pier and extension of the apron, as well as further phases of the multi-storey car park.  Improvements to the passenger terminal at Shannon and further terminal expansion at Cork Airport are also planned.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised the need for competitiveness. We have taken specific action on this front to ensure that our airports make a contribution.  We have frozen airport charges at their current levels since 1 April 1987.  This Government's policy is and has been to keep charges at the lowest possible levels for the main users, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, in the interests of low access transport costs for tourism and other economic development.</P>
    <P>Apart from the State airport, the Government, in pursuit of their commitment to balanced regional developments, have also pursued an active policy of developing regional airports.  The six regional airports at Waterford, Kerry, Carnmore, Connaught, Sligo and Carrickfin are operated by private limited companies.  However, this Government have already invested a total of £14.2 million Exchequer moneys in the development of these airports.</P>
    <P>In addition they have obtained from the EC Commission the resources for a capital development programme costing over £20 million.  This programme which is funded jointly by the European Regional Development Fund and the airport companies is due for completion by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me, I would like to conclude with the reference to the final major component of the Government's aviation policy, this is to develop Ireland as a centre of excellence in aviation. Employment in aviation and in aviation related activities in Ireland has <Col N="1077" /> been buoyant and is expected to expand in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The development of a world aviation park in the Shannon area has been a major factor in this success.  This caters for industries involved in the manufacture, service and repair of aircraft, spares and components and also developments in relation to attracting additional aviation services from Eastern Europe. The aviation park has already got off to a good start and it is estimated that about 5,000 people will be employed in the aviation park by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>We also have the magnificent TEAM facilities at Dublin Airport.  I have had the privilege of examining these personally in depth and comparing them with similar enterprises abroad.  In my view the TEAM facilities and workplace are the best I have seen.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me put unequivocally on the record of this House that I acknowledge the role played by Aer Lingus over the years in the development of Ireland's trade and tourism.  I appreciate the contribution of its employees over the years in enabling the airline to fulfil that role.  I recognise the serious financial difficulties currently facing Aer Lingus. It is a matter for the board in the first instance to determine the urgent remedial action necessary to restore the airline to profitability.  I have asked them in doing so to take full account of the Government's objectives of job maintenance and job creation.  We are living in difficult times.  However, let me assure this House and the Irish people that this Government have a fully integrated and well thought out air transport policy to take Irish aviation through these difficulties. We can and we will take Aer Lingus through its difficulties also.  We are determined to do so while maintaining employment in the airline at the maximum possible level, consistent with maintaining a viable commercial operation.</P>
    <P>May I add it will be necessary for me to leave the House for approximately 20 minutes during the course of this debate, though no fault of my own?  That is the <Col N="1078" /> slot I have on the Government motion in the other House.  I will be back to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and to pay tribute to her for her progressive statement recently with regard to the future of Shannon Airport.  The present crisis facing Aer Lingus causes great concern to all of us because, as we know, Aer Lingus has contributed very significantly to the tourist industry in Ireland over the past 50 years and is a major national employer, currently employing approximately 8,000 people in the country.  Our concern about the present unprecedented crisis in the company is that, if not corrected, it will damage the country's tourist industry and add to the dole queues.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to stress how vital is the development of our tourist industry and the part it must and will play in the future economic development of our country.  Regretfully, I must say that the responsibility for the present crisis in the company rests with Aer Lingus, but also has been contributed to by the Government. There was a time, until the mid-1980s when the Government contributed to the cost of Aer Lingus.  For example, the Exchequer paid a grant annually to the company to alleviate its costs on the Atlantic and, in particular, in recognition of the promotional expenditure incurred by Aer Lingus in attracting US tourists to Ireland.  This was an extremely important function but all that has changed.  In more recent years, the Exchequer has demanded a dividend from Aer Lingus profits despite the fact that in some of those years the company was borrowing significant amounts for the replacement of its European fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many questions asked about the present crisis rests on the doorsteps of Aer Lingus management.  I have said this already, but it has to be stressed.  The company should not have delayed until now to request the Government to invest capital in the company.  This request should have come at the time of the replacement of the European fleet.  They should not have incurred losses of over <Col N="1079" /> £100 million in the past three years.  They should not have waited until they had massive losses before coming to the Government.  They should have come at an earlier time when the Government would have been investing in a viable unit.  That would have minimised the effect all round.</P>
    <P>While I am not adverse to the State investing more in Aer Lingus, the proposal should be for the funding of viable capital investment and not to shore up trading losses resulting from bad management. This is an extremely important point.  Money from the State should be invested in Aer Lingus to ensure its viability at all times.  Surely the consistent and extravagant losses on the Dublin-London route, amounting to £20 million a year for the past three years, must be explained?  I believe these losses are not as a result of market forces but are caused by the obsession of Aer Lingus to see off the competition that exists.  I share the concern of the Minister that part of the objective by Aer Lingus is to see Ryanair off the scene.  If this is the case, there is no way the people should be asked to subsidise it.</P>
    <P>The policy of the national airline to see off competition at any cost is not good. Aer Lingus should be as competitive as possible with the competition but not to the point where the company does serious financial damage to itself.  Of course, one of the most serious consequences of this loss-making policy on the London route was the decision of British Airways to pull out of Ireland. Access to the country poses a major difficulty and a State company like Aer Lingus should not have been allowed to pursue a policy which was so damaging. Of course, Aer Lingus carried out this policy because of the ambivalence of the Government and in no place can this be better seen than in relation to the Shannon issue to which I have already referred and on which I have complimented the Minister.  I paid tribute to her for her foresight in her recent decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been highly critical <Col N="1080" /> of the airline's attitude to Shannon which she described as a red herring.  What the Minister should realise is that Aer Lingus pursued this anti-Shannon policy on the promotion of her predecessor, Deputy Brennan.  If she has any doubt about that, she should read Deputy Brennan's memorandum to the Government when he was Minister for Transport some 12 months ago.  It was because of this attitude in Government that Aer Lingus felt so justified in pursuing the anti-Shannon policy.  Fortunately for Shannon, Deputy Brennan was moved from that Department, but the expectation of change which he has encouraged continued to be expressed by Aer Lingus until the Minister recently put them right on the Shannon question.</P>
    <P>A bright, prosperous future for Aer Lingus is very important, but the responsibility for this rests in the first place with the company.  I do not think the company can rely on the Government to the extent it appears to be doing.  Aer Lingus should make the company more efficient and more cost effective.  It is not enough to claim one is making cutbacks. They must be meaningful and effective in their operation.</P>
    <P>Where Aer Lingus is making losses on the Dublin-London route Ryanair is not; this would indicate that the smaller airline is more competitive and would also indicate room for improvement in Aer Lingus itself.  Aer Lingus should be allowed to charge more realistic air fares on this route, even if it means carrying fewer people.  The Minister recently said that Aer Lingus makes a loss of £5 on every London passenger; I suggest to the Minister that this should not continue. She can clarify the matter if that is an inaccurate reporting of her comments. The supermarkets or any other business in this country cannot sell at below cost, neither should a national airline.</P>
    <P>Now that the Shannon question is out of the way, there is a real opportunity for Aer Lingus to develop the Atlantic route. The Minister suggested that Aer Lingus enter into an arrangement with another carrier and I agree totally with this.  Part of the reason Aer Lingus could not have <Col N="1081" /> an alliance with a US carrier up to now is because of its negative attitude to Shannon and its promptings that things were about to change.  Now that the question of change is out of the way, Aer Lingus should back Aer Rianta's policy of promoting Shannon as a hub which undoubtedly would bring profitable opportunities for Aer Lingus.  I hope that the new task force announced by the Minister for promoting traffic through Shannon will work closely with Aer Lingus on this matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Aer Lingus should commit resources to work with Aeroflot and the other emerging Soviet carriers with a view to a close working arrangement. Aeroflot have a major involvement in Shannon and also with Aer Rianta in Moscow.  There must be an opportunity, through a Shannon hub, of flying from Russian and other Soviet airports to Shannon and for Aer Lingus going onwards to the USA.  If steps like these were to be taken, it would move the company towards positive viability.  The Minister should respond by putting a capital injection into a prosperous, successful, happy State-owned company we can all be proud of in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for her excellent outline of events to us this afternoon and her forthright comments about the various issues.  Without being repetitive, I wish to say that Aer Lingus cannot be spoon-fed all the way but it is essential that it gets the required capital to bring it back to viability.  At that stage under the direction of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, it is essential that Aer Lingus does not stray again into the serious financial mess it has got into in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reiteration and that of the Government of their commitment to Aer Lingus. One of the problems we have is a misconception of the reality of the situation in regard to the Government's commitment to Aer Lingus.  I am glad we have given her the opportunity yet again in a House of the Oireachtas to put on <Col N="1082" /> record Fianna Fáil's commitment and her own to the development of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>It is not overstating the issue to say that this House is about to discuss one of the most important national issues facing Ireland at this time.  As an island country our air access links particularly to Europe are the lifeblood of our economic development potential, our tourism industry and our social integration with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>I live and work politically in a constituency where aviation and Aer Lingus are the dominant employers and there is no denying that the current situation is a grave and general cause of concern as the economy and fabric of the community depend on a successful and growing aviation industry.  The Minister will be well aware of the situation in north County Dublin.  I am part of the community and am well aware of the apprehension that exists there and I may get a chance later on to elaborate on the feeling that the Government must respond.  Despite the recession of the past two years it is inconceivable that the aviation business can be viewed as anything other than a growth industry which is essential and central to national progress.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to use the time available to me to analyse again how the present situation has arisen.  Clearly the Gulf War and recession have been major factors but the scale of the problem is a compound of many unfavourable factors coming together in the past two years.  I would prefer to start in a pragmatic way by accepting that a certain critical point has been reached which severely challenges all parties who can contribute to a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We who are on the political side have continuously encouraged a strong and independent semi-State sector and we have freed them to organise commercially and use best commercial practice to respond to the management challenges in a changing market environment. An integral part of that reality is the acceptance that the necessary solutions to commercial problems must be generated and proposed by the companies themselves. <Col N="1083" /> Aer Lingus has always ranked as one of our foremost companies within any commercial criteria.  It has shown an exemplary commitment to the Irish economy through using, accepting, adapting and investing its technical skills to the immediate core business through aircraft maintenance, computer services, hotels and other areas.  These activities are designed to be profitable and play a vital part in the strategy of the airline to produce profit to underpin the aviation side of the business.  I believe this is a correct and realistic strategy.  The fundamental problem arises because the recession simultaneously hit both sides, pushing the aviation sector into deeper loss while reducing profitability in the ancillary business which, not surprisingly, are aviation-related.</P>
    <P>It is this twin problem which has accelerated the build-up of losses and which now poses such an acute challenge to the board, management and staff of the company.  It is not the first challenge that Aer Lingus has faced and overcome but it is undoubtedly the most severe.  The Minister and the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government have now clarified the environment within which Aer Lingus must seek and propose solutions.  I fully agree that tremendous understanding is both necessary and merited.</P>
    <P>The most important single point which the Minister has made clear and with which I agree is that a solution which relies in a major way on sizing down the airline, its route system and its staff is not the solution to the problem.  It is not the type of solution we expect from a competent and professional management who can only rely on the full support of the community when they reduce the effect on staff to the minimum possible.</P>
    <P>The key factor, therefore, in recovering the situation is clearly a coming together of the board, management and staff and the formation of a detailed and integrated plan which will secure the future.  Such a plan has already been called for and its preparation is underway within the airline.  The Minister said <Col N="1084" /> today that within the next month or two we should have that plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on behalf of the Government, has left the door open but understandably she wants a realistic, imaginative and pragmatic approach.  I believe that everyone from the chairman of the company downwards understands this and the need for a response which will gain the acceptance and confidence of the Government and the community. Nothing less is expected and nothing less will do.</P>
    <P>On many public occasions I have praised and supported the management and workers in Aer Lingus; they continue to have my confidence and support in finding and gaining acceptance for a planned solution.  I will restrict my specific advice to them to a single point.  I have always felt, and I know others agree, that the competition which naturally exists between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has obsessed the corporate attention of both airlines to an unacceptable degree and possibly to the detriment of other issues. In particular I have in mind the Dublin-London air route.  The case has now been made beyond doubt that more realistic fares must be charged by both companies.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is a great company.  It provides employment in Ireland for 7,600 people and has given us good reason for national pride in its many achievements. It is a key factor underpinning our tourism industry which supports 87,000 jobs. It is a key service for the business community and for exports and communications. It is a key service for everyone who lives on this island and our social contact with our emigrants and with the world.</P>
    <P>It is too important to all aspects of our national life to fail or to be allowed to fail.  It is central to the life of this island. I appeal, therefore, to the board, management and staff of Aer Lingus to expedite this plan and to do so within the guidelines that have now been clearly drawn.  Then I expect and will urge my Government to respond in a positive way.  I particularly remind them of the <Col N="1085" /> need to provide options to Government and in these options to look strongly at survival together with future growth and potential.</P>
    <P>I want to make some constructive proposals that I hope management and staff will take on board with the Minister as the major shareholder.  I disagree with the decision on the Shannon stopover.  I can understand the Government's policy on regional development and I sincerely hope that their decision will be of great benefit to the Shannon area but I hoped that a mixed decision would have been possible.</P>
    <P>I am amazed and surprised that the Minister was supported by SIPTU and the CRC because my constituents and the workers in Dublin Airport who came to see me on many occasions did not agree with that stance.  I am asking the Minister, in the light of the decision and the reaction that, as time goes on and the Shannon decision has been developed, and the Minister feels that Shannon is able to stand on its own two feet, the door will have been left open for that decision to be reviewed in the interests of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion, and one I believe has support within the company and among the employees, is an employees shared option scheme.  I am asking the Minister to consider the possibility of such a scheme for Aer Lingus.  I understand there would be support for this in the workforce.  I have written to the Minister for Finance in support of this and I am asking this Minister to lobby him in this regard.</P>
    <P>My third proposal deals with Aer Rianta.  Aer Lingus being Aer Rianta's biggest customer because of the former's financial situation, will find it extremely difficult to secure a private investor at this time.  This is borne out by the board's failing to secure an investor in recent months.  I am suggesting that Aer Rianta, as a profitable State company with Aer Lingus as their most important customer, could buy 25 per cent shareholding of Aer Lingus in the interest of the development and survival of Aer Lingus.  This could be secured by Aer Rianta by its assets and <Col N="1086" /> half its annual profits being capitalised.  I believe they are an ideal partnership with a common interest and Aer Rianta should in the future, if they wish, be given an opportunity to pass on their investment to a private investor.  I make that point on the basis that if anything should happen on a down trade, the first company to be affected would be Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>My fourth proposal deals with the Cohesion Fund.  I suggest that the Minister should try to provide equity from the Cohesion Fund which should be decided in the coming months.  Take, for example, the fact that Spain has been funded massively to build highways that link France and Italy to cater for their exporters and to bring tourists and tourism to Spain.  Roads are not our link with mainland Europe but planes and ships are.  Britain has the Channel Tunnel and I am urging the Minister to make the strongest case possible for equity from the Cohesion Fund to be provided for air transport.  I say that in the certain knowledge that a member state has been funded in such a way &mdash; I know the Greek Islands have been funded for air transport. I am asking now that the Government in the strongest terms should look for an equity funding for air transport.</P>
    <P>A second reason for Cohesion Funds is that Ireland has faced major emigration which has affected every part of our country. Regional airports and low cost fares are absolute essentials for husbands, wives, sons and daughters to get back to their family homes on a regular basis.  I support the policy of the development of regional airports that has been pursued by this Government.  It is essential that people can get back to their regions whether they are from the west, the south or the north-west.</P>
    <P>My fifth suggestion relates to eastern European options.  The Minister stated that she and her Department have been making every effort to secure further business for Aer Lingus around Eastern Europe and with some success as, she rightly points out, but I believe that Aer Lingus should be trying to capitalise or the fantastic success story of Aer Rianta's <Col N="1087" /> operations in Russia, and I would hope that Aer Lingus management are making every effort to piggy-back on their success throughout Russia.</P>
    <P>My sixth proposal relates to marketing alliances.  I urge that Aer Lingus endeavour to set up marketing alliances in a world-wide network of air routes; I have in mind the USA and the Far East.  As I have already stated, to downsize is not the answer.</P>
    <P>Finally on equity, I have heard the Minister and the Government state that at this moment the national finances do not allow further equity to be put into the company in its present state.  I hope that, if the board respond with a cohesive plan that will help to bring the company's present financial difficulties into line, the Government will respond with equity.  I genuinely believe that, because of the importance of Aer Lingus to the national economy, with its record of profits and the sacrifices the workforce have made in improved work practices and salary cuts, the Government should respond in kind. I welcome the Minister's comments on that.  I hope I am reading the script correctly but in my view, given the right circumstances a different opinion may be taken on whether equity would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>They are just a few proposals which I feel are worthy of consideration.  The Government are clearly on record to commit themselves to a strong and vibrant Aer Lingus.  The company should take confidence from this commitment and respond to it with a plan which will be seen as worthy of this stiff challenge, worthy of the excellent record of Aer Lingus itself and worthy of the trust it has in the future of the industry and the company.</P>
    <P>When the company spells out the strategies and policies for success, I have no doubt that such a plan will receive a positive response from Government and the agencies of Government who have a role to play in supporting such a solution.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few final points for the record.  There has never been any doubt about Fianna Fáil's commitment <Col N="1088" /> to Aer Lingus from Seán Lemass's time onwards, and its recent record of investment in the years when I have been at local authority level and national level. We have seen, and Senator O'Toole will know, the £30 million investment for the new runway; the £16 million investment to Airmotive, with 660 people employed there at the moment; the £13 million to TEAM Aer Lingus, which the Minister has rightly praised in her speech here today and which has created 2,000 plus jobs.  In my capacity as chairman of the local authority, I had the pleasure of supporting and proposing the planning application and expediting that application through the Dublin Planning Authority and then of lobbying the then Taoiseach and Government &mdash; the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; for the funding I mentioned for TEAM Aer Lingus.  That proposal was on the table for years and other Administrations failed to take it up.  There are now 2,000 plus people there, recognised worldwide as the most skilled labour force in aviation maintenance. That is something we should all be proud to be associated with.  There is also the £6 million training grants that have been mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have refrained from any knee-jerk reaction to the news of the financial troubles of Aer Lingus.  I have been in constant touch with the Minister and her Department trying to find solutions to their problems.  Some of the comments which appeared in the paper, in my view, were not in the interests of the company or the workforce.  I have lived among this workforce, they are my friends, my neighbours, and I understand their concerns. It is not in the interests of the company to have Aer Lingus linen washed in public.  Now it is time for all those involved, unions, management, the board and the shareholders, to come together in the interests of the company.</P>
    <P>The Government's message of commitment to Aer Lingus has not come across to the workforce and I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to rectify that.  I want to assure everybody of my total commitment to the aviation industry in Ireland, to Aer Lingus and to <Col N="1089" /> Dublin Airport.  I will be urging in the strongest possible terms the Minister and the Government to respond in a most positive way in the interests of the workforce and the national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who lives two or three miles from the airport, in a community of people who are sustained by the airport, I am delighted to have the opportunity to put a few points on the record.  It has been important for the Minister to say what she has said today because it was new and will come as news to many people who are neighbours and friends of mine.  Knowing the Minister as long and as well as I do, I have no reason to doubt her and indeed I believe her when she speaks of her commitment to Aer Lingus but such commitment has been sadly lacking.</P>
      <P>I listened to the contribution made by Senator Wright.  It was a well thought out, well reasoned and very positive statement and he has put forward a number of recommendations which have to be considered.  However, I have great difficulty in accepting from this Fianna Fáil Government a statement that they support a strong and independent State sector.  I have not seen it.  Every time I have seen a State sector become competitive, whether it has been RTE or any other body somebody brings the chopper out to them.  In this case, and I would like to get a response from the Minister on this, we sowed the wind and we are reaping the whirlwind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear any views coming from the opposite benches two or three years ago when I stood up here and asked why was it that Aer Lingus had lost its route to Liverpool?  Why was it that Aer Lingus had lost its route to Munich?  Why was it that Aer Lingus, after three years of market survey and preparation, was refused permission to do the Stansted route?  This was not an anti-Ryanair thing.  The reality was Ryanair was established. I have always supported the viability and the involvement of Ryanair but let us put the record straight on it; the establishment of Ryanair led to the creation of 500 new jobs in Ryanair and <Col N="1090" /> lost 500 jobs in Aer Lingus.  It was playing musical chairs with job losses.  I thoroughly support the involvement of Ryanair but I do not understand how we have got ourselves into the position we are in at the moment.</P>
    <P>In terms of the different groups within Aer Lingus I consider the board of Aer Lingus to be as patriotic and as committed a board as there is to be found on this island.  There is no doubt about the commitment of the board to the industry and to the country.  It is also important to put on the record that the State has made an enormous investment in Aer Lingus and in terms of the capitalisation of Aer Lingus the State and the taxpayer are well ahead.</P>
    <P>What I find hard to take in the Minister's speech is her comment that if the State is to invest in equity in Aer Lingus it will only do it on the basis of getting a return for its money.  I stood up in this House two years ago when the Government proposed the privatisation of Irish Life and, much to the annoyance of some of my friends on the left of the political spectrum, I said I had no objection at that stage to the privatisation of Irish Life for the simple reason that the State, being the largest shareholder, had never taken a dividend from it.  We have, on the one side, a Government who will prop up Irish Life and not take a dividend from it in order to make money out of privatisation and, on the other hand, saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will not invest an equity in Aer Lingus because there is no return&rdquo;.  Those two statements are contradictory.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is going through a rough period.  It is going through a rough period for a number of reasons; the obvious ones are the impact of the Gulf War on air travel worldwide, the fact that there is a world recession at the moment which has led to a reduction in passenger numbers and, associated with those two reasons, the number of passengers using aircraft worldwide has actually gone down over the past two years, something that has never happened before.</P>
    <P>I do not see in the Minister's speech any reference to the fact that the employees in Aer Lingus were the first <Col N="1091" /> people to make a sacrifice when, as Senator Wright said, they put their heads on the line last year and agreed not to accept one of the pay increases due to them under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Let us credit them with taking that stand.  There is a board who are committed, who are doing the business.  There are employees in the company who, by their action, have shown their commitment to the company. Those employees who took that reduction in salary last year should at some stage in the future be rewarded either by shares or equity in the company. That should not be forgotten at some stage in the future.  We have a workforce there who have proved themselves to be flexible, to be committed and to be able to give a service which is unmatched internationally.</P>
    <P>In terms of the trade unions, it is fair to say that the agreement reached between Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the trade union movement some years ago, when there were 30 different groups of workers who agreed after very difficult and intense negotiation to a package represented a sense of commitment on all sides that should be noted.</P>
    <P>The future of Aer Lingus is being put in jeopardy because of current problems and, at the very least, we should ensure that the equity and investment required by the company is made available in order to get through this difficult patch. It is regrettable that the board of Aer Lingus have found themselves unable to establish the Los Angeles link.  I ask the Minister to put pressure to ensure it is established.</P>
    <P>I find the Dublin-London route utterly confusing.  I do not know how it operates. There are planes all over the place and yet every time somebody gets into a plane the airline loses money.  I was in London Airport last week and I could not get a flight to Dublin after 8.30 p.m. I just do not understand the operations of Aer Lingus and Ryanair from Stansted, Luton and Heathrow, and nobody else does either.  You are never sure of a flight, you are never sure of a service; <Col N="1092" /> indeed, I believe Aer Lingus has been cast into the outer wilderness in Heathrow Airport.  You would nearly walk as quickly to Dublin now as you would from the centre of Heathrow to the Aer Lingus boarding gate.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a point I have raised on two previous occasions in this House and I am glad somebody from the Government side, Senator Wright, also raised the same matter.  Ireland is on the periphery of the European Community and that fact has to be recognised in Brussels.  I have asked time and again for recognition of the fact that for the Irish business person to go to Europe to do business, for a tourist to come to Ireland on holiday, is more expensive and if there is to be equality of treatment among the partners in the European Community the Brussels-London-Dublin link should be subsidised and there should be an air corridor between Dublin and Brussels which should be subsidised.  It should be subsidised in the interest of greater communications at European level.  We are perfectly entitled to that and it is a demand I have no hesitation in making.</P>
    <P>I also accept the point the Minister has made that at all times we must maximise on the employment creation opportunities made available by Aer Lingus. The possibility of expansion in air traffic is extraordinary.  I remember the first time I spoke in this House on the whole question of air transport.  It was shortly after deregulation in the US and we saw what happened within two years of deregulation in the US.  We saw the elimination of most of the smaller companies in an extraordinary, inexorable circle of woe in the air traffic business in the US. This was followed by the elimination of some of the largest air companies in the world and the re-establishment of smaller companies.  Now we have the larger companies again and this is not in anybody's interest.  I agree with the Minister's point that the Dublin/London fare should be standardised.  There is no point saying we are looking for equity and for a return on investment.  It is ludicrous to consider that competition has reached a stage where both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are <Col N="1093" /> in danger of going bust because of the nonsensical level of competitiveness which has developed on the London/Dublin route.  That must be made economic.</P>
    <P>I share the views of the Minister on the need to retain a strong national airline. Apart from the prestige for the country, which is not unimportant, there is also the fact that it is the hub of a huge network of companies in the Aer Lingus group in which, the last time I checked, there were approximately 40 different companies tied into one another.  In recent times Members of this House went out to TEAM Aer Lingus.  Nobody could be unimpressed by the work in that company and its proposals for growth.</P>
    <P>The economic indicators in this country were never better.  Interest rates are up at the moment but they will be reduced.  We have failed, however, to translate that into employment creation. Looking at it over the last decade, it appears to me that every 5 per cent growth in the economy leads to a mere 1 per cent growth in employment.  That is a ratio we have to look at and that goes back to the Government's macro-economic policy.  It has to do with the repatriation of profits by foreign companies.  I make this point because, were Aer Lingus to go to the wall, were the unthinkable to happen, were Aer Lingus to go under to be replaced by a foreign airline company, would not just cause a loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the debate in the media has simply been on the question of jobs, quite correctly from the point of view of the people whose jobs are at stake, but that would be only the tip of the iceberg.  Were jobs at risk and were Aer Lingus to go, that would only be the beginning.  There would be the knock-on effect on the Aer Lingus group of companies and it would be a devastating blow to the Irish economy.  There are many other companies involved besides Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the points made by Senator Wright.  We both live in a community which is sustained to a large <Col N="1094" /> extent by the airport, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the Aer Lingus group of companies. It would devastate north Dublin and its hinterland were these jobs to be lost.  It would be a killer blow to the economy of that area.</P>
    <P>We need to further develop Aer Lingus and the airport immediately by extending either light railway or DART to the airport to encourage a greater use of the airport and greater growth.  We need to ensure that equity is provided in order for Aer Lingus to develop by loans, by Government equity or by allowing employees to invest in their own company as proposed by Senator Wright.  All these matters need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>However, I pull back from the position of the creeping privatisation technique Senator Wright suggests, involving give and take and sell to the private sector in three different chess moves.  I disagree with him on that, but I compliment him on the extraordinary research he has carried out as is evident from his contribution here today.  It deserves wider publication and I hope it gets wide coverage, which is what this House is good for. Senator Wright has put things on the record which deserve to be responded to. In conclusion, I thank the Minister for coming today, putting these matters in front of us and allowing us to debate the issues.</P>
    <P>As a responsible trade union leader, I say that this company needs the support of the Government and the State.  No matter what the problems are, in terms of investing in infrastructure and jobs, the money has to be found for an investment in equity in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the comments by the Minister.  It gives us some hope, it gives hope to the board and employees of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole hoped that Senator Wright's contribution would get wider publicity.  I have no doubt that Senator Wright will give a copy to every member of Aer Lingus staff he meets during the election campaign.  I am sure Senator <Col N="1095" /> O'Toole need have no fears in that regard.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is a State company; in many ways it is the leading State company. It has made an enormous contribution not just to the Irish economy but also to our national life.  As a major State company it is entitled not just to Government support but to Government co-operation and encouragement as well. This is particularly so at times of difficulty. In our modern and fiercely competitive world, any company which has to trade in an international environment will, at some stage, encounter problems and setbacks.  At such times it is mandatory on the Government to do everything it can to sustain and support its own company.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is the Government's aviation company.  It is ridiculous to look upon it as the enemy, to treat it with hostility, to attack and hassle it when it needs assistance and support from its owner.  If nothing else, it is at least entitled to moral support.  In practically every modern industrial nation, governments intervene regularly, and often in a substantial way, to assist key commercial concerns whose role is significant to the economy as a whole.  This happens even if these commercial concerns are entirely private sector owned.  For instance, many of us learned recently to our surprise that the mighty Mercedes Benz has been actively supported by the German government over a long period of years. Sometimes this intervention is of a permanent nature.  At other times governments merely intervene to tide the particular concern through a particular rough period.</P>
    <P>As an island nation it is of fundamental importance to us to have a national airline to provide access to the outside world.  To suggest otherwise is to ignore basic realities.  It also must be accepted that in modern circumstances our national airline, in providing for our different access needs, will not have an easy task.  It must operate in an environment which is by no means ideal.  It has to operate from a very small narrow <Col N="1096" /> base.  Its place, however, in the overall economic scheme of things is of such vital importance that it must be assisted in every way open to the Government to enable it to operate successfully.  Any other policy by an Irish Government is totally indefensible.</P>
    <P>From 1 January next the Single Market will be brought fully into operation throughout the 12 member states of the European Community.  This vast market will offer us great opportunities for the development of our economy and of the creation of jobs but it will also bring challenges.  There is almost unanimous agreement among everybody concerned that it will be of crucial importance for us, if we are to exploit this new situation, to have a vast, efficient, modern transport system between here and mainland Europe as well as Great Britain in order to maximise the opportunities available.</P>
    <P>For this reason we have already expended a considerable amount of Structural Funds on improving our transport infrastructure, roads, harbours and airports. An efficient air service for both passengers and freight between here and the principal European centres will be an absolute necessity.  Only Aer Lingus can provide us with such a service.  It must be given every support and assistance necessary to enable it to provide the essential service we will need in that European market.  When this strategic economic necessity and the many thousands of jobs provided by Aer Lingus are taken into account, the argument that Government support of whatever kind is necessary and feasible for Aer Lingus is unanswerable.  There should be no delay in providing it not just in the interests of Aer Lingus but also in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I believe the new Cohesion Fund, which is to be established by the EC, offers possibilities which should be explored in this regard.  Ireland has been arguing consistently with the Commission that, in our case, it is legitimate to use Structural Funds to finance not just permanent infrastructural transport facilities but mobile transport investment. There is a strong case that Ireland <Col N="1097" /> as a peripheral region, with an economy totally dependent on our foreign trade, should be able to use Cohesion Funds to finance a major expansion of the company's European fleet.</P>
    <P>The aviation industry is notorious for its ups and downs.  Aer Lingus has had many long periods of successful, profitable operation.  The present difficulties should be regarded as temporary and, as such, fully justify Government investment and other assistance to overcome them.  We have already lost enough of our industrial and commercial base.  We simply cannot afford to allow the prospects and potential for Aer Lingus to be damaged in any way.  Our employment situation is too desperate to put the thousands of jobs in Aer Lingus in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome the Minister's speech today.  The debate has thrown up many suggestions as to how Aer Lingus can proceed from here.  The issue should be a priority for the Government and for the Oireachtas as a whole.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Wright, I, too, live near the airport in Dublin.  Reference was made to Seán Lemass and his role in establishing Aer Lingus.  I feel very proud of that fact for reasons of family tradition. For that reason also I will defend Aer Lingus, our national airline, and will work consistently to ensure that the company overcomes the current difficulties it is experiencing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus is the largest and most successful entrepreneurial force in the country.  No company comes near it in creating jobs in Ireland.  For example, Smurfit, which employs 15,000 people worldwide, employs 2,000 people in Ireland, reduced from 3,700 in 1986.  Aer Lingus, on the other hand, has expanded employment at home and abroad.  It employs 7,600 here out of a total of 13,631, and has expanded its workforce by almost 2,000 since 1987.  Is total wage bill amounts to £300 million per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout its 56-year history, Aer Lingus has been the focal point for the development of significant levels of <Col N="1098" /> employment opportunities in Ireland, with high levels of skill and technical expertise.  Its drive has led it not alone to expand into the creation of direct employment in its many large subsidiaries but also to foster Ireland's leading company, Guinness Peat Aviation. Guinness Peat Aviation was founded by a former Aer Lingus employee who was taught and encourged by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been a very good investment for the taxpayer.  My information is that since the company was founded 56 years ago, the Government's only investment was £68.6 million shares, plus a permanent loan of £5 million on which it has charged interest.  In March 1992 its gross assets were £1,200 million but the precise value of the company depends on many factors, such as the state of the stock market, the world airline industry in general the performance of the company itself and its profit levels and level of indebtedness.  It is, therefore, difficult to give an exact valuation of the company.  However, it is reckoned to be worth between £600 million and £1,000 million.  It is more likely to be valued at the lower range of the scale at the moment because of the chaos in the world air transport industry and its consequent low level of profits in recent years.  Even so, this figure is many times more than the Government's total investment of £68.8 million.</P>
    <P>The most recent investment on Aer Lingus took place almost ten years ago, when £30 million was invested in the company over a two year period.  The question is, why does Aer Lingus need more capital?  Companies usually go to their shareholders looking for capital for two main reasons.  They are either in a short term crisis or they are embarking on expansion.  Aer Lingus needs money for both reasons.  The world airline industry is in deep crisis and Aer Lingus wishes to expand and replace its transatlantic fleet. In 1990 the world airline industry lost more in one year than it made in profits since air travel began.  The last two years have not been good for the airline business, and in these circumstances Aer Lingus has performed well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> Aer Lingus has a debt at £580 million which, as a percentage of equity, is 8.51 per cent.  This is clearly unsustainable.  A normal commercial company would be able to call on its investors for backing. Last year, Aer Lingus paid £58 million interest on its enormous debt.  With equity funding, some of the money could be paid in dividends to the Exchequer and in investment.  At the moment, Aer Lingus is working for the banks, not the taxpayer.  Companies seek additional support from their shareholders to fund expansion.  Aer Lingus has increased employment in Ireland by 1,700 people in the last five years and it is due to replace its transatlantic fleet which is more than 20 years old.</P>
    <P>The 1980s saw the company replace its short haul European fleet; it now has one of the youngest short haul fleets in Europe.  Aer Lingus has invested over £500 million in 28 new aircraft from its own resources but it built up its present high level of debt not anticipating such a deep crisis in the world airline industry. It had the ability to do that and it deserves great credit from us.</P>
    <P>The investment of equity funds in Aer Lingus is essential to ensure the future viability of the company.  Its debts are too high but they have been run up because of under-investment by an unsupporting shareholder, the Government, because of an unforeseeable crisis in civil aviation and because of the necessary programme of fleet modernisation.  The small State investment in Aer Lingus to date has paid off in a massive increase in its value, in a world class airline and in increased tourist numbers.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Aer Lingus in 1936 played an important role in helping to modernise the economy and provide many direct and indirect jobs in Ireland. Senator O'Toole spoke about privatisation. Would privatisation help Aer Lingus?  If the Aer Lingus group were to be privatised it would be asset stripped. Its current unprofitable air transport side would either be closed down or massively reduced and valuable airport landing rights, for example into London Heathrow <Col N="1100" /> would be auctioned off by the asset strippers to cover the cost of buying Aer Lingus.  This is a classic asset stripping technique.  The privateers would probably sell off the other valuable operations, such as the 8 per cent stake in GPA, the hotels and TEAM, to foreign buyers.  The net result would be that Ireland would be very poorly served by air transport which would have a severely damaging effect not just on tourism but on business and the economy in general. Business people would have fewer flights to and from Ireland and would be less inclined to do business here.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is, in the real sense, a strategic State enterpise.  Like electricity, air transport is an integral part of any modern business, but, to the asset strippers parts of Aer Lingus would be worth more than the whole.  These juicy titbits would be picked clean, destroying the jobs of thousands of Aer Lingus employees and of workers elsewhere whose livelihood is dependent on the survival of our national airline.  The loss of the PAYE revenue plus the cost of social welfare and other benefits arising from job cuts on such a scale would impose a substantial additional burden on the coffers.</P>
    <P>World airlines are in chaos.  Airlines are growing bigger with the large swallowing the small.  Leading international airlines, such as Pan Am have collapsed and, today, TWA is in difficulty, as is Dan Air in the UK.  It has been forecast that by 1995 there will be only five major airlines in Europe.  The huge losses made by airlines in recent years spell deep trouble for many existing airlines.  Yet, high future growth was forecast for the survivors in the eighties.  The number of airline passengers also doubled and it is expected by the year 2000 that the number of passengers will double again to over two billion a year.  The increases in passenger numbers carried by Aer Lingus have been considerably above the European average and the company expects this trend to continue at 5 per cent or even more annually.</P>
    <P>The non-air transport side of Aer Lingus is very profitable and has been <Col N="1101" /> developed to counter the cyclical nature of air transport.  It is on the air transport side that Aer Lingus has made large losses in the last few years.  It made a small profit in 1988 and a small loss in 1989 but losses amounted to £43 million in 1991 and, while reduced to £38 million in 1992, the profits in the other division were not large enough to cover this, hence the group loss of £3 million.</P>
    <P>The question was posed, why should the taxpayer invest in this company?  The taxpayers' investment to date has paid off, not just in small dividends but in huge capital appreciation through their investment from £68 million to £600 million.  In other words, the company is worth a lot more than the State put into it, and it is likely to grow in the future. The air transport business is going through a very rough patch and considers Aer Lingus's size and circumstances, it has done extremely well.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is vital for Irish tourism. Air transport is now the dominant mode in international travel.  Fifty-eight per cent of visitors travelled to Ireland by air in 1991 and Aer Lingus carried 75 per cent of the total as opposed to its 51 per cent five years earlier.  In other words, Aer Lingus carries three out of every four visitors to Ireland by air.  The number of visitors to Ireland in these five years grew by 55 per cent and the number of people who flew with Aer Lingus into Ireland grew by a massive 130 per cent.  Last year, Aer Lingus brought 1.26 million people to Ireland.  Aer Lingus fares are very low compared to other shorthaul routes in Europe, which is good for the tourist but bad for Aer Lingus because they are below cost in many cases.  The company spends £22 million annually on sales and marketing abroad through its 22 overseas agencies.</P>
    <P>The relationship between air transport and peripherality was mentioned earlier. Aer Lingus is highly dependent on leisure travellers who are far more price conscious than business passengers.  It operates from an island with a low population, with a relatively low income economy and with seasonal traffic, carrying twice as many passengers in the summer as in the winter.  The air transport side of Aer <Col N="1102" /> Lingus faces unusual difficulties.  The short length of its journeys means that it is difficult to be profitable.  Its major problem is its low yields from passenger revenues.</P>
    <P>The question was then posed: does the State have the money?  Yes, it has.  The State borrows to invest in many areas which generate no financial return, but the investment in Aer Lingus yields a clearly measurable return in capital growth, dividends and jobs.  Most economists are coming back to the view that borrowing for investment is worthwhile. As things stand, the Government borrow a substantial amount every year to invest in areas where they get no financial return, though they get other benefits, such as roads, sewerage, water, etc.  To ensure the future of this strategic and expanding enterprise, the State needs to invest now in Aer Lingus which will continue to be very worthwhile and rewarding for the taxpayer and the economy.</P>
    <P>Could the State investment be used more effectively elsewhere?  I accept the Minister's and Senator Wright's views on that.  The question is can Aer Lingus be turned around?  Its air transport business has been profitable in the past and the company and the workforce together have done everything they can to reduce costs.  However, with new equity, the company's financial position would be dramatically improved.  It has other problems, such as the continuing crisis in the world aviation industry which will ease when the US and the UK recessions end. When the recession ends and unsustainable competition eases, Aer Lingus will be able to charge more realistic fares.</P>
    <P>More credit for diversifying for success might have been forthcoming.  Recognising that air transport is subject to seasonal variations and trading cycles, Aer Lingus has successfully expanded into many different areas in Ireland and abroad.  It has a major hotel chain in the UK, having recently sold its big chain in the US at a large profit.  Aer Lingus has hotels in France and Belgium and leisure properties in Spain.  It has subsidiaries providing international management services and hospital recruitment services, but its most important success in Ireland has been its diversification into maintenance <Col N="1103" /> with TEAM Aer Lingus, the expert in aircraft maintenance and aircraft engine overhaul which provided 2,000 highly skilled jobs in Ireland, earning foreign exchange in a competitive industry.</P>
    <P>Around 4,300 of the company's total of 7,500 employees in Ireland are involved in the air transport business. Without Aer Lingus, Irish tourism would be severely damaged because it gives frequent and reliable access to Ireland. Tourism is one of the key growth industries in this country, employing over 80,000 people.</P>
    <P>We have heard about subsidies and the question was asked what subsidies? Although it is commonly, but mistakenly, assumed that all companies are regularly subsidised by the taxpayer.  Aer Lingus, receives no State subsidies.  A small subsidy was paid in the early eighties for operating the transatlantic route but no such payments are made today.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has made an outstanding contribution to the economy, but it is in difficulty.  Because of the reluctance of successive Governments to carry out one of the shareholder's responsibilities which is to invest adequately in the company, Aer Lingus has been forced to take out expensive loans from private institutions to finance the capital costs associated with the aviation industry.  The repayments on these loans are a millstone around the neck of an otherwise sound company.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has practised wage moderation.  It has introduced new scales with lower starting points.  Incremental increases have been foregone.  There were changes in crews and staff levels, increasing flexibility and other charges in work practice.  While we may be critical of management, and in some cases that may be justified, they recognise that further belt tightening on the part of the employees has been virtually exhausted, because after all these exercises the debt problem remains.  Unless it is addressed effectively the whole company will be affected.</P>
    <P>Investment of Government equity at realistic levels would stabilise the company's financial position.  It would allow <Col N="1104" /> everyone in Aer Lingus to work with greater security and satisfaction so that together they could provide an even better service to their customers and to Ireland.  In return for an extremely modest State investment of £68.8 million over a period of 56 years, the Irish people have in Aer Lingus a company worth in excess of £600 million which provides employment for 7,600 people in Ireland and a further 6,000 people worldwide. That phenomenal success has been tempered by the impact of the current downturn in the world aviation industry which say all but two international airlines register losses last year.</P>
    <P>Although the staff of Aer Lingus have made considerable sacrifices to ease the company through this difficult period, Aer Lingus requires additional resources to get over the recession.  Panic measures such as extensive cuts in services may improve the appearance of the accounts in the short term but in the long term they spell disaster for the company and for Ireland where job creation and not job destruction is the number one priority.</P>
    <P>Different figures are being bandied about in all sorts of arguments and we might find ourselves asking the chairman of the beef tribunal to decide who dealt with the facts and who did not.  I am not going down that road; I read the statement because I wanted to be accurate in my research.  I accept the Minister's statement which helps the workforce to understand the situation.  It has also played a role in telling the media that while you do not tell lies you often give truth a hard time.  The media will probably take that message, too.  That is not a criticism of the media.  It is not always possible to get at the full facts and, consequently, they may have to go to press with less than the full story.  I hope we have given the Minister sufficient to think about and that we will not be overshadowed by events in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that this will be my last offering for this session.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is sad to be discussing the impending crisis <Col N="1105" /> in Aer Lingus at the last sitting of Seanad Éireann and of the 26th Dáil.</P>
      <P>The national airline has been one of the great success stories of the semi-State sector.  It has grown from a small operation to an extensive one employing substantial numbers of people at home and abroad.  We talk in terms of 7,000 at home and 6,000 abroad, a colossal number to be directly or indirectly employed by Aer Lingus.  The estimated value of the company at £600 or £700 million is substantial compared to the amount of equity that has been put in over the years and which amounts to less than 10 per cent of its present value.</P>
      <P>We should also consider the enormous network of activity that Aer Lingus has been involved in both at home and abroad.  It has operated as a major industry should operate, creating initiatives and expanding into ancillary operations and activities to supplement the main operation.  Here I might mention the establishment in Shannon of a duty free shop which displayed Irish goods to visitors from all over the world, the promotion of Irish coffee which became a world famous drink and the enormous success of TEAM maintenance introduced in the past number of years for the overhaul and the maintenance of aircraft.</P>
      <P>There has been ample evidence of initiative among those involved in Aer Lingus to diversify into additional products and activities related to the main industry there which is the training of pilots.  The success of Guinness Peat Aviation followed the decision by former employees of Aer Lingus to go out on their own to provide the prime international leasing service in the airline industry.  That development owes its origin to the ethos created by Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus at home has been a tremendously positive and productive force in Irish society in tourism and job creation. Its imagination and initiative have often been lacking in other industries which do not have proper research and development facilities and the necessary flair to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been equally successful abroad and has been an excellent ambassador for Ireland.  In the United States which it targeted as its main centre <Col N="1106" /> initially it has been a success with offices in every part of the country.  It has provided a tremendous boost both in personnel and promotional material to the tourist industry which has brought hundreds of thousands of visitors here.  Anything that would undermine that activity would endanger not only the future of Aer Lingus but also the future of our tourist industry and of our recovery.</P>
    <P>More recently Aer Lingus expanded into the USSR; they provided opportunities which Aer Lingus was quick to take up.  Aer Lingus worked in tandem with Aeroflot which provided a huge base and a tremendous number of jobs in the Shannon area.  That has been reciprocated by the establishment of bases in Moscow and other cities in what was the USSR.  Duty free shops have been introduced there where Irish goods are being marketed for the first time.  That has been an initiative of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus.  In the United States Aer Lingus has given a tremendous boost to Irish tourism and has moved into ancillary industry of hotels and catering.</P>
    <P>The aircraft industry is an expensive operation.  When we talk of aircraft replacement we must talk in terms of tens of hundreds of millions of pounds so the requirement for a replacement fleet inevitably brings with it a crisis in terms of capital and when that occasion is compounded by a recession in the tourist industry major problems emerge.  We have been faced with this and Aer Lingus have countered by establishing a new salary scale for employees but that has not resolved all of its difficulties.  Aer Lingus needs an adequate equity investment by the Government to rescue its operation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options the Government might explore to respond positively to Aer Lingus both on a policy and on a financial basis.  The first thing the Government should do is to sit down with the airline executives and come up with a national aviation policy, dealing with matters such as the strength and potential of our national airline, the extent of existing structures, matters of personnel, the location of ancillary operations and on where profits are being made and losses incurred.  Now that <Col N="1107" /> European Union is imminent we will be the only island state in the EC.  We will have no road or rail link with mainland Europe unlike our next door neighbour but will be entirely dependent on sea and air traffic for communications and the supply of goods.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, this country has performed well over a number of years in the production and the export of goods.  We rely to an inordinate degree on the sale of our goods abroad and their transport is, therefore, a major consideration. Air transport is ideal for ensuring quick and easy access to the main markets of Europe.  It is the quickest and most reliable route especially for fragile or perishable goods. Air transport is part of our infrastructure and from that point of view the Minister has good cause to argue for Cohesion Funds to ensure that our national airline will not be covered by deregulation status.</P>
    <P>Air transport is a core essential of our infrastructure and if the European Community is sincere about improving the communications network of peripheral nations it should respond here.  We can request the Government to provide essential equity itself and also look for further equity from Europe to ensure the survival of a long term national aviation policy for this country.</P>
    <P>Those are the principal proposals I would like to make in relation to Aer Lingus and I direct the Minister's attention to those areas.  I am sure that the Minister will not contemplate any serious undermining of Aer Lingus but I would hate demoralisation to set in regarding the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Members of the House have an interest in the Shannon stop-over. I am a representative for Dublin and poor old Dublin has been having a rough time in recent years with regard to employment.  Poor Molly Malone has been crying her eyes out for years.  We have a greater percentage of unemployed people in Dublin than anywhere else.  A recent article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> by Paul Tansey compared the various regions of the country in terms of population and employment.  Dublin has lost <Col N="1108" /> out significantly over the past number of years where the average unemployment rate has increased by at least twice the national rate.</P>
    <P>The Shannon stop-over needs to be looked at again.  I am loath to contemplate anything that might undermine the enormous contribution Shannon has been made to the economy and to the tourist industry and to the quality of life in the western and southern regions. However, it is not only unusual but anomalous that there is no direct link between international capitals and our capital city; unlike other countries.  That omission reduces the number of tourists who might otherwise come directly to the capital.</P>
    <P>Dublin has never been properly marketed as a tourist centre.  Ireland is still a green country in terms of marketing; we are rurally green although all the signs of a modern nation are evident in Dublin. Music, social life, and our film industry are urban generated for the most part. Nevertheless we still project an image of rural thatched cottages.  There is too much of that at present; while it is good in its own right, it detracts from the national capital.</P>
    <P>We would like to see Aer Lingus survive. We hope for an early decision on where the necessary funding is going to come from to ensure that it can expand, retain its workforce and continue its imaginative and successful record of promoting Ireland at home and abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí ar fad a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo. Sílim go raibh deis acu éisteacht leis na pointí a rinne mé, agus rinne siad go léir tacú láidir lena dúirt mé faoin gcomhlacht iontach seo a bhfuil an oiread sin déanta aige ar son forbairt turasóireachta agus iompair sa tír seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been genuinely impressed by the level of insight and awareness shown by contributors from all sides of the House.  I would like to thank Senator Wright for his initiative in having this debate in the Seanad and particularly on a day when political feeling in both <Col N="1109" /> Houses of the Oireachtas is in a state of flux.  I am gratified to note that there is unanimous agreement among us all at the valuable contribution made by Aer Lingus to Ireland's development over the past 55 years.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recognition by Senators of the role of the board in tackling the major problems which beset the airline at present.  The board has primary responsibility for proposing solutions to the airline's difficulties and that is a heavy load to carry.  However, I want to stress that this is no time for despair.  There are solutions to these problems which we will find and implement.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey raised many interesting points which I hope he will accept were covered in my opening speech. Senator Harte's contribution which was well researched concentrated on the company's finances.  I agree that remedial action is needed urgently to restore the company's financial strength.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the vital importance of the role played by employees in Aer Lingus. In the midst of the current problems it is critical as everybody agreed that the morale of staff in the company should not be undermined.  It is worth repeating my conviction expressed in the Dáil that Aer Lingus is a people company, built upon the quality and commitment of its staff since its foundation and because of this has survived many crises in the past and will do so again.</P>
    <P>Current staff in Aer Lingus have not only shown commitment but have also made sacrifices over the past two years in the interests of the company.  I want not only to acknowledge these sacrifices but to express my appreciation of them. I ask Senator O'Toole to note these views which he knows as he and I have discussed this before, I hold passionately.</P>
    <P>In relation to the workforce, one of the points I made to the board of the company &mdash; there is no harm in my talking about it now because for some strange reason it became public knowledge and many things that did not happen at the board meeting were also circulated in the national media &mdash; was that I did not think that downsizing the airline, which is one of the scare stories being put around at present, would be the answer to the airline's <Col N="1110" /> problems.  I told the board they had a lot to learn from the United States experience where when airlines got into difficulties they downsized the airline, made low cost employees redundant, held on to high cost employees and high overheads so that many airlines ended up in chapter 11 and that that was not the answer.  The board have the benefit of the experience of the United States and I did not think that they should go down that road.</P>
    <P>I also said something to the board which for some reason was not talked about publicly and that was that I felt Aer Lingus as well as being a people company was a company of partnership. I compared it to the decision by the Government in 1987 that the only way to deal with our difficult financial circumstances was for Government and social partners to plan a programme together.  We have seen how well the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have worked.  I gave those two examples at the board meeting and said that that was the way forward for board, the management and staff.  This point was also made forcefully here today by Senator Wright.  There is an opportunity there for a three way partnership with the board in the leading role, supporting and informing management and the workforce at all times.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan made a constructive contribution and I support most of his points.  There are two points of clarification, however, that I must make.  The Exchequer did not give an annual subsidy to Aer Lingus for its transatlantic operation. It got a once off injection some years ago.  Secondly, Aer Lingus management specifically said that it did not want or need equity for its European fleet.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senator Costello for endorsing many of my views and I hope he will read my speech if he has any spare time over the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only waiting for the Minister to finish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is heartening today to have such cross-party support <Col N="1111" /> in this debate.  In reply to Senator Costello's point about an air transport policy, I dealt with that matter comprehensively in my speech today and in the speech I made in the Dáil debate some time ago.  We have a fully integrated air transport policy.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to be party political I want to thank Senator Wright for his comments which as usual were not only constructive but innovative.  It is no secret in this House or outside it that he has worked incessantly and with great determination behind the scenes researching trends in international aviation in an effort to bring forward solutions to the problems currently facing the airline.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright raised the question of EC funding for aircraft, which was also raised by a number of other speakers. Senator Wright in this House and elsewhere has stressed how important it is to improve our access transport services in order to help offset the disadvantages of Ireland's peripherality and I agree with that sentiment.</P>
      <P>When I took office I found that the European Commission had refused Ireland's application for EC funding of mobile assets in December last year and among the reasons cited by the Commission were difficulties in relation to distortion of competition.  I felt that that was not good enough and following direct personal intervention by me the Commission agreed to consider a renewed application in which we addressed the concerns they had expressed.  This renewed application was forwarded to the Commission in April of this year and there has been further intensive and extensive negotiations since then.  I am at present awaiting a response from the Commission on my latest proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also raised this issue and I would like to thank him for his support in this House.  He is a fellow trade unionist and was my trade union representative when I was a member of his union some years ago.  I ask him to give the kind of support he gave here in <Col N="1112" /> relation to our application for EC funding for mobile assets at international fora, and particularly within an EC context because such support from the trade union movement is extremely important and would assist me to press this country's case for funding for mobile assets.</P>
    <P>Senator Wright also made the innovative suggestion that Aer Rianta should take a shareholding in Aer Lingus.  I will certainly consider this.  However, I foresee major problems here in that while Aer Rianta is one of the best State owned businesses, as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies pointed out, it has very high borrowings. Furthermore the trend internationally over recent years has been to take airlines out of airport management business.  An Aer Rianta stake in Aer Lingus might also cause problems on the competition front <i>vis-a-vis</i> the EC Commission but I will consider the suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Senator's view on an employee shared option scheme is one which intuitively I find attractive and I imagine many Members would too.  As he said, this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance and I know he is making strong representations to him.  I will raise the question with the Minister, Deputy B. Ahern, and I am sure that in an effort to find a solution to the financial difficulties of the company, he will consider that suggestion carefully.</P>
    <P>I would like to be able to respond in more detail to a number of points made by other Senators but my time is limited. I look forward to coming to this House on many future occasions as a representative of a Fianna Fáil Government to respond to debates.  I hope that when we return in three, four or five weeks time to the other House there will be at least one Senator fewer in this House who may well join me.  I suggest the Aer Lingus workforce have a champion in Senator Wright and that they should at this time support champions.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
