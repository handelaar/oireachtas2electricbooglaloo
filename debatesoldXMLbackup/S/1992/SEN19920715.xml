      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that the inquiry instituted into the case of the Tallaght Two, 18 months ago be completed without delay; and that the findings be made public.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intervene directly in the case of an Irish citizen (details supplied) held in a British mental hospital for the past eight years without conviction of a criminal offence, and without recourse to the courts, in order to secure his transfer to an Irish facility.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is item No. 1 between now and 2.30 p.m. and it <Col N="2074" /> is proposed that all stages be completed. It is proposed to take item No. 2 between 2.30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and that all Stages be completed.  It is also proposed to take Second Stage of item No. 3, between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. and to have a sos between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  Without wishing to pre-empt what the leaders of the party groups will say I understand they have agreed to those proposals and I thank them for that.</P>

      <P>Clearly the spirit of Bastille Day lasted only one day as we face two guillotines today.  On the Order of Business, may I offer those taking part in the talks in Stormont today every good wish from all sides of this House.  I hope their efforts will be successful.  Will the Leader of the House clarify the status of item No. 2, the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1992?  Is it a Government Bill?  Yesterday in the House the leader of the Progressive Democrats here said this was typical Fianna Fáil legislation.</P>

I join with Senator Manning in wishing the historic talks at Stormont well.  On the <Col N="2075" /> Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, I am sure the Progressive Democrats will continue to speak against it but will vote for it.</P>

The last meeting of such standing involved the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, more than 18 years ago.  The talks are historic, whether people like to agree or not.  I would ask the Leader of the House between now and our return in September to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who has been so open and gracious to this House, to tell us about the talks and the point they have reached, if that is in order.  As regards who is in Government and what has been said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure all of us wish the talks well.  Even if they progress slowly, at least they will have progressed, and obviously our hope is that peace will ensue.

      <P>First, I join with Senator Lydon in wishing the Pope well and, secondly, I echo the remarks made in relation to the talks commencing at Stormont. The suggestion made by Senator Honan is an excellent one that at the beginning of the next session we would have the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, in the House to give us a briefing on the situation.  I wish to express my disappointment that we are imposing the guillotine again today, particularly in relation to the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1992.  In a situation where we have to put so much legislation through the House, when the Dáil has risen, and we cannot introduce amendments, I ask the Leader to address that unsatisfactory situation for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Leader of the House would consider giving additional time to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992. This is very important legislation which affects the lives of many people throughout the country.  We have three and a half hours to discuss this Bill on which 53 amendments have been tabled.  I respectfully suggest to the Leader of the House that that is not sufficient time and I would ask that additional time be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always wish people well and I would be quite happy to agree with Senator Lydon that the Head of the Vatican State be wished well in his illness. In regard to the elimination of Private Members' Time and the elimination of issues of topical debate, perhaps when the Leader was telling us about his enthusiasm for Bastille Day he was thinking of guillotines in other places.  Does he have any idea as to when we will resume business: will it be October, November or even September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much point in wishing the participants in the Northern talks well &mdash; which is a very easy thing to do &mdash; if all of us do not make the effort to formulate an opinion and to prepare the public for what may be a very painful compromise on our traditional aspirations.  On a lighter note in relation to the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, may I suggest that if the Progressive Democrats are having difficulty they might have a chat with Senator Honan about the facts of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not have his chat with me in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader is getting off very lightly.  Senators are in a jovial mood this morning.  I did not see any break in the guillotine yesterday afternoon <Col N="2079" /> when a Bill was being debated on which several Senators, myself included were denied the opportunity to speak. Having pressed my point I was eventually given two minutes in which time I could say very little of what I wanted to say about the Bill.  In effect, the guillotine was used yesterday.  Also, we had the ridiculous situation of an amendment being tabled to that Bill and the Minister replying to that amendment in detail when in fact we, the Senators of this House, had not received that amendment. I would like an explanation for that.  Surely if a Senator puts down an amendment and the Minister, who is the guest of the House, is in possession of the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister replied to it in this House yesterday without the Members present having a copy of it. The amendment was not even put to the House.  I would like an explanation and I would inform my colleague that the guillotine was used in a very severe manner yesterday on very important legislation in which, apparently, Senators were far more interested than Members of the other House.  It should not be assumed when legislation is passed rapidly by the other House rapidly that it will have a similar passage through this House.  We should be given every opportunity to discuss any legislation that comes here irrespective of how the other House treats it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer first to the comments of Senator Lydon.  I certainly support what he described as a liberal agenda.  I would also say that the present Pope is not somebody towards whom I feel any political affinity or any great personal warmth but I would have no difficulty whatever in sending him an expression of goodwill and good wishes to someone facing a serious operation.  If Senator Lydon wishes to do that he can certainly add my name to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the liberal agenda, motion 42 deals with the judgment of the European Court.  I should like to put a general question to the Leader of the House in the light of this continuing scandal, and of the fact that during the court case the judges criticised the Oireachtas for not acting and that newspapers and radio today contain reports of various courts criticising the Oireachtas in regard to legislation: is he satisfied with the legislative progress these Houses have made in view of the fact that we are so heavily criticised?</P>

      <P>Obviously we have had a very extensive programme of legislation and I thank the House for its co-operation in getting it through.  The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill is part of the Programme for Government and will be dealt with accordingly today. With Senators Manning, Upton, O'Toole and Honan I extend my good wishes to those involved in the talks in Northern Ireland today.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Before we commence Committee Stage I would like to point out that amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19, 21, 37 and 43 are out of order as they involve a charge on the revenue; amendments Nos. 17 and 22 are out of order as they are not relevant to the Bill as read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 not moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;established purchase scheme&rsquo; means a scheme under section 26 of this Act for the sale of houses by a housing authority which is ongoing and under which the purchaser may, at any time, make application for the purchase of a house;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is very important that this amendment be included in this Bill; what is why I submitted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a permanent tenant purchase scheme for local authority dwellings. I would not favour writing mandatory requirements of this type into primary legislation.  It has always been the accepted practice that primary enabling legislation would leave it up to the Government of the day to decide whether a purchase scheme should be introduced, on what terms and having regard to all of the circumstances at that time.  Most Senators will understand that this has worked well and that there is no good reason to depart from this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as drafted, would allow for a permanent purchase scheme, that <Col N="2082" /> is, a scheme without a time limit if that was what was decided at the time, and the Government of the day would have that option.  One can see the merits of such a scheme but I do not want to rule out completely the option of having a time limited scheme, particularly in relation to certain types of dwellings.  We have the best of both worlds in the Bill. The section provides for a scheme which may well continue if that is what the Government of the day decide or, alternatively, for a limited scheme &mdash; that is a limit on time &mdash; for particular types of dwellings.  It is better to leave the flexibility there in the primary legislation and not try to make that alteration.  I would ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the enthusiasm of the Minister for not having a defined purchase scheme enshrined in section 1 of the Bill.  As it turns out, at present we have no purchase scheme to facilitate people who want to purchase their local authority house.  The last scheme was introduced about three years ago and lasted for about 12 months.  Now that it has ended, there is no scheme.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure the right of a tenant of a local authority house to purchase that house at any time.  At present, this cannot be done.  People are being victimised in that they do not have the opportunity to purchase their local authority houses because there is no scheme to enable them to do so.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment hoping the Minister would be flexible in his approach, knowing that he has served on a local authority and knowing that he realises how important it is that people be encouraged to purchase their houses. I hope he will take this amendment on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions that I was extremely anxious to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme once the social housing plan and the legislative framework which underpins that is established and the local authority system have had the opportunity <Col N="2083" /> to work on a variety of schemes aimed at solving housing problems in a new and distinctly different way.</P>
      <P>The Senator is right when he says we do not have a purchase scheme at present.  The last scheme was introduced in 1988.  It was available to tenants for about nine months and there were about 40,000 applicants of which 30,000 have now completed all the legal transactions in relation to the purchase scheme.  I hope, however, under this Bill that any new tenant purchase scheme would involve much greater private financial resources.  For that reason I am negotiating with the banks and the building societies with a view to encouraging investment from these sectors in this area.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten will appreciate that very considerable resources are required for the purchase of these houses.  I am anxious to facilitate new ownership and the transfer of ownership from local authorities to tenants.  I am considering all these options.  The section in this Bill which we are dealing with enables me or any future Minister to introduce a scheme depending on the circumstances of the time.  It enables him to have a permanent scheme if that is what he decides.  It also allows for a time limited scheme if that option were taken on board.</P>
      <P>No way will I allow Senator Naughten to interpret what I have said as being in any way against the introduction of a house purchase scheme.  We do not have a scheme at the moment but I am trying to remedy that within the context of this Bill and in a way which will be as light as possible on the taxpaying community while at the same time facilitating the tenants who want to purchase their houses.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to hear the Minister indicate that he does not rule out the possibility of a tenant purchase scheme at some future date because the figures he has quoted of 30,000 tenants having availed of the 1988 tenant purchase scheme shows that that scheme was a tremendous success.  In view of the fact <Col N="2084" /> that adequate resources are not available for maintenance of council houses, it is important that we would have the option of introducing a tenant purchase scheme at some later stage to allow tenants who want to purchase their own homes to do so.  That has been a very successful scheme and I would like to see something similar introduced at a later stage perhaps after the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> has been given time to work.  I accept that there has not been sufficient time yet for the various schemes to work.  I am glad the Minister has said that at some later stage he will allow a tenant purchase scheme to proceed again.</P>

      <P>This is so important that we do not have any choice but to press it because, as I have already pointed out people living in a local authority house should have the option to buy out their house.  They do not have that option at present.  I understand it is up to the Minister to introduce this at whatever time he wishes, but for the past two years there has been no scheme and we have to depend on the whim of the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>People who want to buy out their local authority house are entitled to do so and I appeal to the Minister to take this amendment on board.  It is a reasonable amendment.  It does not involve a charge on the Exchequer.  In fact, previous Ministers for the Environment encouraged people to purchase their local authority houses because that would absolve the local authority of the responsibility to maintain those houses.  It is only right and proper that we should have a permanent purchase scheme in place.</P>

      <P>Let me register a mild note of dissent.  I am fascinated by people who are madly keen on the market economy in principle but who, when it comes to tenant purchase schemes are madly keen on giving people the maximum possible taxpayer subsidy to pay bargain basement prices for the best quality houses constructed in the State.  I have major problems in relation to under-pricing of local authority house purchase schemes, and anything other than what reflects the real input of the tenant over a period of time into the purchase of the house.  Effectively, it is giving away an extraordinarily expensive resource and there are other far more economically efficient ways of ensuring home ownership than bargain basement sales of local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not altogether agree with Senator Ryan but at least he has brought some balance into this question. It is not just a matter of saying that houses may be purchased without recourse to the taxpayer.  There is recourse to the taxpayer in a number of significant ways. Up to now the mortgage arrangements for tenant purchase are provided by the local authority and, as a consequence, are a charge on the Exchequer.  Second, the cost of constructing these houses and the subsidy paid each week by the taxpayer to meet the cost of local authority houses is quite substantial.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten will be aware that in addition to the rental income on local authority houses which are now purchased, a further £25 million is required each year for maintenance.  There are substantial sums of money involved.  We should take some further time to evaluate the various options that are open to us. We must also take account of the fact that the amount of local authority housing stock which become available to qualified applicants as a result of casual vacancies would not be greatly increased if all of the local authority housing stock is sold into private ownership.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash; It shall be a principal objective of national housing policy that, before 31st December, 1999, all families be accommodated in spacious and comfortable housing at a cost they can afford, and be located in an external environment which is pleasant and wholesome.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that this amendment be accepted.  Having listened to the Minister on the last amendment, I wonder has a situation been reached where none of our amendments, no matter how reasonable, will be accepted? The other question is whether there is much point in this House sitting at all when the other House is in recess because Ministers are not going to accept amendments here.  Nevertheless, I intend to proceed with the amendments I have down and to press them.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Senators on the other side of the House to give me that generous support that will ensure that when this Bill leaves this House we will have legislation that can operate on the ground as those of us who are members of local authorities would like to see it operate. It is a reasonable amendment and will enshrine in this Bill the type and quality of housing we require.  That should be our aim for every family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree strongly with Senator Honan on this.  It is important for us to seek to enshrine in legislation our objectives in regard to social housing and other areas such as the protection of tenants in private housing.  In Dublin City Council we have created a parallel by drawing up a civic charter.  That civic charter, which has an operational period of five or six years, enshrines as a priority the tackling of the housing crisis facing low income families by a building, renovation, utilisation and maintenance programme to ensure minimum standards for all dwellings by 1996 and by working in conjunction with the Housing Finance Agency and the Voluntary Housing Association.  The new Lord Mayor of Dublin has declared housing to be one of his priorities.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the overview and recognise that while we are making provision in legislation for specific matters, we have to ensure that everybody lives in reasonable, decent and hygienic housing.  Unfortunately, this is not the case at present.  There is a very small number of vacant local authority houses, especially in Dublin city where there are at least ten people for each vacant house. Of course, the problem has been exacerbated by the number of emigrants who have returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very big homeless problem. Anybody who reads the Focus Point report published this year will realise how serious this problem is.  The report says that in a one year period the hostels for <Col N="2088" /> the homeless provided emergency accommodation for an estimated 6,000 people and it cost them £20,000 per month to provide bed and breakfast.</P>
    <P>Housing construction has virtually stopped.  In 1981 £52.5 million was spent on a total of 1,520 units of accommodation in Dublin city.  In 1991, £2.81 million was spent on 25 units of accommodation. It is not surprising that we have a housing crisis.  I am worried that we are tinkering to a degree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting to it.  The Cathaoirleach is the person who should indicate whether I am straying from the amendment.  We have to look at the issue in the context of a national housing policy, to which this amendment refers. We are not putting enough resources into providing houses for the homeless or the refurbishing of houses.  In 1987 Dublin City Council, as requested by the Minister for the Environment, put together an emergency refurbishment programme and they listed various flat complexes &mdash; Cherry Orchard, Darndale, Fatima Mansions, St. Mary's Mansions, Ballymun, Oliver Bond House, Blessington Street and St. Joseph's Mansions.  Apart from St. Mary's Mansions, they have not been able to refurbish any of the complexes on this approval list as they cannot get funding from the Minister.  They have also a list which has not yet been approved by the Department of the Environment.  The Department have approved one list but Dublin City Council are unable to proceed with the work. An article in a recent newspaper reported conditions in St. Joseph's Mansions. There are no bathrooms there and children are washed in the sink used for washing dishes.  The flats are literally falling apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inadequacy both in terms of refurbishment and the building of houses.  It is estimated that 1,500 people in Dublin city who should properly be housed by the corporation are living in private accommodation.  As approximately <Col N="2089" /> 1,000 of these people have families, we are talking of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people.  Because of the shortage of houses, private housing is getting very expensive.  There is a very poor level of monitoring of the conditions. The State, in other words the taxpayer, is paying for this accommodation.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment. Until we enshrine a national housing policy in legislation we will be never able to force the Government to provide the necessary funding and resources.  I ask the Minister to recognise the housing crisis in the context of this legislation.  We are tinkering with social legislation and until we provide the funding to build houses for those who are unable to house themselves we will not address the real problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pious aspirations are all very fine but they need legal force. Eamon de Valera wrote the highest of social aspirations into the Constitution but then inserted a clause which said they could have no legal effect and were there simply to inspire us.  This amendment would be fine if it could make some difference. The Government and their predecessors have taken the best part of £1 billion out of the housing budget since 1987.  If that money had been spent on housing, we would not have half the problems we now have.  Fine Gael are in favour of reducing public expenditure but if we want a decent public housing programme we cannot reduce expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My problem with the amendment relates to the word &ldquo;families&rdquo;.  There are more people in need of housing than families.  Under the Supreme Court definition &ldquo;family&rdquo; means a family based on marriage.  As a result, single parents, single people, young people and many other categories would be effectively excluded.  This may not have been the intent, but I am wary of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  It is a word President George Bush is using with increasing enthusiasm to get himself re-elected.  It is a word that should be used with great care.  The words &ldquo;Persons&rdquo;, &ldquo;people&rdquo;, or &ldquo;individuals&rdquo;<Col N="2090" /> would be fine.  To make the accommodation of families the number one objective in housing legislation is effectively, although it may not be the intention, to exclude many other categories, some of whom are in extreme need, particularly single parents to whom Senator Costello referred to.  Some people may argue that that is a statement of priorities, which would mean other people would have to wait for housing until the objectives were met.  I hope Senator Naughten will not put his amendment to a vote.  If he does, I will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have to strive to ensure that housing conditions are improved.  I have a clear vision as to how this can be achieved.  However, it cannot be achieved if we continue to think along traditional lines.  We have to create new and different options.  We have to involve the voluntary and private sectors.  Local authority and private housing have to be developed as part of one housing programme. Most speakers who contribute to debates on housing either deliberately or inadvertently refer to the number of local authority houses that have been built or are about to start, as if this was the only solution to the housing problem. While the number of local authority houses built will always form an integral part of the solution to our housing problem, it is only one part of the solution.</P>
      <P>As Senator Costello will be aware, there was no remedical scheme, no urban renewal scheme and no bathroom scheme in 1986-87.  People may say that expenditure of approximately £16 million provided by the taxpayer is not enough. It is unfair of them to say that if they do not say where more can be got and who is prepared to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brendan Ryan that the concept of a family has changed; we now talk about households. The total number on the housing list at present is 23,000.  Of that number 6,800 are single persons, 2,400 are married couples without children and there are many thousands of lone parents.  Because of these changed circumstances, we have to adopt new provisions.  The housing plan which was first published in February 1991 will shortly be enacted.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Naughten's frustration at the possibility of not having amendments accepted.  The Dáil is in recess and if I accept amendments this Bill cannot be enacted into law and some of the provisions in the Bill cannot be put into effect.  The most desirable thing we can do is enact this Bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Some Senators referred to the regulations. I will respond to these points as best I can.  I want to achieve more cohesion between the private, voluntary and public sectors in attacking this problem on every front.  I am in the process of trying to find additional resources which will help us in our quest to ensure that progress is made in providing the best possible housing for our people.  There is no fundamental disagreement on these aims.  One cannot attempt to put those aims into legislation unless a very thorough analysis is carried out over the next seven years to all factors involved, for example, economic factors, emigration, internal migration and unemployment. One would also have to consider the costs involved; for example, every local authority house built this year will cost about £90,000 over the next 20 years.  That has to be funded by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained many times before, we have a huge dependency rate in our economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners: the ratio is about 2½:1, that is, one <Col N="2092" /> person working for two and a half dependants or ten people working for 25 dependants.  There are other ways to approach the issue.  One way is to try to involve the banks and building societies to a much greater extent in the tenant purchase scheme.  This would enable us to free more resources and ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that all people live in decent housing.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the range of options available.  It is possible in 1992 to provide housing accommodation for 7,000 households. This covers all the schemes and casual vacancies but does not include the bathroom scheme, the remedial schemes and the other urban renewal developments. That is a reasonable projection. However, we must do it fairly and squarely, look at the schemes, see how they are to be financed and who is to pay.  It is not enough to put forward an aspiration. As Minister for the Environment I will be fighting for all the funds I can get. If anybody can tell me where additional funds can be found I would be very glad to hear from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority for 17 years I am glad the Minister is looking at other ways of solving the problem than simply putting pressure on local authorities to build houses as fast as they can.  It did not matter what the houses were like; the party in Government wanted to be in a position at the next general election to boast that they had built more houses than any other Government.  It was a disgraceful approach to housing, but that was the reality.  I am glad this approach is being changed.  I am also glad more emphasis is being placed on the maintenance, improvement and upgrading of local authority flats, etc., under the bathroom and urban renewal schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister sounded very plausible when he said he could not accept amendments as the Dáil is in recess and he did not want to delay implementation of the Bill.  Is he aware that this House passed an average of three quarters of a Bill every week for the first eight weeks and has passed four Bills a week for the last <Col N="2093" /> three weeks?  I no longer believe it is simply a matter of inefficiency.  If it was, it would be gross and bumbling inefficiency.  I have to conclude that there is a concerted organised effort to rush these Bills through the House &mdash; 12 Bills in three weeks &mdash; so that Members do not have the opportunity to make amendments.</P>

      <P>All of us want to see an expanding housing policy.  We realise it must be funded from somewhere.  I refer particularly to the Dún Laoghaire area. Some of the older houses in the area were <Col N="2094" /> neglected and much work needs to be done.  The Minister must assess the amount to be spent on constructing new houses and on refurbishing older houses. Very few new houses are being built, but the Department are involved in various refurbishment schemes.  The Minister should make a list of priorities in respect of refurbishment of existing dwellings and the construction of new houses.  An overview must be taken.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire Borough Council made submissions to the Department as long ago as 1988 and 1989 but when we are approached by people living in the area we cannot tell them whether anything is about to happen.  Obviously we do not expect the Minister to write a cheque for several millions for Dún Laoghaire but we need an indication that progress will be made in certain areas.  We also need to know how many new houses will come onstream.  The housing list grows monthly.  There are difficulties in the shared ownership scheme but there are certain people on the housing list who, if given half the chance, would be prepared to make the effort.  People must be removed from squalid conditions, and we must aim at certain levels.  There is no point in making bland statements about Utopia.  We must live in the real world.</P>

We should have the opportunity of introducing amendments which can be passed and sent to the Dáil.  I do not reflect on the bona fides of the Minister's intention with regard to this legislation but we are operating in limbo.</P>
      <P>I accept everything in the legislation but I have reservations about some of the proposals.  Nevertheless I am prepared to see how the provisions will work.  We must also look at the fact that we have literally stopped building houses.  I gave the figures earlier, indicating that £50 million was spent in a period of ten years and that the figure now is approximately £2 million.  What building activity there is in Dublin is in Sheriff Street on the basis of de-tenanting the old jerry-built flats without urban planning.  There are also a couple of small schemes.  In Portland Row there is a refurbishment scheme involving 13 old houses.  Four of them were allocated last week and the lowest number of points was 98.  It is expected by the local authority that the number of points required for these houses will not be below 95.  We can see the great demand for housing.  We must consider this in relation to unemployed. The problem is growing with the number of people becoming unemployed.</P>

      <P>We could all subscribe to the sentiments expressed in the amendment tabled by Senator Naughten, but surely it is not necessary to have those aspirations enshrined in legislation.  I do not think any Government could do that. There is a very difficult question of resources.  It is not a cheap job to create houses for the huge number of applicants who are on the housing list at present. All the Government can do is try, as the resources become available, to do the best they can.  The Minister has said that this year 7,000 applicants will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The plan for social housing introduced by the Government will help to eliminate the huge housing list.  There are various options in that plan such as shared ownership, mortgage subsidy and so on.  If that plan is implemented properly by the local authorities it will help reduce the housing list substantially.</P>
      <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out, it is not just a question of building local authority houses.  There are other elements which should be brought into this scheme such as the private sector, the banks, the building societies and so on.  They have a part to play too.  That, coupled with the plan for social housing, will help reduce substantially the huge housing list.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he is very keen to get this Bill through.  I am intrigued that there is no commencement date for this Bill that its provisions will come into force when the Minister sees fit.  That does not suggest a huge enthusiasm on his part.  He wants the Bill put through but it will be at his discretion when various sections of it will come into force.  If he wants me to suggest where the funds will come from, I suggest he could have a lower threshold for the property tax and the income related residential <Col N="2098" /> property tax.  The threshold is excessively generous.  People in my income bracket can well afford to pay it and should be doing so.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned Dún Laoghaire and told us about the housing problem there.  Dún Laoghaire has fewer homeless people than any other urban area in the country, according to the Department's figures.  The Department's housing report for 1991, shows there are two homeless people in the whole of Dún Laoghaire.  There are 350 in Cork, which at a guess has about the same population. I am intrigued as to how they can have an expanding number of people on the housing list and virtually no home-lessness. Maybe they know something we do not; maybe they have a policy provision we do not have or maybe they do not bother to count them.  The Minister should inquire in Dún Laoghaire about the apparent absence of a homelessness problem.</P>

    <P>The Minister, said he was not trying to steamroll this Bill through.  I do not know whether he is trying or not but it is being streamrolled through.  Perhaps the Minister and his Department were tardy in bringing forward the Bill.  I do not know what the problem is.  We can only deal with the facts here.  Perhaps the Minister, and his Department, could have brought it to the Dáil a little sooner and it would have come here a little sooner.  For the Minister to suggest, as he rather offensively put it, that the meanderings of anybody in this House would not be allowed to hold up his objectives in responding to the housing crisis is very insulting.  It is perfectly clear that everybody in this House is as anxious as the Minister to respond to the housing problem. I am very amused to hear the Minister say that he will spend all day and all <Col N="2099" /> night if necessary discussing the Bill with us.

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gravely concerned about section 2, which deals with shared ownership leases, and on Second Stage debate I spoke at length on the issue.  My amendments to the section dealt with the quality of housing and the ambitions and aims that we, as elected representatives, should have in this regard.  Basically, we should try to improve the quality of housing.  Two of my amendments have been ruled out of order on the grounds that they might incur a charge on the Exchequer.  I do not believe that they would involve a potential charge.  Rather, I consider that they express an ambition for the best possible quality of housing, something that each and every one of us as elected representatives, whether we be members of local authorities, Members of this House or of the Dáil, should strive to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under a shared ownership arrangement an individual might buy a half share in a house, with the local authority owning the other half, and then some 20 years later might have to buy the other half of the house at an index-linked price.  That is crazy.  If the Bill goes through and if shared ownership becomes a fact of life, I appeal to the Minister to at least ensure that people are able to buy back, at whatever stage they wish, into the other half share at the cost on the original date of purchase.  If that is not done some people will never, in a whole lifetime, be able to <Col N="2101" /> own their own house.  As the Minister knows, it is the pride and ambition of everybody in this country to own his or her own home.  Under the shared ownership scheme effectively people for the first 25 years will pay off the mortgage on the first portion of a house and then will have to remortgage and spend the next 25 years paying off the second portion. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to at least ensure that people will be able to buy the second portion of the house at the original cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support everything that Senator Naughten has said on this issue.  I have two points that I should like to share with the House.</P>
      <P>My first concern relates to the purchase of a portion of a house by mortgage, with rental payments being made on the other portion of the house, the other portion also being purchased on the repayment of the mortgage on the first portion of the house.  The scheme certainly will not get off the ground unless the price of the second portion of a house is tied to the cost price at the time the first mortgage was entered into.  An index-linked system whereby the cost of inflation added to the cost of the final lump sum to be paid after the first mortgage was paid off, or to be renegotiated under a new mortgage, would be a very poor deal for our tenants. The Minister should remember that they are people at the lower end of the income scale.  It could happen that generations of a family had to make payments before their house was fully paid off.  The primary concern is to peg the amount dealt with at first by way of rental payments and due for payment after the completion of purchase of the first portion of a house to the cost of the house at contractual stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to address the question of whether the unemployed might be brought into this scheme.  For an example, the House could consider a case I am trying to deal with at present. An individual who was employed purchased a small one-bedroomed house some year ago.  That person is now unemployed but does have an asset and is <Col N="2102" /> therefore not eligible for direct housing from the corporation.  It would be ideal if that person were able to sell the one-bedroomed house and use the proceeds not only as a deposit but as a means of paying off what would be the mortgaged sum on the first portion of a house under the sharded ownership scheme &mdash; whether that portion be 25 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent.  The individual could then pay rent on the outstanding amount of money.  There are many people who would have bought a low cost, small house, particularly in the inner city areas where there are many one-bedroomed houses, old artisan houses and so on, but because their family has grown they need rehousing as they are in over-crowded accommodation. We do not have a scheme to deal with those people.  I consider that the shared ownership scheme, even without amendment, would be flexible enough to bring in those people if the Minister would allow the entire deposit on a house to be considered as a mortgage.  In other words, instead of the purchaser making a small deposit on the mortgaged portion of a house and then entering into a repayment arrangement for 20 years or more, the deposit would be extended to cover 25 per cent or more of the actual purchase price and the individual would then enter into a rental arrangement under which, because of unemployment, he or she would be entitled to certain subsidies from the authorities.  The problem of the unemployed who are in need of accommodation could be addressed in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The social housing plan was launched in February 1991 and about 240 applicants were approved for shared ownership arrangements before the end of 1991.  In the first three months of this year that figure trebled.  Although there may be doubts about the shared ownership scheme and there may be reluctance on the part of certain elected representatives and local authority officials in some places to recognise the good sense behind the scheme, the applicants who come within the range of qualification <Col N="2103" /> are recognising the sense of the scheme.</P>
      <P>When considering the options that could be provided for home ownership the Government took the opportunity to examine what was happening in other countries.  We looked close to home to determine what was happening in Northern Ireland.  I am happy to tell the Seanad that in the North of Ireland 13,000 households have embraced the shared ownership scheme, which is named the co-ownership scheme up there.  The scheme is working very successfully in the North of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the normal way we would encourage and would like everybody to purchase or own their own house by conventional methods.  The simple reality is that there are a great number of applicants who very much desire home ownership but because of the constraints of their family income or their personal income, and having regard to the repayments that would be necessary under conventional mortgages from building societies, local authorities and so on, they are not able to purchase their own house.  We would not be confronted with such circumstances if all those on the approved housing lists were in a position to own their house and wished to do so from the moment of purchase.  Therefore we must ascertain whether there is another way in which we can help individuals, families or households to purchase their homes under a shared ownership scheme.</P>
      <P>There are a great number of applicants &mdash; I have given the House the numbers of people in households under co-ownership arrangements in the North of Ireland, 13,000 &mdash; and if one examines the position on a population comparative basis, it would appear there are at least 26,000 applicants in the South who would fit into that category.  Are we not then to provide those applicants with any new option or facility?  Those Senators who have had the experience of wanting to purchase something but did not have the requisite financial resources to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;decided they would wait until such time as they had the requisite resources.  But within the intervening period &mdash; as they will have endeavoured to put together the necessary finances &mdash; they will have found that the cost of the product, house or whatever, will have continued to rise substantially above the prevailing inflation levels.  This will have meant that, three or four years later, having put those savings together, they were then further away from the possibility of purchase than they had been before.  Therefore we said, &ldquo;No.  We will strike at it now.  We will ascertain whether we can help such households achieve shared ownership&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The system is simple in the sense that one can purchase up to 75 per cent of ownership of one's house in the first instance.  Most people referred to a 50 per cent ownership.  We will accept that. The argument advanced by Senator Costello was that the value of the remaining part of the equity held by the relevant local authority should be withheld or stand still.  What we have endeavoured to achieve is that that would rise, not in the way in which housing values might rise &mdash; the House will be aware how they can escalate from time to time &mdash; but would merely keep pace with the value of money.  People will be in a position to own the full house.  They will have the option of selling the house.  It is important to put this into some overall financial context.</P>
      <P>I did not have the opportunity a few minutes ago to refer to references to earlier housing developments nationwide. The fact is that this year I have to find £200 million within my Department to meet the loan repayments on commitments entered into over time by local authorities nationwide.  That money has to be found.  When it comes to making provision for doing more than that, one has to find the necessary resources and take them from somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are endeavouring here, in line with what is happening in other countries &mdash;<Col N="2105" /> with an exceptionally good experience in the North &mdash; to introduce an innovative scheme.  Indeed, I might compliment local authorities and elected representatives who are putting their full weight behind the implementation of this scheme.  I regret that its implementation is not even nationwide.  There remain some local authorities who are reluctant to implement its provisions.  I want to encourage housing officers and elected representatives nationwide to see the wisdom of providing an opportunity for families or households who do not have any other choice available, who want to own their homes but have not the requisite financial resources to enable them to do so.  If they are to wait until such time as they have the requisite savings the likelihood will be that the gap between them and the purchase of their homes will be even greater.  We are bridging that gap.</P>
    <P>Senators, and Deputies in the other House, will realise that, even though we had arguments about amendments, we are dealing with amendments which have been lifted almost in their pure form from those before the other House which were rejected there.  Therefore, in one way, I suppose one could contend the Seanad is not placed at any greater disadvantage than the other House in that context.  But in neither House was cognisance taken of the fact that we provide a rental subsidy under this scheme which helps eligible applicants and new co-owners of houses in the rental cost of that part of the equity they have still to purchase.</P>
    <P>Much consideration has been given to ensuring that the scheme will work.  I am delighted to see the nationwide response to it, although I should like it to be greater in some places.  But already, at this point in the year, a few local authorities have expended their full financial allocation for this purpose.  They have put a determined push behind the provisions of the scheme.  Clearly it is working. In the light of experience any technical or other legal difficulties that have arisen on the part of local authorities have been remedied in this Bill, <Col N="2106" /> thereby freeing up the scheme for quicker implementation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senators that the shared home ownership option while not being the only solution meets a particular need. It is designed for a particular category of households, people who have no choice, who are unable to purchase their homes though they wish to do so.  In this scheme we are facilitating such people to the greatest possible extent, very much in line with what has been the experience elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's reply.  Under this shared ownership scheme, or what I might describe as a hare-brained scheme, people will never own their homes.  This is my objection to it.  The average person will take out a mortgage at, probably, 30 years of age.  Under this scheme that person will have reached age 50 or 60 before that mortgage is repaid.  This means that such a person will never see the end of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the trebling of applicants in the first three months of this year.  That is still a trivial number given our current huge housing problem nationwide.  It is a clear indication that the rank and file have no interest in this scheme.  Given the diabolical housing conditions many families are subjected to, they are still not opting for this scheme because they can see no end to their commitments or repayments.  That is my objection to it.  I contend that those who opt for this scheme will have a loaded revolver pointed at their foreheads as there is no alternative available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority housing building programme has dried up completely, or as near as makes no difference.  For example in my county where there were 80 houses built annually four years ago, only 15 are now being built.  That is a disgrace.  An applicant on the Roscommon local authority housing list today could wait 12 years before being allocated a local authority house.  Such people will not become involved or participate in this scheme.  People in rural areas are a proud people who want to <Col N="2107" /> own their homes and see an end to the line.  The Minister would have to agree with me that whenever any purchase scheme was offered, by and large people in rural areas bought out their homes, whereas under his social housing policy they will never be given such an opportunity. The Minister referred to experiences in other countries.  He should remember that other countries have not our tradition of home ownership.  We like to own our homes.  People will never be afforded that opportunity under this social housing policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier he will not accept amendments.  However, he must recognise that this social housing policy, this joint ownership on the part of tenant and local authority, is not feasible.  He should recognise that from the start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reject out of hand Senator Naughten's contention.  I am a little surprised at his resistance to new thinking.  I am also surprised that he would find something fundamentally unacceptable about the scheme which is innovative and provides for a subsidy on the remaining part of the equity for qualified households.  Yet he could find nothing wrong with the Fine Gael ending the Housing Finance Agency's index-linked scheme without any subsidy, a few years ago.  The Senator is making the mistake of confining himself to thinking that this is the only scheme available, is suitable for certain applicants and not for others.  New housing construction will meet the needs of other eligible households, such as work in lieu of local authority housing, extensions, voluntary schemes and remedial schemes.  The Bill has a comprehensive, open, flexible outlook on the range of options available to solve housing problems.  I assure Senator Naughten that, in spite of his resistance, a growing number of people nationwide are inclined to listen to me rather than to him.</P>

      <P>We have encountered this problem within local authorities in the build-up to the scheme.  There has been the build-up to the scheme even though the legislation is not yet operational.  There is a real fear on the part of potential purchasers about the open-ended nature of the scheme, about the inability to freeze the market value at time of purchase.  There real fear is not knowing what they may be handing down to their families and dependants.  One cannot draw a line and say what will have to be paid or what they are getting into.

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to reply to the points I raised in relation to the unemployed or somebody who would be able to make a substantial deposit, perhaps through the sale of their existing premises which would have been a low-income-orientated premises?  If the size of the family increased, they may <Col N="2109" /> wish to participate in a scheme like this but because they are not employed they cannot actually pay a mortgage or would not be considered for mortgage purposes. For example, could they sell their one-bedroomed home when they need a two or three-bedroomed house which they could purchase under this scheme? Would the Minister say whether the scheme would accommodate such people and their circumstances?  I have come across a couple of such cases.  The cheme could address the needs of, say, someone who married young, obtained a small house in the inner city, and is now unable to avail of local authority housing or purchase larger accommodation.  Are the provisions of this scheme open to such interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>Experience in the North of Ireland has been that a great number of householders decided to move towards the purchase of the second part of the equity at faster or more frequent intervals than has been originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>On the specific point made by Senator Costello, I have been at pains to point out on a number of occasions that I want to break away from the notion that somebody in receipt of unemployment benefit is not entitled to take out a mortgage. This scheme can work in a number of ways.  For instance, local authorities can go into the marketplace to purchase suitable accommodation related to an individual's capacity to pay.  For example, in one local authority area an unemployed person paying a rent of £15 a week moved into shared ownership at £19 a week.  The facilities are there for a person to take advantage of this scheme and the relevant local authorities have the necessary flexibility.  I am extremely anxious that local authorities, looking at the market position and the possibility of purchasing accommodation to suit the needs of such categories of people, be a vital component or factors in the approach to solving this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raised a specific case of somebody disposing of a property of a comparatively low value.  Clearly the provisons of the scheme will enhance their <Col N="2110" /> position, in that henceforth they will be in a position not only to pay a deposit but also to move to a higher percentage of ownership from the beginning.  I would welcome such opportunities and encourage them at local authority level.</P>

      <P>I am very much afraid of the impression that will be given by certain Senators who appear to be objecting to this scheme merely for the sake of objecting.  People must recognise that this is a very innovative scheme for a certain category of people.  Indeed, it acknowledges what Senator Naughten spoke about earlier, that the majority of our people would wish to own their homes.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten spoke of people not knowing the amount of their future mortgage repayments.  That is the case whenever anybody enters into an agreement or takes out a mortgage with a building society or other financial institution; their repayments will vary as interest rates rise or fall.  We should acknowledge that this scheme constitutes another vehicle affording a certain category of people with an opportunity or owning their homes.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, there is an inbuilt rental subsidy under the provision of this scheme.  The fact that the number of applicants in the first three months of this year trebled compared with the whole of 1991 is an indication that people who want to own their homes at some stage in the future realise that the provisons of this scheme are suitable for their purposes.  We should not be frightening people away from a worthwhile scheme, which could lead to their finding, too late, that they should have opted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the scheme is targeted at a certain category of people, those local authority housing lists or prospective tenant purchasers of local authority houses.  It is also targeted at those with an income of less than £12,000.  It is unfair of the Minister and <Col N="2111" /> Senator McKenna to accentuate that the figures have trebled in the last few months since the scheme began.  There were extreme difficulties at the beginning of the scheme which prevented people from applying and the Minister should readily acknowledge that.  It was not until these difficulties were ironed out with his Department by the local authorities that the scheme got off the ground.  One cannot say that the figures trebled, the scheme only started in the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proof the scheme is a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We would have had these applicants in the earlier stages if the problems had been sorted out in the first instance.  The scheme is encouraging people to take out mortgages.  Senator Naughten raised the point about buying at a later stage.  The Minister said that those in Northern Ireland are now buying in at an earlier stage than was anticipated. It should not be overlooked that many people remortgage for house improvements and here we are asking people to take out a mortgage today and to remortgage in ten, 15 or 20 years' time to enable them to carry out house improvements. This happens all the time as people want better homes.  In the past, many people remortgaged to provide bathroom or toilet facilities within the home, or to add extra bedrooms as the family grew.  If these people have to remortgage at the increased price they will not be able to improve their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is part of a package to eliminate the building of houses by local authorities. As I said on Second Stage, the scheme is not reducing the list of housing applicants because between 75 and 80 per cent of those people are on social welfare assistance. Not many of them will apply for shared ownership or co-ownership of houses.  There is a real problem here and the Minister should not regard the scheme as a way of eliminating the building of local authority houses.  This is not working in the Dublin area although 400 <Col N="2112" /> people have applied in Dublin county for the shared ownership scheme and the applications are being processed at present.  It is grossly unfair of Senator McKenna to make that comparison but he was prompted by the Minister who said earlier that the proof of the success of the scheme was the flood of applicants. When a house has been lived in for ten or 20 years it needs improvement and probably extra rooms.  The cost of remortgaging should be related to the price of the house on the day of purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this section. I am quite prepared to listen to people in local authorities, who can talk about the possibilities and difficulties, etc., in relation to a new scheme, but I cannot see anything wrong with experimenting with new ideas.  Some of the countries which I most admire &mdash; particularly Scandinavian countries have never strongly supported direct local authority house building, they prefer to use public resources to give people security in decent housing.  I am in favour of getting people guaranteed access to good quality housing.  I am not in favour of guaranteeing people access to making a killing out of selling good quality housing simply because the State understates the value of the property.  I am not in favour of subsidising people like myself to get rich by buying houses with heavily subsidised mortgage interest.  I am in favour of a housing policy, not a personal enrichment policy or a capital acquisition policy.  Shared ownership is a way of enabling people to get a foot inside the door and once people do that we can leave the rest to them.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that there is a whole host of problems which have not even been thought of yet but the idea that one should object in principle to new ways of thinking suggests that some of my colleagues have not, perhaps, realised that new ideas are a good thing.</P>

      <P>Another reason for supporting this scheme is that our local authority find the cost of maintenance <Col N="2113" /> prohibitively high.  Under this scheme the tenants or owners of the future will have an interest and pride in the property which they do not have if they are renting one.  From that point of view alone &mdash; although there are other advantages &mdash; it is a welcome scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Ryan.  Obviously he fails to appreciate that the local authority housing scheme has been abolished by this Government in so far as the funds have been taken away from it.  This scheme will replace the former scheme which has run out of funds.  The urgency of this social housing programme is simply because (a) the Government have failed to provide the funding for local authority housing; (b) this Government and their predecessor over the last four years withdrew the house improvement scheme which was undoubtedly bringing a lot of houses back into the housing stock and (c) the new house grant scheme has practically gone because unless somebody is building a new house for the first time and getting a contractor &mdash; direct labour is no use any more &mdash; he or she cannot avail of the £2,000 new house grant.  This is why we have a huge number of applicants for local authority housing and this hare-brained scheme will not help people to own their own house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make a comment in relation to the Minister's statement and that of Senator McKenna about the great success of the scheme.  In Dublin city 435 applications have been received to date and staff have had to be redeployed and trained to assess them.  Extra staff were not provided to deal with the scheme so it is an extra burden on the local authority.  Sixty provisional approvals have been made, 90 approved applicants have recently selected dwellings and paid a deposit to the corporation and these are being processed.  Every possible effort is being made to increase the number of approvals speedily; however, the income of many applicants is low and it is unlikely that they would <Col N="2114" /> be able to meet the repayments on a house within the nominated price range.</P>
      <P>That is the problem to which Senators Naughten, McMahon and I have been adverting, that it is extremely difficult for the tenants, 70 per cent of whom are on social welfare payments at an average rent of £10 or less, to meet the mortgage and the rental.  That is a major obstacle and, while we are in total agreement with experimenting with as many schemes as possible, an improvement to this scheme could be to freeze the cost of the house at the time of purchase so that the mortgage and rental can be paid and the tenant knows precisely what he is entering into rather than having an open ended scheme which increases with the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>This is not a bad scheme but it will be very limited by the factors to which I referred in relation to the fact that tenants &mdash; those whom we want to purchase the Houses under the scheme &mdash; will find it very difficult to meet the repayments on the mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Shared ownership is an innovative scheme which has generated major activity and interest within all local authorities.  To prove my point, last year there were something in the region of 240 approvals in that category while in the first quarter of this year we have already had over 600 approvals, which suggests we are making inroads.  It is innovative, it is a scheme that appeals to people and they can avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors referred to by Senator Costello in connection with Dublin &mdash; I refer to it in regard to the south Cork housing area &mdash; is that we had 67 applications this year, four were approved, seven were refused and the rest are in abeyance.  There seems to be a difficulty within certain local authorities in terms of progressing the applications. This is one area in which the Minister could tell county and city managers to get the lead out.  People are anxious to be housed and it is in all our interests to ensure that they are provided with proper housing.  Local authorities now have the mechanism by which it can be done and <Col N="2115" /> I suggest that the Minister should urge the managers to get on with the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon said that people do not know what they are buying.  That does a disservice to the officials in the local authority because I know from experience that they go to great pains to explain the scheme to applicants, outlining what is involved, how long the payments will go on etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope we can move on, but I want to comment on the behaviour of my local authority.  Senator O'Keeffe made a grossly unfair statement. I have had occasion to deal with local authority staff throughout the country and certainly their behaviour in the Dublin area does not bear out his remarks as they act with the greatest efficiency within the law.  My local authority, up to 10 July last, received 392 applicants under this scheme.  They have provisionally approved 218, 12 have been further processed and given houses, 81 of the 392 applicants withdrew from the scheme and further information is required in relation to 65 applicants. What greater efficiency can be required than that?  It is most insulting to my local authority to tell them to get the lead out and to get on with the scheme.  Local authorities are anxious to see people housed and they are inhibited from doing so because of what this Government have done in diverting the funds available to them.  I have seen the lists in County Dublin rise to the greatest number in my time as a public representative.  There are 2,200 applicants in Dublin county today; never before were there so many on a list. That is what the Minister's alternative schemes are doing in my part of the country. Of the 2,200 applicants, 80 per cent are on social welfare.  Is it any wonder that we wish to improve the lot of those people?  I am also surprised at the comments made by Senator Ryan, who should be concerned about the people <Col N="2116" /> who are now forgotten under the Government's housing scheme.  There are people in County Dublin today who have never before been in such a plight in regard to housing.  It is disgraceful to blame the officials of local authorities when it rests with this Government.</P>

When I hear a good idea I recognise it.  I know it can be used as a sham, I know it can be used as a cover up for the lack of funding, but the reality is that imaginative schemes generate demand which can create additional political pressure to provide the funds.  We can deal with the funds later on.  I would like a dozen good ideas to be tried to make use of public funds in the best possible way and I would be the first to point out that they are wrong.  I will not get involved in a spurious argument about something that is a good idea simply because I do not like the Government.</P>

He knows it is false and misleading and that nobody did as much to bring up the numbers of local authority houses as the Government from 1983-87.  I am sure that Senator O'Keeffe, on reflection, will withdraw the statement.  It is wrong to criticise county and city managers for not operating this scheme.  The reason this scheme is not being operated is that county and city managers have no confidence in it because they know it will not work.  I will <Col N="2117" /> give on example: in my own county, with a population of 50,000 there has been only one applicant.  That tells its own story.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody. The simple fact is that there is an uneven application throughout the country in terms of the response to this scheme.  That is not a reflection on individual authorities; it is a fact of life.  I am delighted Senator McMahon is aware of what is happening in Dublin county because I had the privilege in Dáil Éireann of telling a Deputy representing north Dublin how good Dublin county were in their response to this scheme, approving at the moment at the rate of one per day, which would be between 300 and 400 in the year.  There is no point in Senator Naughten closing his eyes to these realities.</P>
      <P>On the question of ownership what is fundamentally wrong with a family or household today is that they are not in a position to own 100 per cent of their home, and may not be able to do so for 25 years.  What is wrong in setting out to own half or three-quarters of that home? What would be wrong with the next generation carrying on the process of getting outright ownership?  Are we saying that a particular generation must own absolutely, and that therefore the next generation is to get it free, gratis and for nothing?</P>

      <P>Everybody wants to do it, but not everybody is able to do it.  In the next ten years 10,000 to 12,000 people <Col N="2118" /> will own their homes under the scheme that is being pushed by Dublin County Council and others.  By approaching it my way, they will be moving towards outright ownership.  Approaching it the Senator's way, they have no choice. Senator Naughten may be the Minister for the Environment some day and this Bill provides the opportunity to peg the cost of the remaining equity, if so wished. The flexibility is there, if there are circumstances that demand it, and I have provided for that.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten said that local authority houses are not being built.  As long as I am Minister for the Environment I will not approve large local authority housing schemes on the periphery of cities and towns.  I am not going to pool into one area, groups of people, lone parents, the unemployed and the people on the housing list.  I want them to be part of the community, and to be fully integrated into it on sites that are serviced, in houses that have been acquired or extended as a result of voluntary activities, and I will fight my corner to get the financial resources that will make that achievable.  That has to be the philosophy. Why should there be a reluctance to extend one's home under the local authority works scheme, in lieu of local authority housing?  What do people do in normal life when they have overcrowding? They try to extend.  We are facilitating that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the house <Col N="2119" /> improvement scheme.  I will never introduce a house improvement scheme like that.  If I have the resources, I will target them to the people who need them.  The taxpayer should not have to find £200 million for people who can afford to extend their homes.  As a public representative I have to tell people who come into my clinics that I have no house improvement scheme for them, that I know they are entitled to one, but that I also know that grants were paid to people who have more than one home, more than one option and more than one facility.  I am not going to have a scheme like that in place burdening the taxpayer and which is not targeted.  If we are able to introduce an improvement scheme in the future, and I look forward to the day when we can do it, it will be in line with the philosophy of this Housing Bill, it will be aimed at those in need, reaching out to people, and concerned to do with our resources the maximum possible.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the scheme during the eighties.  The total number of houses built dropped every year, from 1981 to 1988, but as I mentioned earlier, I have to find £200 million this year just to pay the debts.  I have to make sure that I use these resources to the limit possible. I will fight my corner for the resources, but I want to urge this House and people like Senator Naughten, for whom I have the highest regard, and other Senators who have contributed here, not to get themselves stereotyped by adhering to the schemes of the past as if there was not a changed society.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon knows, when he talks of those ever-increasing housing numbers, that they are dramatically changed from anything he has ever experienced.  The total number may be less than it was ten years ago, but the actual composition and make up of the numbers is entirely different.  We are having to make provision for a very changed housing dimension.  It requires concern, flexibility and involvement of all the sectors, because it will take that kind of dynamic effort from the private sector, the voluntary sector and the local <Col N="2120" /> authorities.  We cannot close our eyes to these realities.  This Bill opens up that flexibility.  We should help it along.  It is not just a matter of who is in power.  It is a matter of dealing with the people who are in need and whom we want to help. It is a matter of sponsoring and promoting new schemes that will help us to achieve that reality.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke at length as if this was an additional scheme. It is not.  It is a replacement scheme for a scheme which was very successful over a long number of years.  That is my objection to it.  The Minister talked about certain people getting house improvement grants.  I do not doubt that there was a certain amount of abuse as regards that house improvement grant, but the Minister or the Government should not have killed the scheme.  What they should have done was adjust it to meet the requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not close my eyes to any innovative scheme or any trial period for a scheme to house people.  I said on the Second Stage debate that we should let new schemes run alongside the old schemes until they are proven.  In Dublin County, and obviously the Minister knows a fair bit about it, there are forgotten people in dire housing circumstances who do not fit into any scheme, because the Minister has done away with the local authority building scheme.  There are 2,200 applicants in Dublin County, the highest number in my time as a public representative in that area.  I hope Senator Ryan is still behind me, because that figure was down to less than 200 or 300 when we were in Government. Never forget that.  This is the highest number in Dublin County since I became a public representative, way back in the mid sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my early years as a public representative by far the biggest problem of people coming to my clinics was housing until the housing list was reduced.  I am not being unfair to the Minister in saying that 75 per cent of housing applicants <Col N="2121" /> now are on social welfare and do not fit into this or any other scheme.  They would not have £1,000 in a thousand years in their present circumstances, to put down as a deposit.  They are the forgotten people.  I am not objecting to this scheme.  I want to see this scheme go ahead, but I want to see the majority of housing applicants in the Dublin area being facilitated and they are not being considered.  Money is now being diverted from these people that I am talking about to facilitate other people in the scheme. I have no objection to people getting houses under the scheme.  By all means have the scheme, but let it run alongside all other schemes.  Let us not forget about the other people who should be given the benefit of the doubt.  If there is a doubt about the allocation of money, the money should be diverted to the people on social welfare who are in dire housing circumstances. They are not being given any chance.  They are now being put on the list, as the single person was, in the sixties and seventies.  People are on the list all right, but they will never get a house. I know that has changed for the single person, but we are now putting these people who are on social welfare on a long term list.  I am pleading for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator McMahon said single persons remain on a list and are not housed because there is no accommodation for them.  That is the simple fact.  I am disappointed with both the Minister's and Senator Ryan's remarks.  They are misconstruing what we are seeking to do in this Committee Stage debate.  We are not objecting to this proposal; we are seeking to improve it to make it more accessible to those people it is targeted at, the people on social welfare, who are unemployed, who find it difficult to make mortgage repayments or, indeed, to be able to pay at the end of the equity scheme &mdash; as the Minister referred to it.  That is what we really want to do.  I outlined to the Minister the obstacle that my local authority are facing.  On 13 May 1992, they made a submission to the councillors in relation to the shared ownership scheme.  They <Col N="2122" /> put in on record that they had only 19 approved applicants for selected dwellings. We have got provisional approvals for only 60 out of 435 applicants.  That is not through lack of co-operation or because of a negative attitude among councillors or politicians.  The income of many applicants is low, and it is unlikely that many would be able to meet the repayments on a house within the price range nominated by them.  People want to get houses but because of house prices in the city of Dublin it is virtually impossible for the people at whom this is targeted, to get one.  That is why after 12 months looking into this scheme, redeploying and training staff, interviewing all the applicants and putting out literature advertising it, only 19 people got dwellings.  Therefore, it is reasonable for us to seek improvements.  The improvements we seek is to make the scheme accessible to people.  People should be able to see what is at the end of the road, see what their outgoings will be and get pegged to the actual cost at the time they are entering the commitment.</P>
      <P>I would also like to correct the Minister in relation to the statistics from 1981.  In 1981 1,520 units of accommodation were constructed.  The number decreased in 1982 to 1,351 in the Dublin area.  It increased to 1,753 in 1983.  It decreased to 1,717 in 1984.  It decreased in 1985 to 1,358.  In 1986, it decreased to 1,014 but in 1987 it had decreased to 446, in 1988 148 and in 1989 to zero.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even those statistics illustrate a number of points.  First and foremost, the Senator is losing sight of the overall position of total housing constuction. I referred to Dublin county a moment ago in terms of their response. Is it put to me as being logical to assume that the situation in the city is entirely different from the county?  I have to put on record my disappointment with Dublin city in terms of their response to the scheme.  I could put on record a number of other local authorities, one in <Col N="2123" /> particular, where there does not appear to be the kind of response that is required.  This is an extremely urgent matter.  I want to encourage public representatives, housing officials and everybody else to work this scheme as hard as it is possible to work it.  It is not the only element in this plan but it is the one which is being concentrated on here at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to local authority house buildings, where Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council have an opportunity to purchase a house to meet the kind of needs that Senator McMahon is talking about, we want to encourage them to take it.  This cannot be solved by just looking at one particular range.  The argument is very often put to me by Dublin City Council that the price range is out of order.  I looked up the statistics for 1991 and found that 30 per cent of the houses in Dublin were sold for under £40,000 and ten per cent were sold for under £20,000.  What did the local authority do about acquiring any of those? These are the realities that we are faced with and that we have to explore in the context of how we deal with housing, to get a mixed solution to the range of problems that are facing us.  Ten per cent of the houses in this country at the moment are unoccupied.  They may not all be suitable for purchase or acquisition, but they are unoccupied.  In every town, village and city there are blights on the environment, potential purchases for group housing, for single households&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Twenty years ago there was no such thing as a scheme like this.  In my home town, I approached the county manager with a proposal to house a family in a derelict building in the middle of a lovely old terrace of houses.  Work was carried out by the local authority, and by the family, and that family have been happily housed there ever since.</P>
      <P>In saying that I will not have big local authority schemes, I do not want to turn my back on very beautiful schemes that have been built in the past or on the contribution that the tenants and local authorities have made.  However, I do not see that kind of solution as being the predominant solution, or the character of housing for the future.  That is all we are saying here.  Let us look at that. Create the mix, and look at the different solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year something like 1,300 houses will be built in the country.  If I can find more resources I will increase that.  Suitable houses will be purchased for shared ownership and there will be the extension of local authority houses and an absolute commitment to bring the private sector and the voluntary sector in.  The voluntary sector this year will provide between 500 and 600 units throughout the country.  That was not part and parcel of past housing experience and it is very acceptable and welcome.  A local authority in this country refused to respond positively by giving a site.  The majority voted not to do it.  When we want to change, let us take everything on board on the basis of the work that I have been able to do and the commitment of the officials in the Department of the Environment to this new thinking, and to supporting <Col N="2125" /> the local authorities in a range of options to deal with a variety of housing problems that face us today.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of regulations under subsection (5), and I am referring in particular to paragraph (f), I hope the regulations take into account the new trend in Dublin city, which is expressed by the elected representatives on the council, that we can no longer build large houses and provide large living space in the down town city centre area.  There is a considerable change of attitude &mdash; although it is not unanimous, the majority accept that we <Col N="2127" /> must provide smaller units in the city areas.  In other words, one cannot expect to get the same accommodation in the central city area as in the suburbs.  To a large extent that is the type of housing we have been building in the past but we will have to move away from that.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) In drawing up and adopting or <Col N="2130" /> amending a policy under this section a housing authority shall have regard to the distinct needs of and provision for members of the traveller community.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Because of the obnoxious nature of section 10 it is important to reiterate the need to impose an obligation on the housing authorities, some of which have had 20 years of practice at finding out how not to do anything for the travelling community.  Some local authorities have a good record of identifying and recognising the distinct need of travellers, but the record of others is nothing short of disgraceful.  Some members of local authorities are nothing short of disgraceful either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 58 of the 1966 Act, which this section of the Bill expands, local authorities are responsible for the management and control of any dwelling, buildings or other land of which they are the owners.  The provision requiring the drawing up of a policy statement by the local authority for the performance of the functions under section 58 therefore extends to halting sites.  In drawing up policies in relation to such sites regard will have to be had to the needs of the occupants just as in the case of tenants of houses.  Accordingly the proposed amendment would be unnecessary.  In any event subsection (1), paragraph (c), includes provision for the Minister to direct authorities to have regard to specified matters in formulating policy and if a Minister was unhappy with the manner in which a local authority were discharging their duties he could make use of that provision.  I hope that these assurances will persuade the Senators not to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (3) (b), between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(vii) the records and accounts of a designated body will be inspected <Col N="2131" /> and audited regularly by a Department of the Environment auditor.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems eminently reasonable that there should be a clear provision stating that the accounts of any such designated body will be subject to the same scrutiny as the accounts of any other body which might be directly or indirectly in receipt of public funds?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was first put down in the Dáil and, recognising that there was merit in strengthening the provisions in relation to auditing of the accounts of designated bodies, I introduced paragraph (h) to subsection (4) on Report Stage in the Dáil.  This specifically provides that ministerial regulations may make provision in relation to the auditing of the annual accounts of a designated body.  I would not however envisage the audits being carried out directly by the local government audit reports to the Minister rather than to the local authority. The local government auditor's function would be to ensure that proper annual audits were being carried out and furnished to the local authority by the designated body.  Furthermore, I should say that the existing provisions in this section will, under subsection (4) (f) and (g), enable the Minister to make regulations in relation to the monitoring by the housing authority of activities of the designated body, the submission by the designated body of its accounts and other reports to the authority.  Also the delegation order itself, under subsection (3) (b) (v), can set out the rights of the authority to inspect the books of a designated body.  It is therefore clearly envisaged that the delegating authorities will keep ongoing checks on the activities of designated bodies, which would include an annual examination of their accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;(1)  A housing authority may directly or in conjunction with another body provide sheltered, protected or semi-independent accommodation either of an interim or permanent nature for special categories of citizens including&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  aged persons,</P>
      <P>(b)  families the head of which is less than 21 years old,</P>
      <P>(c)  persons who might otherwise be institutionalised,</P>
      <P>(d)  families, members of whose household have caused severe social disruption to neighbours on an ongoing basis,</P>
      <P>(e)  other categories specified in regulations including battered or abused women and children and young people sleeping rough or alienated from their families.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may, by regulation, specify the type or types of accommodation including the type or types of supervision to be provided under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about these categories of people and I do not want to delay the Minister, but I would like to hear a response to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be an unnecessary addition to the Housing Acts, which already contain sufficient powers to accommodate the Senator's proposal. Section 6 of the Bill allows housing authorities to grant assistance to approved bodies for the provision of housing accommodation that would encompass all the categories envisaged in the proposed amendment.  For example, the Focus Point project at Stanhope Street, which caters for housing needs, was actually <Col N="2133" /> aided to the tune of £1.92 million under section 5 of the 1988 Act, which section 6 of the Bill replaces.  That project also received two special grants in 1990 and 1991 amounting to £335,000, bringing the total assistance to £2.25 million. Special allocations have been made for the provision of communal facilities in existing and new voluntary housing developments in 1991 and again this year. These allocations are intended to provide a supportive community atmosphere for the residents.  Focus Point, which specialises in dealing with homeless persons, receives an annual grant from my Department towards its running costs and the 1992 allocation for this purpose is £65,000.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that the Government fully appreciate the potential of sheltered housing provided by the voluntary sector as substantial resources are being committed to it and the legislation is not a hindrance.  Equally, section 56 of the Housing Act, 1966, under which all local authority dwellings are provided, is perfectly adequate to allow local authorities to cater within their housing programme for the housing need to which the amendment refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister about section 56 of the Housing Act, 1966.  That Act made no particular provision for people who were homeless or people who were living in unsuitable or overcrowded accommodation and a number of other categories.  One of the deficiencies in the Act is that it does not actually specify people who have no accommodation.  I accept fully what the Minister said regarding all the wonderful things he is doing but, as I have said consistently throughout this debate, the Department of the Environment have managed to spend £1 billion less during the past five years than they would have spent if they had simply maintained the 1986 and 1987 expenditure &mdash; in cash terms, not even real terms &mdash; at the same level on housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because they have now spent very constructively, but also with an enormous multiplier in terms of good PR, about £10 <Col N="2134" /> million or £20 million on a whole range of very worthwhile projects, they would not be allowed to get away from the fact that what they have actually done is pulled the plug on low cost housing. Schemes that would have been peripherally important in terms of the overall housing programme are now overstretched because of demands and because of the lack of public housing and all the schemes the Minister talked about at such length earlier.  We cannot get away from the fact that these schemes, which were meant to deal with specific niches in the housing demand, are now going to be hopelessly stretched because most people on low incomes are in some kind of publicly supported housing.  I do not disagree with what the Minister has said, but the saving is a drop in the ocean by comparison with the enormous savings that have been made by the Department of the Environment by simply not spending money on housing over the last five years.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) This section shall only become operational by ministerial order, which order shall only be made once the Minister is satisfied that a national plan has been implemented to fully satisfy the varied accommodation needs of the traveller community.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find this whole section profoundly offensive in its tone, its presumptions, its arrogation of extraordinary powers to the local authority.  They do not even have to meet minimum standards; they simply have to decide what they do for these people.  There is a local authority site in a disgraceful condition run by Dublin Corporation on the periphery of this city which I visited shortly after I returned from Palestine and, quite honestly, it sent me back to the refugee camps on the <Col N="2135" /> West Bank.  The Israeli treatment of the Palestinians would have been a credit to them compared with how Dublin Corporation on that site deal with travelling people.  To suggest that local authorities should be allowed to pick up a caravan after 24 hours and dump it out there is outrageous.</P>
    <P>A variety of problems arise under section 10.  To start with, it would be useful if the Minister had to certify that he was satisfied &mdash; in the words of the amendment &mdash; that &ldquo;a national plan has been implemented to fully satisfy the varied accommodation needs of the traveller community&rdquo;.  I am increasingly aware of the fact that prejudices against travellers is becoming fashionable again. I quoted from a letter from the president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce on Second Stage about travelling traders.  It was valid as far as the complaint went about those people, but it managed to incorporate every single prejudice that has ever been articulated against them such as fiddling social welfare, of being vagabonds and so on.  As far as I am aware, I am the only public representative in Cork who took the least exception to this man's outrageous use of his position to stigmatise a whole community.</P>
    <P>I fear that section 10, with its series of judgments and assumptions about the travelling community and about what they do and will not do, is a further reintroduction of prejudice into our society.  One way to dilute the impact of this obnoxious section would be to ensure that the Minister would, first, have to say that he was satisfied, however political a judgment that might be, that there was something like a national plan implemented which looked after the needs of the traveller community.  I have always said that when there are decent halting sites and a range of services available to people we can talk about enforcing other laws.  Before those services exist any enforcement of the law is a coercive act by the vast majority of the community against the vulnerable minority.  There are a whole series of other questions to <Col N="2136" /> be asked on this matter.  I would invite him to wait until he is satisfied there exists sufficient services of an acceptable standard, which reflect the needs of the travelling community, not those that reflect the prejudices of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>How would a Minister ever be satisfied that a national plan has been implemented to fully satisfy the varied accommodation needs of the travelling community?  It is obviously an impossible criterion to write into legislation.  No matter how successful local authorities are in planning for the needs of travellers, because of the very nature of those needs there will always be some problems, even if they are only seasonal ones.  If the section has merit, and many believe it has, then this amendment is not realistic.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 42, to delete &ldquo;five miles&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one mile&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was intrigued to notice that a ministerial amendment in the Dáil increased the radius within which a halting site must be located from one mile to five miles.  The original provision was for a distance of two miles.  A two mile radius means 12 square miles, a five mile radius means 75 square miles, so that the area in which you can seek out a site is being extended. If a temporary dwelling &mdash; with the extraordinary latitude which the Minister gives to himself in section 10 (14) is located anywhere in the city of Dublin there will be a site somewhere within a five mile radius.  Therefore, they will simply have to say we can put them anywhere; there <Col N="2137" /> is no requirement that they must go to the most suitable site, to the one that is nearest the children's school, to work, shops or nearest any other service.  The local authority can, if they are feeling benevolent, be benevolent; if they are feeling aggressive they can be aggressive; if they are feeling downright cantankerous, they can be cantankerous.  In the words of section 10 (1) &ldquo;a temporary dwelling could... appropriately be accommodated on that site&rdquo; if they think so but not on any objective criterion. Therefore, the very least would be to reduce the radius over which they could cast their increasingly hostile eye if they want to take on travelling people and move them on in the interests, presumably, of the appearance of certain parts of our urban areas, otherwise this involves the use of draconian powers to move people on whenever the local authority wish.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few general comments on the section. I make these comments on behalf of my colleagues Senator Eoin Ryan &mdash; and Deputy Joe Doyle &mdash; the other public representative in our area &mdash; who encouraged Dublin Corporation to erect sites for travellers in the Ringsend area and in the Ramley area.  I accept what Senator Brendan Ryan said, that some Dublin Corporation sites are in a disgraceful condition, but I do not think we have the worst record in Ireland for providing sites for travellers.  We have played our part, not as well as we should have, but we have certainly played it a great deal better than many other local authorities.  The difficulty about this section in my experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the specific amendment we have had numerous instances where we have endeavoured to persuade local communities to accept a <Col N="2138" /> site for travellers in their midst.  Sadly, this task has not always been easy.  As Senator Ryan said, there is a great deal of resentment and prejudice towards travellers.  It is shocking and it is a scandal. During my time as a public representative the only two meetings I recall with absolute horror &mdash; I shake every time I think of them &mdash; were with residents' associations where they would not agree to accept Dublin Corporation's proposition regarding sites for travellers. It was appalling and to use the word &ldquo;unChristian&rdquo; would be to put it mildly.  If the local authority can assure that community, or those people who are objecting to the site, that the travellers will be accommodated in a properly serviced site it helps to obtain their agreement to the site.</P>
      <P>This section is very important but I do not have a strong view on whether the distance should be five miles, two miles or one mile.  I am inclined to think that one mile would not fit the Bill.  I would like it to be one mile but I am trying to be practical about it and to balance the opposition of local communities with that of the problem for the travellers.  I do not have fixed views on the matter but I am of the opinion that one mile is not enough and possibly two miles might be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to enable the housing authority to take direct action to secure the removal of a temporary dwelling where it is parked within a radius of five miles from an official halting site in which there is a suitable vacant berth.  The radius was, in fact, increased from two miles on Committee Stage in the Dáil in the light of extensive comments made by Deputies during Second Stage debate on the problems caused by uncontrolled parking of caravans, often within a reasonable distance of vacant official halting sites.  The effect of this amendment, however, would be to reduce the limit to one mile. As this would significantly curtail the application of the section, I cannot accept it.  I do not think it unreasonable to expect travellers to make use of halting sites <Col N="2139" /> that have been provided at considerable expense to the taxpayer and, therefore, to the housing authority.  I consider that a distance of five miles will achieve a balance between the need to make use of halting sites and the needs of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that a housing authority may exercise powers under this section only where a caravan can be appropriately accommodated within an approved halting site.  As presently drafted, this section would allow a local authority to take action against caravans parked beside one site where another site within five miles may be empty.  On the other hand, it would not enable travellers to be moved out of the general area where they want to reside for the time being.</P>
      <P>I should like to put on the record as strongly as I can that the primary aim is to solve a problem which seems to be militating against the possible acquisition of suitable sites.  We have to face the reality that the acquisition of suitable halting sites has presented enormous problems throughout the country.  We therefore have a choice.  We can say the position is impossible, that we are not able to solve this problem and as a result condemn a section of our community to living conditions and to a lifestyle and life expectancy which are unacceptable.  All of us have experience of sites that are blighted, inappropriate and where the freedom to park almost anywhere is the order of the day.  Many people will be familiar with the traffic accidents and the dangers which apply to this kind of haphazard development.</P>
      <P>We must take on board the resistance of the settled community to halting sites. What I want is to try to eliminate that resistance.  If I cannot do that, then we cannot solve the problem because we will neither be able to get the sites nor develop the sanitary facilities and other amenities that are so necessary in the context of helping the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often it would allay some of the fears if it were possible to give an assurance <Col N="2140" /> that a site would be fully utilised and that there would be no parking close to a halting site where there are vacant berths.  It may not be the most desirable thing in the world that we have to set limits like this, but I have to try to be practical and to face the problems as I see them.  The alternative is to leave things as they are.  They are wrong from the point of view of the travelling community, they are unfair and we need to change them. We need to convince the settled community of the need to address this problem. It may be possible to reduce opposition by providing fairly high cost, well developed sites and ensuring that there would be some obligation to prevent parking very close to it where vacant berths are available.  Is it suggested that when we find the resources to provide the site and the buildings and put in the services that travellers may still decide to park immediately outside?  It would not be fair to the community living in an area that supported the notion from the very first day that those freedoms should remain, that those blights should remain on the side of the road are harmful to the travelling community, to the tourist potential and to the people who are living in that area.</P>
    <P>We are trying to find an accommodation. It is not that what we are doing is sacrosanct.  It is not that we have all the answers and know perfectly what to do.  I am quite sure Senator Brendan Ryan feels the same way.  We need to explore the avenues to find ways to reduce the opposition.  We desperately need more sites.  The first priority is to get the sites and I will try to provide the financial resources to the local authorities to develop them.  When I visited one local authority on my tour around the country, they informed me that there was a possibility of getting other sites but they did not have sufficient financial resources. Many other questions were put to me demanding money for one thing or another, but I said in that one instance that if they were short of finance I would come back to deal with that problem.  It is a commentary on our attitude that I was asked subsequently at a press conference <Col N="2141" /> why it was that I was able to have some resources for this purpose when I was not able to have it for other demands of the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us to the nuts and bolts of this problem.  We must try to find a balance based on all the views which were put to us.  In the Dáil I had to resist a provision which would provide for no limit so that the local authority itself could decided on any limit.  I thought it would be better to set some limits.  To set a limit very close to the site would militate against the possibility of acquiring new sites; too far away from the site would mean that people would be pushed too far away from where they wanted to live.  That was the balance we struck and we are prepared to give it a good try.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly right in this case.  My experience is that this was the one thing which held back the accommodating of the travelling community in my part of the country. Our first effort at it was many years ago in Clondalkin where an assurance was given to the local community that there would not be parking within approximately five miles.  Of course it was not enforceable, and it was not enforced.  It meant that the entire county knew of the situation and whenever we went to acquire a further site in the county this was thrown up at us.  The settled community would not accept an undertaking from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important point here. There is a minority of travelling people who do not want to go into the sites provided for them at the taxpayers' expense.  It is very hard to justify the expenditure on this kind of accommodation for the travelling people when there are other needs in many local authority areas and other people looking for housing.  Yet here we are giving 100 per cent grants to accommodate the travelling people.  Despite that and despite the facilities on these sites there are many travelling families who do not <Col N="2142" /> want to use them.  They do not go into them.  If parking is restricted to one mile they will find sites in the Dublin area so as to avoid going into those sites.  It would put the Dublin authorities in a most invidious position with regard to solving the problems of the travelling community. The travelling community know the law far better than we do.  I found this from my own experience also.</P>

      <P>They would know the landowners in an area, whereas I would not know them.  They know which plot to occupy, the plot which they have found they cannot be moved from.  If there is a parking limit of one mile, it will leave the problem in the Dublin area unsolved.  I do not think Senator Ryan or anybody else would like to see that situation arise.</P>

      <P>It is not so long ago that Dublin County Council got involved in moving a traveller's caravan the result of which was the arrest of a priest and a nun, among other people.  I would be intrigued to know under what powers the council operated then, because it seems to me that what this is about is short-cutting and speeding up of processes that are already available to them.  The only obstacle that I know of to their present powers is the Supreme Court decision that there must be somewhere for people to move to, which does not seem to me like an outrageously unreasonable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has no date for coming into force; in other words, it will not apply only to people who move a dwelling after a particular date.  It will apply, for instance, to people who may have had a caravan in a location for 20 years, or to people who, perhaps, have had children going to school from that location for 20 years.  Has the Minister inquired about the educational possibilities for children who are moved five miles from where they are at present, and what will that <Col N="2143" /> do about the long term problems of the travelling community?</P>
    <P>I am talking not about the problems with travellers, but about the problems of travellers.  They may be difficult, but if what has been said in this House about the acceptance or non-acceptance of travellers was said about black people instead of about travellers, the Press Gallery would be full of journalists screaming abuse about people who were racist and prejudiced.  One can get away with saying certain things about travellers but if one said those things about black people one would be accused of being racist and prejudiced.  If one talked in this way about what black people want, where they will live and what they care about, one would be accused of being racist but if one says this about travellers one can get away with it.  We have got so short a distance along the road of recognising minorities in our society that we can claim the majority can read their minds, read their attitudes, and, indeed, know what legal knowledge they have as well.</P>
    <P>The point is, there would be no problem if sites existed and to suggest that the problem of sites will be solved by moving them onto sites that local authorities cannot manage is nonsense.  It would be an outrage to move a family with children to Saint Oliver's site in Dublin city beside, ironically, Wheat field Prison.  To move a family into such a site would be a gesture of appalling cynicism, given the state of that site.  The local authority does not have to meet any standards of sanitation or space; it simply has to say that in its opinion the accommodation is appropriate.  If the officials of Dublin Corporation, who run this site, are of the opinion that Saint Oliver's is appropriate, then they will dump every traveller they can onto it &mdash; and many more sites besides if they feel like it &mdash; because of the extraodinary breadth of the definition of a temporary dwelling.  They will be able to clear any potential cardboard cities that might develop due to increasing homelessness because of the definition of a temporary dwelling in this section.  We will have the most wonderful <Col N="2144" /> and cleanest streets in Dublin.  We will have no homeless people in Dublin at all if somebody in Dublin Corporation takes the notion that they can clear them all into sites if they feel like it.  That is what is in it.  Whatever the motivation, what this section will do is to further stigmatise, further brand and further harass people who have suffered quite enough already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Ryan is confusing two different problems.  I have visited Saint Oliver's site but I am prepared to accept what he has said.  I do not contend that sites for travellers run by Dublin Corporation are what they should be.  I accept that, and some of them are worse than others, but that is the problem that should be addressed and it is a problem some of us, as public representatives, have endeavoured to have addressed.  I do not think that that is the same as the other problem which the Minister outlined very fairly, that is, why it is important to encourage communities to accept sites for travellers in their areas. They will not accept them.  This is not easy to do.  The two experiences we had in the Pembroke area and in Ringsend, where eventually they accepted sites, were a nightmare.  The problems in the county are quite different from the problems in the city.  I do not believe they will be able to get any more sites accepted if they cannot give the settled community the assurance that it will help to clear travellers who are parked all over the place.</P>

I am not going to stand here as Minister for the Environment and say that this Bill will eradicate for all time the problems that beset society today.  What we are trying to do is to make a further attempt to solve the problem.  I am happy about the language I use and the efforts I make and my commitment to solving the problems of the travelling community.  I would dearly wish the opposition to halting sites <Col N="2145" /> to change.  It would provide us with a greater opportunity to deal more expeditiously with the problems relating to these matters.</P>
      <P>It has been my experience from discussions with representatives supporting the travelling community that those who will first occupy those sites will be those families who tend to live in the particular area.  I do not envisage it being otherwise. It would seem quite extraordinary to me that a family living close to a halting site, availing of local educational facilities for as long as 20 years, would not be the first family to occupy that site.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the opportunity to live close to where they had been living but in much better surroundings. That would be my priority and I am sure it would be the priority of the local authority also.  We are still faced with a situation where, in all circumstances, some little effort must be made on all sides.  I will not stand here and decide for all time what the settled community may wish to do, but it seems to me there is plenty of room for radical improvement in terms of the awful conditions many travelling people still live in today.  The overriding priority is to give some opportunity to these people for education and employment in a way which has not been possible up to now. That has to be the governing priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The travelling community have indicated time and again that the first stage along that route must be the provision of halting sites.  It is not the only solution but it is the one that is most often sought by them.  To take that a step further, one must acquire a site and to do that there must be some agreement locally to obtaining that site.  We can stick our heads in the sand and say it is not ideal &mdash; and I would be the first to admit that circumstances are far from ideal &mdash; but within the provisions of this legislation we must decide what further steps we can take to improve the situation.  If I find, in the light of experience, that some further changes need to be made to create the <Col N="2146" /> possibility for an earlier solution to these problems, I will be the first to explore it, but I think we should give this a trial.</P>

I am usually at loggerheads with them, but I hope the impression is not going out that the halting sites are as described by Senator Ryan.  The site he mentioned may be in that condition.  I am not so aware, but certainly the sites in my area in Firhouse and two in Tallaght, particularly the one at Brookfield in Tallaght, won an award for general appearance and upkeep.  It is a pleasure to visit and I invite Senator Ryan to visit some of those sites in County Dublin.  Then he might get a different impression of how the travelling people are being treated.</P>
      <P>I hope he does not pick out a site where there might be a temporary problem. Over the years we have had to deal with families who would not move into a site. I am proud of the sites in my area, and I invite Senator Ryan to visit the site at Brookfield, Firhouse or any other site.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's detailed and long reply to these amendments, I believe some credit should be given to the local authorities who down through the years have put proper sites in place, manned them and tried to service them.  I wish to say to Senator Ryan that in County Clare it was never a case of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;.  Thirty-five years ago the first commission to deal with this problem were set up.  My late husband, Derry Honan, was appointed a member of that commission by the then Minister, Mr. Boland.  The members of Shannon Town Commissioners and Clare County Council worked together in dealing with this problem.  Trouble is now being created by new families moving into the area. They are creating problems for the settled community and members of the travelling community who have settled in the area.  At present two caravans are parked outside the vocational school in Ennis. <Col N="2147" /> Clare County Council do not seem to have the power to move them.  I have spoken with those families.  I do not have as much contact with the travelling community as Senator Ryan, but I have tried to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>A big site was set up near Drumcliffe cemetery along a road where there were houses valued at between £60,000 and £70,000.  Credit should be given to local authorities who have worked hard to provide sites.  Some of these families are not prepared to co-operate with the local authority.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Ryan's views on this issue.  I do not put people into different categories.  It would be wrong if the impression was given in this debate that local authorities did not play their part in trying to deal with this problem.</P>

I hope that under this section people who have been in the one place for 20 years will not be moved and that members of local authorities will be able to have a say in such cases.  To attempt to reduce by way of amendment the distance from five miles to one mile is totally impracticable. Maybe there should be a separate Bill to cover Dublin.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out to Senator Ryan that it would be impractical to locate sites a mile apart in the functional area of my local authority, which is about 70 miles from north to south.  The best thing to do is locate them in towns where the sites have worked very well.  I do not see any merit in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I hope that under this Bill people who have lived in small campsites for years will not be moved.  These people are accepted as part of the local community. My local authority and county manager have never attempted to make life awakward for these people by moving them to sites.  Even though they have refused to live in houses, they are accepted as part of the community.  I hope those people's rights will be protected under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), to delete line 44, and substitute &ldquo;and that site has sufficient space and sanitary facilities available that the temporary dwelling could&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is where the Minister's good intentions are tested.  The section as it stands will leave it to the discretion of the authority to decide whether a temporary dwelling can appropriately be accommodated in a site.  As my colleagues have said, local authorities have different records: some have an excellent record, some have a poorer record and, tragically, some have virtually no record at all.  Some local authorities have a great record of providing good quality sites.  I am aware of the sites to which Senator McMahon referred.  Local authorities will have an opinion about the appropriateness of putting a temporary dwelling in a particular location, based on the high standards they have operated. However, other local authorities will be equally content to dump everybody in a slipshod second rate site that meets some minimal requirement.</P>
      <P>We must set objective criteria, either by way of regulation of legislation, which provide that there must be space and there must be empty berths in a site.  A satisfactory level of sanitation must be available on the site so that the children living there will not be more unhealthy than if they were living elsewhere.  It should not be left to the local authority to guarantee that the same standards will be maintained.  As some Senators have said, these standards can be uneven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to use this as a carrot and stick arrangement, it would be much better for him to provide that adequate levels of sanitation and space should be available.  This would mean the local authority would not be judge, jury and executioner and a travelling family could test this provision in the courts on the grounds that space and sanitation standards were not adequate.  Under the section as it stands, the opinion of the local authority will be absolute and the <Col N="2149" /> occupier of the temporary dwelling will not be able to argue his case.  This is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 (1) enables a housing authority to require a temporary dwelling to be removed to a halting site where it could, in the opinion of the authority, appropriately be accommodated. Therefore, an authority is required to form an opinion in each case that the caravan, etc., could be appropriately accommodated on the halting site concerned.  This would automatically involve such considerations as the space, and certain facilities, including sanitary facilities etc., being available on the site. However, it must be said that halting sites are generally of a high standard in terms of the criteria referred to in the amendment in relation to space and sanitation. While some temporary sites, especially those in County Dublin, are not finished to the same standards as apply on permanent sites, they still afford travellers much better conditions than would be available on the roadside.</P>
      <P>I accept the point made by Deputy Honan that local authorities have made every effort to ensure that halting sites are properly developed.  The cost per unit now exceeds the unit cost of one local authority house.  This gives a clear indication of the commitment on the part of the Government and local authorities to provide the most satisfactory and best developed sites possible.  I have had occasion to open and visit a number of halting sites.  I was delighted to see local residents among the welcoming groups. Some people may say they should not be thanked for doing this because so many other residents were opposed to the sites. I wish to acknowledge the efforts made by those people who gave their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to existing sites which may not be as adequately served as they should be.  Clearly the onus will be on the Government and the local authorities to improve these facilities.  The officials in the local authority dealing with this matter have to be satisfied that these families will be appropriately accommodated in the site.  This means that the <Col N="2150" /> facilities have to reach the required standard. This amendment is unnecessary as the local authority have to ensure that a site meets all the criteria outlined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot support the amendment as it stands, although I support the thinking behind it.  I could never bring myself to support an amendment which proposed to take power from local authorities.  As I have said consistently in this House, many or our problems stem from the fact that local authorities have so few powers. I am not saying all local authorities have carried out their functions in respect of the travelling community in a satisfactory manner.  I believe the way to deal with these problems is to give local authorities more and not less powers.  Every time a local authority do something wrong power is taken from them.  We should be assisting and encouraing local authorities to do their job properly.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to take another power from local authorities.  I could support the amendment if it read &ldquo;and the site, in the opinion of the authority, had sufficient space and sanitary facilities available that the temporary dwelling could&rdquo;.  I am not opposed to the idea of providing sufficient space and sanitary facilities.  I believe the words &ldquo;appropriately be accommodated&rdquo; in section 10 (1) mean that adequate space will be provided in a site and it could not pass the test if no berth was provided for the temporary dwelling.  I thought the word &ldquo;appropriately&rdquo; meant decent facilities.  As I said, unfortunately I cannot support the amendment as it stands.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(6)  A Housing Authority shall not <Col N="2151" /> exercise its powers under this section, if the exercise of such powers would render persons under 18 years who are occupying the temporary dwelling, homeless.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I believe it would have been much more humane to refer to children occupying a temporary dwelling and the need to identify their problems. Sometimes there can be more involved than simply a temporary dwelling being parked in the wrong place.  As Senator Finneran said, there can be a long tradition of people living in one area.  An insensitive local authority may decide to move a temporary dwelling too soon or too quickly without adequate consultation, thus leaving children without shelter.</P>
      <P>My amendment may not comprehensively deal with the issue but it would have been nice for the Minister to refer to the need for a local authority to consult with the local health board before taking any of these powers.  They should find out from the local health board and social workers the position in relation to children and their vulnerability instead of looking at the issue entirely in terms of the structure to be moved.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer back to what I was saying earlier, that is, that Deputy O'Connell is a very genuine and caring Minister.  I recall keenly that in the debate we managed to have here some years ago on the subject of AIDS the then Senator, now Minister, spoke with great passion, energy and conviction and with great adventurous spirit.  He spoke about the possibility of the free needle exchange and even said that we had to consider legalising certain forms of drugs in order to cut down on the spread of the disease.  However, by comparison this is a very timid performance in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I remember when I was small we used to play a game called &ldquo;Relievio&rdquo; where there were various steps involved.  There were scissors steps, which is what I would consider Deputy Haughey's Irish solution to be.  We had baby steps, which is what the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, is at.  We had what we actually need, namely, giant steps.  This is a tragic situation we are facing.  It is a potential cataclysm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the speakers yesterday wondered <Col N="2155" /> about the costs and said that if what he called morality was not so directly involved we would have placed on the record the actual cost to the Exchequer. I can give him some information.  The cost of sustaining one patient with full blown AIDS for one year is £25,000 to £30,000.  Tht puts the matter into a particular context.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few remarks in response to the Minister's Second Stage speech.  There are certain elements in it with which I agree, but I have to say I believe the Minister is deeply and profoundly embarrassed and ashamed of this Bill.  He knows it is a rotten Bill.  Everybody else knows it is a rotten Bill, because it is far too little and far too late. I speak with some vigour.  This day last week I was visiting a friend of mine who died the next day.  I have had many friends who have died of AIDS.  This has been my experience because I work within the gay community and we were the first group of people to get it.  This is not going to be the case for very much longer.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond to what the Minister said in his speech regarding the mechanism by which the infection is spread.  According to the latest WHO statistics, the mechansim of transmission for HIV on a global basis is now confirmed at 90 per cent heterosexual intercourse. The passage of the infection through drug addiction and through homosexual intercourse and blood products for haemophiliacs is only 10 per cent.  Figures published today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> indicate a 100 per cent increase in heterosexual transmission over the last year in Ireland.  The situation is clearly altering.  We must take these facts on board.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the Bill that was produced in July of last year.  He said that it provided for condoms to be sold without prescription or authorisation, with certain provisions: one, the person was over the age of 17 years; two, the vendor was over the age of 18 years; three, the sale was not by way of vending machine; and four, the sale was either <Col N="2156" /> from one of the existing approved outlets selling all contraceptives, that is, pharmacies, family planning clinics, hospitals, and premises registered by a health board &mdash; all foolish, restricting and controlling mechanisms.  If we are, as I say and the Minister recognised more than a year ago, facing a potential cataclysm, why are we fecking around in this pettifogging way in the middle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not be, because this is a very serious situation.  We are fiddling while people are dying.  I have been witnessing people dying and I wish to God that the people on various sides of the House, and they are by no means exclusively Fianna Fáil, who titilate their consciences would go with me to places like St. James's Hospital where talented young people in their thirties are dying.  More people will die needlessly because of the gross inadequacies of this Bill.  What is the point of any age restriction if people are going to die?  Are we saying we will protect people over the age of 17?  Do not people of a younger age need protection? Is there any point introducing an age restriction other than as a kind of moral figleaf?  As I have said before on this subject, children are not sexually titilated by a limp piece of rubber unless they are extremely peculiar, but there are some young people who are sexually active and they require to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was on a radio programme on a local radio station last weekend.  A woman who sounded very nice rang in and asked about the rights of families under the Constitution; what about her authority? I understand that this a problem that is raised, but where does authority come from?  Authority comes from the love and respect parents can command in instructing <Col N="2157" /> the children in this matter of private sexual morality, and if parents are not capable of extracting that kind of response from their own children, why should other children be penalised and why should other children possibly be sentenced to a very unpleasant form of death?</P>
    <P>I do not want to maximise the unpleasantness but I must pay tribute to the extraordinary care and efficiency of the doctors in facilities such as St. James's Hospital, people who understand how to manage the inevitable death of people with the terminal disease of AIDS and who give them some degree of comfort and dignity towards the end of their lives.</P>
    <P>I will be tabling an amendment to provide that the Minister, by ministerial order, may vary the regulations controlling the facilities through which condoms are made available.  Everybody knows they should be available through vending machines &mdash; the Minister knows it; the Civil Service know it; every idiot in this country knows it.  This evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> has an article in which a young man states:</P>
    <P>Steven explains part of the problem about contraception.  &ldquo;I know I can legally buy condoms but there's just no way I'd go into a chemist and ask for them.  I'd be too embarrassed.  When you think about it, they're not really available, are they?  They should have machines in public toilets and pubs where you can get them.</P>
    <P>I know a lot of guys who'd expect the girl to have condoms or be on the Pill.  I know myself I'd rather take the chance than have to ask for them in a shop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thank God for the ordinary, decent common sense of the Irish people who are openly flouting this law.  I incite them to continue flouting it.  I am glad that over 100 outlets, including public houses, have already put vending machines in their lavatories and I will personally assist them to break the law because it is an idiotic law, it is a dangerous law and it is a law that may cause the deaths of young <Col N="2158" /> people.  I have no difficulty, no qualms whatsoever about that.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of this Bill is less than radical.  It is called the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, yet it has nothing to do with family planning. The Minister acknowledged that when he said it is a response to the serious health problem of HIV infection. However, he starts off by defining &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; as any &ldquo;applicance or instrument, including contraceptive sheaths, prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse between human beings;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the first target area of this virus was the gay community. The gay community are not using contraceptives in order to prevent pregnancy; they are using them in their most important manifestation that is to prevent infection, as a prophylactic, but we are still pretending that condoms can be made available only to prevent conception. For one of the principal target groups that is complete idiocy and nonsense. There is a paragraph in the Minister's speech with which I agree but it is so little that it fails signally to make any gesture to address the real problem:</P>
    <P>I do not consider it appropriate that married couples should seek a precription for non-medical items which they need for contraceptive purposes. It is an unnecessary intrusion on their married life....</P>
    <P>I agree but is that as important as saving people from a gruesome death?  Why this extraordinary delicacy and sensitivity about the married life of young people? If there were an invasion of privacy it would be a serious civil liberty matter, but we are not talking about life and death, whereas in terms of making contraceptives available to young people we are talking about precisely that &mdash; life and death.  I believe in civil liberties; I regret any intrusion into them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I was telephoned by a man who asked me to introduce amendments to protect the consciences of chemists in the West of Ireland.  Confronted with this appalling situation, I could not care less <Col N="2159" /> about the consciences of chemists in the West of Ireland.  Young people, at their most vulnerable, require to be protected against the possibility of acquiring an infection for which there is no known cure.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to two provisions in the Bill that I welcome very much.  He spoke about a comprehensive family planning service.  I give a strong welcome to this because previously we had a sectarian service which dealt only with what is known as natural family planning.  If the Minister is moving towards a more general approach, I am certainly very happy to support that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talked about using regulations.  I would question the extent to which the Minister will be capable of using regulations to vary the main content of this Bill.  Perhaps he could reply to this &mdash; I hope that I am not blowing the whistle on a potential political Trojan horse &mdash; and tell me whether it is possible for the Minister to address the reality of Ireland today.  The people of Ireland are so far ahead of the politicians that condom machines are already being installed all over the country.  Will the Minister be able to use the regulations to vary the legal position in order to legalise what is actually happening on the ground or will we have to come back and once again deal with legislation on contraceptives?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows my feelings, I would not wish it to be thought that I am in any sense antagonistic to the family unit; I respect it but I also expect from that family unit a certain moral standing. It is up to the family to produce in their children the moral standing they require. The Minister said on Second Stage:</P>
    <P>By prohibiting sale by way of vending machine it balances such wider access with the desire of parents to have some objective level of supervision over the availability of condoms where young persons are concerned.... This is intended to ensure a certain element of control and supervision of supply.  In a disaster, why are we worried <Col N="2160" /> about the control, supply and supervision?  In France, Germany and Holland condoms are being handed out free of charge to children in schools because that is preferred to the notion that young people will die.</P>
    <P>As an Irish citizen I was horrified to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> about a year ago a letter from a woman who considered herself a good Christian and who said that if it came to a choice between her son using a condom or dying of AIDS she would prefer that he died of AIDS.  That woman repeated her statement during an excellent RTE radio programme.  I am sure that woman considers herself to be a good mother and that she has some kind of convulated logic for her belief. God spare the children of Ireland from people who take that view.  It makes me wonder whether heterosexuals are fit people to have children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to start my contribution with a question to Senator Norris, &ldquo;Who would have the children?&rdquo;, but I shall not go down that road.</P>
      <P>It is hard to know where to begin in a debate on this Bill.  This is a missed opportunity and it is an awful tragedy that the Minister, who flattered himself by saying, for so many months, that he would produce a worthwhile Bill on this issue, has apparently fallen foul of Cabinet or other colleagues somewhere along the line so that we now have this legislative nonsense before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will provide for a marginally better position than obtains at present. The position will be marginally better in that condoms will be sold more generally, although not from vending machines; the supervisory role for the health boards &mdash; which was nonsense because it was inoperable &mdash; has effectively gone; and the nonsense concerning the declaration on a prescription as to the purpose of an inert contraceptive has been deleted.  But having said that, and having given as much as I can to the Bill &mdash; which is very little &mdash; where do we go?  The problem of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past decade or so in relation to most <Col N="2161" /> social legislation has been that we were ahead of public demand, we forced the pace a little too quickly when it came to what the public were prepared to digest. Hence, any attempts at liberalising issues such as this fell foul of the public, and in this regard I think particularly of the two referenda of the mid-eighties.  On this legislation the public are laughing at these Houses.  They will do what they do regardless of what we in this House say about condoms or sheaths.  The exercise this House is going through today, which the Dáil went through in the past week or two, is a total farce and it brings into disrepute what legislation should be all about.  I urge the Government, through the Minister, to rethink this nonsense urgently.</P>
    <P>My main objections to the Bill lie in two areas: the lack of vending machines, discretely but properly situated in our community generally, and the licence for casual sex we are now granting those over 17.  All of us, and particularly those of us who have young people and teenagers in our families, know what peer pressure is. If our children are going through college or third level education of one kind or another they come across peer group pressure.  For the Government to state in this legislation that legally one can now use condoms when one passes one's 17th birthday effectively gives people the licence to do so.  Let us be honest.  Back over the years throughout Ireland the Confirmation pledge was that one did not take a drink until one was 18.  Perhaps the use of condoms will now be added to the Confirmation pledge and sex will be made the great forbidden fruit along with drink.  I am not so sure that such a pledge would be any more effective than was the pledge not to drink.  What nonsense. Even if a four or five year old came across a condom that would not cause any harm. For those too young to use condoms the greatest risk is that they might choke on them.  For those who do know what to do with a condom, surely it is up to them to decide whether or not it is part of their ethos or part of their life at that time.</P>
    <P>It is up to us all to try to rear our children as we think fit and with the best <Col N="2162" /> possible responsibility towards their sexuality.  Some of us fail as parents and some of us succeed.  Parenting is a very difficult job today, with children facing a huge range of outside influences apart from the home influence.  Parents can only do their best in this area.  For goodness sake, here we are legislating to make the improper use of a condom a criminal offence, either because one is too young, because one has purchased it in the wrong way, or because it has been sold in the wrong way.  Even this late in the day could we not have a little sense?</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; fascinates me, too, given that one of the reasons we are liberalising &mdash; or just about liberalising &mdash; the availability of condoms is the scourge of AIDS in our community.  The Bill defines a contraceptive as a device to prevent pregnancy; I wonder how that relates to the whole AIDS issue.  It is not only hetro-sexual beings who use condoms.  The definition is much too narrow, again making further nonsense of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Many women in their forties, and perhaps even younger, can no longer take oral hormonal-based contraceptives of one kind or another because of a potential danger to their health.  The health of many women is already seriously at risk because of too many pregnancies or other medical complications.  In the years from 40 to 50 contraception for women is often at its most critical and its most difficult. Particularly from the point of view of women's health, the availability of condoms and sheaths at that stage is extremely important.  Most contributors to the debate have spoken about the legislation in relation to the young and have talked about the danger it might present to the young.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that there are very many women seriously at risk because of the lack of free availability of condoms, particularly in rural Ireland.  In many rural towns there may be only one chemist shop, where a woman has dealt for 30 to 40 years.  Perhaps her family dealt with the shop before her.  One should imagine the great personal indignation, difficulty <Col N="2163" /> and embarrassment that would be caused if at the age of 45 a woman had to present herself to &ldquo;Mrs. Murphy&rdquo;, the local pharmacist to ask for condoms.  Vending machines, discreetly placed in areas that people frequent, are important not just for the young but also for the not-so-young who might find it very embarrassing to face that difficulty in middle age, when contraception is of critical importance for so many reasons.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the making available of vending machines.  I should like him to at least assure us that it will not be necessary to bring further legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas if the Government have a change of heart on this issue and finally realise that there is a consumer demand for the discreet provision of vending machines.  I am not saying that vending machines should be found in every GP's rooms and every classroom throughout the country; I do not want them at every crossroads.  There are locations where vending machines could be discreetly situated so that consenting adults would be allowed to make up their own minds about their own method of contraception. The Government have no business at all behind the bedrom doors of consenting adults.  The Government's business is to protect the vulnerable, either the very old or the very young, from unwarranted and unwanted interference by others.  I reject any attempt, including this half-hearted attempt by the Government, to try to direct the lives of consenting adults.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my hope that the main Church in this country might reconsider their views on contraception.  This matter is not directly related to this Bill but the present position of the Catholic Church on contraception is very important for many women and many men in this country. Very many men and women in this country have been made <i>á la carte</i> Catholics because of the Church's <i>Humanae Vitae</i> on this issue.  Undue emphasis has also been given to this area, which, I think has made the Church lose credibility among younger generations and <Col N="2164" /> today's middle-aged generation.  With respect, I urge the Churches, and Rome in particular, to have a new look and a rethink of their views about contraception. I do not have to bring the issue further than our country, where a population explosion is not an immediate issue, but if one extends the line of thinking around the globe and the Third World one realises that there are many reasons that those who wish it &mdash; it should not be forced on anyone &mdash; should have free availability to contraceptives with the blessing of the Catholic Church and, indeed, some of the other Churches who are lukewarm on the subject.  I confine my comments to the Church I know most about, even though my knowledge is very little.  I do not pretend to know a lot about it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in his response to Second Stage debate to address himself specifically to the issue of the age limit, which effectively gives those over 17 the licence for casual sex.  I should like him also to explain why condoms will not be available from vending machines, not just for the young but also for the not so young who in an impersonal way want to avail themselves of a medically inert form of contraceptive during those very difficult years from 40 to 50 when woman perhaps cannot avail of other forms of medical contraception of one type or another.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister of State please also indicate in his reply how the changes recently announced by his senior Minister in relation to our national AIDS programme are being implemented? Apparently a very good man who was head of the programme has been moved aside and a different system has been put in place.  Perhaps we could have explained to us the thinking behind the change and whether this change is working and working for the benefit of the public at large.  Perhaps he could give us up to date figures on the AIDS problem in our country.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly difficult issue to know when to introduce young children to the whole problem of AIDS.  It is very hard to explain to children the risks and <Col N="2165" /> the tragedy of AIDS without getting into the inter-personal relationship area.  Perhaps we are leaving it too late to bring to the notice of many of our children the importance of responsible sexual relations.  Perhaps overall sex education is not being taught within a context to which young people can relate.  Judging from my time in college in the late sixties and early seventies, I find young people nowadays far more conservative in their approach to personal relationships than they were than.  Perhaps because of recessionary times, they are more serious about their studies, their drive to get employment, perhaps the AIDS epidemic has at last brought home to them the need to greater responsibility in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I will leave it at that.  I am extremely disappointed with this Bill; it is really a little bit of nonsense before the House We are the laughing stock of the public. The public are way ahead of us in relation to the provisions they will make for themselves regarding internal medical contraception such as sheaths and condoms. They are not going to listen to us legislators. I wish we could at least keep pace with the public demand in this area and, while respecting the ethos of our country, respond to the demands of consenting adults while at the same time protecting the vulnerable, the very young and the old.</P>

      <P>I recall the occasion when what was called the Principal Act in this Bill, namely, the Health (Family Planning) Bill, 1979, was debated in Seanad Éireann the then Minister for Health was one Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  There was no time limit on the debate on that occasion; perhaps they were more leisurely days.  But, of course, the issue was much more central, the terms of reference more substantial and somewhat wider.  It is incredible that 13 years later we have not disposed of this unfinished business.  It just is unbelievable that we are still prostituting the Houses of the Oireachtas by talking about the availability of bits of rubber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there has been some progress; <Col N="2166" /> there is no denying that.  This pathetic Bill purports to make a little more progress but overall I must say the sense of <i>dé já vu</i> is overwhelming.  I was indulging myself in the library this morning reading my contribution on that occasion pausing a while to marvel at the dexterous turn of phrase and so on.  But I was struck by the number of resemblances there still are to the Principal Act.  For example, the hyprocrisy begins right with the title, which has been observed more than once.  Of course, family planning is a euphemism &mdash; in 1979, as in 1992, the whole point about contraception is to avoid having any family at all.  Really the hypocrisy begins there.</P>
    <P>At that time we had a Minister who said he wanted to do much more than he was doing but felt he was constrained by circumstances, expediency perhaps, pressure.  It was in that context that he coined the famous phrase &ldquo;An Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;, which, significantly, has gone on to become one of the great cynical phrases of Irish politics and has been adopted by the public as such.  It is significant that it is in the context of debating contraceptives that that piece of cynicism was produced, though Deputy Haughey did not mean it as cynicism at the time.  He was then a Minister who protested he was doing as much as he could but felt that that was the most he could do.  He had no intention of resigning, by the way, in protest against the pressures being brought to bear on him.  Another similarity is that he repeatedly said in this and the other House: &ldquo;But can you not be reasonable?  Do you not see that this is the best we can do at this particular time?  This is progress, please accept it.&rdquo;  It seems to me that in these past few weeks we have heard that same note of desperation on the part of this Minister.</P>
    <P>In 1979 also there were politicians on the Government side, who believed that the Bill did not go far enough, who believed that the State had no business whatsoever interfering in private morality, who spoke with contempt of the Bill as a petty piece of compromise, but <Col N="2167" /> who still voted for it.  There were people who pointed out that the availability of contraceptives does not add up to compulsion. That simple message does not yet seem to have hit home in this country, among legislators and among those who pressurise them.  The fact that contraceptives are available does not compel people to use them, but those who will not use them themselves, who deny their availability to others, are interfering with the principles of civil and religious liberty. None of that has changed.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has not changed over those years is the selective conditioning of conscience, the peculiarity of Irish morality whereby politicians claim exemption on issues of sexual morality; but their conscience is not at all as tender when it comes to other areas of morality in public life, such as, bending planning permission, dodging taxes and so on. Again, that has not changed.  What has not changed is what I said on that occasion in 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will persist with scholarly meticulousness.  The reference is volume 92, column 706, of the Official Report of 4 July 1979.  I described the Bill as &ldquo;probably unworkable in many respects, pusillanimous in approach and, most deplorable of all, denominational in inspiration&rdquo;.  That last one has to be modified somewhat.  I am glad to observe a section of this Bill which tried to get away from the denominational inspiration, the section where comprehensive family planning is mentioned.  But &ldquo;unworkable in many respects and pusillanimous in approach&rdquo;, that is certainly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really feel it is a waste of time repeating this, but I must go on the record again.  Everything has now been said in this debate, said very ably by my colleagues. What has been well pointed out by both Senators Norris and Doyle, of course, is that the immaturity rests in ourselves and not in the public at large. It is the immaturity of politicians giving <Col N="2168" /> in to pressures &mdash; who knows what kinds of pressures? &mdash; while the public at large find the debate more and more irrelevant to their needs.  One difference from 1979 is that society has changed radically since then in respect of the openness of frontiers and the ease of communications. The notion of trying to prohibit the supply and sale of condoms in certain circumstances is totally ludicrous and nonsensical from that point of view alone, paticularly from the point of view of the traffic between Ireland and Great Britain or between the North and ourselves.</P>
    <P>Of course, what has changed is that at every handsturn we are reminded that we are Europeans and that we must behave as mature Europeans.  In this respect we are behaving as retarded, insular infants. It is totally unacceptable, then as now, to have the State acting in a censorious or paternalistic manner.  As Senator Doyle said, everyone knows that we all think differently from what we are stipulating in this Bill.  We all know that the whole nonsense should be repealed from the very beginning, that there should be a Bill introduced allowing free availability of condoms with, of course, proper concern for their effectiveness; and their reference to, let us say, industrial research and standards is the only area in which the State should be concerned.</P>
    <P>The attempt to legislate in age terms is unenforceable.  The prohibition on vending machines is also unenforceable.  I would like to think that the Minister does have power to amend the relevant section by subsequent regulation but it seems to me as a layman that the Bill clearly prohibits vending machines and that, therefore, amending legislation would be necessary if any progress is to be made in this area.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill flies in the face of facts. In <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today there was the report that three more public houses in Cork have now installed vending machines, bringing to a total of 20 the number of such machines in Cork city and suburbs.  The Garda Síochána are well aware of this.  In fact the promoter, a Mr. Arthur Leahy, of the campaign for <Col N="2169" /> the promotion of sexual help has informed the Garda that he is installing these machines.  Is the Minister going to tell me that there will be any prosecution on foot of that action and, if not, does it not bring the law into disrepute?</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said that he would willingly instigate people to break the law.  I am enough of a conservative to say that I do not wish to condone the violation of the law.  There is nothing so ridiculous as legislation which is ignored by the people at large, but when the law is a total ass and when people take their own shortcuts, surely it is then time for the State, ignominiously and sheepishly, to follow suit?</P>
    <P>I approve of two sections of the Bill, one which at last gets away from the denominational approach and speaks about comprehensive family planning services, and another, section 4(3), where the Minister prescribes standards for contraceptives and which says: &ldquo;a person shall not supply contraceptives which do not comply with the regulations&rdquo;. That is the real business of the State where condoms are concerned, to make sure they conform to technical standards, that people are not buying defective products and so on.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House perhaps I was somewhat too flippant when I suggested that the State should get into this industry itself or, at least encourage entrepreneurs to do so.  As I understand it, it is a huge industry.  Why should our economy not profit from the manufacture and sale of contraceptives with a distinctive Irish flavour, as it were?</P>

      <P>One could think of Ireland at the most critical moments. However, I will not develop that flippant tone because the matter is perhaps too serious.  It seems to me that the opposition to progressive legislation in this area falls into three groups.  First, parents and guardians who have a difficult time and whose views I do respect.  However, they seem to fail to understand that mechanisms, in themselves, do not create <Col N="2170" /> a permissive society.  For example, the kind of contraception which should be available in this country has been available in Northern Ireland for decades past.  Is anyone in their right mind going to tell me that Northern Ireland is a permissive or degenerate society?  Second, parents might reflect that it is a poor tribute to their character formation of their children, a poor tribute to the Church's formation of their character, that they have to depend on the State for the availability or non-availability of pieces of rubber to sustain their children in moral behaviour.  I have respect for parents who have such scruples, but for politicians who pretend that they have a conscience in these matters, who simply act out of political expediency, I have nothing but contempt.</P>
      <P>Third, there are people who worry about small children mistaking these devices for balloons as Senator Doyle said.  We would hope that someone would be at hand to prevent them choking, but if they want to play with balloons, that is something else, In any case, I have nothing but pity for the kind of person who is really worried about that.  When people say: &ldquo;Oh we could not really have them in public places,&rdquo; what they really mean is &ldquo;they would embarrass me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;they would embarrass my age group&rdquo;; in other words, they confuse morality with primness and guilt.  For those people, I have nothing but pity.</P>
      <P>I have a regard for the Minister, for both Ministers, of course, but I am speaking for the moment about the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell.  I believe he became increasingly desperate when he was pushed to the wall on this Bill. That explains his rather absurd approach in the Dáil last week when he asked: why should people not go to the counter and ask for a packet of condoms with their pint?  After all, if there is no sin in sex, why should they not do so?  The mistake the Minister is making there is to confuse morality with privacy.  People might well believe there is no sin in whatever they are doing but they want to be private about it.  I contend that was a mistaken approach for the Minister to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2171" /> I hope the Minister will remain in Government to make this Bill more progressive, that he will be able to bring in amending legislation so that we can move on to the next business, as it were.  Once we grow up and adopt the European norm, then we can move on to the next business.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the Bill, because I recognise that it is an attempt to make progress, but it is such silly legislation I could not possibly lend my support to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This will have been the third attempt in the past 13 or 14 years to introduce this type of legislation.  We began with the Haughey Bill which, as Senator Murphy has said, was an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  There were very few Irish politicians who knew more about Irish solutions to Irish problems than Deputy Haughey.  Indeed he was the master practitioner of that art.  Then we had the Barry Desmond Bill at which time we were told this country could descend into some dreadful, unbearable moral quagmire if that Bill was passed. The Bill was duly passed with my distinguished colleague, former Deputy Barry Desmond, cast in the role of a political battlecat fighting off all the forces of restriction, old-fashioned ideas and so on.  Deputy Desmond fought them off and lived to tell the tale.</P>
      <P>We have the present Bill, and, as Senator Murphy might have said, I have a feeling that quite large numbers of the public now find the whole issue something of a bore.  In many ways public opinion has moved on, away from it.  I have a feeling they regard some of the political shenanigans on this issue somewhat irrelevant, not having any place whatever in the present world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill itself does mark some progress, although, it does not go far enough.  One feels that the constraints in the Bill were gestures in the direction of the country's moral police force. Obviously those elements are becoming less powerful and less important than they used be.  However I believe the <Col N="2172" /> present restrictions contained in the Bill are there at the behest of those people. I can understand why they have been included at the behest of such people. Were I in the Minister's position, were there as many of those people in my party as there are in the Minister's party, I am not sure I would have the stomach to resist their wishes because, of course, they do commend quite an amount of clout and power in this country, even if it is diminishing.</P>
    <P>This time the debate by no means has been as difficult or as rancorous as the last time, indeed the first occasion.  That is to be welcomed.  In many ways we are improving, but we have quite a way to go before we become fully mature in these matters.  It might be no harm to remind ourselves that the restrictions on the sale of condoms only came into law in this country some time in the thirties.  My distinguished colleague, Sentor Harte, told the House last night that in his younger days in the city of Dublin when he was working as a delivery boy for a firm of chemists he used to have the job of delivering these devices to the clients of his employer.  It was only from the thirties onwards that we began to worry about the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister has not gone the whole way or has not had the capacity to make condoms fully and freely available to those who want them. It is no harm to remind ourselves that there is no obligation on anybody to purchase or use condoms.  All that is really being asked is that they should be readily available to people who want to use them.  It is simply a matter of personal choice as to whether one wants to use them.</P>
    <P>There is, apparently, a clear consensus that the availability of condoms has an important role to play in the control and prevention of AIDS.  This has been the basic argument advanced by the Minister in support of the legislation.  This, as it were, is his main defence as he comes under attack from the various moral police forces who will berate him and put him under pressure because of the introduction of this legislation.  It is a pity <Col N="2173" /> in that sense that he has not been at least consistent in regard to the definition of condoms in the Bill.  Of course the definition which is given in relation to condoms is that they should have a role in the prevention of pregnancy.  One of the major reasons they are being introduced is to prevent the spread of AIDS, which is not consistent and not the same thing as preventing the development of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not have the political courage to allow condoms to be made available from vending machines.  It also seems as if he is behind the times in relation to the practice in this country.  There was a report in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> which stated that about 100 vending machines for the sale of condoms have already been installed.  The same report mentioned that another 40 or so condom vending machines will be installed within the next fortnight.  Senator Murphy has given a rate of condom machine installation in Cork as being in the order of two per day. If condom vending machines prevent one case of AIDS they will be well worth while.  I cannot for the life of me see what the problem is in relation to making condoms available from those outlets.</P>
    <P>It is also very difficult to understand why there is a need for restiction at 17 years of age.  The reality is that people in this age bracket who are sexually active will probably be the most irresponsible in relation to the way they behave sexually. If the basic objective is the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, or if that is the primary excuse which the Minister seeks to use for the introduction of this Bill, I cannot see how he can impose that restriction in relation to the age at which these devices will be made available unless he is under continuing, recurring pressure from those elements which I believe are primarily, although not exclusively centred in his own party. I cannot see how this age restriction will be enforced.  It cannot be enforced in relation to the illicit use of alcohol by people under the age of 17 or 18 years. You have only to walk the streets of Dublin any night to see youngsters <Col N="2174" /> emerging from off-license premises carrying large bags of cans of alcoholic drink.  The Minister is validly concerned about the role of condoms in the control and prevention of AIDS and in the control and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been a 45-50 per cent increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases over the last few years.  In St. James's Hospital, I gather that in 1988 9,755 people were treated for sexually transmitted diseases. In 1991 that number had increased to 13,758, so there is obviously a very serious problem in relation to sexually transmitted diseases which were a very serious problem in this country until about 1950 when the development and widespread availability of antibiotics helped to control them.  In many ways between 1950 and 1980 the problem was basically contained.</P>
    <P>Since the advent of AIDS &mdash; the first paper on AIDS was published in 1983 &mdash; the problem has become much more serious.  There are now something like 276 cases of full blown AIDS and over 100 people have died from it.  Senator Norris made the point that while AIDS is a very serious problem, its spread is not exclusively related to sexual activity. Some of it is, but other AIDS cases arise from the totally irresponsible use of needles and so on.  We must keep in mind that when we talk about the control of the spread of AIDS arising from the greater availability of condoms there is a limit to the degree which greater availability of condoms will help to control the disease, but we should reach that limit.  In other words, we should make them available so that at least that source of the spread of AIDS can be controlled as far as possible. However, we must live with the fact that people will continue to get AIDS through the irresponsible use of needles and so on, but that is a separate matter.</P>
    <P>One of the things which has often struck me in relation to the growth in the incidence of AIDS is the fact that, as I understand it, the disease develops in much the same way as the growth of bacteria.  You can expect, as it were, that <Col N="2175" /> growth curb to go through an expansionist phase.  That point is sometimes lost on the public when we talk about or when we observe very large percentage increases in the spread of AIDS from year to year.  While that is very regrettable it simply arises to some degree because of the phenomenon through which that disease grows.  In many ways, while it is very disturbing, to some extent the public may be excessively alarmed by the figures because they may be not as informed as they should be in relation to the way in which these disorders grow when there are no proper or effective drugs to control them.</P>
    <P>Many of the restrictions in this Bill are irrelevant today.  It is a pity that the Minister could not bring himself to be fully in accord with the concerns of most people in this country.  It is a pity that he has bowed to the pressures to which I have no doubt he has been subjected.  It is also a pity that he was not able to go the whole way in relation to making condoms available reasonably and sensibly in the fight to try to control AIDS, a terrible disease regarding which we would all benefit from knowing more about it.  However, that is a long and complex matter and indeed somewhat outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as much out of a sense of duty as anything else that I speak on this because, quite honestly, like many of my colleagues, I am bored stiff with the issue.  The only thing which sustained my interest is the persistent prissiness of Governments and indeed other people who talk about the issue.  I do not understand what sort of perception of the rest of humanity guides those who believe the restrictions in this Bill have any meaning in terms of private, not to mention public, morality.  The idea that you will do some good by these restrictions is such a profound indication of a disorientated vision of our society and of the people who live here that it might alleviate my boredom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that we have moved so far that the sale of peculiarly constructed pieces of rubber is the sort of thing that <Col N="2176" /> should be confined, as Senator Murphy quite rightly said, to a ministerial order about quality and standards.  Beyond that, let us go on and deal with things that matter to people far more than the degree of accessibility to condoms.</P>
    <P>I recall the first time I saw a slot machine containing contraceptives in a public house in London in 1966.  It was in an Irish area of London and an uninformed or perceptive Irish male had written that it was the worst chewing gum he had ever purchased.  Remarks such as that remind one of the triviality of the issue but the apparent determination of the Irish State to turn a trivial issue, which took 12 months to progress from the first publication of a ridiculously restrictive Bill, to this debate was obvious.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine, who has no connection with subversives, had her home raided during a fairly extensive period of house raids some years ago.  The Special Branch had a warrant to search for arms. She happened to be involved in a contraception action campaign, so the only objects they came across were large supplies of contraceptives.  Eventually, after the usual routine, when she went to collect what had been taken from her home, the gardaí showed a far greater interest in the condoms than would have been healthy, given that they were supposed to be concerned about arms in the first place.  The confiscation of condoms as the consequence of a raid on a house in pursuit of something as serious as arms is a commentary, not just on the Garda, but on all of us.  It is also a commentary on the pessimistic view of sex, which for a brief period of our history, in this part of the country at least, has taken hold of us.</P>
    <P>We are not a people with a long history of repression in the area of sexuality, in fact, quite the opposite is the case.  A considerable lack of inhibition was one of our characteristics up to the Famine when a certain view of sex which controlled the Roman Catholic Church at the time took root in the minds of many people.  It has taken us a little over 100 years to get rid of it but we have moved <Col N="2177" /> from that and now have a much healthier attitude, based on the fact that people are mature and sensible most of the time and that nothing coercive will make irresponsible people behave responsibly in this area.  The only way one can influence people is to persuade them that certain courses of action are in their own self-interest.</P>
    <P>I am amused at the continuing prissiness of Irish society&mdash;not at ourselves, because I am perpetually amused at politicians &mdash; but at the Irish media who have drawn some extraordinary significance from a statement by a Fianna Fáil Deputy in the Dáil that he was a young, sexually active, Irish male.  This was supposed to represent some significant step forward in Irish life although the man in question is married and has three children.  If he was not sexually active I would be far more concerned about him.  If he admitted to not being sexually active, there would be some significance in the statement. When the Irish media see some significance in a young, married, Irishman admitting to being sexually active, perhaps people, apart from politicians, need to look at the assumptions, perceptions, prissiness and underlying puritanism that still bedevils us.</P>
    <P>On the serious issue of the transmission of AIDS the quibble one should always have is in pretending that there is a simple solution to its sexual transmission.  Condoms, as everyone knows, provide considerable protection but they are not a guaranteed from of protection.  They are a guaranteed powerful agent for reducing the spread of AIDS.  Words like &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; are still important.  Even with something as joyful and liberating as sex, there is still an obligation on people to behave responsibly.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that the more irresponsible people are in the use of their sexuality, all the evidence is the less likely they are to use any form of protection. That does not get away from the fact that the first step would be to make contraceptives and condoms available to everybody who might conceivably use them in order to prevent the transmission <Col N="2178" /> of AIDS.  Some prissy restrictions are inexplicable.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated by the prohibition on the sale of condoms in sports centres catering for persons under the age of 17. Does that mean that shops which cater for persons under the age of 17 can sell contraceptives but that sports centres cannot?  Why are people at more sexual risk in sports centres than they are in shops or in other retail outlets?  I am intrigued by this.  It is as if somebody asked what would be the areas in which somebody could catch us, sports centres were mentioned and included.  Even the local sweet shop can sell condoms but, apparently, there is no moral hazard there.  Is it that people think there are some hidden sexual undertones in sporting activities?</P>
    <P>Condoms are one of the classic items which should be sold where the market exists.  Where they are sold should be determined by the market and not by intrusive, meaningless regulations.  If there is a demand for condoms in sports centres, which happen to be used by young people under 17, then condoms should be on sale there.  These regulations assume the traditional position of the old moral guardians that these &ldquo;things&rdquo;, as they would call them, are a source of encouragement to a form of behaviour.  They are not.  Anybody who has the sense of responsibility to avoid sexual activity, except when condom protection is available, has reached a level of sensible maturity which will mean that the availability of condoms will not be a determinant in their moral choices.  That is what makes me wonder who is responsible for thinking up these regulations. Why should they not be sold from a mobile outlet?  What is so risky about a mobile outlet?  The only risk I can think of is the possibility of not enforcing standards but if that is the problem it should be stated explicity.  Somebody also felt, presumably, that there would be these slightly dirty men outside pubs at night, slipping these things to people, perhaps at a reduced rate, in the interests of corrupting our youth.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see logic behind these <Col N="2179" /> restrictions, other than the inclusion of restrictions to satisfy people who might otherwise start complaining.  Where is the logic in saying that there is something sensible about selling them in public houses, where the poor, unfortunate publican is overworked and under pressure late at night?  As well as having to deal with drunken customers wanting more drink because of the approach of closing time, he will have to make sure that the people to whom he sells them are not under 17.  People can be in public houses if they are under 17 years but they cannot drink.  The mind boggles at this.</P>
    <P>We should be grateful that something as vital to the protection of life as these can be dispensed safely and helpfully through a dispensing machine.  Are we trying to impose yet another moral barrier that one might have to confront somebody known to one?  Senator Murphy made a very valid point when he said that one should not confuse morality with privacy.  People may be quite happy with their moral choices but may not feel that is the same as advertising them in the crowded conditions of their local public house late on a Saturday night.</P>
    <P>I do not often feel out of place in my own country, I am very comfortable in Ireland.  I do not share many of the views of the liberal wing of Irish society about its nature but this issue increasingly makes me feel that I am entirely out of touch, because I do not understand the logic behind legislation like this, the logic behind the age, access and outlet restrictions. I do not understand the logic behind prohibiting vending machines as if somebody had created a new totem of the image of Irish life, before which we must genuflect, stating, &ldquo;no vending machines for condoms&rdquo;.  This is the image we were going to preserve.  This is the little relic of ourselves as we used to be that we are going to hang on to for another ten, 15 or 20 years.  The image of ourselves as we used to be is that of a healthy people with a healthy attitude to sexuality, an attitude which was taken from us briefly for about 130 or 140 years but which we are now rediscovering.  The <Col N="2180" /> little episode of the last 40 years of extreme puritanism is an even smaller episode in our history and now we are moving beyond it.  Maybe in this legislation there is a hint of nostalgia, not for an Ireland that never really existed anyway but for the way we would have liked things to have been.  This legislation would have been right and necessary even if the AIDS threat did not exist, because access to proper contraception is a necessary part of the healthy sexual development of any adult.  Access to contraceptives should be a normal part of peoples' maturing.  The choice should be part of that.</P>
    <P>At some other stage I would like to have a serious discussion in this House about AIDS and about moral responses, personal responses, societal responses and responses in terms of medical care, etc.  It is an enormous issue.  I am not sure it is one to which our society has yet faced up to completely or adequately.  It is an issue that deserves far more than legislation making condoms available, important though they be.  This small piece of legislation is a statement of the fact that we no longer believe that these things are somehow inherently lethal and need to be handled with as much care as explosives.  We have at least moved beyond that.  As far as that goes, it is welcome.  It is a pity that the Dáil is in recess because there are amendments that will be discussed which would simplify and make far more sense of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, all the way through, refers to persons selling condoms.  Both the 1979 Act and the 1985 Act, either by deliberate choice or by accident, are written in language that prohibits a limited company from selling condoms.  For instance, pharmacies that are limited companies cannot sell condoms.  This was confirmed for us at about 2 a.m. on the morning the 1985 Family Planning Bill went through this House by the then junior Minister at the Department of Health.  At that time we had the spectacle of the then Senator Mark Killilea attempting to amend the legislation to let all limited companies sell contraceptives.  I do not think that <Col N="2181" /> was his intent, but the effect of his amendment would have been to do so.  I have not seen anything in this legislation which changes that.  Maybe the interpretation has changed, or maybe the law has changed and I missed it, but it would be a great pity if even the limited liberalisation that is here were to be inhibited by such a technical omission.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate over the past two days.  I will briefly record, for the benefit of the House, the reasons for bringing forward the legislation we are discussing here as a matter of urgency at this time.</P>
      <P>The Bill is primarily a response to public health issues.  It is intended to reduce the spread of sexually transmissable diseases, notably HIV/AIDS.  AIDS was identified as a clinical entity in 1981 and diagnosed cases have been reported to the Department of Health since 1982.</P>
      <P>The epidemiological development of AIDS and HIV in Ireland is similar to that experienced in other Western European countries.  From 1982 to 1985 cases were reported in homosexuals and haemophiliacs and the condition was seen as a largely imported disease.  When seroprevalence monitoring became possible in 1985 it was apparent that the HIV virus was indigenous in the country and that a particular problem existed in relation to the spread of HIV infection in IV drug abusers.</P>
      <P>To date we have 276 cases of AIDS reported, which meet the CDC/WHO definition.  Some 1,223 people have tested HIV positive.  The percentage of IV drug related cases is now 39.5 per cent of all cases as compared to 10.5 per cent in 1986.  This movement of the epidemic towards the drug abuser has been accompanied by a steady increase in the number of heterosexual cases.  Nine per cent of Irish cases are heterosexual.  In 1986 we had no heterosexual cases in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Positive tests are reported by the virus reference laboratory to the Department of Health each year.  Of these, the <Col N="2182" /> number of heterosexual cases which have tested positive is increasing steadily.  In 1986, 21 HIV positive heterosexual cases were reported.  Since then the numbers have increased to 148 cases to date. Interestingly, the number of tests carried out on heterosexuals has trebled between 1987 and 1992, increasing from 7,638 to 20,850.  It is not unreasonable to conclude from these figures that there is a movement of the disease away from the groups traditionally considered to be most at risk of contracting the infection to the wider community.  In addition, using the heterosexual figures as an indicator, it would appear from the statistics regarding the numbers tested that an increasing number of heterosexuals are considering themselves to have been at risk of contacting the infection.</P>
    <P>The number of cases of STDs notified to the Department of Health under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, show an increase also from 2,891 new cases in 1986 to 4,189 in 1990.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the framework for the availability of condoms provided under the 1979 and 1985 Acts needed to be updated to respond to the situation which I have described.</P>
    <P>The use of condoms in the fight against AIDS/HIV in particular has been endorsed by international fora, such as the WHO, and was addressed recently by the National AIDS Strategy Committee in their comprehensive review of our national AIDS strategy.  The strategy committee highlighted the role of the condom as a primary measure in preventing the infection.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to update some of the provisions of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 and 1985.  The 1979 Act was designed to deal in an acceptable and responsible way with a problem which had already been a matter of debate for some years and had culminated in a Supreme Court decision which involved a fundamental change in the law relating to the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The Government in 1979 decided to avail of the opportunity, when introducing legislation made necessary by the <Col N="2183" /> Supreme Court decision, to legislate also for a full family planning service.  It made provisions, <i>inter alia,</i> for; the orderly organisation of family planning services and the provision of a comprehensive natural family planning service; the making available by health boards of a family planning service, which was defined as a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to any one or more of the following: family planning, contraception and contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Provision was also made for the sale of contraceptives in certain chemists shops to persons named in a prescription of authorisation given by a registered medical practitioner.  The doctor had to be of the opinon in giving the prescription that the contraceptives were being sought for the purpose, bona fide, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropiate circumstances.  The doctor had to indicate this on the prescription. The Act also made provisions with regard to the licensing of importers and manufacturers of contraceptives; the advertising and dispaly of contraceptives; and the funding of research into certain methods of contraception.</P>
    <P>The 1979 Act was seen at that time as an appropriate legislative initiative, given that it set out a structure for the organisation of family planning services and introduced controls, considered necessary at the time, with regard to the sale of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Regulations made in 1980 required health boards to make available a family planning service and indicated the requirments to be met in relation to family planning services provided by other bodies.  They dealt with the issuing of prescriptions and authorisations for contraceptives, their importation and their advertising and display.</P>
    <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act was introduced in 1985.  It amended the 1979 Act by extending the right to sell contraceptives to doctors, employees of health boards, licensed family planning clinics, <Col N="2184" /> maternity hospitals and hospitals providing services for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.  The Act provided that condoms and spermicides could be sold without prescription to persons over 18 years of age from the specified outlets.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening address outlined the main provisions of the Bill introduced last year by the Government. One of the main priorities of my Department is the fight against AIDS.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overseen the completion of a set of recommendations from the National AIDS Strategy committee and funds have been provided for a number of responses to the issues raised.</P>
    <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1991, has been examined in detail to ensure that it dealt adequately with public health problems and with a view to bringing the provisions of the 1979 Act more into line with current thinking and practice in so far as family planning issues are concerned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns which the Government had last year in bringing forward the 1991 Bill and many features of it have been retained in the present Bill.  I have always felt, however, from my own experience, and in the light of views which have been expressed since it was published, that a number of changes in this Bill were necessary.  The Government have accorded priority attention because of the major public health issue at stake and the Government's concern that all action be taken to tackle the spread of HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>The main change which has been introduced to the 1991 Bill are, first, the removal of the provisions with regard to spermicides.  In the 1991 Bill it was intended that condoms and certain spermicides would be widely available without prescription.  This provision had followed on from the 1985 Act which had allowed condoms and spermicides to be sold to persons over 18 years of age.  The decision in 1985, was taken in the context of the desirability of using spermicides with certain condoms for contraceptive purposes.  Spermicides however, have no <Col N="2185" /> prophylactic effect other than as contraceptives. They do not prevent the spread of sexually transmissable diseases. In fact, I would be concerned that were they to be used mistakenly for such purposes, they could lead to the transmission of such diseases, including AIDS.  The Bill provides therefore that spermicides will in future come within the definition of a medical preparation to be governed by the provisions of the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>Second, in Section 4 of the Bill, the requirement that doctors must indicate on a prescription that a contraceptive is for the purposes, <i>bona fide</i>, of family planning is dropped.  this provision originated in the 1979 Act when entirely different considerations prevailed.  It is no longer considered appropriate to retain this requirement.</P>
    <P>Third, the Bill lowers the age limit for the purchase of all contraceptives to 17 years and eliminates the requirement that married couples should have to obtain a prescription to buy contraceptives.  Provision is made, therefore, in section 4 of the Bill, to exempt them from the prescription requirement.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the role proposed for the Health boards is dropped from the Bill. There is no need for a registration system, as it will be clear from the outset, where condoms may be sold.  A further change which has been made to the 1991 Bill involves the requirement that importers and manufacturers of condoms should hold a licence from the Minister for Health.  The Minister does not see this as necessary.  Instead of requiring that importers and manufacturers of condoms hold ministerial licences there is provision in section 4 of the Bill which enables the Minister to prescribe standards for contraceptives.  It will be illegal to supply contraceptives which do not comply with these standards.</P>
    <P>In the light of the debate in the Dáil last week, my colleague, the Minister for Health, moved a number of amendments to the 1992 Bill.  I have already outlined these to the House, the main amendments being an amendment to enable the Minister to grant aid all types of family planning research and an amendment <Col N="2186" /> enabling the Minister to oversee the provision of a comprehensive family planning service by health boards and other bodies.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer back to some comments made by Senators in the course of this Second Stage debate. Senators referred to the exclusion of vending machines from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider that the Bill represents a balanced, appropriate and pragmatic response to the evolving public health situation in the context of AIDS/HIV and other sexually transmissible diseases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context, it would be impossible to have an adequate and necessary level of supervision over the availability of condoms if these were to be available freely from vending machines, street vendors or mobile outlets.</P>
      <P>When developing this Bill, the Government did not consider it necessary to provide the total deregulation of condoms as being fundamental in the fight against AIDS/HIV.</P>
      <P>It is essential in developing legislation that we act proportionately to the difficulties which we are addressing and it can be seen that the provision of section 5 of the Bill in particular are proportionate and appropriate towards addressing, in a balanced way, all of the complex issues surrounding the availability of condoms here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concomitantly, section 5 liberalises significantly the areas through which condoms <Col N="2187" /> may be sold.  The effect of the section is that condoms may now be sold freely in almost all retail outlets to persons subject to the provisions of section 5 (1) (a).</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of age limits.  The Bill provides that condoms may be supplied from a wide range of outlets and that the age at which persons could obtain condoms should be reduced from 18 years to 17 years. Senators are aware that parents have expressed reservations in regard to the Bill which related in the main to a reduction in the age limit below 17 years. We must take cognisance of the views and reservations of parents in implementing legislation which provides for the wider availability of condoms.  We must strike the correct balance between the concerns of parents and the requirements to take measures to protect public health.  The establishment of this age limit is, the result of many representations made by individual parents and not as a result of concerns expressed by any organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in the context of an age limit of 17, is consistent with the development of the preventative elements of the national aids strategy and the dictates imposed by the continuing high prevalence of other STDS and, I would stress, does not interfere with the right of married couples under the age of 17 years to obtain contraceptives freely.  It also contains a provision which enables contraceptives to be sold to a person under the age of 17 years in respect of whom a prescription has been issued by a registered medical practitioner.  The Bill, therefore, represents a major improvement on the 1979 and 1985 Acts and, rightly so, in the light of the public health requirements at the present time.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello spoke of the need to refer specifically to the prophylactic effect of condoms and Senator Norris also referred to this issue.  The accepted medical definition of a condom includes reference to &ldquo;preventing infection&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the definition of contraceptive sheath in the Bill deals <Col N="2188" /> adequately with concerns in regard to their prophylactic effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mention it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello also referred to the treatment of persons in prison who are HIV positive.  The Minister for Justice has established a group to advise him on this and related issues.  The National Aids Strategy Committee has also dealt with the matter in the recommendations they made to the Minister for Health recently.  Their recommendations were forwarded to the Minister for Justice. I have no doubt that he is giving his full attention to the reports of both these groups.</P>
      <P>Senator Cullen referred to the pluralist society in which we live.  I am conscious that criticisms have been made of the 1979 Act in so far as it has been constructed, by certain groups, as sectarian. This is a matter of interpretation and there are several views on the matter. Last week, however, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, moved two amendments in the Dáil which were outlined for the House yesterday.  They remove any doubts as to the possibility of a sectarian approach being adopted to the interpretation of the legislation by deleting references in the 1979 Act to &ldquo;natural&rdquo; methods of family planning.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross made a very general speech about the Bill.  He referred to an ethos which he considers to be inherent in the provision regarding the age limits in section 4 (1) (b) (ii) of the Bill and to the fact that persons under 17 years of age and who are married may obtain contraceptives freely.  This matter, I had hoped, was clearly explained in the Minister's opening address.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate that married couples should seek a prescription for non-medical contraceptives. This would be an unnecessary intrusion on their married lives.  This is a sensible, pragmatic provision which is not underpinned by any particular ethos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly raised the need for a sex education programme in schools.  As the Senator will be aware, the Departments <Col N="2189" /> of Health and Education are currently implementing an aids education programme in secondary schools and as was mentioned in the Dáil last week, there will be a meeting with the Minister for Education shortly, to discuss the question of the education in schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte, quite rightly, highlighted the role of a proper framework to deal with: treatment, care and management of persons with HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; contact tracing; HIV testing and counselling; and support systems.  Those services are not appropriate in a Bill which deals primarily with the wider availability of condoms in the context of the prevention of these infections.</P>
    <P>The provision of services is implemented under the health Acts and I am glad to inform the Senator that all of the services which he has mentioned are being provided throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition, over £3 million was recently allocated to the health services, including the voluntary sector, to implement the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, towards delivering programmes and services relating to: prevention through education and information; care and management of infected persons; and support for infected persons and their families.</P>
    <P>I regret that Senator Hederman feels that yesterday we were not taking the views of this House seriously.  Reference was made to the enlightened and constructive views of Senators and I can assure the Senator that in the exercise of the considerable powers given to the Minister under the Act we will bear in mind the opinons expressed here during the course of this excellent debate.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis and O'Reilly mentioned the need for more rigid controls over cigarettes.  While not relevant to this debate, I would like to put on the record of the House that the Department of Health have the most stringent and comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation in Europe.  We are regarded as pioneers in this area, so much so that our legislation <Col N="2190" /> has been used as the basis for similar legislation by the EC and Canada.  We have been successful through our legislation and information programmes in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the adult population from 45 per cent in the mid seventies to 32 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív mentioned the desirability of a monogamous relationship as the one sure way of avoiding HIV infection. This is, in fact, reflected in the Department's information programme on AIDS.  For instance, the booklet entitled <i>AIDS &mdash; The Facts</i> in the section on &ldquo;How to Avoid Infection&rdquo; states: &ldquo;Remain faithful to one sexual partner who is also faithful to you.&rdquo;  It is accepted, however, that this advice will not be heeded by everyone, so the Bill is designed primarily to ensure that condoms are as widely available and accessible to meet the problems being posed by HIV and AIDS.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle, in addition to addressing the points raised by other Senators about the age limit and the vending machines to which I have already responded, questioned the structures through which our AIDS strategy is being implemented.  In view of the many facets of the AIDS problem and the responses required from various State and voluntary agencies, the National AIDS Strategy Committee was established to ensure that a co-ordinated and integrated inter-sectoral approach was adopted. The committee consists of experts from the voluntary sector, the health boards, the Government Departments of Health, Education and Justice and from virology and genito-urinary medicine and drug treatment.  The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Donnell, is chairman of this committee and is in the position to provide leadership and drive to the delivery of the AIDS strategy.  I am pleased to let Senator Doyle know that Dr. James Walsh, the former National AIDS Co-ordinator, whom she referred to, is a member of the committee.  Dr. Walsh is also retained as a consultant to the Department of Health on AIDS issues.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, may I compliment all the Senators who contributed to this very wide-ranging debate.  This Bill is a pragmatic and carefully considered response to a public health concern.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to change the definition of a condom.  It broadens it to include devices which are not intended to prevent pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse between human beings.  It is obvious that AIDS also results from sexual intercourse between human beings where there is no possibility of pregnancy.  The definition is flawed and is in conflict with one of the basic objectives of the Bill as outlined by the Minister, the prevention and limitation of the spread of AIDS.  For those reasons we have sought to change the definition of condoms in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this amendment as it would effectively render the definition of contraceptives meaningless.  If this amendment was passed I could not, for example, make regulations with regard to the quality standards for condoms as this definition seems to specifically state <Col N="2193" /> that they are not contraceptives.  Should this amendment be accepted much of the remainder of the Bill would cease to have any effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and accept the Minister's argument but would he accept that the section defining &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; is itself absurd?  He stated that the principal intent of this Bill is to prevent the spread of disease, not to inhibit pregnancy. It is not principally intended as a family planning Bill but as a measure against the spread of disease.  Section 2 gives the following definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Contraceptive&rdquo; means any appliance or instrument, including contraceptive sheaths, prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse between human beings;</P>
      <P>Does this mean that a member of a homosexual partnership is excluded?  It would be absurd to maintain that homosexual partners in a relationship employ contraceptive sheaths in order to prevent pregnancy.  They do not; they very wisely do it in order to prevent the spread of infection.  The widespread use of this kind of prophylactic measure by the gay community in Ireland, to a certain extent, and certainly in San Francisco, has limited the spread of the disease.  Does this mean, therefore, that homosexual couples regardless of age are excluded?  Where is the intention stated?  When the Minister says &ldquo;prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy,&rdquo; does he mean the intention of the design of the contraceptive or the intention of those employing the contraceptive? I have to say it is a little confusing and this arises from the fact that historically contraceptive devices evolved directly from the question of family planning but now the far more important use of these devices is as a prophylactic measure against the spread of disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the point the Minister has made, but unquestionably the definition of contraception is totally at odds with the remarks of <Col N="2194" /> the greater part of the Minister's address here yesterday when he stated that while the purpose of this legislation was to deal with the prevention of pregnancy, it had a much wider function.  The definition here is only for the narrower function and that is not in accordance with the purpose of this legislation.  Therefore, even if the Minister was unhappy with the wording we are putting forward as an inappropriate substitute, nevertheless he must acknowledge that what is there is totally unsuitable and does not fulfil the purpose of providing for a variety of contraceptive measures which are included for the first time in the definition, such as contraceptive sheaths or condoms. Perhaps the Minister would explain the anomaly between what is provided here, under the umbrella of family planning legislation, and what he has stated as being the purpose of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I did anticipate what Senator Norris would say and I examined this issue last week.  The definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; includes the words &ldquo;prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy resulting from ...&rdquo;.  The prophylactic role as a measure against infection is, of course, secondary and that should be borne in mind.  The medical definition of a condom includes reference to preventing infection.  They are primarily used during sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy but their secondary role is to prevent infection.  Of course, section 4 of the Bill makes significant reforms in the area of family planning.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister can clarify something for me?  My understanding is that in the light of the AIDS crisis prophylactics and condoms have been developed specifically for use by the gay community but they were neither intended nor designed as a contraceptive. It bothers me that the Minister may not <Col N="2195" /> have, because of the narrowness of the definition, the power to specify proper standards for such condoms should they come on the market in Ireland; and it is necessary that such products should be on the market here to avoid the spread of AIDS.  They were a direct consequence of the AIDS crisis.  The strong quality was designed for use by homosexual couples with a view to preventing the transmission of AIDS.  They have no contraceptive intent.  Their design was not based on a contraceptive intent and their use is not as a contraceptive.  What would concern me is not that they would be unavailable but that the Minister might have the power to ensure that only products of a proper standard were available.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has brilliantly anticipated what I intended to say. It is interesting that he was aware of this. In fact my understanding is &mdash; I could be incorrect in this &mdash; that Richard Branson's brand named &ldquo;Mate&rdquo; condoms were specifically designed with this intention. It seems that by the operation of this Bill the Minister is legally excluding this form of contraception from the operation of the Bill.  I am less worried about the question of safety, because they are designed with this requirement in mind and this has been established in the press and newspaper reports and possibly by the court action that was taken.  In fact they may not be covered by the Bill so they could legally be given free, they could be legally dispensed by people other than chemists or agents of health authorities and so on, and indeed they could be placed in machines.  However, in a sense it is disingenuous of the Minister to say that the primary reason for the use of the sheath is always to prevent contraception because clearly in the case of homosexual couples this is not the case.  It could not possibly be even a secondary effect, because a condom &mdash; I hope I am not disillusioning the Minister terribly&mdash;is not necessary in homosexual relations to prevent pregnancy.</P>

      <P>There is no patent on design.  A condom can be of any form, shape or size.  Therefore there is no question of our saying that one of a different type; once they prevent conception they are condoms as such.  Once they are sheaths in any form and prevent conception they are condoms.  The definition of a condom is &ldquo;a thin rubber or plastic skin worn during copulation for preventing conception or infection&rdquo;.  An English physician in the 18th Century was said to be their inventor.  It does not matter what form they take &mdash; many of them are animal products &mdash; their primary purpose is to prevent conception and the secondary role is to prevent infection. Everything is covered that would have that purpose in mind but nothing will be forbidden or precluded from coming within the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not satisfied me on that point because the wording in the definition is &ldquo;prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy.&rdquo;  I have to ask the Minister whether condoms prevent conception simply by existing? Surely it is not sufficient to say that condoms prevent conception by existing or because they have a capacity at some stage to prevent conception.  It is clear that there are contraceptive sheaths designed, prepared, intended and widely advertised as having no relation to the prevention of conception but having everything to do with the prevention of the spread of disease.  I could produce numerous advertisements for these condoms which say they are specially designed to prevent the spread of venereal infections, particularly AIDS, that they were prepared and intended to prevent the transmission of disease, not pregnancy.  I cannot deny that hypothetically there could be a secondary result in certain circumstances not principally envisaged by the manufacturer of preventing conception, but the question of preventing conception, is a question of the manner and the occasion in which they are used as well as the intention of the manufacturer and the person employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> It is clear that there are brands of contraceptives, or what you could call contraceptive sheaths, that are primarily designed, prepared, manufactured and employed with no direct thought of the prevention of conception but absolutely homing in on the question of the prevention of disease.  It appears to me from my reading of the Bill that they would not be covered.  What is stated here, in plain language, is that a contraceptive means something that is prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy.</P>

      <P>If I use condoms as a medical doctor for the purpose of a rectal or vaginal examination, they are intended for the purpose of examination. The Bill does not say it is intended by the manufacturers; it merely says it is intended.  It can be intended by the person using them.  I want to make that clear.  If I use them as a medical doctor in the course of a diagnostic examination, I intend them for a particular purpose. We have consulted the Attorney General's Office on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how anybody can argue that this is an adequate definition.  It is deficient.  First, the Minister gave us the definition and said it has a two-fold intention &mdash; to prevent pregnancy or infection; &ldquo;or&rdquo; is not a lesser degree; &ldquo;or&rdquo; is an alternative.  He cannot say now that the primary intention was to prevent pregnancy; he now says the Bill does not say it is intended by the manufactures; it says it is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely all manufacturers have taken on board developments that have come about in relation to the spread of the AIDS virus; and the purpose of the condom has been extended in terms of the manufacturer.  One purpose is the prevention of the spread of infection, but the overall purpose is to prevent either pregnancy or infection.  What we are stating here is not reflected in the Minister's remarks on the purpose of this legislation. If you were to include in the <Col N="2198" /> definition &ldquo;for the purpose of preventing pregnancy or infection&rdquo; that would be more acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the rationale of what the Deputy is suggesting because condoms are primarily to prevent conception in the process people getting pregnant no doubt get infected. We are not talking in terms only of AIDS and HIV, but other sexually transmissable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis and so on. Condoms are manufactured to the BSI standard and the standard has not changed to take care of the infection element.  Condoms must serve the purpose for which they are manufactured, which is preventing conception.  If we were to accept the amendment, the Bill would not serve the purpose for which it was introduced.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask one question of the Minister because it goes to the heart of the matter.  Suppose it was clear from the advertising and packaging of a particular form of contraceptive that this was designed principally or exclusively for the purpose of avoiding the transmission of disease, although it might have the secondary unintended effect of preventing conception, and suppose somebody sought to acquire or purchase one of these brands of contraceptive, would that be covered by this legislation? It seems to me from reading the Bill that it would not, and that might be a good thing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (b), to delate lines 11 to 20.</P>
      <P>Much to my regret this matter was referred to a number of times in reply to the substance of the debate by the Minister of State when he spoke about the rights of parents.  This is unacceptable. He said:</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of age limits.  The Bill provides that condoms may be supplied from a wide range of outlets and that the age at which persons could obtain condoms should be reduced from 18 years to 17 years.  Senators are aware that parents have expressed reservations in regard to the Bill which related in the main to a reduction in the age limit below 17 years.  We must take cognisance of the views and reservations of parents in implementing legislation which provides for the wider availability of condoms. We must strike the correct balance between the concerns of parents and the requirements to take measures to protect public health.</P>
      <P>Why?  What is so sacrosanct about the rights of parents?  What is so sacrosanct about the rights of one group of parents who apparently are unable to convince their children to behave in the way they think appropriate?  Why should other parents' children be penalised?  I have no doubt there may be a small increase in the incidence of HIV infection as a result of this provision.</P>
      <P>Who should we be protecting primarily? To whom is our primary responsibility?  It is not to the sensitivity of parents.  I respect these parents, but to a limited extent.  We should protect young people against a mortal illness and not dithering about the susceptibilities of parents who by their own admission have signally failed to convince their children of the rightness of their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> As far as I am concerned, I accept absolutely the authority of parents and their right to influence their families.  But what does this authority consist of?  It consists of the capacity of the parents to convince the child through respect, through argument and through love that their position is the correct one; and if they cannot do that why should they use the brutal instrument of the law to place other parents' children in jeopardy?  For that reason I think this is one of the most dangerous aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record that I believe strongly there should be no age limit at all.  If a 12 year old child were to be prevented from getting HIV by being given a condom free, I would personally give it to him and I would take whatever stick I got from the parents.  I know that the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, has had experience of this.  I know that he is a compassionate and caring man.  I have to exercise my compassion when I see a person I know to be a good man, somebody who is deeply caring about this problem and has personal acquaintance with it, sitting there.  Because of the reluctance of Government as a whole to move in this area, I am placed in this invidious situation.  However, I will not withdraw from the position I take on this.  There should be no age limit.  Our concern is not with the sensitivities of parents; our concern is with the health, the wellbeing and the survival of young people.  That is the paramount consideration.</P>

      <P>I want to support Senator Norris and to move our own amendments. I think this provision is unworkable. I cannot see how it can be enforced in the everyday lives of people.  I also cannot see that it has any function and it is in direct conflict with the Minister's objective of trying to restrict the spread of AIDS, which is a very worthwhile objective.  To be honest about it, this item in the Bill arises from what I would consider to be the activity of the moral police in this country, who in many ways have put the Minister in a very invidious position.  I regret that.  I do not think that that type of provision is realistic.  I do <Col N="2201" /> not think it is enforceable and I honestly think it should be dropped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate at this stage some of the points I already made on Second Stage as they are relevant here.  The first thing I identified on Second Stage was the major difficulty of how we are actually to implement this section.  How does one police such a section?  We all know that because of patterns of dress, hair styles and the different physical sizes of people, it is a practical impossibility to work out the exact ages of people.  There will certainly be big margins of error.  That is the first difficulty with the age factor, the identification of the people involved.</P>
      <P>As a teacher involved in training young people, I would hope that young people would be responsible in their sexuality and in their sexual practices.  That is what we would all want and that is what we will have to try to achieve through education campaigns in schools.  On Second Stage I called for a complete programme of education in our schools.  Why would that be our aspiration?  The reality is that many of our young people are sexually active at a much younger age now.  This is quite clear.  It is clear if only from the fact that last year there were 2,000 teenage pregnancies and that last year 4,000 young women made the lonely journey to England for abortions.  Those are horrible and said sad statistics.</P>
      <P>I accept that there would be some happy endings to teenage pregnancies, but there is a lot of human trauma and suffering as well.  We are dealing with a situation where people are sexually active at a younger age, a situation where we cannot very easily determine whether a person is 15, 17 or 18 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no empirical evidence to suggest that people become sexually active because of the availability of contraceptives. They are sexually active first and they proceed to use contraceptives later.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the availability of these things will make people sexually active. That is an important point.  If there were evidence that it was leading to promiscuity <Col N="2202" /> then it would be a very important consideration, but that evidence does not exist.  It is clear also that the Irish communities in London &mdash; I lived among them for periods during the summer months &mdash; live to a very traditional moral code, a very Irish moral code, in the middle of a city where these vending machines are readily available.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of AIDS. We are talking about the prevention of death from and the spread of such a horrific disease.  It is something that cannot be treated lightly.  When one takes all of these issues into consideration we are left with the obvious conclusion that the amendment should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, particularly the section we are talking about, is the great missed opportunity.  It is all the more so because the Minister flattered to deceive on this issue by his own utterances.  Many of us were of the opinion that we would get really progressive legislation in this area.  In being critical of the Minister, I feel that if he were left to his own devices the Bill might not be exactly what we have before us today.  But he must accept responsibility for the legislation before us and consequently must accept the criticisms not only in these Houses but from the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age limit is unenforceable.  Maybe it is just as well if the nonsense is going to persist and we are going to be voted down, as I suspect, with the amendments here this evening.  We are quite frankly stating to young people that when they reach 17 years of age they are now legally entitled to enter into casual sexual relationships.  It is like giving them a licence for casual sex.  It is far more dangerous than having no age limit at all.  It is very hard for young people, particularly young girls, who may want to hold the line in certain relationships if on reaching the age of 17 they can then be pressurised by their boyfriend or by their colleagues who say &ldquo;What is wrong with you?  It is legal at 17 years.&rdquo;  That is the great issue that indicts this legislation. It is a great tragedy that we have <Col N="2203" /> handed to young people the dictum that casual sex is legal at the age of 17 as the law of this land stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. There is a point that needs to be underlined.  When we put in legislation a statement that condoms can be used at the age of 17 and over it is giving a certain licence that many might have felt was not there before.  I take the point made by Senator Norris that over the age of 16 people are free to make their own arrangements in these areas; but for youngsters who might not otherwise feel that that was the sort of moral code they were operating under we have made life even more difficult in many ways.  I make that point not to criticise in any way but because those of a certain view feel that they are protecting young people by putting in an age limit of 17 in this Bill.  I feel it is making a nonsense of the argument that there is any protection there.  It is making life more difficult for youngsters and making it particularly difficult for them to resist going the full way in a sexual relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is being made that there is no compulsion on anyone to use condoms. Why is an age limit necessary at all?  There is no complusion on 15 year olds or 19 year olds to use them if they do not want to.  There is no compulsion on any age group at all.  What is the Minister trying to achieve by putting an age limit in the Bill?  It does nothing but give a certain <i>imprimatur</i> by the State to casual sex when one reaches 17 years of age. What else is going to be achieved?  What intrinsic medical danger is there in a condom in the hands of a 14 year old?  I made the point earlier on Second Stage that if a 4 year old gets hold of them, the greatest danger to them is that they may <Col N="2204" /> choke, but other than that, from a sexual point of view, there is no medical danger. There is a far greater risk to the lives of women from oral contraceptives than ever these inert contraceptives could possibly have.</P>
    <P>If we must discuss this subject and the nonsense of the Bill before us, we should be addressing the health problems that can arise for women on oral contraception generally, which are far more difficult.  It is an area that has been neglected. For the last ten years we seem to have been talking in this House about condoms and have got no further.  It has not been taken off the agenda, as has been said in this House also.  All we have managed to do is teach every nine and ten year old, if not seven and eight year old, what a condom is, what divorce is about or what abortions are, because we talk and talk for ever and never complete the agenda.  We are going around in circles to such an extent, particularly on the 17 year age limit, that we are the laughing stock of the public.  The public are aeons ahead of the legislators on this.  If they want condoms, they will use them whether they are 16, 26 or 46 years of age.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the position.  I believe we are wasting our time to a large extent.  The point has been well made in recent days that the Dáil has now gone into recess, that even if the Minister were of a mind to accept amendments in this House he would have to either recall the Dáil, which would not be done, or else wait until the autumn for the Dáil to come back into session.  I would ask the Minister to be true to his own beliefs on this issue and to indicate his own views on whether having a 17 year age limit makes any sense at all or if this is just a State <i>imprimatur</i> for casual sex when youngsters reach this age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree very strongly with what has been said from these benches in relation to these amendments. The simple straightforward fact is that last year there were 2,000 teenage pregnancies, so certainly there were 13, <Col N="2205" /> 14, 15, 16 and 17 years olds in that group. Therefore, sexual activity at an early age is quite widespread.</P>
      <P>As well as that, last year almost 14,000 people attended St. James's Hospital clinic for treatment in relation to sexually transmissible diseases.  Obviously we have a major problem in that area as well.  These are simple facts.  What is the Minister's response to that?  It is to introduce a discretionary cut-off legal age which, in fact, is anomalous because it varies as between persons who are single and those who are married, as though only those who are married are likely to be sexually active.  What is the Minister's response based on?  It is based on that hoary old chestnut that has cropped up over and over again and which has been thrown into this debate from the other side of the House on Second Stage, that just as television heralded the advent of sex in this country the availability of condoms is responsible for sexual activity. It is that sort of scientifically unfounded psychological ethos that has been generated in a certain section of our community. It is that attitude that permeates this Bill against, I am sure, the better judgement and aspirations of the Minister.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that sexually transmissible diseases know no legal age limits once people are sexually active and it does not matter whether the person is single or married.  The Minister has not a leg to stand on for maintaining this provision in the Bill.  The Minister will recognise what has been put very strongly from these benches, that condoms are simple, harmless pieces of merchandise. They are rubber, plastic or whatever material and they have never caused a single death to child or adult.  For that reason it seems very strange that the Minister should insist on imposing such restrictions on something that is of a non-medical character and which, in the final analysis, the Minister will not be able to enforce under the law.</P>

      <P>I suppose the easy thing for me to do in these circumstances would be to remain silent and say nothing, but <Col N="2206" /> lest that would be interpreted as some sort of tacit support for a situation which I believe to be incorrect, it is imperative that I should say something.  I am very uncomfortable about the provisions of the Bill in relation to this matter for most of the reasons that have been articulated on the other side of the House.  I do not doubt the Minister's motives or his genuine desire to improve the situation within the country in respect of this matter.  He is to be commended on what he has done.  However, this whole issue is really ludicrous.  What are we going to do if we find young persons of 14, 15 or 16 years of age buying condoms?  Are we going to subject them to the rigours of the law?  Are we going to go again to the High Court and the Supreme Court on a matter like this just as we have done on other matters?  That is the logical extension of this type of measure.  That is certainly to over-dramatise the case, but that could be the consequence of it under law.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a gross insult to the intelligence of young people.  It is also very regrettable that we do not repose in them a certain level of trust which they are entitled to expect of us.  I am a parent of teenage children and I am quite confident that they know all about these matters, and they certainly know far more about them than I knew when I was their age.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard the figures for pregnancies which have been documented over the past two days.  It may well be that some of these young people actually choose to be pregnant, but that is a choice which they are entitled to make.  If they do not want to be pregnant, they are entitled to make that choice too, and in the interests of public health, if we can do anything to assist those choices, then <Col N="2207" /> it is our responsibility to do that.  I do not understand why these matters should have been discussed in this House over the past two days when there are far more pressing matters that confront the country and society.  This is not a matter for legislation.  Why do we not trust the younger generation?  I made the point yesterday that we allow young people, almost without restriction to buy cigarettes, which are far more damaging to their health.  I do not believe this issue is a matter for the State.</P>
    <P>I am gratified that members of the party are allowed to exercise their individual discretion in matters of this nature and that is as it should be.  These are not matters for the party Whip or for rigid party regulation.  These are sensitive matters. I respect the view of the people who take a contrary position, the people who would have even more rigid restrictions if it were in their remit, but individuals must make their own decisions.  These are not decisions for the State, they are decisions for individuals.  It is not in our remit either to decree on the morality of issues or on whether or not they are sinful.  That is a matter between the individual and his God and his Church.  That has nothing to do with us in this House. These matters seem to get confused all the time.</P>
    <P>Young people are simply not interested in what is happening here today.  Certainly from my conversations with them I can assert that with a fair degree of certainty.  They think we are irrelevant.  Is anybody suggesting what we will do today will prevent young people of 15 or 16 years of age getting contraceptives if they want them?  What are we going to do when we discover they have obtained them?  Are we going to subject them to the rigours of the law? That is nonsense.  That is why I have serious difficulties with these provisions. People should be left to make their own decisions in private; It has been said that people are embarrassed to go into premises to buy condoms.  Young people are not embarrassed to do this.  I would certainly <Col N="2208" /> be embarrassed but I do not think my children would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis more often than makes me comfortable.  On this occasion I agree with him completely.  I was thinking about the things in Irish life that put young people at risk and I do not think sex is one of them.  Prohibited substances such as drugs which are a threat to the lives of at least a minority of our young people, are widely available in spite of massive prohibitions, huge police resources and all types of parental exultations. In spite of the apparent all-pervasive availability of life threatening drugs, the vast majority of our young people either do not sample them or sample them briefly and pass on to a life of considerably greater sense and maturity.  I work with young people &mdash; I teach a little &mdash; but I do not claim to know them that well.  Much as it pains me, I have to accept that they regard me as a member of a totally different generation who does not understand what they are talking about, not to mention much else.  Their capacity to handle the pressures of life, their awareness of the realities of life, their maturity and their common sense is light years ahead of my capacity when I was 17 or 18 years of age.  It is not that they are cynical or hardened; it is just that they are much more mature and sensible.  They make decisions about their lives in their own way and in their own time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a gross insult to them to pretend that this Bill is about protecting them. This Bill is about protecting the sensitivities of elderly men predominantly who are uncomfortable about these matters and who have to have a sop in it to keep them from feeling that some sort of metamorphorical floodgate is being opened.  This is a gross insult to our young people.  For the past 20 years the vast majority of young people have spent their summers in other countries where far more lethal substances than contraceptives are easily available.  They have survived all that, and they will survive easy access to small pieces of rubber. <Col N="2209" /> It is time we, and not our young people, grew up.</P>

      <P>As a people we are slow to accept different standards.  The 1985 Act was an improvement on the 1979 Act.  When the Coalition came into power they did not bring the age limit down to 17 years.  Perhaps they were right because at that time circumstances were different.  That Act was introduced by former Minister Barry Desmond.  I knew his personal views on the issue and that Act but he had to implement a Cabinet decision.  This is not a Dr. John O'Connell Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a Government Bill; we have collective responsibility for such matters.  During my few months in the Department of Health I have talked to groups who have accepted that there must be wider availability of condoms.  I explained the public health problems to them.</P>
      <P>As parents, we worry about our children when they are at an impressionable age.  We like to have a say in their upbringing up to a certain age, which I believe is 17 years.  We like to be able to advise them so that when they leave home, we know we have done our best for them.</P>
      <P>We should not take that role away from parents.  Parents want to give their children the best advice they can.  The age of majority is 18 years of age.  Why should it be 18 years and not ten or 12 years?  We set an age which we believe at the time is the correct one.  In another ten years' the age of majority may be 16 years.  It may even be 14 years by the end of the century.</P>

      <P>It is said that people are more sexually active nowadays.  People were engaging in sexual activities thousands of years ago.  We must listen to parents.  We cannot say to them that they have no rights.  They have rights.  They are not fundamentalists; they are genuine people who are concerned about their children.  If we do not respect parents we respect nobody.</P>
      <P>Most young people first have sex out of a sense of curiosity.  If they have to go to a doctor to get condoms he can give them advice, tell them about the measures they must take and warn them about the various sexually transmitted diseases.  He is doing more than just writing a prescription for condoms; he is acting as a medical adviser.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way since the 1979 Act.  In a year or two circumstances may change and we may have to introduce another Bill.  In 1971 I put down a parliamentary question to the then Minister &mdash; no one knew what I was talking about &mdash; in relation to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935.  We are moving along slowly.  As Senator Murphy knows, Ireland is not confined to Dublin 4 or Dublin 6.  There is a different way of life in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to think I am legislating for people in all parts of Ireland.  If we ignore the views of parents we will not be serving a useful cause.</P>
      <P>This is not my Bill; it is a Government Bill.  As circumstances change, more legislation will be introduced.  When we are integrated more into Europe, things may change more rapidly.  I ask Senators to accept that we have to take the views, fears and normal anxieties of parents into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not here when I made my Second Stage speech.  I referred to the 1979 Act, the Principal Act.  I said that although many things have changed there is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> nonetheless.  The then Minister also claimed that he would have liked to have gone much further but that he had to take various interests and pressures into account.  As the House will recall, <Col N="2211" /> he came up with the phrase, &ldquo;an Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;, which turned out to be infamously cynical.  As the debate went on &mdash; with respect, this seems to be another parallel &mdash; the then Minister seemed to sound an increasingly desperate tone as if to say: &ldquo;This is the best I can do, why can you not take it and understand I cannot do anymore?&rdquo; That parallel is still there.</P>
      <P>Of course, parents have rights.  I question if it is our business to legislate in this matter.  The Minister said that he must legislate for all of Ireland, not just for what he perceives to be Dublin 4.  Why legislate in this area?  Parents should realise that whether or not their child is sexually responsible is their responsibility. It is their responsibility whether their child is sufficiently well-informed to know that this piece of rubber is a mechanical aid which his morality will tell him to use or not to use.  To the extent that some parents demand the State to implement their rights, they are depriving other parents of their rights.  This is the inescapable dilemma and one of the numerous sillinesses the State gets into when it tries to legislate in this area.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with the age limit.  How can one enforce an age limit, be it 17 years, 18 years or whatever?  Who in a public house is going to establish, when the last drinks are being ordered and the condoms are being handed out with the pint, whether the recipient is under age or not?  How can this provision be enforced?  If it cannot be enforced it makes a nonsense of the law, and young people already know that.</P>

      <P>I do not doubt that the Minister is responding to representations made by a small number of concerned parents.  However, it is a question of whether the priority lies in terms of the concerns of these people, the greater good or people and the objective the Minister has set himself of preventing the spread of AIDS, which should be the primary objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is much difference <Col N="2212" /> between Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 and the rest of the country.  I am sure the Minister would agree that there is very little difference between Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 and Dublin 12.  I would not be as concerned as some people seem to be about those differences.  It is a pity that the Minister will not accept these amendments. I would not be too bothered if this Bill had to go back to the Dáil.  If we do not have a general election the Dáil will resume at the start of October.  In many ways too much has been made of the fact that the Bill will have to go back to the Dáil if it is amended here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one final point.  Many of the arguments have already been rehearsed.  Senator Murphy raised a point with which I dealt, and which the Minister has not taken on board, that is, the responsibilities of parents, not just their rights.  If they care for the children, parents have a responsibility within the family to make clear their ethical standpoint.  If they are incapable of doing that with affection and by way of example, then they have no reasonable moral resource to the force of law, which, as Senator Murphy correctly said, then impinges on the rights of other parents who do not take the same point of view.  Therefore there is a degree of moral violence by these people.  The right to health and the right to life &mdash; I am as entitled to use that phrase as anybody else &mdash; of young people is of far more consequence than the views and sensitivities of parents.  I am sure it will not come as a surprise to people to know that I am extremely pro-life, in the real sense of the word.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister. He made a superb speech in the Dáil on the first occasion the issue of AIDS was debated.  It was an extremely forward-looking speech.  Of course, he was then a backbencher; he certainly did not have ministerial responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A very useful backbencher <Col N="2213" /> bencher, if I may say so.  When the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, appointed Deputy O'Connell as Minister for Health I regarded it as a remarkable and great advance.  I remember the Minister saying that he hoped to play a role parallel to that played by Dr. Noel Browne in confronting tuberculosis.  I wish to say to the Minister that that is a very difficult role to square with the exigencies of meeting Cabinet dithering.  I do not know how the Minister can do this.  Perhaps he will find a formula.  He has my sympathy.  He will certainly have my support if he takes the Noel Browne road, because when Noel Browne believed in something &mdash; for example, the mother and child scheme and the tuberculosis eradication programme &mdash; he went right to the bitter limits and was prepared to bring the Government down, which he did.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the age of majority.  While there is a partial parallel, voting is not a life-threatening exercise and the parallel is not complete.  With regard to the age of consent, we received very interesting evidence, which I was unaware of, from my distinguished Labour colleague, Senator Jack Harte, who said in the House yesterday that when he was a youngster of 12 years in 1932 he sold condoms in a chemist shop in Parnell Street.  It does not seem to have irreparably damaged him.  He is one of the most sensible, balanced and decent people I have met.  I understand he is also a pretty good parent.  He survived the experience of selling condoms at 12 years of age in the north inner city.  At 16 years of age he was in the British Army.  Army personnel were not allowed out on the town without being given prophylactics. He also survived that experience.  This testimony by a Member of the House proves that our anxieties are misplaced and exaggerated.</P>

    <P>When will we grow up and realise that marriage has damn all to do with disease?

      <P>Marriage has nothing whatever to do with infection; it is another fig leaf.  There is a different age of consent for people who are married.  If one looks at the logic of this, it becomes even worse.  People are far less likely to engage in irresponsible or disease-threatening sexual activity within marriage.  It is the people outside marriage we should be most worried about.  Saying that there is a lower age for the accessibility of condoms within marriage is a complete and utter fraudulent piece of tripe.  To balance that we are told that the Bill contains a provision which enables contraceptives to be sold to a person under the age of 17 years if a prescription has been issued to him by a registered medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that there are circumstances in which perhaps approaching a doctor is useful because the issuing of the condom will be placed in the context of pseudo-parental advice to the young person involved.  I accept that this is always valuable.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Norris.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a person under the age of 17 who can acquire condoms if he or she has obtained a prescription from a registered medical practitioner. This is not practicable in all circumstances.  I disagree with Senator Dardis on the question of embarrassment. The embarrassment factor is extremely important.  Not just people of my generation but younger people are embarrassed at the prospect of going to a doctor or talking to their parents about this matter and they may very well not acquire these contraceptives even when they need them.</P>
      <P>Earlier I cited today's edition of the <i>Evening Herald</i> which published a survey of the sexual practices of young people. A young person is quoted as saying that he would use a condom but only if it was easily and freely available.  Under no circumstances would he go to a chemist shop to get one because he would feel embarrassed.  He said he would prefer to take the risk.  I imagine the risk of which this person was talking was the risk of pregnancy to his girlfriend, but I imagine that he would also be aware of the considerable risk in not using the appropriate protection against disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was extremely interested in what the Minister said and in the tone of his contribution. If one decoded it, he seemed to be saying that there has been a progression since 1979 when a Bill was introduced which was described as an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Then we moved to 1985 when there was a further degree of advance and liberalisation.  In 1992 it is being pushed a little further and within a short space of time we may be <Col N="2216" /> able to deal with this matter in a more far-reaching manner.  In 1979 we were dealing with a situation which was a result of a constitutional action.  The climate was substantially different.  Even I am saying things in 1992 which I would not have dreamt of saying in 1979.  The context has changed very radically in this area because of the impact of disease. We must bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>One would, of course, wish the Minister well in dealing with elements within Government who are not as yet able to take so progressive a view, perhaps because their minds are directed towards other areas which are critical to the Government of Ireland.  If this Seanad can do anything to place at the Minister's disposal serious, cogent, well-argued cases for the Government to think again, then the Seanad will have performed its function.  Some of us, including the Minister and I, have regrettably and tragically had direct access to the effect of this disease.  I wish I had the eloquence of the man I visited on his death bed last Tuesday to present the evidence.  I do not believe there is anybody inside or outside this House who is inhuman enough not to take every possible precaution to ensure that that unfortunate but wonderful man's death is not unnecessarily repeated in other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Minister's defence of his position on this amendment. I am firmly of the view that there should not be an age limit in this Bill.  We are stuck with trying to make sense of the Minister's defence of his decision to impose an age limit of 17.  If, because of parental concern, the Minister feels there has to be an age specified, why 17?  Are parents not concerned that 16 is the age for consensual sex?  Under this legislation 17 is the age at which young people can use condoms.  Is that not a matter of concern to parents?  What do people between the age of 16 and 17 use if they want to have consensual sex?  It is totally illogical to introduce the age of 17.  If there is any merit in introducing an age limit, it should be 16, not 17.  The <Col N="2217" /> Minister's defence makes nonsense of what he is trying to achieve in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister says we must move forward in easy stages which the public at large can digest.  He pointed to the legislation of 1985 as being a little more liberal than that of 1979 and to this Bill as being yet a little more liberal.  There has been a major change between 1979 or 1985 and today.  Even in 1985 AIDS was not the public health issue, the scourge, that it is today.  That changes entirely the complexion of the debate on this issue.  I would ask the Minister to address that point, as well as the illogicality of specifying the age of 17.</P>

      <P>On the question of embarrassment, I will accept that sex is a topic which the public were loth to discuss.  Perhaps these debates will help to bring discussion into the open.  We would go a long way by having these contraceptives on display and encouraging people to buy them as they require them.  Who would have thought five or seven years ago that this could have been discussed as it is being discussed now?</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said there was no embarrassment on the part of young people.  Senator Norris spoke recently about going into a pharmacy to buy condoms. He in his own way bringing the matter into the open so that people can discuss it.  We can overcome the problem of embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle mentioned the age of 17 years.  There is a problem in specifying any age.  Why should 18 years be the age of criminal responsibility?  Why should it not be seven or 12 years?  The feeling was that parents would have some control <Col N="2218" /> over their offspring up to the age of 17. At the age of 17 they should be mature adults, capable of making their own decisions.  This belief was widely held. Fianna Fáil have 53 per cent of the vote and they know the feelings of the grassroots.  They know the way people think.  The feeling is that the public were anxious that decisions, when they were made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If they feel that there is a danger, they can consult their doctor and get some advice, not necessarily just about condoms but about the dangers involved.  If parents feel embarrassed even discussing it with their children they can refer them to the family doctor, who will give them the necessary medical advice and act as counsellor in a situation like that.  I will rest my case on that.  In a court of law maybe I would not win but luckily that is not the case here.  I wish to highlight for Senator Norris that I have given £3 million towards the campaign against AIDS recently.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 37 to 43, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) The Minister, may now or at a future date, make an order extending the range and type of outlet through which the sale of condoms could be permitted, including vending machines.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment would give the Minister the capacity that I believe he would probably like to have, that is, by ministerial order or regulation to introduce something that basically the entire House knows is necessary.</P>
      <P>I know that the Government have to go into a certain degree of pretence in these matters.  When they feel that they have to introduce legislation, they have to produce a justificiation for it.  The language used is very interesting.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, in responding to comments made about vending machines said:</P>
      <P>Senators referred to the exclusion of vending machines from the provisions of the Bill.  I consider that the Bill represents a balanced, appropriate and pragmatic response to the evolving public health situation, conscious of AIDS, HIV and other sexually transmissible diseases, while taking into account the reasonable concern of parents</P>
      <P>I am not going to reopen that argument, which we have dealt with.  The reasons that people such as myself feel strongly about the subject of parental responsibility have already been placed extensively on the record, so I shall ignore that issue completely.  The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>In this context it would be impossible to have an adequate and necessary level of supervision over the availability of condoms if these were to be available freely from vending machines, street vendors or mobile outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He subsequently talked about the issue of control.  What is required is completely the reverse.  It is not a question of seeking to have supervision or control.  Supervision and control are required in circumstances in which the substance or the object being discussed is in itself intrinsically dangerous.  The intrinsic purposes <Col N="2221" /> of these materials are to promote health. Instead of supervision, control and restriction, we should have the widest possible distribution.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in many European countries Government agencies are entering schools and actively promoting the sale of condoms.  I think the exercise of supervision, control and restriction is completely the wrong way to deal with the matter, that what we should be doing is promoting the use of condoms for those who are already sexually active.</P>
    <P>I shall come back to the question of embarrassment.  The Minister may well know of the novels of Tom Sharpe, the English comic novelist.  Some years ago I put one of those novels on the syllabus in the university, <i>Porterhouse Blues</i>, an acadmic satire which deals basically with life in an Oxbridge college.  The mock hero dies tragically, partly as a result of the pursuit of condoms.  In fact, in the 1980s, he, an English metropolitian figure in one of the Oxbridge colleges, is so embarrassed to ask for a condom that he has his hair cut about six times and is completely scalped.  The events are slightly humorous, but even in this debate, dealing with a tragic situation, one is entitled to refer to works of comic fiction.  The important point in this context is that we are told that even a postgraduate student in an Oxbridge college, who was writing a thesis on the rise of the pumpernickel in Westphalia in the 17th Century, was deeply embarrassed, and Sharpe regards his illustration as a representative experience.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that many young people would be embarrassed to go to chemist shops and so on and that the best way of dispensing condoms is through vending machines.  In our society there is quite a heavy social emphasis on alcohol. People go out to pubs socially in the evenings and quite frequently they may meet somebody, which meeting leads to the kind of experience described by the young man called Stephen in the <i>Evening Herald</i> article that I read earlier.  It may be that those people just would not be <Col N="2222" /> bothered going through the required contortions to get a condom and a condom would not be purchased unless there were availability through a vending machine.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister is well aware that the people of Ireland, the &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; to which the Minister referred, are moving to instal condom vending machines in places of public resort.  I hope that the Minister does not worry too much about the oft referred to &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo;.  One can pay to much obeisance to the grassroots.  I remember a cocktail party in North Great George's Street in which I referred to the grassroots in a way that I thought would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I put forward and in both the Dáil and the Seanad my party put forward support for the concept of condom vending machines for one or two reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, we feel that the people who are most at risk from the infection of the AIDS disease, those who are most likely to contract and spread AIDS, would be more likely to have access to and use contraception if they had access to a vending machine.  The likelihood of people using condoms is greater when there is availability of a vending machine, given that at the particular time that they decide to have sexual intercourse &mdash; whether they be in a nightclub, a bar or <Col N="2223" /> some other social meeting place &mdash; it is unlikely that they would go to purchase condoms from a legitimate outlet.  To maximise the likelihood that potential AIDS victims or AIDS carriers would use condoms, we felt that the best solution would be to make vending machines available.</P>
    <P>I accept the thesis that on the part of our youth there is now a lesser inhibition in relation to sexual activity and in relation to contraception.  I should like to speak about an older age group as well. In this regard I think very much of women in the 35 to 50 years age group, people who have come from a different set of youth experiences and who may perhaps have very real inhibitions when it came to purchasing condoms from the proposed outlets.  Unfortunately, it is often left to women to organise contraception and family planning.  I can understand that a person in their early forties might have a real inhibition about going to the local chemist or newsagent, with whom they have dealt for many years, to ask for a packet of condoms.</P>
    <P>It is the view of my party, and it is very much my own personal view as a teacher and as a person concerned about young people, that the ideal is to have a responsible attitude to sex, to have good sex education, to eliminate promiscuous activities to the greatest possible degree and to encourage proper life relationships. That is what we all aspire to and work for, whether we come from the profession from which the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, comes or from the education field, as does Senator Mullooly opposite me, or from any other sector. All of us here as fulltime politicians are concerned with the achievement of that ideal situation.  However, we also have to legislate for that which is not the ideal, for the reality.  The reality is that we have a large number of young, sexually active people who are greatly at risk from the disease of AIDS and among whom there is also a real chance of potentially destructive and tragic teenage pregnancies. We have to provide condoms at the centre that is most likely to get to the <Col N="2224" /> vulnerable group and the potentially at risk group.  It is obvious that the way to do that is to provide vending machines in discreet locations at the traditionally used night spots of young people.</P>
    <P>When I worked in the emigrant communities in England and in New York, which I did for two and a half years in all, it was my experience that the Irish community and a large number of other communities there lived responsible personal lives and excellent family lives and they did that in the midst of the complete availability of contraception.  That is the experience I gained from working for a number of summers in bars over there, which I found a wonderfully enjoyable experience as a young person.  It is a fallacy to suggest that vending machines would cause promiscuity &mdash; the promiscuity comes first.  The argument that some people have been putting up in that regard is not logical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said by Senator Norris and Senator O'Reilly.  I cannot understand why there should be a problem in relation to making condoms available from vending machines.  I consider that to be a sensible, practical approach to the way that the world now is.  The availability of condoms from vending machines would increase the access of young people to condoms, especially when one considers that there would be vending machines in the places at which young people congregate in a social setting that might lead on to sexual intercourse later in the evening.  I am disappointed that the Minister has seen fit to exclude availability from vending machines and I think that that will inhibit his campaign against AIDS.</P>
      <P>I am also very interested in the emphasis that seems to be placed on the availability of condoms from public houses and so on.  In many ways that is perhaps curious.  I am reminded of the Shakespearean quotation in which it is stated in relation to alcohol &ldquo;Lechery, Sir, it provokes and unprovokes.  It provokes the desire and it inhibits the performance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let us get a couple of things straight.  Contraception is not a necessary evil.  Contraception is a good thing.  It is something that has liberated women from a male-imposed burden of childbirth.  It has liberated couples from the fear of pregnancy in circumstances that pregnancy is not wanted.  There is a certain &ldquo;prissiness&rdquo; running through this debate that somehow contraception is a necessary evil that has to be tolerated a little more now because of the horrible threat of AIDS.  The devices we are talking about here are things that in the vast majority's of people's lives and at most times in history have been good things for those who have used them.  They have made lives better, more fulfilled, less threatened and less unhealthy.  They are not some kind of evil on the margins of society that must be tolerated to a limited extent.  These devices were not invented because of AIDS &mdash; in the case of condoms they happened fortuitously to be extremely useful in the fight against the spread of AIDS.  Condoms are useful devices in themselves in preventing unwanted pregnancy and in enabling people to have a much more healthy and much less troubled relationship than they would otherwise have.  As everyone else seems to be putting quotations on the record, I should like to state my disagreement with Philip Larkin.  In the way that we in the House are talking one would think that Philip Larkin was right when he said that sexual intercourse began in 1963.</P>

      <P>No, between the ban on <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> and the Beatles first LP.  Sex was not invented then.  It was never invented, it has been part of us since humanity evolved.  Perhaps the whole history of the peculiarities of our attitudes to sex has as much to do with primeval fears about the propagation of the species as with morality.  It is time we acknowledged that sex and procreation, necessarily and rightly, should be divorced from each other.  I cannot understand <Col N="2226" /> how it is morally superior not to have vending machines but hopefully to have condoms freely available on the shelves of every supermarket in the State. One would hope that would be the prevailing position.  I hope that is what the Minister has in mind.  The whole issue is really beyond me at this stage.  I begin to feel a stranger in my own land.</P>
      <P>Like most people in this House I am a parent.  I know many parents and I do not know any parents who have these worries.  The parents I know believe that the only way their children will develop healthy and responsible attitudes to something as vital as sexuality in their lives is by persuasion, example and good, solid education based on good solid values.  Most of those parents long ago concluded that if their children decide to act promiscuously legislature changes of the kind we are talking about will not make a damn bit of differences to their lifestyles, but persuasion will.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that Senator Norris's amendment is an enabling one.  All these restrictions should be eliminated.  They are all meaningless and cannot work.  I do not think anybody is going to start selling contraceptives in schools just because the Minister does not make it illegal.  I know sufficient about the ethos of most Irish schools to believe it will be a long time before that sort of thing happens.  In the case of a minority of schools where parents and boards of management hold different views who are we to tell them that we know better?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments the Labour Party propose effectively have the same purpose as the deletion proposed by Senator Norris.  We are proposing in a different way, to delete certain sections and to allow, under regulation, to delete the section if the Minister so wishes in the future.  If the Minister is intransigent about not amending this Bill in regard to the outlets that are specified in it, it is important that he should have authority to do so at a later stage.  The Minister should be ready to do so within a week or two of the Bill being passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo;<Col N="2227" /> and as in the case of the cutoff age, we are presenting obstacles to their location, sale and distribution contrary to the intention of the Bill, as stated by the Minister.  In other words, we are contending that the Bill's purpose is to ensure that disease does not spread, that precautions are taken and that condoms have a major role to play in that exercise. At the same time we are taking certain discretionary steps rendering that task more difficult to achieve.  We are anxious to tackle the problem but, because of some psychological barrier, we are unable to enshrine in legislation proper and thorough methods to do this.  Therefore, we have inserted certain limitations .  Senators should note where those limitations are imposed &mdash; precisely where young people are likely to congregate in sports clubs, or dance halls, where vending machines would likely to be located.  We are limiting the likely success of the Bill by imposing these limitations.</P>
    <P>How will the Minister define, say secondary schools, which have specialised in post-leaving certificate courses in his constituency, let us say, in Ballyfermot, or in Clogher Road, and have provided courses that are not third level in a sense are not quite second level, but in which the students will be 17, 18 and perhaps 19?  There are up to 20,000 such courses being provided in secondary schools in the country.  Let us take the example of the vocational school in Cabra which began as a secondary school and has Junior and Senior cycles.  It is now specialising in post-leaving certificate courses.  Certainly under the terms of the Green Paper on Education all second level schools will be defined as secondary schools.  I note that the terminology used in the Bill is &ldquo;secondary school.&rdquo;  Here is an example of an institution that began as a secondary school, remains a secondary school but became a school that caters for 17 and 18 years olds.  What will the Minister do there?</P>
    <P>The norm, once puberty is reached, is that youngsters are likely to become sexually active.  Abstinance may have been the preferred norm in the past but <Col N="2228" /> sexuality is a healthy aspect of human nature which must be recognised.  If we are to ensure that human sexuality is normalised and became part of our educational system, then we must ensure that our youngsters are healthily aware of the sexual aspect of their lives, something which will be part and parcel of their livestyles.  Obviously then, we must take into consideration the manner in which we make condoms and contraceptives available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of vending machines, I had to take into account the feelings and reasonable concerns of parents that their children would not be exposed unduly to circumstances which their parents would consider to be unsuitable or inappropriate for them.  The main concern was accessibility to condoms, which it was feared would arouse curiousity, older children showing them to younger children, thereby orientating their minds to sex.</P>
      <P>Senators must admit that this Bill constitutes a major step forward in ensuring the much wider availability of condoms in almost all retail outlets.  It will be clearly seen that I have endeavoured in no small way to meet the needs of those who require them.  In case the Labour Party are not aware, their deputy leader did acknowledge that fact, that the Bill constituted a major step forward.  We must consider it in that light.</P>
      <P>Senators have proposed the insertion of a provision enabling the Minister to prohibit the sale of condoms in certain places.  This would be against the rationale of the provisions of the Bill and I do not intend to accept such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in what Senator Norris sought.  Senator Norris wishes to oppose section 5.  If we deleted that section we would be reverting to the position that obtains at present, that is that condoms would be available for sale only from the same outlets as other contraceptives, that is from pharmacies, health boards, family planning clinics, general practitioners and hospitals.  Their sale could not be affected through any other outlet if Senator Norris's amendment were to be <Col N="2229" /> accepted.  I am sure that is not what the Senator had in mind in opposing section 5.  Nonetheless, that would be the position. We would be reverting to the provisions of the 1979 Act, which none of us would want.  Senator Norris's amendment No. 5 would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill which is to extend the range of outlets.  I think everyone will agree on that.  It represents an appropriate <Col N="2230" /> response to the circumstances prevailing and in that way serves an important need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Section 7 of the Principal Act (which restricts the advertising of contraceptives) is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment repeals the advertising restrictions in the Principal Act, in other words, it seeks to control the advertising of condoms in the same way as other forms of advertising are controlled.  If I remember correctly, there is a provision that advertisements should be honest and decent and have other attributes along those lines.  We believe that the advertising of condoms should be treated in the same way as every other form of merchandise.  The consumer legislation in regard to advertising should also apply to condoms.  We are seeking to demystify these devices and to treat them as part of <Col N="2231" /> everyday life.  They should not be in a category which requires special restrictions and controls.  They should not have a special aura and advertising them should be controlled and restricted in the same way as everything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is long overdue and I congratulate the Labour Party for introducing it.  This amendment would not allow a deluge of advertising contraceptives.  The Advertising Standards Authority have extraordinarily strict rules as evidenced by the very restrictive, recently introduced permission to advertise something as normal as sanitary towels which could not be advertised on television or radio until recently because someone thought it would give offence.  In that sort of moral climate of adjudication of what is tasteful or offensive, the likelihood of any extensive advertising at times &mdash; or in locations &mdash; which would make it offensive to anyone is, to say the least, limited.</P>
      <P>There is also an underlying assumption about the severe restriction on advertising of contraceptives and puts them in the category of things like tobacco which is inherently dangerous, which contains nothing good and which harms everyone with whom it comes in contact.  Alcohol can be very pleasurable but it can also do great damage.  The use of contraceptives will not harm anyone apart from a metaphysical, moral judgment about the appropriateness of using such devices. However, not even the strongest moralist could advocate that the use of contraceptives, particularly those available without a doctor's prescription which, after the passage of this Bill, will be condoms only, will do any physical harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is peculiar that something which nobody believes can do any harm physically should be restricted in advertising. A condom will not harm anyone but it might do good to a person and his or her sexual partner if it is used responsibly. It is extraordinary that there are more restrictive prohibitions and constraints on advertising something which at best is physically neutral and in many cases <Col N="2232" /> positively good physically than things like tobacco which harms thousands of people every year.  That suggests that our priorities are based on a moral order of what is appropriate.</P>
    <P>A youngster is far more likely to do himself harm smoking cigarettes from the age of 12 than from limited sexual experimentation protected by the use of a condom.  I would prefer young people to be a bit less wary about sex and a lot more wary about tobacco.  The lives of many people would be much less at risk if they had safe, protected contraceptive sex than if they all started smoking at 12 years, doing themselves perhaps irreparable damage.  Therefore, it seems nonsensical to have restrictions on the advertising of contraceptives when other things which are far more life-threatening are left relatively uninhibited.  I appreciate that there are restrictions on tobacco advertising, but we do not yet have a prohibition on tobacco advertising and it is still possible to advertise it in many ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that alcohol and nicotine are life-threatening and very much in need of control in their advertising. I made the point on Second Stage that I believed if this Bill had included the aspects we appealed to the Minister to include, it would have been the final word on contraception.  In this area we hope it will be almost the final word.  I hope that when this Bill is enacted we will be able to get away from the contraception and condom debate which has gone on for the last 20 years and which has sapped the intellectual, moral and social energies of so many people.  It has been absolutely bizarre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wonderful if we could extend &mdash; I am in the licensed trade and proud of it &mdash; our views to other areas of morality for a change.  Take, for instance, the morality of a situation where a spouse spends 60 per cent of the family income on alcohol, or the morality of cigarettes bring readily available to very young children who have absolutely no sense in regard to their use.  That is the kind of <Col N="2233" /> debate we would like to see replacing the contraceptive debate.</P>
    <P>If we are to be consistent with the stated position of the Minister at the outset that the objective of this Bill is essentially part of a drive against AIDS, which is also the viewpoint of the World Health Organisation, then the logical corollary is to allow advertising.  It is not logical to use condoms as part of the fight against AIDS without altering our laws on advertising.  That would appear to be a <i>sine qua non</i> for a fight against AIDS. It would not be fruitful to elaborate further on the matter except to say that we are talking about simple logic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a question for me.  I have just borrowed the bound volume of the Principal Act from my colleague, Senator O'Reilly.  From my reading of it, what we are talking about appears to have already been enacted.  I am not sure if this is the case, but section 12 (4) states:</P>
      <P>Section 9 (1) of the Act of 1946 is hereby amended by the deletion in paragraph (b) of &ldquo;the unnatural prevention of conception or&rdquo;, and &ldquo;prevention or&rdquo;, and the said section 9 (1), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister and his advisers could confirm whether, by the operations of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, the prohibition on advertisements has already been removed, which would suggest that it might have been more sensible to have moved amendment No. 11.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on that amendment, which also dealt with advertising.  Some years ago, when I became aware of the situation regarding AIDS, I was involved in a group through the Hirschfeld Centre and we printed 250,000 leaflets on safe sex.  I wrote to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, pointing out that the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889, was continued by the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, and that the precise things referred to in Senator O'Reilly's amendment &mdash; the fixing of <Col N="2234" /> public notices about any disease affecting the generative organs of either sex, or any complaint of infirmity arising from or relating to sexual intercourse or the prevention and removal of irregularities in menstruation &mdash; were in fact prohibited, but that we were going to go ahead and advertise.  It seems to me that that is something which may still need to be looked at.</P>

      <P>That is known as parliamentary sleight of hand and I know it is something which the Minister greatly appreciates.  Perhaps he could tell me whether the question of advertising contraceptives was dealt with and is now free of restriction.  I urge that the advertising of contraceptives be made part of the programme.  I believe that we could seriously look to the Swedish and general Scandinavian model, where they dealt with this in a way that had an impact directly on young people by including a certain degree of visual stimulants and humour on television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the same clarification as was requested by Senator Norris.  The focus of the amendment is to ensure that the stated purpose of the Bill would be implemented &mdash; in other words, that there would be no restrictions on advertising.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that contraceptives are available at certain outlets for a purpose, to prevent unwanted pregnancy and the spread of infectious diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process of normalisation and to ensure that contraceptives become an acceptable normal item of merchandise, their purchase should not be controlled by restrictions on advertising that would put them in the class of a controlled drug which had certain dangerous implications or effects.  That is the thrust of this amendment, although we can rely on the Advertising Standards Authority to ensure that that is done with <Col N="2235" /> discretion, proper sensitivity and so on. The other side of the coin is that, even if there is a certain truth in what Senator Norris said in relation to the matter being covered to an extent already under the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, nevertheless we must ensure that advertising is part of the promotional, educational and awareness activity in relation to dealing with the problem of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.  It should be an inherent part of the AIDS material being presented to the targeted population; it is all part and parcel of the issue.  Advertising should not be restricted, but should be an inherent and useful element of the process of education, the dissemination of information and the accessibility of contraceptives.</P>

That is a step forward and is very much to be welcomed.  I am pleased that the capacity exists in the present law to permit that.</P>

      <P>On that question there are two points.  I do not want to be too contentious late in the night, but I have never seen a Minister so weakly supported by the members of his own party, as this Minister has been for the last two and a half to three hours today.  I do not know whether it is a sign of a conversion to liberalism, or a conversion to silence, either of what would be uncharacteristic of Fianna Fáil, or whether it was just that they were a little bit wary of it.  The Minister was left largely on his own, and I have never seen it happen before.  Secondly, I wish that the other party in Government who were so good on the liberal rhetoric had actually been here to vote on some of the amendments, which would have tested their liberal rhetoric and would have made them decide which side they were on, instead of going missing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the way he handled the debate.  He remained courteous and pleasant throughout the debate, but unfortunately he was not in a position to accept any of our amendments. I also thank the Minister for the attitude he has adopted towards this issue over the years.  It is a pity that he was not able to go a bit further.  I fully accept that his heart is in the right place.

      <P>The Bill is not all bad and we welcome certain aspects of it.  There is no doubt that it is a step forward.  The purpose of the exercise here, because the Dáil has risen, was to tease out some of the absurdities in the Bill, and highlight the fact that the Bill is already out of date. We know that to an extent the Minister is prisoner of circumstances, but we can see that progress will be made in relation to a number of the matters that we teased out.</P>

There is a lot of rhetoric and hot air in this House; but when it comes to going through the lobbies, that is when one really finds where the support is.

    <Title>Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1992: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 and 1978, so that a number of new and significant provisions concerning, in the main, mature students, can be made in the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years.  The higher education grants scheme is the scheme under which the local authorities, who are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme, pay grants to eligible students attending full-time courses in universities and other approved third level institutions.</P>
      <P>Grants awarded under the scheme have, of course, always been means tested.  The detailed conditions governing the award of grants in any particular year are set out in the higher education grants scheme of that particular year, and not in the legislation itself.  Naturally the terms of the scheme must be in accordance with the principles enshrined in the legislation.  Each year my Department prepare and issue a specimen scheme for the guidance of local authorities, and they are recouped their expenditure on grants awarded under the scheme.  Each local authority makes a new scheme for each year and, under the existing legislation, this has to be submitted to the Minister for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendments covered by this Bill are that the income eligibility of mature persons, who are not dependent <Col N="2240" /> on their parents, would be assessed by reference to their own and, where appropriate, that of their spouses incomes; mature students who secure a place in a third level institution would be recognised as satisfying the academic attainment requirements for the award of a grant; other school terminal examinations from our EC partners such as the general certificate of education of Northern Ireland, would be accepted in lieu of the leaving certificate examination for the award of grants.</P>
    <P>Facilitating the return of mature students to formal education, including third level education, has a very definite emphasis in the Green Paper which I have just recently launched.  This builds on the broad statement of education policy in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which identified the upgrading of education for mature students as a key policy objective.  The programme, in paragraph 69 (m), provided that:</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Grants Scheme will be re-examined in the context particularly of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  increasing the income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third level;</P>
    <P>(ii)  assessing income eligibility of mature students who are not dependent on their parents, on the basis of their own and, if married, that of their spouses' incomes;</P>
    <P>(iii)  regarding mature students who secure a place in a third level institution as satisfying the academic requirements; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  the development of more equitable income assessment criteria for all applicants.</P>
    <P>With the passing of this legislation, all of those objectives in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are now achieved.</P>
    <P>There are currently about 1,600 mature students enrolled in full-time courses of third level education &mdash; some 850 in the vocational education committee <Col N="2241" /> colleges sector and the balance of 750 in the Higher Education Authority sector.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate with any certainty how many mature students will qualify for grants under the new scheme, but firm data should be available after the first year of operation.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme was introduced in 1968, almost a quarter of a century ago, following the enactment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.  It is worthwhile and appropriate at this juncture to reflect on how the numbers of students in, and the public funding of, third level education have changed in the intervening 25 years or so.  Numbers in third level education have expanded rapidly over the last quarter of a century, from 21,000 in 1965 to almost 70,000 in 1990-91, increasing in 1991-92 to about 75,000.</P>
    <P>Total public expenditure on education in 1992 will amount to £1.6 billion, representing almost 20 per cent of total Government expenditure and almost 6 per cent of GDP.  This represents an unprecedented increase in allocation of available resources to education compared with 1965, when the corresponding figures were 13.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.  Indeed, the percentage of GDP invested in education has almost doubled in the past 25 years or so. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the third level sector.  Third level education now accounts for 22 per cent of the Education budget compared to 8 per cent in 1966 &mdash; an almost three-fold increase.</P>
    <P>The total enrolment in third level education at present is 75,000.  A further increase in student places is planned over the next four to five years which will bring the participation rate up to about 45 per cent of the age group.  In a period of less than ten years, there will have been an increase of 34,000 students in third level education &mdash; a staggering increase of 60 per cent which reflects continuing Government commitment to providing additional third level student places as well as improving access to higher education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> I pointed out on another occasion that, despite the explosion in numbers of students at third level, more than half of all students at present in third level colleges receive grant assistance of one type or another, higher education grants, ESF grants and vocational education committee scholarships, etc.</P>
    <P>The total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State is about £72 million.  The average support per student benefiting under the various grants schemes is £1,900.</P>
    <P>The background to this Bill is that following on proposals contained in both the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which I have quoted, and in the Joint Programme for Government, we have carried out a fundamental review of the higher education grants scheme.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Government sanctioned a radical range of improvements.  Those improvements will take effect in the schemes for 1992 and subsequent years in respect of mature students and students who sat the leaving certificate this year and who will be new entrants to third level education in 1992 or subsequently.  However, as a result of a ministerial amendment which was made to the Bill during its passage through Dáil Éireann on Tuesday, 7 July, 1992, existing mature students who are attending approved institutions will also be eligible to apply for grants under the improved scheme from the 1992-93 academic year.  This is the first occasion that mature students were recognised and it reflects our commitment to mature students.</P>
    <P>The principal improvements to the grants scheme arising from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as already announced are: The income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education: income eligibility will be assessed on income and income limits in the year of entry into third level rather than as heretofore, on the income limits in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate: mature students who secure a place in a third level institution <Col N="2243" /> will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant: mature students who are not dependent on their parents may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes and, if applicable, their spouses' incomes rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now; and lone parents welfare payments under the lone parents allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility.</P>
    <P>In addition, as I promised in the Dáil earlier this year, a working group in my Department have completed a detailed review of the criteria for eligibility for third level student grants to achieve greater equity and transparency.  Following this complex review, I announced on Monday, 6 July 1992, a substantial increase in income eligibility limits with effect from the 1992-93 academic year.</P>
    <P>The increases in the income limits are very significant and will be of enormous benefit to lower and middle-income families who have been experiencing difficulties in sending their children to third-level education.  For instance, under the new arrangement which I have introduced, a family with anything from one to three children will qualify for full fee and full maintenance grants on an income of £15,000.  This represents a dramatic increase on the present income limit of £10,787 &mdash; an increase of over £4,200 or 40 per cent.  This same family will be eligible for a full fee grant with an income of up to £18,000 and a 50 per cent fee grant up to an income of £19,000.</P>
    <P>It is important to note also as I have mentioned, that these income limits will be increased by a further £2,000 in respect of every child, after the first child, attending third level education, as announced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>It was because of my concern about the sometimes extreme financial pressures placed on families in these income groups, and who are now catered for in the new income limits, that I announced earlier this year that I was carrying out this radical and fundamental review of third level student grants.  I was also <Col N="2244" /> anxious to see that greater equity, fairness and openness be introduced into the system of means testing for student support and in the allocation of resources for students and their families.  Taken in conjunction with the other package of improvements announced earlier this year &mdash; all of which will come into effect for the 1992-93 academic year &mdash; I am happy to state that these improvements represent the most radical and far-reaching set of reforms in student support since the scheme were introduced in the late sixties.</P>
    <P>In introducing this range of improvements, I am also determined to ensure that a greater degree of fairness and rigour is introduced in the assessment of income and in ensuring a full return of income from all applicants.  This approach is motivated by a wish to ensure that there is greater equity and fair-play for everyone and I am anxious that the more direct involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in this important aspect of the schemes will make a significant contribution to achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>I am happy that my announcement has received a wide welcome.  As I said, this package represents an unprecedented leap forward in the whole area of student support and provides a major boost to thousands of students and their families throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes minor amending legislation to give effect to the improvements referred to earlier so that the grants schemes for 1992 and thereafter can be appropriately amended and grants paid to mature students on the new basis for the 1992-93 academic year.  The other improvements to which I have referred will be taken care of in the context of revisions to the higher education grants scheme for 1992, and do not require amending legislation.  I am also taking the opportunity, in section 4, of amending section 2 (i) (a) of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, to permit the acceptance of other school terminal examinations in place of the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline to the House the provisions of the Bill as passed by <Col N="2245" /> Dáil Éireann.  During the course of the consideration of the Bill by Dáil Éireann some very important and fundamental changes were made by way of ministerial amendments and I shall refer to these where they arise.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo;, which is referred to in the Bill, as the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants), Act, 1968.  Section 2 amends section 1 of the Act of 1968, as amended by section 1 of the Act of 1978, by inserting definitions of &ldquo;mature students&rdquo; and &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  The section, in providing for a minimum age of 23 years for mature students, takes account of current admission requirements of approved institutions, and provides the facility for the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary that age by making regulations.  The making of such regulations is dealt with in section 6.  The definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in section 2 includes either person of a married couple living together and also includes a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife.  It is identical to the same definition in social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 2 of the Act of 1968 and provides for local authorities to award grants to mature students who do not qualify for grants under the existing arrangements.  Also, mature students who are not dependent on their parents, will be assessed by reference to their own income, if any, and that of their spouses, as defined if applicable.  Mature students who are dependent on their parents will be assessed by reference to their own income, if any, and that of their parents in accordance with the general practice for higher education grants.  Section 3 also provides that mature students must comply with such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Minister.  A similar provision exists in relation to higher education grants generally in subsection 2 (1) (d) of the Act of 1968.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will enable, <i>inter alia</i>, a suitable provision to be included in the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years deeming mature students to have met the academic <Col N="2246" /> requirements for grants.  Section 4 amends section 2 of the 1968 Act to permit the acceptance of other school terminal examinations in place of the leaving certificate examination.  This section is not geared towards mature students <i>per se</i> but to cater for those students living in the Border counties and who attend second level schools in Northern Ireland.  Under the 1968 Act such students could not qualify for a grant as only attainments in the leaving certificate examination could be taken into account.  Section 4 will permit the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance to prescribe that appropriate standards at the general certificate of education of Northern Ireland may be taken into account for the purposes of a grant.</P>
    <P>The Bill as originally drafted, however, referred to &ldquo;such other school terminal examination held and sat outside the State&rdquo;, and, on reflection, this provision was seen to be too restrictive in that it would not allow the Minister to take account of any special circumstances which might arise.  Consequently an amendment was introduced whereby that part of the section now reads, &ldquo;held and ordinarily sat outside the State&rdquo;.  As I have indicated this section was drafted mainly to cater for the situation of the relatively small number of Irish nationals residing in Border areas and attending second level schools in Northern Ireland. Bearing the post-Maastricht era in mind, it would also allow for the terminal examination of any of our EC partners to be taken into account for grant purposes should such a need arise.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental and important amendment made in Dáil Éireann, however, was the amending of section 5 (1).  The Bill as initiated in the Dáil provided that the grants improvements for mature students would apply to mature students who secured places to commence courses in 1992 or subsequent years.  However, during the course of the Committee Stage debate strong arguments were made in favour of catering for those mature students who are already attending third level courses.  As a consequence, <Col N="2247" /> the Bill was amended on Report Stage by way of a ministerial amendment to cover students &ldquo;who have secured places to pursue courses in approved institutions in the year 1992 or subsequent years&rdquo;.  In effect this means that mature students who are already attending approved courses and who will be continuing on those courses during the 1992-93 academic year or subsequent years will be eligible to apply for grants.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) stipulates that the amended provision relating to school terminal examinations outside the State shall apply to the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends the Act of 1968 and provides for regulations made under the Act to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a standard provision relating to short title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House as I did not get an opportunity to do so last week because I had to vote in an election for a county council chairman which was extremely important as the voting was close.  If I had been here the Minister would have had to listen to my expressions of frustration at not being able to debate education in this House over the past three years in Private Members' time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, had to listen to me for an hour and a half and, perhaps, the Minister was saved that.  Tonight I will be able to say what I want to say in relation to education and to this Bill. I hope we will be able to discuss very important educational matters during the debate on the Green Paper next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which has been changed substantially from the Bill initiated in the Dáil.  It is timely because it emanates from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, took on board the amendment which was pressed very strongly by Deputy Jim <Col N="2248" /> Higgins to extend the eligibility for grants to those already at college.  This change brought relief to a great many and I am glad it is included in the Minister's presentation this evening.</P>
    <P>The mature students lobbied for and argued the merits of a grant scheme for themselves and it would be sad if they did not benefit from the Bill.  It was a job well done.  Thought the scheme will be a cost on the Exchequer, the benefit will be inestimable to the mature students who began their studies in anticipation of being awarded the grant because of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> They were conscious also that the ESF grants were extended to mature students on 1 January 1991 and this took immediate effect and applied to students already attending the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
    <P>The numbers are very small; the latest figure the Minister has given is 1,800 and there is an almost equal divide between the vocational education committee and the Higher Education Authority colleges. It is to the credit of students who scrimped and saved that they are not studying for esoteric reasons or for self-fulfilment only, but out of sheer economic necessity.  Social changes in our society have given rise to problematic issues.  Single parents, deserted wives and husbands and those who married at a young age may have foregone third level education and now find themselves trying to rear a family on their own and job opportunities demand a C.V. which includes third level qualifications.  This change will be welcomed by that sector. Society has changed since 1968.</P>
    <P>It is very timely that new structures be put in place to facilitate and develop continuing education or further learning and to move forward in line with our nearest neighbours.  I am glad the Minister stated that bearing the post-Maastricht era in mind, the examinations of our EC partners should be taken into account for grant purposes should such a need arise.  We must anticipate what may <Col N="2249" /> happen rather than having to introduce a ministerial order at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It is important in the light of the Regional Technical Colleges and Dublin Insitutute of Technology Bills to stress the tremendous work being done by the vocational education committees.  I have been on the adult education committee since 1985 and this year I am chairperson. I am delighted to see the evolving nature of adult education.  It is no longer confined to the leisure activity area but has moved very quickly into the areas of computers, particularly certificate and diploma courses.  It is no longer just adult education to while away the hours, it is moving very quickly into the professional arena and attracting great numbers of mature students.  The commitment of those who pursue these courses is enormous, despite the fact that some courses, particularly the diploma from UCC, are costly.  I was interested to see that nobody from County Limerick dropped out of those courses; admittedly the majority of those students were women &mdash; and the female sex is well known for their tenacity &mdash; but they had to find the money for the courses and they were a great success &mdash; I would like to put on record the work of Kilfinnan Education Centre, which has developed TEFL courses, language exchange programmes, etc.  I was on a plane recently from Germany and the person beside me had a brochure in German for Kilfinnan Education Centre. This is putting education on the map. Kilfinnan is in County Limerick, near the borders of Limerick and Cork.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the European dimension existed long before we had the vote on the Maastricht Treaty.  It is important to show that the vocational education committees have moved ahead so quickly despite their meagre resources.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that our universities are in the early stages of developing continuing education programmes. It is appropriate that they address the needs of our society not just in relation to degree courses but in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  They should link up <Col N="2250" /> with the trade unions to ensure the basic needs of mature students are met.  We tend to associate universities with third level degree courses but there is no reason they could not provide certificate and diploma courses.  This would widen the possibilities for everybody.  Generally, those who go to university have not missed out on their education but I would like to see the universities relevant to all.</P>
    <P>In the University of Limerick, 20 postgraduate courses are funded through the ESF and there are innovations and developments in regard to extending this funding to other courses.  That is very important.  In the context of the recently enacted colleges Bills it is very important to ensure that they advance in line with post-Maastricht Europe.  This is a golden opportunity for all third level educational establishments.</P>
    <P>This is my last chance before September to make an impassioned plea to the Minister to consider the plight of parents who even with the very welcome increase in income thresholds, will still not be able to send their children to college. I know I have the support of colleagues in all the political parties and they have told me they will take up the issue with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument in the Dáil last week is not relevant to these people. The £50,000 earner will still be able to send his family to college.  Whether his income is means tested or not, his children will still have access to third level education, whereas children of those in the low to middle income bracket will still not have access because their parents' gross income is above the income threshold and their income tax payments and other demands on their income are not taken into account.</P>
    <P>I will cite three genuine cases which sadden me.  The first case is a man who worked for 30 years and does not drink or smoke, his wife supplemented the family income by a part-time job, and all he wants is his daughter to have access to third level education but she will not qualify under the present means test. This man came to the Department of <Col N="2251" /> Education as part of a delegation to put his case.  He said: I understand the figures, I understand equity, I know what the Minister is doing, but what about me? What do I say to my daughter?  It is very hard not to be moved by somebody who is on the wrong side of the fence.</P>
    <P>The second case is parents whose son and daughter have both sat the leaving certificate this year and who have to make a choice between who will go to third level education.  That is insidious.  I do not know how they will choose between their son and daughter.  These couple are just over the threshold.  The third case is where a family scrimped and saved and were on the point of opting for social welfare and giving up a job to ensure their daughter will get her place in a third level establishment.  She has opted for a course in a college outside Limerick as the course she wishes to pursue is not held in Limerick.  This means their is no question of her attending the local regional technical college.  This girl's parents have heard her say &mdash; which disgusts them &mdash; she will live away from home and draw her £50 social welfare because she is embittered by the fact that she will not have the chance to go to college. These are three case studies &mdash; and if they were the only three, they would have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Education is for life and at the end of the day it will be a question of £50 versus £39.  I make that plea to the Minister.  I understand what he is trying to do, and I know the public purse cannot be stretched much further but as a teacher I see the value of education.  Here are three cases where these children cannot have third level education.  Their futures depend on a couple of pounds.  This saddens me.  I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision to means test the ESF grant.  I am only asking him to defer it until next year.  It is not going to cost a fortune.  He has already made the commitment to £5 million in relation to the income thresholds but it is still the PAYE lower and middle income earner who is affected.</P>
    <P>I know the ethos of the whole grants <Col N="2252" /> system and the inequities that exist for the self-employed.  I would point out that 66 per cent of the higher education grants paid by Limerick County Council goes to the self-employed &mdash; the figures are shocking in relation to who are actually availing of the grants &mdash; 19 per cent is paid to PAYE workers, 16 per cent to the unemployed and 9 per cent to retired people.  Those are the facts from Limerick County Council this year.  The figures show that the low, middle income and the unemployed are not having access to higher education.  We have discussed this issue many times.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point assessing students from disadvantaged areas not alone for third level education but for first and second level.  In his report, Patrick Clancy has plenty of documentation to support that view.  If we are genuine as regards cherishing each child equally, we have to address this matter. It is important as regards employability.</P>
    <P>I am at variance with the various Ministers and I mentioned the last day we debated the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1992, that I like a coherent policy in education.  I see it very differently from any other Department because you are talking about the long term.  Whether we are talking about a Fine Gael Coalition, a Fianna Fáil Coalition Government or whatever, I expect Ministers to take on board the policies of previous Ministers. Education does not change overnight. There have to be long term policies.  I am at variance with the three different interpretations, particularly in relation to the regional technical college Bill.  In relation to the grants, I am not sure that I understand the review committee's whole examination of the inequities which I had hoped would have included interdepartmental finance, social welfare and education.  I think it would be far more relevant to have social partners in education.  Why can we not move into the social partners?</P>
    <P>We are trying forever to put education in the context of community, to have liaison between parents, teachers and the community at large, because that is what education is all about.  You cannot educate <Col N="2253" /> in a vacuum.  The EC supported a pilot scheme in relation to local liaison through Shannon curriculum development. I was involved in it myself and I thought it was the most explosive and dynamic aspect of what we were doing with education.</P>
    <P>If we were going to review the grants system it is obvious that not only would the Departments of Finance, Social Welfare and Education be involved but also parents, unions, the IVEA, students, students' unions and higher education groups, because there must be an exchange between the various groups.  I know Deputy Higgins in the other House referred to the NESC and the ESRI for independent assessment, but I would appeal to the Minister again to cease means testing for this year.  I will give him financial reasons later as to why he should do that.</P>
    <P>There is a long list of people who will not benefit &mdash; for example, civil servants, those working in local authorities, staff officers, nurses, teachers and gardaí.  We are talking about a cross-section of the community who are paying taxes and have a right to demand this grant.</P>
    <P>In regard to the memorandum to which I referred when debating the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, can we not impress on Brussels the need for more funding all round?  I will be very interested to read in the Green Paper the new education policy whereby the <i>tranche</i> of funds post-Maastricht will extend to education and health, among other areas.  Will we have a say in how those funds are directed, whether to first, second or third level?  I hope that topic will be covered in the Green Paper.  We are not going cap in hand to Europe. What we are really saying is that Europe has our best asset &mdash; our young graduates are being poached from university campuses &mdash; so there is no reason we should not get a pay back in other ways.  This would help to fund the people who are not getting the opportunity of education.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to reform and the assessment element.  There are references in presentation to the Dáil regarding rigorous procedures in assessing <Col N="2254" /> income from all applicants.  I would have thought that the local authorities, who deal with smaller numbers compared with the Revenue Commissioners who have to assess so much, would have fine combed every single applicant.  I know that when there was a question of suspicion as regards the self-employed, the Revenue Commissioners were not in a financial position to be able to take a person to court, saying that the returns from their accountants were not acceptable. If the Revenue Commissioners did not accept the returns there would have been legal proceedings, so I know their hands were tied.</P>
    <P>My point is that the Revenue Commissioners still did an excellent job and they know what they are talking about. Local councillors do not spare those whom they know to be creaming the system, so it is not as if the local authority are not able to assess.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Revenue Commissioners, I would like to ask the Minister where is the link to tax assessment procedures that is referred to?  How will it be done?  Mention of the Revenue Commissioners puts the fear of God in people, so perhaps the fear element will result in more genuine and honest certificates of income being submitted.  If there is a disagreement between the local authority and the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; the local authority say they are the statutory body for awarding grants; the Revenue Commissioners come up with a different figure &mdash; who is the ultimate authority at the end of the day in those assessment procedures?</P>
    <P>There is a delay in local authorities throughout the country in the assessment procedure and in trying to ensure that the student going to college has his or her money up front immediately.  The heaviest burden an undergraduate has to face is in the first year of college, where they have to pay for digs, clothes, books, etc.  Parents are absolutely skint at that particular time.  I know plenty of students, whose names I could give, who dropped out of college in those first weeks because the grant was not made available on time and they could not <Col N="2255" /> survive financially.  They had their pride and did not wish to say their parents could not put up the goodies or whatever. Will there now be a delay because of the numbers coming into the system who will have to be assessed?  Whoever is entitled to a grant should have that grant on his or her first day in college, because there is absolutely no way that that income group will be able to support the student <i>ad nauseum</i> or until the grant actually comes.  As public representatives we get numerous representations asking whether the grant will ever be paid.  I think I mentioned that the final arbiter of assessable income is very important.</P>
    <P>The other point &mdash; the hardy annual as regards the link between Departments and local authorities &mdash; will the Minister make resources available to the local authorities to help process the grants? Really, they are hardly able to do what they have to do already.  What is the union's attitude in relation to the huge amount of assessing they will have to do, which may slow up the whole process?</P>
    <P>In relation to universities, a positive point &mdash; and there are many positive points in relation to this Bill &mdash; is that they operated a waiver system under which they found it very difficult to decide in relation to a young student whose father was dead or a mature student who just scrimped and saved to get to college.  As it stands they will no longer be the arbiters; the grant will be there for the person who needs it most and that is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification on a case study in the Limerick area of a young unmarried mother living on her own in a flat who was assessed on her parents income, even though she was in receipt of social welfare. I hope the Bill will ensure that that category of girl who may wish to pursue third level education would be assessed on her own income.  At the discretion of the local authority they cleared her for the grant, but certainly she was not going to get it.</P>
    <P>There must be thoroughness in relation to the implementation of this Bill.  I do not envy the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2256" /> their job.  I do not envy the local authorities their job either in the forthcoming months.  Generally speaking it is an exceptionally good Bill now because of the amendments taken in the Dáil.  The case studies I outlined are genuine and the cost is not going to break the bank; I do not think there will be very many cases at that level.  My point is that one student missing the chance of education for life is one too many.  When one weighs up the cost of implementation, the cost in time to the Revenue Commissioners etc., at the end of the day one might throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter in the light of the sad cases of those who are on the margins and who are still weighing up whether their children will or will not have access to third level education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on this very innovative legislation. The proof of the excellence of this legislation is that even though Senator Jackman tried extremely hard to find fault with it, at the end of the day she was not able to and had to acknowledge that.  I welcome also the recent announcements made by the Minister in relation to income limits.  I am particularly pleased with this legislation because it addresses difficulties in a particular sector of third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very appropriate that the Minister has laid great emphasis on continuing adult education.  That is extremely welcome. One must ask who are these mature students.  In passing, let me say to Senator Jackman that we all acknowledge that women are very tenacious people, as they have proved that over and over again.  There is a range of categories of mature students not least the people that Senator Jackman referred to.  A number of mature students have gone through second level education and, for a variety of reasons, did not at the time appreciate the importance of further education.  There may have been other circumstances, such as difficulties at home, family problems etc., which mean <Col N="2257" /> that students at second level did not get the opportunities and type of support and help that students need at second level. They are at a very formative time when they are coming out of the age of puberty and are under a lot of stress and do not appreciate how important education is.</P>
    <P>A survey of students at intermediate certificate level, which is the stage at which drop out often occurs, would probably show that the vast majority of those young students would opt out if they got the opportunity.  They stay because they have constant financial and moral support at home, and the importance of education is reiterated to them over and over again.  Unfortunately, there is that category of students who opt out for a variety of reasons.  Some who finish second level get the leaving certificate or the GCE find that they are not at the time interested in furthering their education and go into mundane jobs.  They then realise that that is not for them and that there might be an opportunity for them to do better in some other area.  It is then that they look at the opportunities of getting a third level education.  It is marvellous that there is a facility for those people to come back into mainstream education.  This legislation will definitely help those people enormously.</P>
    <P>One must recognise that, in terms of adult education, there are two different streams.  There are those interested in hobby or leisure classes but now more and more adult education is concentrating on some sort of certification and improving one's lot in employment. Certification is extremely important.  The more certificates people have the better chance they have of getting improved employment or getting employment itself.  There is more and more emphasis on certification.  Ten or 15 years ago the vast majority of adult education classes concentrated on hobby or leisure-time activities.  Now there are only a few of those leisure classes which are cyclical and usually involve a group of people who just want to have a night out. However the vast majority of people are looking for courses with a certification at the end which will prove that they are <Col N="2258" /> competent or efficient or have attained a certain standard in a particular subject or in a particular area of business.  People who can present certification to employers who advertise for jobs have a better chance of getting those jobs.  It is through that type of activity that people come back into mainstream education and realise that there are opportunities to go further and attend third level education. That is welcome.  The legislation will benefit those people enormously.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned married women who, very unselfishly, gave up work outside the home to rear their children. One invariably hears people talking about giving up work to look after their children but what they did effectively was to give up work outside the home and take on a much more difficult job of rearing their children.  It was left to the woman of the house to do that.  The husband was invariably seen as the breadwinner and the wife did all of the housework.  Subsequently many of those people found &mdash; when the birds had flown the nest and the family was reared &mdash; that they had time on their hands and looked for the opportunity to get back into employment.  Unfortunately, opportunities were closed to them in the intervening years because of the demands for certification and qualifications that they would not have had the opportunity to acquire.  We are talking about a time span of maybe 20 years when these people would have been out of the workplace, and when they want to re-enter the workplace they find that things have changed drastically and that they are not really competent.  Many of those people who want to be in a position to financially support themselves opt then to go back into third level education in order to get qualifications, and they do that for a variety of different reasons.  They are an important sector as well.  There is a whole range of individuals within this category of mature students and each of them is equally important in their own way.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said in terms of third level education is very significant.  The number of students attending third level institutions increased from 21,000 in 1965 <Col N="2259" /> to 75,000 in 1992.  The budget for third level education increased from 8 per cent to 22 per cent during that period.  I think the Minister said there has been an increase of 16 per cent in the third level student population in ten years.  That is a massive increase in numbers.  One has to appreciate the enormous strain this puts on the Exchequer.  The education bill is absolutely massive every year.  We have to recognise that finances are not limitless and there is a limit to the amount which can be divided out.  By and large, a fair share of the finances is devoted to education.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his amendment. We have to appreciate that he did not have to introduce that amendment. However, I am delighted the Minister brought in the amendment.  He appreciates that mature students are a very important category of people.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1,600 mature students attending third level education at present and I believe that number will increase dramatically over the next few years because of this far-seeing Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement in regard to income limits and means testing.  As a member of both a county council and a vocational education committee I have been pushing for years for an increase in the income limits.  Every year the council and vocational education committee automatically appealed to the Minister to do something about income limits and means testing for grants for third level education.  I must compliment the Minister for tackling this issue and bringing forward these improvements, which will be of enormous benefit to third level students.  Some people might say he has not gone far enough but I think he has done a tremendous job.  In some instances he has increased the income limits by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred to case studies. The existing income limit for full fee and maintenance support for a family with two children is £10,787.  This will be increased to £15,000, an increase of 39 per cent.  No one could suggest that an increase of 39 per cent is not a substantial <Col N="2260" /> increase.  Sometimes limits are only increased by the rate of inflation, that is by 3 or 4 per cent.  The existing limit of £13,822 is being increased to £18,000, an increase of 30 per cent.  A family with two children on an income of £14,995 get no grant at present for either maintenance or fee.  Under the new limits, they will be entitled to full fee and maintenance. That is an absolutely unbelievable change.  The Minister has not been loud enough in praising himself for what he has done.  This is a revolutionary move, and we have to give credit where it is due.</P>

      <P>With regard to ESF grants, as the Minister said tonight he will introduce equity into the system.  We are talking about transparency and equity.  I agree fully with Senator Jackman that there is a perception that the children of many self-employed people who are entitled to third level grants are receiving them at the expense of the PAYE worker.  As a PAYE earner, I know exactly what the Senator is talking about.  I put three of my children through third level education and, as anyone who has had to do this knows, this was very expensive.</P>

      <P>Some people in that category do not get any grants.  As we all know, if everything had to be put on the <Col N="2261" /> table and was above board many people who are receiving grants would not get them.  Many PAYE worker who have lower incomes than many self-employed people do not get any grant.  The other sting in the tail is that the tax paid by the PAYE worker who does not qualify for a grant is used, among other things, to pay grants to people who should not get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to equity and transparency, I want to reiterate that the Minister is bringing equity into the ESF grants system.  If a family are over the income limit, a student will get no grant or maintenance allowance.  As Senator Jackman said, some families with an income of £50,000 get a full grant and full maintenance while other families with an income which is approximately one-third that amount do not get a grant. Anyone who would suggest that that is equitable would need to review the system.</P>
      <P>Middle income and lower income families who send their students to third level institutions experience financial difficulties. I imagine the Minister would acknowledge that point.  If all the money in the world was available there would be no problem.  The Minister's announcement is a step towards complete transparency and equity in the system of third level grants.  How can it be suggested that a person earning £50,000 should be allowed avail of full grants while the person earning one-third of that amount would not be entitled to any grants because the student happened to be sent to one third level institution as opposed to another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which will be of tremendous benefit to all mature <Col N="2262" /> students.  I hope many more mature students will take up these grants.  Those who know about these grants should tell others about them.  Some mature students might not realise that these benefits are available.  A public relations exercise is needed to explain the types of grants and supports available for adult education at third level.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this innovative legislation and on the huge increase in income limits announced recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the Bill. It represents a long overdue improvement. Comment was made yesterday on the amount of legislation coming from the Department of Education.  This is the third Bill we have dealt with this week. Educational legislation in the past was scarce.  The levelling process which is evident in the Green Paper has resulted in these legislative proposals coming before the Oireachtas.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has been in operation for 18 months, envisaged that many of these proposals would have been dealt with already but, unfortunately, the Green Paper has only been published.  The related proposals we dealt with this week were expected by the authors of the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> to be in operation before now.  This Bill is very much along the lines of the proposals in that programme and it is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education has been expanding at all levels at an enormous rate.  The number of students at third level has increased from 21,000 in 1965 to 70,000 last year while 75,000 are expected this year.  This indicates a massive increase in the number of young people going to third level.  That has been reflected in the ever-increasing budget for education, which now represents 20 per cent of Government expenditure.  This sobering thought underlines our very large young population and the emphasis that we as a society place on education.  We have already placed that emphasis but accessibility <Col N="2263" /> has been greatly improved over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>Greater participation has resulted in increased problems, particularly at third level.  At primary level we are experiencing a reduction in numbers, while at second level numbers are expected to reach a plateau by 1996-97.  The extension of the secondary cycle to six years may defer the levelling out of numbers at second level for a year or two.  There is a continuing expansion in the demand for third level places.  One of the problems is that we make extra provision in terms of numbers rather than space.  The numbers seeking places will increase due to the fillip represented by local authority third level educational grants.</P>
    <P>The number of mature students availing of third level education is disappointing. This is because financial circumstances restrict their accessibility. The imbalance is very interesting, with roughly 850 mature students in the vocational education committee sector and 750 in the Higher Education Authority sector.  This reflects the direction in which the educational system has been going.  There has been more emphasis in the vocational sector on continuing adult education and the involvement of mature students than in the other third level sector.</P>
    <P>Last year 53,000 students completed post-primary education, of whom 35,000 sought places at third level.  Of those who applied, 20,000 did not receive offers. That is an enormous number.  Some of those who did not receive offers would not have reached the required academic standard but others would have been refused because there were no places for them.  The academic standard is dependent on the number of places available. There is tremendous pressure for third level places and we have not been able to provide the extra places required.  This will impinge on what we are now trying to do in making third level education more accessible to mature students.  They will have to compete for places.  A corollary to this legislation should be sound proposals to provide the extra <Col N="2264" /> places needed.  I would be interested in hearing any proposals the Minister may have to create this equitable mix over the next few years.  There will be very considerable pressure on third level places.</P>
    <P>According to the Green Paper, there is 75 per cent participation at senior cycle level and that is expected to be extended to 90 per cent.  If we extend the senior cycle participation level to those aged 17 and 18, there will be a carry through to third level.  The greater the success we have in generating more involvement and participation at post-primary level, the greater the number who will carry on. That is not a defect in the legislation but it an issue that needs to be taken into consideration when making provision to bring more people into the system.</P>
    <P>The area of continuing education and adult education is extremely important. I know the matter was dealt with at length in the Green Paper on Education and in the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i>.  We have a partnership involvement in seeking to improve access to continued education.  That is the direction we must take to ensure that everybody, at whatever level, who seeks to continue education will be able to get it.  Even if the person involved has not completed second level education, he or she should be able to come into education and continue to the level to which they aspire.  In that context, I am concerned that those who do not have the leaving certificate, the standard criterion established here, and are involved in apprenticeships, for example, should not be excluded from participation in the regional technical colleges and the new Dublin Institute of Technology.  I hope that, because the legislation changes the criteria to an extent, we will not bring in mature students who have reached the necessary academic qualification while excluding others who have already been in the system.  I am concerned that one sector might substitute the other.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.  He may say it is a matter for discussion in the context of the Green Paper and that it is for the universities <Col N="2265" /> and the Dublin Institute of Technology themselves to deal with as time goes by. I should like him to give an indication of intent in that regard.</P>
    <P>I suppose one could say very cynically that further participation in education is a means of getting people off the live register and that that is a cheap way of doing so as long as there is money coming from Europe.  I do not question the Minister's bona fides in the matter, but I ask him why his predecessor felt it necessary to impose means testing on ESF funded courses for the very large number of people who attend vocational education committee colleges.</P>
    <P>About 90 per cent of the students who attend vocational education committee courses avail of one of the grant systems, in particular the ESF grant, whereas for the universities the figure is between 40 per cent and 45 per cent.  A particularly large number of students in the vocational education committee colleges are being affected by the sudden decision to means test ESF applications.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Senator McKenna is not in the Chamber to hear my next few comments.  My criticism of the ESF grant means testing does not result from any opposition to the introduction of equity and transparency to the system.  That is welcome.  What I objected to was the timing of the new regime.  As I said before, the cart was put before the horse.  In other words, the axe fell before any equity in terms of eligibility was put into the system.  That meant that towards the end of January, when the decision was being taken and was announced, youngsters had a very short period until 1 February, to make CAO/CAS choices for the courses they wished to enter.  The result was chaos because students did not know what their entitlements would be.  They did not know if this was a firm decision, if it would be reversed, or if they could opt for courses that were ESF funded.  It should be remembered that at that time there was a very low level of eligibility, which has since been increased.  Even at the increased level of eligibility, some <Col N="2266" /> students will still be faced with a considerable amount of hardship.</P>
    <P>As I said to Senator McKenna, my criticism of the previous Minister for Education was with the timing of the new system and the manner in which the changes took place.  I was concerned about the hardship and the trauma it caused and, to a large extent, still causes. It is my opinion that the wrong decision was taken.  The number of students budgeted for the ESF funding estimates has been exceeeded by about 2,600.</P>
    <P>The State has to pay 100 per cent of the funding for those students maintenance grants, whereas it would have paid a proportion of that with the rest being met by Europe.  The obvious answer would have been for the State to bear the burden this year.  The maximum amount involved would be about £2.5 million but that is not a large sum in the context of the £1.6 billion Education budget.  The measure has hit very hard and caused many problems. The second idea would have been for the Minister to go back to Europe to determine whether Ireland could argue for an extra tranche of funding.  We have been very good Europeans in that we have been very anxious to use European funds for educational and training purposes.</P>
    <P>In this debate we are not talking simply about higher education grants, we are talking about the local authority higher education grants.  Under this legislation mature students are being introduced to this scheme.  It is interesting that in the scheme outlined it is the Minister who provides the scheme for the local authorities rather than local authorities providing the scheme for the Minister. Therefore, the criteria under which grants are provided are drawn up by the Minister. I do not know whether the Minister has as yet provided a specimen scheme and sent it to the local authorities so that they may examine the requirements for eligibility for local authority grants.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the eligibility requirements will be set to a national standard which will not take into consideration the requirements of individual local authorities.  In this regard I refer <Col N="2267" /> to the Clancy Report which, in 1986, reported on an examination carried out on participation at third level education. The report strongly noted that there was an incredibly poor participation rate in certain socio-economic areas.  Because local authorities cannot themselves devise a specimen scheme but must rely on the scheme that comes from the Minister, they will not be able to draw up their own regulations and criteria to encourage the involvement of people at the lower end of the scale.</P>
    <P>The constituency with which I am involved, Dublin central, the north innercity area south of the canals, has an incredibly low participation rate of approximately 0.5 per cent.  There is a need for the authorities to be able to focus on a particular blighted area and try to put together a system where it is possible to take young people to the top level of education.  The Minister might consider requesting suggestions from the local authorities about the way the participation level in ESF-funded courses might be enhanced and what flexibility might be required to attract a greater participation of the whole socio-economic grouping.  I know it is very complex and probably cannot be done without participation and interaction at primary, second and third levels.  But it would be worthwhile to invite suggestions from local authorities because I know their members have expressed concern continuously at the enormously low participation rate.</P>
    <P>I shall not go through the provisions of the Bill in any detail.  I will just refer to the three major amendments.  For example, henceforth eligibility for grants will be dependent on a person's and their spouse's income, not that of their family. If applicant students are not dependent on their parents, meanstesting will be of their own income and their spouse's income, not that of their family.  In addition, eligibility will be dependent on actual current income as distinct from the income of the student when he or she graduated, which might be some time ago.  That was the old system operated <Col N="2268" /> by the local authorities.  We now have an interesting change.</P>
    <P>The second point concerns mature students.  It is said that third level institutions will be recognised as satisfying the academic attainment required for the awarding of grant.  That is a criterion that will be determined by the availability of space for students in existing third level accommodation, a matter to which I referred already.</P>
    <P>The third point is in relation to our EC partners and Northern Ireland.  This is a very useful development.  I hope we will have reciprocation from that area and I know there are certain schemes in existence. It is interesting to note that local authorities will now be providing facilities for mature students who have received a qualification outside this state.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the 300 to 400 mature students already within the educational system will be included and that the provisions of the Bill will apply to them retrospectively.  What will be the position of, say a mature student who may have a third level degree or qualification already will they receive a grant, as a mature student if they enter third level education for the second time, so to speak?  Perhaps their skills may have become somewhat redundant and they may have become unemployed.  They may have a primary qualification and may be anxious to re-enter third level education in some other area.  They would seem to be covered by the provisions of the Bill.  That would appear to be reasonable, particularly considering our present level of unemployment in many areas, affecting not merely people with third level education but those in the professions as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the income eligibility ceiling of families, an increase for each child, the assessment on the current income and the fact that the income limits in relation to the maintenance grants will now be index-linked. In particular I welcome the fact that mature students can now participate in third level education with the benefit of local authority higher education grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister and his Bill.  The main purpose of this Bill is to enable local authorities to award higher education grants to mature students, if such students satisfy the income eligibility criteria on the basis of their own means or, if applicable, on the basis of their own and/or their spouse's means.  The Bill also provides that a mature student who secures a place in a third level institution automatically will be regarded as having satisfied the academic requirements of the grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The position to date has been that all applicants for higher education grants were regarded and assessed as dependants, which meant that their parents' or guardians' income, as well as any income they might have themselves, was taken into account in determining reckonable income.  I welcome the fact that that will be the position no longer in the case of mature students.  Mature students who are not dependent on their parents or guardians will now qualify in their own right for higher education grants if they meet the income eligibility criteria.  To date also the leaving certificate was the only qualifying examination for higher education grants &mdash; in other words, the academic attainments required for the higher education grants had to be obtained in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that this Bill provides that school terminal examinations outside the State will now be accepted in lieu of the leaving certificate examination for the award of the higher education grants.  I assume that from what the Minister said in his statement that this situation will apply to all students, not just to mature students as defined in this Bill.  The Minister referred to students from Border counties who may be attending schools outside the State.  I take it from what he said that such students will now be eligible for higher education grants if they meet the academic attainments required on the basis of examinations they may sit for in these schools.  This provision will also be helpful to emigrant families who return <Col N="2270" /> home and who have children in second level education.  It will mean that such children will be able to continue their studies for terminal examinations outside the State and at the same time qualify for higher education grants here.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will render it easier for mature students to enter third level education and will lead to an increase in the number of third level students seeking places in higher education institutions.  In turn, that will lead to a need for those third level institutions to increase the number of places available to mature students.  I certainly hope that that will be done.  In this context I like to welcome the proposal in the Green Paper on Education regarding the provision of additional third level places for mature students who do not fulfil the usual academic requirements.  Other Senators have referred to the Green Paper.  This is an important and welcome proposal in the Green Paper.  There will be those mature students who will not satisfy the ordinary or usual academic requirements and who will be anxious to secure a place in third level institutions.  The fact that new arrangements will be made for those students if this proposal in the Green Paper is implemented is indeed very welcome.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will also lead to an increased demand for pre-third level courses and pre-university courses for mature students.  I expect and hope that this demand will be met, particularly by the vocational education committees. Every vocational education committee should consider how best such pre-third level courses can be provided to facilitate mature students who wish to seek places in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>It will be important also, as a previous speaker said, to promote such courses and to promote the idea of mature students seeking third level places.  In the last few years we have seen a significant number of very welcome initiatives in the area of third level education.  The number of third level places has been increased very considerably.  There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic <Col N="2271" /> and Social Progress</i> to provide a further 9,000 places over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The application and admission procedures for third level institutions have also been simplified.  Last year, for the first time, all applications for entry to third level were processed through the expanded CAO/CAS system.  Offers for courses in all institutions issued on the same day.  Everybody with an interest in the matter welcomed this development. This year a new grading system for the leaving certificate results is being introduced and all third level institutions will operate a common points system this year.  For the first time the colleges of education are included in the CAO system.  After this year the matriculation examination will be discontinued and it will no longer be possible to combine the results of two leaving certificates, this will introduce a greater equity into the system and make it fairer for everybody.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, in addition to announcing the new arrangements for mature students, the Minister for Education announced a number of other improvements in relation to the higher education grants scheme.  He announced that the income eligibility ceiling for families is to be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first, attending third level education.  This was a very welcome recognition of the financial strain on families with more than one child in higher education.  At the same time the Minister announced that he had set up a committee to review all aspects of the third level grant schemes, including the income eligibility limits.  As a result of that review major improvements were announced very recently.  From the start of the next academic year in September-October, a substantial increase for all families in income eligibility limits will obtain and more equitable procedures for assessing income will operate.</P>
    <P>A family comprising one to three children will qualify for full fee and full maintenance grants on an income of up to £15,000.  If two children from this family are in third level the income limit will be increased to £17,000.  These <Col N="2272" /> increases, as Senator McKenna said, are substantial and very welcome.  It will mean that many average PAYE families and middle income families who would not have qualified in the past for higher education grants will now qualify, not only for fee grants, but also for maintenance grants.  Full fees will now be paid in respect of students from families, with one to three children, on an income of up to £18,000 and this figure will rise to £20,000 if two of those students are in third level.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the parents' welfare payments under the lone parent's allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility.  The fact that income limits and maintenance grants will be index-linked from this year on &mdash; all very significant improvements &mdash; will help to increase the participation rate in higher education and will benefit, in particular, students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>In the academic year just ended, approximately 75,000 students were enrolled in third level institutions and approximately 55 per cent were in receipt of financial support under the various student grant schemes.  Another 27,000 students approximately will enter third level education in the next academic year in September or October.  More than half of these will be in receipt of grants and indeed will be dependent on grants to cover the cost of their third level education. I agree with Senators who said that it is important to pay these grants when they fall due and that there is no undue delay in processing applications, particularly for higher education grants, because of the new procedures which will operate from this year.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to refer to the recoupment of higher education grants to local authorities.  The local authority of which I am a member will, in the current year, pay out in excess of £1 million in higher education grants.  If we are to go by the experience in the past the recoupment will not be made until almost 12 months later, so that local authorities generally carry the expenditure on higher <Col N="2273" /> education grants for almost a year on their own overdraft accounts.  This results in substantial bills arising for local authorities. In the case of my local authority it is estimated that the interest bill which will arise this year because of the delay in the recoupment of higher education grants will be in the region of £50,000. Expenditure on higher grants should be recouped to local authorities in instalments, as payments to students fall due. Finally, I welcome this Bill as its provisions will enable mature students to receive financial assistance to enter third level education where, heretofore, they were precluded in many cases from receiving higher education grants.  The third level system will be enriched through the increased participation of mature students and this increased participation will be facilitated and encouraged by this legislation.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in welcoming the Minister to the House this evening.  I have spoken many times in this House and, indeed, on general legislation, in relation to the changes in ESF grant eligibility for the maintenance portion of the grants.  While this Bill does not specifically deal with that I again want to emphasise my concerns about that area.  I welcome the increase in income eligibility.  It makes some improvement in a fairly chaotic system.  The Minister referred to the fundamental review of the higher education grant scheme which the Minister and his Department have carried out.  Will the Minister make that review available as a separate document to Members of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us particularly each autumn, are approached by constituents who have difficulty in determining their eligibility, or in understanding their lack of eligibility for third level grants of one kind or another.  It is accepted that the system has been fairly chaotic for some time. There appears to have been an anomaly in the treatment of the self employed versus the PAYE sector.  We all had cases from time to time particularly from the PAYE middle and lower income sectors, who have felt very hard done by by the <Col N="2274" /> system that has been in operation up to now.  These people outline details of cases of farmers up the road who have so many acres, so many head of cattle and such and such a milk quota and only two children and yet they got a third level grant, whereas the PAYE middle income person with five, six or ten children did not manage it on the basis of their P60 or whatever.  The inference and veiled allegation is that the self employed can somehow fiddle the system, but those in PAYE type employment are caught, because the facts are on paper with their returns each year.  There has been grave and growing disquiet in this area.</P>
    <P>Apart from what is before us in this limited Bill in relation to mature students, and the increase in the income eligibility limits, which we welcome, I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the third level grants issue generally. I would also like to know if he could make public, the outcome of the review in the Department of Education.  I respectfully request the Minister to do so.  Making it public would surely be in line with the Taoiseach's commitment to open Government.  I await with interest the opportunity to read the full review and not just the specific issues that are apparently dealt with in this short Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to mature students, the Minister in his speech welcomed the ministerial amendment which was made to the Bill during its passage through Dáil Éireann on Tuesday 7 July last, which allows existing mature students who are attending approved institutions to be eligible to apply for grants under the improved scheme for the 1992-93 academic year.</P>
    <P>We all welcome that amendment which while technically a ministerial amendment came at the request of Deputy Jim Higgins, the Fine Gael Education spokesperson in the lower House.  As this was taken on Report Stage it was ministerial wording but it was a Fine Gael proposal supported by the other parties. While the Minister may claim credit for an excellent change in this Bill relative to its initial publication, the Fine Gael and Labour parties can claim as much if not <Col N="2275" /> more credit for the achievement of the application of this Bill to mature students already taking third level courses.</P>
    <P>There has been and still is great disquiet about eligibility and assessment of eligibility for third level grants.  I would have liked the Minister to postpone the implementation of means-testing of the maintenance portion of ESF grants, particularly for this coming academic year, until it could be taken as part of the overall review of the grant scheme for third level education generally.</P>
    <P>The ESF grants have turned what might have been considered &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; third level institutions, into a major success story as part of our third level scheme.  I refer to the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In the short few years that ESF grants have been around, the demand for places in regional colleges has doubled and trebled.  The number of young people who have been able to get third level education is beyond the dreams of previous Governments before European funding was available.  I would hate to add to what is a hotchpotch system, which has been subjected to deletions and additions due to various budgets and Estimates, a proposal to means test the maintenance portion in the absence of considering it in the overall review of third level funding generally. I ask the Minister again to consider it.</P>
    <P>In the main, the families we are affecting by this change are those who could not afford the option of sending their sons or daughters to universities to acquire degrees where there is no ESF funding for either the fees or their maintenance. County Wexford has no third level institution.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present</i>,</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in County Wexford which has no third level institution.  Our young people who leave second level education and want third level training or university education must travel from home to Carlow, Waterford or to Dublin <Col N="2276" /> with Waterford taking the bulk of our students.  This means that they must live away from home from Monday to Friday. The maintenance portion of the ESF grant is a critical factor in the ability of middle to low income students, particularly from families with more than three children, to get third level education.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this.  In County Wexford, we have the second lowest uptake of third level places in Ireland, and this relates directly to the fact that we have no third level institution in the county and our young people cannot afford to travel either to the university or to the regional technical colleges.  We also have the second highest unemployment rate, with 24 per cent unemployed.  This is not often recognised because the perception is that Wexford is the model county and does not have a major unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>We have not lost any major industry but over a long period there has been an insidious decline of our industries.  The decline of our industrial base has reached critical proportions.  We were a major farming county but with the loss of employment on the land and with that option now closed off, our school leavers face major difficulties finding work.</P>
      <P>Having stated the statistics on the uptake of third level places and our chronic unemployment, I need not remind the Minister that education is directly related to one's chance of not ending up on the dole queue.  If one leaves school without any certificate, there is a 36 per cent chance of ending up on the dole queue; however if you have a leaving certificate the chance of ending up on the dole is reduced to between 12 per cent and 15 per cent; if you succeed in getting a third level education there is only a 4 to 5 per cent chance of ending up on the dole queue. Need we say more?  The question for jobs for 16 and 17 year olds should be directed to a quest for third level places or for further realistic training when they leave formal education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in Wexford is critical. Because of our low uptake of third level places and our high rate of unemployment, <Col N="2277" /> I urge the Minister to reconsider his proposals to means test the maintenance portion of the ESF grants.  Distance is a cost factor for young people attending third level institutes.  Our young people do not have the option of attending third level courses in their own county, although there is a post-leaving certificate course in the Wexford vocational school where students have the option of taking a language and secretarial course, but we do not have a third level institute, much as we would love to develop satellite courses from Carlow or Waterford regional technical colleges.  Indeed that concept is being actively pursued at present.</P>
    <P>The increase in the income eligibility threshold is to be welcomed as well as the opening up of opportunities for mature students but I am very concerned about the overall scheme for grant aiding third level students.  I regret that the Minister has chosen to means test ESF grants without dealing with this matter in the overall review.  May I ask him to consider postponing means testing ESF grants for the academic year 1992-93 until there has been a comprehensive examination of third level grant aid assistance?</P>
    <P>I accept the calls and the need for equity in the system, but I also accept that some of the perceptions of inequity may not be realised.  I have a feeling that the system is heavily weighted in favour of the self-employed because of the system of tax assessment of the self-employed and as a result of PAYE sector need our attention and protection because they find it particularly difficult to fund their children's third level education.</P>
    <P>From the statistics, the Minister will realise why Members want to ensure that our young people have the opportunity to pursue third level education at certificate if not degree level.  We want to increase their prospects of employment or at least make them mobile in terms of gaining employment outside the country and, when they want to return, hopefully being able to find a niche for themselves at home.  May I again appeal to the Minister to postpone his proposals to means <Col N="2278" /> test the ESF grant this year until we can all examine the review of the higher education grant scheme.  I look forward to getting a copy of that review so that I can study the many issues that need to be considered in this most important area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to this House.  I wish him well in his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>Times were stormy but things have settled down as the Minister has indicated his concept of education.  The Minister is introducing the enterprise culture into the education sector, and we all welcome this.  He deserves credit for doing this.  It is very important that such a concept exists in education from the very beginning right through to third level because our young people need to be enterprise conscious to generate the economic activity we so badly need.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  For many years Members have been calling on Ministers to extend the opportunities to mature students.  For one reason or another, some people were unable to attain certain standards and were not in a position to pursue third level courses.  However, in this Bill the Minister has opened the door for them.  One of the advantages of giving mature people the opportunity to pursue a third level course will be to improve their self image.  These people know third level education opens up many new opportunities for them.  When they pursue a course, they are motivated and have a goal to achieve and most of them are successful.  This Bill will give many mature people the opportunity to return to education and pursue a third level course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle is right when she says that most people want the opportunities that come from education because it makes them employable.  Those who have been denied second and third level education find it extremely difficult to find employment in this age of technology. This Bill will provide opportunities for them to pursue a course.  At the end of the day most people want <Col N="2279" /> meaningful employment and wish to contribute to the economy.</P>
    <P>We tend to overlook the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  There were four areas covered: increasing the income eligibility limits; assessment of income eligibility for mature students; third, academic requirements of mature students who secured a place in third level institutions and, fourth, the development of more equitable income assessment criteria for all applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion on the Adjournment is the need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that the inquiry instituted in the case of the Tallaght Two, 18 months ago be completed without delay and that the findings be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly, I will recap on some of the major items in relation to the story of the so-called Tallaght Two, Joseph Meleady and Joseph Grogan, two young men in Tallaght who were convicted and sentenced to five years imprisonment in relation to a joyriding incident.  The incident took place in February 1984 when a car owned by Mr. Eamon Gavan &mdash; a resident in Templeogue &mdash; was stolen by joyriders.  Mr. Gavan very bravely clung to the car for about a mile before being dislodged.  He did his best to prevent the theft taking place.  He subsquently identified the driver and the front seat passenger as being Mr. Meleady and Mr. Grogan.  The trial took place in May 1985 in the Central Criminal Court and the prosecution case was based solely on visual identification by Mr. Gavan and his son, Paul.  The accused responded with alibis that they were not <Col N="2280" /> in the vicinity at the time, had not been involved in the theft and produced certain evidence to support that claim.  They further produced a witness, Mr. Brendan Walsh, who declared that he was the driver and that neither Grogan nor Meleady was in the car at the time of the incident.  However, the jury convicted both men, Grogan and Meleady, and both received prison sentences of five years.  They appealed the sentences in November 1985 and produced fresh evidence in the person of Mr. Paul McDonnell, who claimed he was in the car, and was one of the joyriders.  He also claimed that neither Meleady nor Grogan were in the car; in other words, similar evidence was given previously by Mr. Walsh.</P>
    <P>In July 1987 the State decided to prosecute Mr. McDonnell for perjury in relation to this matter.  It is interesting to note that at that case further evidence was presented by the Garda, which had not been presented at the earlier court hearing, namely that a fingerprint of Brendan Walsh had been found, in 1984, on the interior of the front window of the car &mdash; in other words, near the seat where Mr. Walsh claimed he had been.  The only matter disclosed at the trial by the prosecution was that a fingerprint which was Mr. Walsh's had been found at the rear of the car.</P>
    <P>The case was decided by the jury on the basis of the perception that Mr. Walsh was in the back of the car whereas Mr. Walsh had given evidence that he was in the front of the car.</P>
    <P>The major questions that have to be addressed are that certain evidence that was very relevant to the case was withheld at the initial trial in 1984 and accidentally emerged in 1987.  Questions will have to be asked as to the reason no identification parade took place, which is the normal procedure.  Another man who came forward in a TV programme on RTE, claimed he was the driver of the car &mdash; already two men had come forward, one claiming he was in the passenger seat and another in the rear seat, testified to that in court under oath &mdash; and subsequently identified himself <Col N="2281" /> before senior gardaí as the driver of the car.</P>
    <P>The only evidence before either the original hearing or the appeal court was the questionable evidence of the identification of father and son, without the benefit of an identification parade and without any corroborative evidence.  As I said, fingerprints which were relevant to the case were not disclosed.  It brings us to the question of whether there was a miscarriage of justice in this case.  A very substantial campaign has taken place: 10,000 signatures were collected, the people who were involved in the Birmingham Six, including Gareth Pierse, have become involved.  Their perception is that the case is similar to cases dealt with in Britain and Ireland, whether it was the Birmingham Six, the Gilford Four or, in our own case the Oscar Breathnach and the Nicky Kelly case where certain uncorroborated evidence was presented which was not sufficient to warrant a conviction but the question remained that there was a likelihood of a miscarriage in the case.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, there had been calls for a public inquiry and a judicial inquiry and the State indicated that the Director of Public Prosecutions was examining the matter.  My matter on the Adjournment refers to the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions has been sitting on the case in excess of 18 months, it is now closer to two years, and we still have not had the report.  There are major matters that have to be addressed in relation to the validity and reliability of the convictions.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say, if the Director of Public Prosecutions has completed his report?  It has taken an enormous length of time on a matter that is of considerable importance, where people's good names may well have been impugned, have served prison sentences and so on.  In that context is there any possibility of action being taken on the Martin report in relation to the establishment of an independent body which would recommend to the Cabinet or to the Attorney General &mdash; and would investigate in the first instance &mdash; that cases, where there was a <Col N="2282" /> serious question mark about the validity of the convictions and where there was no further access to the courts be reopened? We do not have that facility here but it is in existence in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Martin report recommended a particular procedure for introducing it and that would be one way of dealing with this case.  At present the Director of Public Prosecutions is either in the process of making a report or has made a report and I ask that it be presented or at least that we be informed of the state of play in relation to that report and that its findings be published.  If not the campaign obviously will continue.</P>
    <P>Mr. Meleady's father has left his employment to concentrate on clearing the good name of his son.  A large number of people and representative organisations have lent their names as corporate bodies or as individuals seeking to deal with this case to ensure that there is a full examination of the major questions and reservations that exist.  The case has also soured relationships between the gardaí and the community in Tallaght and that should not be allowed to continue.  It is important that the matter be resolved at an early stage.</P>
    <P>With those few words I would like to impress upon the Minister the urgency of getting the matter resolved and of ensuring that the report is finalised, if that has not already been done and that the results are published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I have to say that the House will be aware that the former Attorney General requested the Director of Public Prosecutions to prepare a report on the case referred to by the Senator.  The Taoiseach has been informed by the Attorney General that the report furnished by the Director of Public Prosecutions was detailed and extensive, it involved some complex issues and it would take time to be examined fully.  The Attorney General has also informed the Taoiseach that his examination of the report is proceeding as quickly as possible but that other matters of urgent public importance <Col N="2283" /> which he was obliged to deal with in recent times unavoidably delayed completion of this examination.  The Minister for Justice has no function in relation to the Attorney General and it would not be appropriate for him to comment on the timescale for completion of the Attorney General's examination of the report.</P>
      <P>A formal petition for a pardon on behalf of Messrs Grogan and Meleady was received by the Taoiseach recently. This petition and supporting documentation which will also need to be examined has been passed to the Attorney General for appropriate attention. The House will apreciate that it would be inappropriate for me, in the circumstances, to make any further comment on the matter at this time.</P>
      <P>However, I can repeat the assurance the Taoiseach has already given that the matter will receive urgent consideration when the examination has been completed. I understand the Attorney General believes he will be in a position to conclude his examination of the matter shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is the need for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to intervene directly in the case of an Irish citizen, of whom I have supplied details to the Department, held in a British mental hospital for the last eight years without conviction of a criminal offence and without recourse to the courts and to secure his transfer to an Irish facility.  First, I am very encouraged <Col N="2284" /> and heartened by the positive response that I have had from the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I believe they take this case seriously on both compassionate and legal grounds.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a very quick background to the case.  This is a young man who entered Trinity College in 1970 and took a degree in literature there, so he is obviously a highly intelligent man.  In 1976 he went to Nigeria where he worked for a while, but he discovered that his father was seriously ill; in fact his father died and he came home to Dublin for some weeks.  He then discovered that he had been incubating a series of tropical diseases, including malaria and hepatitis, so he became seriously ill and did not return to Nigeria.  He contemplated taking further training as a teacher but discovered that this was not in accordance with his personality and he decided to go into the home decorating business.</P>
      <P>In 1982 he discovered that there was a community living on an island off the west of Ireland called the Atlantis Community, known popularly as the Screamers, and he felt that these were people who could offer something to him in the way of development of his personality. He went to investigate and discovered that among the people there was a young woman to whom he found himself greatly attracted and they became involved in a quasi-erotic situation, although it subsequently was clear that she was using her powers of attraction in order to enmesh him further in this sect.</P>
      <P>He found the situation extremely frustrating and eventually left for his brother's wedding, returning once more to the community, but there was a series of incidents during which he found the young woman alternately seductive and rejecting.</P>
      <P>He came back to live with his mother in Dublin and spent some time decorating the family home and doing other decorating work around Dublin.  However, he then decided to go back to the community and discovered that there was a similar organisation in England called the Raj Neesh Organisation and he felt he could get what he needed in that community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2285" /> Similar circumstances, which I will not detail, occurred there.  He developed an obsession with a therapist who was using primal scream therapy and sensory deprivation but she became distanced from him, and he became obsessed with her. He managed to break into the community's premises and attacked a guard. This led subsequently to his arrest and he was transferred to Norwich Prison.</P>
    <P>While he was in the prison he asked to see the chaplain and while he was being conducted to the hospital chapel he took a warden hostage and held him there for eight hours while negotiations took place.  He was obviously under severe mental and emotional strain as a result of the complexion of circumstances I have described, his unsatisfactory job situation, the death of his father and his various serious illnesses combined with an emotional vulnerability which had been exploited by this very curious religious sect.</P>
    <P>He was subsequently transferred to Broadmoor Hospital on 6 August 1984 and then transferred to Moss Side Hospital in June 1987 and he is now in Ashworth Hospital in Liverpool.</P>
    <P>One of the really worrying things about this, to me and to anybody who believes in civil liberties, is that here is a man who was emotionally vulnerable; he was in a difficult situation; he did commit an assault but it is a severe sentence.  If he had committed murder he might be out now.  He has already served eight years and because he is in prison under the Mental Health Act he has no recourse to the courts, he cannot appeal and he has no redress against this situation.</P>
    <P>In 1989 he was examined by an independent psychiatrist, a Dr. Roberts, with a string of initials after his name which I will not waste the time of the Seanad by putting on the record.  I transmitted these facts to the Department of Foreign Affairs this morning:</P>
    <P>The Nurses report that Mr. Wilson has not shown any particularly abnormal behaviour now for many months. He presents them with no nursing problems.  He has not shown any symptoms <Col N="2286" /> which can be attributed to mental illness.  He attends school in a regular and committed way and spends much of his time studying for a Postgraduate Degree.</P>
    <P>The psychiatrist interviewed Mr. Wilson and said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson greeted me on my second visit in a friendly and direct manner and was clearly pleased to be able to talk about the incident.  He tells his story in an utterly consistent manner and clearly some of the events which he relates still cause him some distress.  At no stage during the interview did he express ideas which were of themselves psychotic although he was describing events which were extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Then there is a summary of comments from this eminent, independent doctor:</P>
    <P>I do not believe Mr. Wilson is demonstrating any signs of mental illness at the present time.</P>
    <P>2.  I believe Mr. Wilson has been mentally ill and that his mental illness began to develop around the time that he went to the Atlantis Community for the first time.</P>
    <P>3.  I think that Mr. Wilson's illness is of a very unusual kind and can only be understood by reference to the events which were happening to him and his perception of them.</P>
    <P>5.  His ability to form relationships with people, his warmth and sense of humour and his ability to concentrate on his studies all bear testimony to the fact that he is well at the present time.</P>
    <P>6.  I do not believe that he is in need of further treatment within a secure situation.</P>
    <P>7.  He acknowledges the dangers in what he did and does not seek to excuse himself other than to say he has behaved in a silly and wrong way.</P>
    <P>This is a man who has attested professionally to the fact that the subject of my interest this evening was a well person <Col N="2287" /> mentally in 1989.  This begs the question if he is not now well, what kind of hospital is it in which he is being contained?  If somebody had returned to mental health in 1989, a citizen of Ireland, how is it that it can now be maintained that his situation has deteriorated to such an extent that he cannot with any justice be released?</P>
    <P>I have this gentleman's permission to quote from his letters.  In my opinion &mdash; and I am used to assessing students professionally &mdash; they show a man of considerable intelligence and capacity to express himself who has been through a harrowing experience:</P>
    <P>I can honestly say that the longer I have spent in Ashworth the more my mental and physical health has deteriorated. The Mental Health Act is the only piece of legislation in the United Kingdom where a person can be indefinitely detained beyond the limit of their sentences or without a trial.  In my case I never had a trial.</P>
    <P>Shades of the Birmingham Six; there is no release date.</P>
    <P>I have been told by the medical team on Gibbon, that is the ward, as politely as possible that I can reasonably expect to serve another five years on top of the eight I have served.</P>
    <P>This is not the worst.  He finds his separation from Ireland the worst.  He says:</P>
    <P>What would not apply in Ireland would be the soul destroying sense of isolation which I endure over here year in, year out.  In these places if you are deprived of contact with somebody from the big world out there after all the years you become totally institutionalised and eccentric.  I have seen it happen to others.  That is why I wished and prayed for years to be sent home.</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>For my first four years over here I spent the bulk of my time in solitary confinement in a ten foot by eight foot <Col N="2288" /> concrete box with nothing for company but the smell of my excreta in a plastic chamber pot and the muffled sound of a shout or cry in the distance, not knowing night from day but being alive like in a coffin.  I received no help from anybody.  I believe the fact that I come from an educated background and read a lot has been my greatest drawback over here.</P>
    <P>He believes the fact that he took a prison officer hostage has not helped his case. He does not think he will be able to endure this for another five years.  I have transmitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs a report from <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper dated 1 March 1992 in which David Brindle, the social services correspondent, indicates that an inquiry has taken place into this hospital as the result of the death of a person called Sean Walton, who also sounds Irish, following a beating.  An inquiry has been carried out into conditions in this hospital.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to raise this matter at the very highest level as a matter of urgency.  He should contact the Home Secretary and ensure at the very least that this man is transferred to an appropriate environment.  Obviously the most appropriate environment is in Dublin where his family, including his mother who is elderly, will be able to visit him.</P>
    <P>This appalling case involving an Irish prisoner who committed an offence by striking someone in the face when he was under extreme mental and emotional pressure should be addressed so that he will not have to endure what can only be described as a living death in an English hospital without being sentenced.  I am sure it is possible to do something to bring this talented man who has already spent eight years in what amounts to confinement in a British jail back home where his mental health would undoubtedly improve.</P>

      <P>This sad case was first brought to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs in January of this year when the person's family contacted the <Col N="2289" /> consular section.  Following this approach, the Department contacted the probation and welfare service of the Department of Justice.  The service confirmed that they were already aware of the case and had been requested by the British hospital, where the person in question is detained, to provide a report on the person's home circumstances.  The report provided by the service was a positive one.  The Department of Foreign Affairs then contacted the Department of Health and the Eastern Health Board and sought their advice about the case. The latter wrote directly to the British hospital in question.  I understand that this correspondence is currently ongoing.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs subsequently asked the Irish Embassy in London to contact the hospital where this person is being kept.  The embassy were informed that there was no procedure whereby persons in psychiatric hospitals in either country could be transferred to the other.  This meant that the only option would be for the Home Secretary to discharge the person unconditionally. However, the hospital indicated that they could not recommend this course of action.  During the course of their inquiries, the embassy learned that a review of the person's case took place on 3 July.  The embassy have since written to the Home Office asking them to advise on, first, the outcome of that review and, second, the possibility of the person being allowed to return to Dublin.  The consular section of the Department of Foreign Affairs have been in regular contact with the person's family, and I can assure the Senator that they will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I have noted the comments made by the Senator.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have the matter looked into as a matter of urgency and will be in further contact with the Senator.  I should say I have taken careful account of the plea made by the Senator on behalf of this person.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the <Col N="2290" /> Minister for the humane approach he has adopted to this case.  I agree that perhaps the best approach would be to repatriate this person to Dundrum Hospital even for a temporary period where he could be properly assessed by Irish professionals in a context which both he and they would understand.  I am most grateful to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their interest in this matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Finance why a VAT inspector has been calling to bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dingle peninsula over the past few weeks and questioning the owners about how many rooms are let to tourists, and how many rooms have bathrooms.  He has also asked to see their dining rooms and details on the number of people they can accommodate.  This VAT inspector, as is his right, arrives at the door of the house, identifies himself properly and produces his identification card.  Many people providing bed and breakfast accommodation are afraid that the tax man is about to move in again, which he has every right to do.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to give careful consideration to the situation of people who are providing this much needed service for tourists.  These people derive a small income from their activity during the summer months, and they charge between £8 and £12 per person for bed and breakfast.  I can assure the Minister that this is not a holiday for the people providing this type of accommodation. I am not talking about guesthouses; I am talking about people who have up to five bedrooms in their houses. As I said these people are providing a much needed service for tourists who visit the Dingle peninsula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 180 hotel bedrooms in the peninsula 40 to 50 bedrooms in approved guesthouses.  Over the past 15 to 20 yers an increasing number of people have visited this area.  The people about whom I am talking have provided <Col N="2291" /> bed and breakfast for tourists year after year.  In many cases the money they make from this business is used to carry out improvements to their homes.  The bed and breakfast accommodation provided in Dingle is excellent.  The money these people make from this business is reinvested so that they can meet the demands of tourists, many of whom require bedrooms with a bathroom en suite.</P>
    <P>If these people take down their bed and breakfast signs and discontinue this service it will be a great blow to the Dingle peninsula, the town, restaurants, bars, etc.  In future an inspector of taxes or a VAT inspector who wants to question people engaged in this business should write them a simple letter and <Col N="2292" /> attach a questionnaire so that they can give the necessary information voluntarily. I ask the Minister to introduce legislation which would provide that a certain amount of money derived from bed and breakfast accommodation would be exempt from tax as almost all this money goes back into improving the houses.  County Kerry and the Dingle peninsula have set a standard in tourism which other counties could follow.  I hope many Senators, TDs, the Minister for Finance and the Cathaoirleach will come to the kingdom, where they will enjoy their holiday and, at the same time, spend their money in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 July 1992.</P>
