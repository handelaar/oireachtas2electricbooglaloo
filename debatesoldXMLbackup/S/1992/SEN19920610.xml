      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that work commences in 1992 on the construction of the new Community College at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matters:</P>
      <P>1.  The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the time scale for the refurbishment of the Central Model School, Marlborough Street, is adhered to.</P>
      <P>2.  The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that a trained remedial teacher is appointed to North Brunswick Street Primary School, Dublin 7, to cater for the substantial number of students who require remedial education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's matter and Senator Costello's matter regarding the Central Model School, Marlborough <Col N="306" /> Street and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the other matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he could be a bit more precise about the amount of work we have coming before us from now until the end of the term?  Indeed, I would like him to specify when we are going to terminate this session.  What is the amount of work?  I know we are somewhat influenced by what is coming through from the other House.  We would like to have a better idea of what the arrangement of work is likely to be over the next number of weeks.  We would also like an assurance that we will not find ourselves at the end of the term with a backload that is simply going to be subjected to what you, a Chathaoirligh, euphemistically call &ldquo;an allocation of time&rdquo;, but which we like to refer to as <Col N="307" /> the guillotine.  At this time of the year I am afraid the guillotine works at an extra rate.  I would prefer to get come clear idea at this stage.</P>

Senator Costello has come back in again today and talks about the guillotine.  At present we are sitting at least one day extra a week and possibly two.  With all due respects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Bill has been given more time &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; but for the Senator to stand up on the Order of Business for two days in a row and suggest that a guillotine might be put on this particular Bill is unjustified.</P>

      <P>We are on amendment No. 57.  We gave a lot of attention to this amendment last evening.  Senator McMahon was in possession.  He is not here, so I will call Senator Hederman who is now offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>We were debating the deletion of paragraph (j).  It refers to the question of not allowing a prisoner to stand for election if he is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for any term exceeding six months whether with or without hard labour or penal servitude or for any period imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State.  We vehemently urged the Minister to consider deleting this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three very small points which I would like to make over and above what I and other Senators said yesterday.  We mentioned the nature of the very minor offences for which one could get a sentence of six months.  I did not have time last evening to check them out.  I am sure one could get a sentence of six months for dangerous driving, which is a very serious offence and I am not belittling <Col N="309" /> it.  For drunken driving one could get a similar sentence.  That might be particularly sensitive to Members in this House.  I will say no more about that. One could find oneself being sentenced to six months and perhaps spending only two or three months in jail.  Yet you would not be eligible to take your seat in this House, if you were elected democratically by the people.  In view of what was said yesterday, it is important to look at this section again.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to mention is whether there is such a thing any longer as a sentence of a period in jail with or without hard labour.  I thought that concept had gone from our prison sentences.  I would like some clarification on that.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to make&mdash; and it is one which I think is very valid in relation to this amendment &mdash; is that I thought it was the purpose of prison sentences to reform prisoners who were in jail.  If that is the case, it is an admission of defeat on the part of those who drew up this Bill and on the part of the Minister to say that when somebody goes to jail we cannot accept that he could be reformed and we are not going to allow him to take his seat, if elected.  It is extremely unfair and unbalanced.  I hope that, having considered the matter overnight, the Minister will tell us now that he will consider deleting this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole section is an important one in relation to the question of the legality and constitutionality of who should be disbarred, and on what grounds, from being a candidate for election. We must put forward very substantial <Col N="310" /> reasons if any citizen is going to be disbarred.  The Constitution itself, in Article 16, states that every citizen, without distinction of sex, who has reached the age 21 years and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.  Clearly, there is a constitutional imperative there that anybody who is to be disqualified must be disqualified on substantial grounds.  That is the principle we have to consider in looking at each of these disqualifications suggested here.</P>
      <P>I would like to take it from a number of angles.  First, I would argue that imprisonment is a particular type of sanction for wrongdoing.  There is a whole variety of sanctions for wrongdoing. What people may not realise is that imprisonment itself is an alternative to more drastic sanctions that existed in the past, such as execution, which was the common one for the most trivial of offences.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic principle must be that when somebody is imprisoned that he, in fact, loses one of his constitutional entitlements &mdash; the right to liberty.  After that, he has under the law other constitutional entitlements as a citizen of this country.  Such person is entitled to an education and to health care.  He should be entitled to the right to vote.  He should also be entitled to stand for election.  There is nothing implicit in the sentence of imprisonment just because it punishes people in a particular way.  Let us say there was no sentence of imprisonment but suspended sentence.  One sees daily that people get suspended sentences for the most serious of offences because it may be a first offence.  People may have been killed or seriously maimed through drunken driving. That is not an irregular occurrence. However, for one reason or another &mdash; extenuating circumstances, the judge <Col N="311" /> may be sympathetic, perhaps there is a character reference &mdash; the sentence is suspended.  A person might get a suspended prison sentence for three or six years.  In other words, he does not go to prison, so therefore he is not subject to a sentence of imprisonment for a term of six months.</P>
      <P>A person, under the jurisdiction of the District Court, where there is no jury, can end up in prison for six months or longer for very trivial reasons.  We are not talking about somebody who has had the benefit of a trial by a jury of his peers. One can end up in prison for minor offences.</P>
      <P>Debtors end up in prison, a category which the Whitaker Committee said should never be in prison because that is adding extra cost to the State.  Their offence is not the type of offence that prison should be used for.  Are they people who should be disqualified?  The Whitaker report recommends that a very large percentage of those who are in prison should be out on community service orders.  The judge may decide, at his discretion, whether to impose a prison sentence or to impose an alternative sanction for the same type of offence.  Therefore, just because a particular judge imposes a prison sentence of six months, or in excess of six months, that person may be disbarred from being allowed to be a candidate for Dáil Éireann.  Another judge, for exactly the same offence, may impose a sentence that does not result in incarceration and then that person can stand for election.  There is an anomaly there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that this provision would find favour with the constitutional requirement that somebody should be eligible unless he is specifically debarred for due cause.  I would like to hear the Minister's reply in terms of the weighty constitutional requirement in this area. Many categories of people can go into prison for offences that one would not regard as criminal offences.  Farmers and students have marched for their rights. But because they are in breach of one particular piece of legislation or have <Col N="312" /> caused an obstruction or a breach of the peace, they can end up in prison for a considerable period of time.  The Minister should reconsider this section entirely in accordance with our amendment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this because I know this amendment has been discussed at some length.  There are times when I wondered whether we were having a debate on prison reform or electoral reform.  The points made by Senator Costello carry a lot of weight, especially in light of the new understanding of the interpretation of the Constitution.  If we are going on precedent, the only case I am aware of where a Member of Parliament was suspended, and in fact lost his seat, because of a prison sentence would tend to strengthen Senator Costello's case.  This was back in the 1920s.  A member of my own party called Coyle, a very fine man from Mayo, wrote a cheque in the Ormond Hotel that he did not have the resources at that point to meet.  Because of that he was brought before the courts.  I do not know why somebody did not have the sense to put some money in his bank account.  But he got a two year prison sentence on foot of what was certainly not a major offence.</P>
      <P>That was in 1924 and that sort of thing probably would not happen today. Nevertheless, Senator Costello has made a case which, I believe, is certainly worth listening to.  There may well be other constitutional matters and I would be happy if the Minister would simply agree to come back to us on Report Stage with any fresh thinking he may have on the matter.  I am not asking him for an answer here and now.  It is a matter which he may very well want to have discussed at Cabinet and with the Attorney General. However, I think Senator Costello has made an interesting case and one that needs to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was debated at length last night.  Essentially, all I would say is that there is not a more unsuitable place from which to conduct an election than from a prison.  It is about <Col N="313" /> the worst place possible that one could consider fighting from.  If somebody in those circumstances and with those restrictions can find himself able to get elected, it means that there are powerful political forces at work.  Those forces should be allowed to express themselves through the ballot box rather than remain bottled up.  They might begin to express themselves in other ways.  That is one of the main reasons why I would like to see this restriction removed.  I would also like to emphasise the item in the wording in relation to the jurisdiction in this State. I still wonder why that is in there.  Why is there the possibility of people in prison in other states being allowed to be eligible for election while in this State we will not accord the same facilities to people in prison here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister not to accept this amendment.  He has stated very clearly that the paragraph refers only to a serious offence.  We could waffle here for two days and go back to the formation of the State.  Most people elected to this House understand the meaning of a serious offence.  If there is an armed robbery of a post office and one gets 12 months in jail, that is a serious offence.  The Minister and those who advise the Minister are well aware of what a serious offence means.  Let us have an intelligent interpretation of what the Minister is presenting here.  We would never get legislation through this House if we are given examples, going back to when the State was formed of who was in jail for political offences.  There would be no end to it.  There can be motoring offences and drunken driving offences. We can talk about the law and reform of the law and bad law.  We can get one judge sentencing to three or four years somebody who has not got his car taxed or insured.  It could be said that that is not in the same category as a serious offence within the meaning of this Bill. We should give a mature response to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with what Senator McGowan has said in relation <Col N="314" /> to serious criminal offences.  People who commit serious criminal offences should be disqualified.  In fact, I do not see them queueing up to get into Parliament, anyway.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect which I find a little disquieting.  It relates to civil unrest. We have been blessed in this country because we have not had very serious civil unrest for a very long time.  I attended the farmers' march which came to Merrion Square.  It was not very far from being serious civil unrest.  I could visualise circumstances where the authorities could intervene in circumstances of serious civil unrest based on political disquiet and where people could be committed to prison on that basis.  That would raise questions as to repression by the State, in that people who went out on to the streets or got involved in some serious situation on a matter of conscience, or on a matter of serious political difficulty, could find themselves in jail.  It would be very inappropriate in those circumstances for the State not to allow them to be Members of Parliament. There are many examples in other countries where people have fought for civil rights and have been sent to jail and have not been even given the opportunity to stand for Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some difficulties about that. Nevertheless, as I said last evening, I believe that the balance of the argument lies with the Minister.  Some regulation must be established whereby people who are members of the criminal classes cannot become Members of the House or cannot continue to be Members.  As the Minister pointed out, there is nothing to stop people from standing.  It is a matter of being able to continue their membership of the House.  There are precedents in our history where people were elected to the Houses of Parliament from jails.  As I said it would be quite conceivable to imagine a British Minister in the other Parliament in the early part of the century giving the same sort of reasons as are being given here for legislation of this nature and which would have disqualified people who sat in the <Col N="315" /> British Parliament or in our Parliament subsequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I believe the points now being made by Senator Costello and Senator Manning were covered last night.  I certainly endeavoured to deal with them in as reasonable a way as as I could.  I certainly oppose the amendment.  Paragraph (j) of section 41 provides that a person who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for any term exceeding six months, whether with or without hard labour, or of penal servitude for any period, shall not be eligible for election to or membership of the Dáil.  Amendment No. 57 proposes to delete this paragraph. Paragraph (j) applies to persons serving a sentence in excess of six months or a sentence of penal servitude.  Thus, it relates to prisoners undergoing sentences for serious offences.  A person convicted of a less serious offence &mdash; for example, a non-payment of fine &mdash; would rarely be required to serve a term of imprisonment in excess of six months.  The disqualification would not, therefore, apply to a person convicted of minor offences.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is that persons serving sentences for serious offences, including murder and terrorist related offences, would be eligible for Dáil membership.  While a person is serving a sentence of imprisonment, he is deprived of his liberty, he cannot engage in his normal occupation, his movement is restricted, is strictly controlled, and normal actions associated with freedom of expression and association of movement are suppressed or curtailed. For example, the number of visits a prisoner may receive are controlled and supervised; the letters he may receive or send are limited and may be subject to censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that in these circumstances, a prisoner would not be in a position to discharge his functions as a Member of the Dáil while serving his sentence.  In any event, it is not appropriate that the <Col N="316" /> privileges available to a Member of the Dáil or a Dáil candidate should be extended to a convicted criminal.  It appears that in virtually all EC member states the law envisages that a citizen may be deprived of the right to vote or stand for election on coviction for serious misconduct. I repeat, we covered this fairly comprehensively yesterday and I appeal that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The Minister has restated everything he said yesterday therefore it is not unreasonable to reply to the points he made.  There are Senators in the House today who were not here yesterday.  The Minister said that in other countries if a person has been in prison he cannot stand for election and I said he was being totally illogical.  He is allowing these people to stand, and if they want to get publicity for their cause and use the election in some way, he is allowing them to do that.</P>

      <P>If I may, then, I was looking up these matters and I have just got the information.  For setting fire to a haystack, a stack of corn, you could get a year's imprisonment.  Do you think it is reasonable that somebody who set fire to a stack of corn is in prison for a year or six months&mdash;they could well be out the day after the election, the day after they were due to take their seat &mdash; would not be allowed to stand for election for <Col N="317" /> another four years and 11 months and 29 days?  I think that the Minister is simply stonewalling.  Would the Minister reply to my question?  If he replied to the points raised we would not have to keep repeating them.  Is there such a thing as hard labour?  Does it exist?  I understood it was gone.  If the Minister would reply to these points we would not have to repeat them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he will allow them to stand, but when they are democratically elected he will not allow the will of the electorate to hold sway and he will prevent them from taking their seat. Apparently, the Minister gives the democratic will of the electorate a low priority; that is not very important.  What is important and what matters to the Minister is what is in this legislation, but what matters to me and to those who spoke last night, is that the democratic will of the people who elect such a person should be allowed to hold sway.</P>

      <P>It is a brief point, but a new one.  The Minister stated that he is going to disqualify people from membership of Dáil Éireann, should they be elected, if they are serving a prison sentence for any term exceeding six months, but he failed to make any distinction between what would be a criminal offence and a civil offence.  Senator Dardis referred, very appropriately, to something arising out of civil disobedience. It could be a matter of the most serious criminal nature or a civil matter not involving a criminal offence or impinging the person's character.  The <Col N="318" /> offence could relate to all sorts of things such as street demonstrations, which are participated in by various groups and categories of people, whether they are protesting about potholes or they are farmers marching on the Dáil.  For example, a casual trader without a permit can get six months plus in prison.  If you sell contraceptives without authorisation, you can get 12 months plus in prison.  The Minister cannot simply throw in a blanket coverall and catchall disqualification here; he must be more specific if he wants to put in a disqualification that is in line with his constitutional obligations.  Let me emphasise that.  Once a person is entitled as a citizen to vote, then we are not entitled to impose a law and conditions which would seek to present an otherwise qualified person from entering Dáil Éireann.  I think therefore that the Minister will have to be a lot more specific in relation to the category of prisoner to which he is referring.  Even if the Minister was to come back with a further qualification, I think he should certainly reexamine the situation and make a distinction on the grounds of the category of criminality as distinct from the category of civil disobedience for which a person could end up in prison for six months plus.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In page 37, lines 8 and 9, to delete paragraph (k).</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the debarring of people who are undischarged bankrupts from being able to contest elections or from being Members of the Dáil.  It is not that I am a defender of those who are bankrupt, either discharged or otherwise, but I feel that this amendment seems to be a throwback from other times, from another form of thinking.  I cannot see any great reason that these people should be singled out and debarred from membership of the Dáil or from contesting elections simply because they are bankrupt.  If they are bankrupt, then that is hardly a good base on which to fight an election.  I would imagine that the public would be made well aware of the fact that they were bankrupt, if not by themselves then certainly by their political opponents, who have always been very good at getting that type of information across to the public at election times.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is another aspect to it.  It relates to the fact that in many ways if somebody is a Member of the Dáil and becomes bankrupt, or runs into difficulties or is at risk of becoming bankrupt, what happens in reality is that supporters of that party who have money bail them out.  One wonders if that is the best way of approaching these problems. Basically, I am not happy that this type of debarring still remains in the legislation.  I cannot see any good reason for it.  If someone is bankrupt that would answer most of the problems and preclude them from being a viable candidate.</P>

      <P>I do not think we need go back over that ground.  A lot of the things we said on the last amendment apply here.  I think there are many bankrupt people in the Dáil, people who are <Col N="320" /> totally bankrupt of ideas as to how changes should be made and perhaps also bankrupt of the idea of their responsibility to have some regard to the democratic wishes of the people.  What is being done in regard to this amendment and the last one is, that the input from the electorate is simply being put aside and people other than the electorate are deciding and taking it upon themselves not to allow the electorate to speak.  As I said, even if the Minister was not going to allow them to stand, but we have the ignominy of allowing them to stand and getting the support of the people in their constituency.  We all know that that is not easy.  Everyone of us who has run for a popular election knows how difficult it is to get elected.  Nevertheless, the public will of the people will be thwarted here and now by leaving this in.  I think it is a bankruptcy of ideas.</P>

      <P>This is the last in our list of categories that the Minister is disqualifying. I think it comes back to the basic point we made: that there is a constitutional imperative on the Minister to ensure that nobody is disqualified except for the gravest of reasons.  As Senator Hederman says, there are types of bankruptcy other than financial bankruptcy. To actually have this particular category defined as a group who cannot become Members of the Dáil or, if they are Members, who must leave the Dáil, is far too serious an imposition, because bankruptcy can be discharged.  As Senator Upton said, it may be discharged by the members of a party in advance or if somebody happens to be a Dáil Member at the time.  The right of the people to elect whom they regard as best fitted to represent them, whoever that person may be, should be left and we should not be introducing categories here that for no valid reason interfere with that right.  I do not know what valid reason the Minister can give for this or for a number of the other disqualifications he has offered here.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (k) of section 41 provides that an undischarged bankrupt <Col N="321" /> is not eligible for election to or membership of the Dáil.  The paragraph proposes to re-enact existing law, which is contained in section 51 of the Electoral Act, 1923.  Amendment No. 58 proposes to delete paragraph (k) and thus remove the disqualification on grounds of bankruptcy. Disqualification on grounds of bankruptcy appears to be based on the view that a person who has been shown to be unable to conduct his own affairs in a satisfactory manner should not be entrusted with the conduct of the affairs of the country.</P>
      <P>The law of several of the EC member states declares bankrupt persons to be ineligible for election to the national Parliament &mdash; for example, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Luxembourg. In each of these countries, except the United Kingdom, bankrupts are also disqualified from voting.  Unlike the position in the case of the existing provision, there is provision in section 42 (3) for a period of grace of six months before the disqualification takes effect in the case of a sitting Member of the Dáil.  This provides an opportunity for a Member who is an adjudicated bankrupt to obtain a certificate of discharge under section 85, paragraph 7, of the Bankruptcy Act, 1988.  If a certificate of discharge is obtained within this six months period, the person does not cease to be a Member of the Dáil.  In this regard the provision of section 41 (k) is more flexible than the existing provision of the 1923 Act.  I think the provision of section 41 (k), taken in conjunction with section 42 (3), strikes the correct balance in relation to the disqualification of bankrupts and I think the amendment should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>The Minister has let us know that there is a six month period in which the bankruptcy can be discharged. That would seem to mean in effect that those parties which are well funded, which have wealthy supporters and which have the support of people with business connections and so on, would in most circumstances have the capacity to deal with and discharge a bankruptcy problem. That may not be the case in relation <Col N="322" /> to a Member of the Dáil who happens to be perhaps an independent or indeed a member of a small party whose supporters are not particularly well off.  I think that enters another note of discrimination, which is quite undesirable. As I say, that is just another reason why I would hope the Minister might accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the position in regard to offences such as bankruptcy, which back in 1923 had a certain connotation, changes as the years go by?  We seem to be sort of frozen in our thinking, and that just because that was the position in 1923, it has to be so again today.  Can we not have a little imagination and say you can become bankrupt through no fault of your own?  To give the reason that one could not conduct one's affairs in a satisactory manner is a long way from the truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>There are many aspects of bankruptcy and moral bankruptcy is perhaps more serious than financial bankruptcy, and financial bankruptcy is very much a relative thing.  You can be declared bankrupt and put into Stubbs for a very small amount of money which you may be unable to discharge, depending on your circumstances, whereas somebody else could be declared bankrupt for hundreds of thousands or millions of pounds and they might even be in a position to discharge it, depending on the circumstances of the company or their provision.  Again, the Minister makes no demarcation; it is just anybody who happens to be an undischarged bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the same as happened in relation to the previous amendment, where the Minister does not distinguish whether a sentence of imprisonment is for a criminal or for a civil offence.  In this case the Minister does not distinguish between a moral bankruptcy and a financial bankrupt; or, in the first instance, since he is referring here to financial bankruptcy, whether it is of a serious nature or of a minor nature.  It certainly would seem <Col N="323" /> strange to be adding this category in this context without some sensitivity or some regard for the seriousness of the bankruptcy; and no such regard is indicated in this particular provision.</P>

      <P>This is a minor technical amendment.  It simply seeks to define the appeal process more widely than it is defined in the Bill and also to define it somewhat more precisely than it is defined in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will be able to respond favourably to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">

      <P>Section 42 indicates the time in which the disqualifications referred to in section 41 takes effect in the case of a sitting Member of the Dáil. Subsection (2) requires the registrar of the court by which a disqualifying prison sentence is imposed or confirmed on appeal in the case of a sitting Member, to notify the Chairman of the Dáil on the expiry of the time allowed for appeal or on the determination of the appeal as may be appropriate.  Amendment No. 59 proposes that the reference to appeal in this section should include appeal by way <Col N="324" /> of case stated, proceeding by way of judicial review and appeal from an appeal.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the situation where a Member of the Dáil has been found guilty of a serious offence.  The offence must have been of a serious nature otherwise the sentence of imprisonment in excess of six months or of penal servitude would not have been imposed.  In fairness to the individual concerned who, after all, will have been duly elected as a Member of the Oireachtas, a period of grace is being allowed before the disqualification takes effect in order to allow an appeal to be lodged and dealt with.</P>
      <P>It seems only fair to do this before the person's career in public life and, possibly, his livelihood are cut off.  We cannot foresee what the circumstances might be in a particular case or, on the face of it, the Member concerned will have been convicted of a serious offence. His fitness and his capacity to represent his constituents and his discharge of his parliamentary functions will be seriously in question.</P>
      <P>While it is appropriate that he be given every reasonable opportunity to clear himself, the interests of the Oireachtas and of his constituents must also be taken into account.  It is doubtful if these interests would be best served by allowing the matter to drag on indefinitely.  It is proposed, therefore, that he or she would be allowed the normal period contemplated in rules of court for lodging an appeal.  On the conclusion of that period, unless otherwise directed by an appropriate court the disqualifying provision would take effect.</P>
      <P>As I have said we cannot foresee what the precise circumstances may be.  There may be good reasons he cannot lodge an appeal within the normal period allowed or that he should choose some other route available in law to have his conviction or sentence reviewed.  In that event, I understand it would be open to him to seek an order restraining the registrar of the appropriate court from notifying the Chairman of the Dáil under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> We know how zealous our courts are in regard to the rights of the individual and we can be confident that they would extend this protection to the individual in such circumstances.

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 38, subsection (1), to delete lines 23 and 24 and substitute &ldquo;as proposer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a minor technical amendment but it is one which can have very important implications.  It seeks to deal with the situation where a person may nominate himself as a candidate or, alternatively, the person may be nominated by another individual who proposes him or her but the proposer needs to be a person registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency for which he proposes to nominate the candidate.  I cannot see any necessity for the qualification here that the person who makes the nomination has to be a person registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency for which he proposes to nominate the candidate.  That is a minor technical point.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any difficulties arising from the deletion of that provision.  The fact that it is there could create alarming problems for somebody who might be a little slipshod about the way nominations are lodged.  That could be a particular problem in the city of Dublin where there are not very clear boundaries of county or boundaries between different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Terenure area of Dublin where I live, one side of Terenure Road is in <Col N="326" /> Dublin South-East and the other side is in Dublin South-Central.  It could very easily happen, if somebody was not particularly well informed about the procedures for being nominated, that a supporter of a candidate who lives across the road might think they were in the same constituency or be unaware of this technical point and could offer to look after or take care of someone's nomination.</P>
    <P>In the case of the major parties, I doubt if that would be a problem.  It would not be a problem in my case in as much as my director of elections has invariably been something of a wizard on these matters. However, it could be a difficulty for an Independent candidate contesting a Dáil seat who may not be aware of the technical side and would feel that somebody was doing him a favour by putting forward his nomination, going through the procedures, and then finding that because of this minor technicality the nomination was invalid.  There are precedents of people being debarred from contesting elections on minor technicalities. I understand that a Member of this House, who represented the National University of Ireland, at one stage missed the deadline for lodging his nomination.  These things can happen. This is a minor technical detail, which in a certain set of circumstances, could result in somebody being debarred from contesting an election.  That would be wholly undesirable.</P>
    <P>On the other side, I cannot see why that specification has to be included in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment and, to accept it.</P>

      <P>This amendment raises the question which I hope the Minister will address of people on the register of electors who are not eligible to vote in Dáil elections.  If this amendment were accepted it would then, by inference, state that a proposer could be an elector who was not permitted to vote in the election for which they had actually proposed the candidate.  For that reason and no other, I feel the amendment could not be carried, despite the suggestion that <Col N="327" /> it is of a technical nature.  It raises the fundamental question of people who are on the register, who can only vote in local elections or European elections, but are precluded under our Constitution from voting in Dáil elections.  Until that anomaly is addressed, this amendment would create enormous legal difficulties. Therefore, I am not be in favour of supporting it but I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>An interesting angle on the issue has been raised by Senator Mooney but I do not think it addresses the existing anomaly.  At a Dáil election a person may nominate themselves as a candidate whether they have been registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency for which they propose to nominate themselves.  There is no obligation on the candidate to be registered in the constituency but there is an obligation on anybody who may nominate them.  If a second party comes into the equation, that second party must be registered in the constituency and it would seem only reasonable that you would have the same criterion for anybody nominating somebody for election.  If you are entitled to nominate yourself you should be in the constituency; if somebody else nominates you they should be in the constituency.</P>
      <P>There is an inherent anomaly in this provision and all the Minister needs to do is to eliminate that anomaly.  We have suggested a way of doing that but the Minister may have a different way, it remains an anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 46 repeats without change the existing law in relation to the procedure for the nomination of candidates at a Dáil election.  Under subsection (1) a candidate may nominate himself or may with his consent be nominated by another person who is a registered elector for the relevant constituency.  Amendment No. 60 proposes to delete the requirement that a proposer of a candidate must be a registered Dáil elector for the constituency for which the nomination is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> The existing provision which subsection (1) re-enacts, has been in force since 1963.  Prior to the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1963, a person to be nominated as a candidate at a Dáil election required a proposer, a seconder and eight assentors, each of whom had to be a registered elector for the constituency concerned.  For a valid nomination the nomination paper had to be signed by ten registered electors for the constituency. The candidate himself also had to sign the paper and thus indicate his formal consent to the nomination.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Act, 1963, changed this provision to a requirement that a candidate simply nominates himself or is nominated by a proposer.  On the recommendation of the joint committee the requirement for ten signatures was removed.  At the same time the arrangement under which the candidates may be endorsed by political parties was introduced. Most candidates are in fact endorsed by political parties and this in itself is an indication that the candidate is serious and has some measure of support in the community.</P>
    <P>The requirement for the candidate's own signature on the nomination paper was also dropped in 1963.  The reason for this was that the period for nomination is rather short and an intending candidate might well not be available to sign the paper &mdash; for example, on account of illness or absence from the country.  As an alternative, therefore, the law provided that the nomination could be signed by one registered elector for the constituency.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to require that a proposer of a candidate at a Dáil election should be a registered Dáil elector for the constituency.  In the case where a candidate is nominated by a proposer the candidate is not required to attend in person at the ruling on nominations.  It seems reasonable that some minimum link be shown to exist between the proposer and the constituency.  The proposer could be nominating a candidate who is not residing in the constituency or even in the State.  The amendment, if accepted, would permit a person who may not even <Col N="329" /> be a citizen to nominate a person who has no link whatsoever with the constituency. This may be an extreme example, but I think it illustrates the desirability of maintaining the provision as drafted.  In reality the operation of this provision has given rise to no difficulties in practice and a serious candidate for election will have no difficulty in getting an elector in the constituency to propose him.  In fact, it is common practice for candidates to be nominated by a proposer even when there is no apparent necessity for it. Again, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no great disagreement with what the Minister said. What he said seems reasonable enough. However, the technical possibility exists in the example I have given.  In the case of a member of a small political party or an independent candidate who would not be particularly clued into the details of the election process, first of all, they might think that who proposed them was of significance.  They might be unaware of this provision and find subsequently that the proposer simply lived across the road from them and knew them well. Accordingly, they would be disqualified from contesting the election.  All the difficulties the Minister alluded to in relation to people from outside the State and people who know nothing about constituencies etc. are covered in the stipulation which says that the candidate has to consent to the proposal.  However, when it comes to frivolous candidates contesting elections just as a gimmick, that is not precluded by this stipulation here, because of course anyone who wants to be a frivolous candidate can simply nominate himself or herself and there are no restrictions in relation to whether or not that person is from the constituency, lives in the constituency or even knows where the constituency is.</P>

      <P>I am attempting to get clarification because the Minister did not address the point I made earlier.  If he is not addressing that point, I feel that this is a discriminatory measure as it currently <Col N="330" /> stands because it precludes those who are on the register of electors.  From the reply the Minister has given, it seems to me that the basis of this section is that there be a strong link between the proposer and the prospective candidate and that that link would be anchored in the constituency. I suggest to the Minister that this section as it stands has another anomaly in it in that it specifies Dáil electors and that there is a growing number of people on the register of electors in a constituency who are not entitled to vote in Dáil elections.  Is it now being suggested that they are not entitled to even propose somebody for election to the Dáil?  I would be grateful if the Minister would address that issue.  It is a discriminatory measure as it stands.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has addressed the central issues that Senator Mooney and myself have raised. Must it be a Dáil elector?  Is it the person registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency and why it should be restricted to a Dáil elector?  That could be interpreted as a form of discrimination against others who would be entitled to vote in other elections in the constituency.  The Minister referred to the option where a person nominates a candidate, but he has not referred to the person nominating himself or herself.  That is where the anomaly arises.  There is no requirement that the person who nominates himself or herself at a Dáil election is registered as a Dáil elector within the particular constituency.  It would make sense to have the same procedure operating for whoever does the nomination, whether it is the person concerned or whether it is a second person.  Secondly, we should seek to eliminate any anomaly in relation to those people on the register in the constituency and we should treat them all equally.</P>

The Minister is stating specifically that only a Dáil elector in the constituency can nominate a candidate.  I am asking why he cannot extend the nominating process to those who are on the electoral register.

      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 39, subsection (5), line 10, after &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or Independent' &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Of the amendments I have tabled this is the one about which I feel most strongly. I hope the Minister will give us not only a sympathetic hearing but that he will give us some encouraging response. I refer to the section which says that where a candidate is not the candidate of a political party he should be entitled to enter after his name on the nomination paper the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;, and if he does so the returning officer shall cause that statement to appear on the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>I am asking that after &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; should be inserted the expression &ldquo;or Independent.&rdquo;  I was originally of the opinion, that the Minister did not have the option of leaving it blank.  I thought I was reassured on that point but I now have serious doubts about it.  I would very much like the Minister to address that point.  In the section I have just read there is nothing there which indicates that one may do what is the custom at present, that an Independent can put either &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; or leave the space vacant. I know that section 88 (2) (b) says: &ldquo;the surname of each candidate and the name of his political party if any, or, if appropriate, the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; shall be printed in large capitals.  I believe that could be read, &ldquo;the name of his party or, if appropriate, the expression &ldquo;Non-Party,&rdquo; meaning that if he is not a member of a political party he, or she will then have &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the Second Schedule the form of a ballot paper is given and there is no candidate there who has a blank space after his name.  The name of the party is given or the term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;. That leads me to my original belief that a candidate will be obliged to enter the words &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  I want to speak as strongly as I can against the introduction of this new arrangement that Independents will have to call themselves <Col N="333" />&ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; if they want to have anything after their names.</P>
    <P>A different Minister was here when we debated this on Second Stage.  I would like to repeat that I find it extremely offensive when people, Catholics, and I am a Catholic, call other people non-Catholics. There is a suggestion we are all Catholics, we have all got the one true faith, and all others, whether they are Methodists, Presbyterians, Jews, Muslims are non-Catholic.  I have never used the expression and I find it quite offensive. I find it equally offensive that I might find myself in the situation where I have to call myself &ldquo;Non-Party,&rdquo; that is, of course, if I do not join a political party before the next election.</P>

      <P>This is a serious issue and I must keep it that way, the fact that we will be obliged to call ourselves &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to put himself in the shoes of people who are not members of political parties.  Are we soon going to arrive at a stage in this country where if you want to be a politician you will be obliged to be a member of a political party?  I mentioned the other day that it was interesting that an ENFO publication, which I produced on a previous occasion, stated: &ldquo;Why not join a political party?  Join a political party and do not be a hurler on the ditch.&rdquo;  Now we have all these bodies like ENFO apparently telling people to join political parties and not be hurlers on the ditch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that what is proposed in this section is a great insult and is an attack on the civil rights of those people who wish to call themselves Independent. Could the Minister imagine what it would be like?  It might sound absurd but this is <Col N="334" /> what he is asking us to do, can he imagine what it would be like if he was forced to put on the ballot paper after his name, non-Fine Gael, non-Labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody is laughing and I am happy to see that the Minister has a sense of humour as well.  I ask him to delete this section.  Certainly, it has not been my experience in this House that members of political parties have wanted to be unduly unfair to Independents.</P>
      <P>Even if we are allowed to put nothing in, I still think it is an insult.  My dictionary defines &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; as &ldquo;a politician who commits himself to no party; not relying on others, not subject to bias&rdquo;.  Another dictionary said, &ldquo;a politician who commits himself to no party; an Independent is somebody thinking or acting for oneself&rdquo;.  That fairly sums up what the Independent is, &ldquo;somebody thinking or acting for oneself&rdquo; and that it highlights the difference between the Independent who thinks and acts for himself or herself as opposed to the non Independent who does not think or act for himself or herself.  I put it to the Minister that it is a civil right to call yourself an Independent.  What are the members of the bench on which I sit? How do you refer to them everyday here in the Seanad?  Are we not known as the Independent group?  Does Senator Hanafin not now sit on the Independent bench?  Is that not where Fianna Fáil sent him when they threw him out of the party?  He happens to have joined the University Senators but he was sent to sit on the Independent bench.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few points to make.  I agree with Senator Hederman's amendment because the Minister proposes to define all candidates, other than those who are members of a political party as prescribed under previous sections in this legislation as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  That is a negative and unacceptable way of going about it.  Anybody whose name is on a ballot paper should at least expect to be described in positive terms.  An inherent problem with this provision is that they are described only in negative terms and I believe that can have an adverse effect on the electorate who might otherwise consider voting for a candidate.  It is a substantial issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are put forward as a candidate, but described on the ballot paper as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; you are being discriminated against as your credentials are not being <Col N="336" /> acknowledged and you could lose votes because of that description.  We should have not only a positive rather than a negative description of anybody putting himself forward for election but an accurate description.  People who stand as Independents do not want to be described as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;; they stand as Independents because they are independent minded.  That is not a negative but a positive and accurate way to describe them.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate we had a question about the status of a person putting himself forward to represent a cause for which he is well known.  The Minister would find it very difficult to find anybody, not a member of a political party, who describes himself as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; in his dealings with the community.  Usually he will describe himself as an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; or &ldquo;Community&rdquo; candidate.  It comes back to Senator Hederman's point, it is a question of the draftspeople and the legislators putting themselves in the position of those people, the people do not see candidates as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; but as people standing for something, and independence is a positive virtue.  Most of us are members of political parties but it is appropriate for somebody to stand as an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; and he should not be defined in terms of the political parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments already expressed by Senators Hederman and Costello.  I am beginning to wonder if the Minister comes from that school of political thinking which believes there is no such thing as an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; in Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be delighted to hear whether he does or does not.  Of course, language is important and Independent candidates invariably describe themselves as &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; in their literature. They might qualify that they never use the term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  I think they are being put at a considerable disadvantage. <Col N="337" /> People, particularly those who are not especially interested in politics, may look for &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; candidates on the ballot paper and this new description of &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; will come as a surprise to them.  They will not be familiar with that term because it will not have been used in the campaign, on election posters or literature and that will give rise to unnecessary confusion.</P>
      <P>I believe Independent candidates should be entitled to describe themselves as they see themselves, in other words, as Independent.  This negative description of non-party is inadequate and most Independents constantly seek to make a virtue of their independence.  Our colleagues behind us constantly harp on their independence, and they are quite entitled to do so.  It is an important feasture of Irish political life and an important part of the election process that you should have Independent candidates.  For that reason I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 45 repeats existing law in relation to nomination of candidates and enables a candidates to include the name of his political party on the nomination paper.  If the candidate is not a candidate of a registered party he may use the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or leave the relevant space blank.</P>
      <P>Section 88 which deals with the preparation of the ballot paper enables the name of the party or the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; to be shown on the ballot paper.  Amendments Nos. 61 and 85 propose to give the non-aligned candidate the additional option of using the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; on his nomination paper and on the ballot paper.  Under existing Dáil electoral law, repeated in section 46 where a candidate is not a member of a registered political party, he or she is entitled to enter on the nomination paper after his or her name the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; and under section 88, in the case of such candidates the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; is printed on all ballot papers and on election notices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress that the use of the description &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; is entirely <Col N="338" /> at the discretion of the candidate.  Any candidate who does not wish to use this description need not do so; the relevant space on the nomination paper and on the ballot paper may be left blank.  I consider the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; to be the most appropriate to describe a candidate who wishes to make it known that he or she is not a member of a registered political party.  It indicates briefly and clearly that the person does not belong to a registered party.  The amendment gives the non-aligned candidate three choices &mdash; to leave the space blank, or to use the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;.  I do not see the practical necessity for this range of choice and I suggest the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  Having reread the section I accept that one can leave the space blank.  May I make it quite clear however, that that is no way changes my wish to have this amendment accepted because the Minister is asking us to be either a negative or nothing; that is what it boils down to.</P>
      <P>At this stage I thank the Labour Party Senators for their support.  I appreciate that and it will encourage me in future to exclude the Labour Party from my unfavourable remarks about political parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I might even join you. The reality is that the Minister is allowing us to call ourselves &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or we can leave the space blank.  Perhaps a candidate wants to make it known that he is not a member of a party; perhaps he wants to be known as an Independent because he has a positive, independent, enlightened approach to legislation, to the running of the country, to all these issues, and he does not keep harping back to the past.  I very much regret the fact the Minister keeps saying this repeats the legislation we had back in 1920 or 1923. We are showing ourselves to be bereft of <Col N="339" /> ability to move with the times and to take an enlightened approach.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister and those who drafted this Bill look on those who are non-party and not members of political parties as some sort of eccentric cranks whom they want to downgrade. Let me say to the Minister and those party members who adopt that view, and continue to try to denigrate independents as eccentric hurlers on the ditch, or sitting on the fence &mdash; and that is what they try to subtly say in their ENFO publications &mdash; that people will rebel and are starting to rebel.  The reality is that we have now got a young, dynamic, educated electorate who are much better informed.  If the Minister insists on relegating everybody who is not in a political party to the status of a non-entity they will send a message back, as happened in the last local elections.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about that.  The parties are running scared at what is happening and are introducing these draconian measures.  This amendment which I have tabled is a specific attempt to move away from that situation.  I think the Minister, his party colleagues and all politicians, including myself, would be well advised to consider the mood of the electorate and to look at how they are reacting to the way they are being treated by politicians.  They have made it quite clear they do not like it and do not like being treated as imbeciles.  I feel strongly about the other amendments but I feel extremely strongly about this one.  May I ask the Minister if he wishes to be antidemocratic in the way he is treating the independent candidates?</P>

      <P>If this amendment were to be accepted and if a candidate was to be entitled to enter on the ballot paper the description &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after his name and at some stage in the future a political party applied and were successful in registering as &ldquo;The Independent Party&rdquo;, candidates from that party would be entitled to use &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after their name.  We would have a situation where non-party candidates <Col N="340" /> would also be entitled to use &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after their name.  If that situation were to arise we could finish up in a very serious difficulty.  For that reason I would be opposed to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of taking this amendment on board.  I do not see why there should be a major difficulty with having the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; included after &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;.  We have very many fine independent politicians in this House, in the Dáil and in the county councils throughout the country.  I do not see where there can be any great difficulty in having the words &ldquo;Independent, non-party&rdquo; included after the name of a candidate who does not belong to any of the major political parties.  I would ask the Minister to examine this matter and come back to us on Report Stage.  Hopefully he would then be able to take this amendment on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear the Minister's reply and even though Senator Mullooly's point is valid, and one that I support, I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Hederman's position.  I was trying to establish how this term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; came about.  If my memory serves me right &mdash; and perhaps the Minister may be advised on this &mdash; a law was introduced in this country for the registration of political parties within the last 20 years.  Up to that time there had been a more flexible arrangement about how candidates described themselves.  I am not too sure about this &mdash; and perhaps I should not mention it &mdash; but I remember there may have been an attempt to encourage parties with subversive tendencies involved in the political arena to register and come into the mainstream democratic process. This was one of the reasons the Government of the day introduced legislation for formal registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that legislation was being drafted this strange, nebulous, alien term was introduced by a bureaucrat.  Somebody somewhere sitting around said &ldquo;We have to come up with a term to describe those <Col N="341" /> candidates who are not members of a political party and why not use the term &lsquo;Non-Party&rsquo;?&rdquo;  It is not in common usage. I always felt those who said that the law is an ass had a certain amount going for them because in much legislation, legal jargon takes over and it sometimes ignores common usage.</P>
    <P>As Senator Naughten pointed out and as Senator Hederman in a very forceful defence of her amendment said, the term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is widely used.  The electorate readily identify with it and they are not at all confused by it.  In another forum I would describe the Minister's reply as &ldquo;cute&rdquo;.  It was very clever in that it skirted the issues and did not address the actual term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;, which seems to draw the ire of those proposing the amendment.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear.  I am not taking a principled stand on this, but merely expressing this view because I feel the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman might look again at the term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; because of the hostility it generates on occasions on the Independent benches.  It is a term in common usage around the country and would not, in my opinion, confuse the electorate or create any extra difficulties.  The Minister said in his reply that candidates may opt to leave the space blank or describe themselves as &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;.  I also appreciate the Minister's point that by adding a third option we would create difficulties of one sort or another.  I felt that answer did not address the central problem, which is the use of the term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  To put it in a sentence perhaps the Minister could come up with some other term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important amendment and I ask the Chair to bear with us while teasing it out a little further, particularly since Members on all sides of the House have come in with <Col N="342" /> expressions of concern about the wording that is proposed here.</P>
      <P>Senator Hederman put it excellently when she described the Minister's proposed description of &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; as &ldquo;negative or nothing&rdquo;.  That is a beautiful way of describing it.  In other words, after your name you can have a blank or use the term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; but you cannot express yourself in a positive fashion on the ballot paper.  That is not good enough.  The Minister said there are two options, but why not a third?  What is the major obstacle to having the third option which would be the term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; which is requested by Senator Hederman? If we can choose to leave it blank or use the term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;, why not have the third option of &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister why it is not possible to incorporate this into the provisions of the legislation.  It is damaging to the prospects of a candidate if they are described as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or if there is a blank.  There is something inadequate about this description which could endanger their prospects of being elected.  I am not sure I accept Senator Mullooly's point that a party could be known as the &ldquo;Independent Party&rdquo;. However if a party is known as the &ldquo;Independent Party&rdquo; then so be it.  We have &ldquo;Independent Fianna Fáil&rdquo; in Donegal.  I am sure other parties also have those who attach &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; to the party name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and we have an &ldquo;Independent Fianna Fáil&rdquo; Senator on this side of the House who has been expelled from the bosom of the great party but still regards himself as Independent Fianna Fáil, even though he is an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;.  The Minister is proposing to establish a category knows as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;, whereas everybody else is described as a member of a specific party. We have the generic term &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;; imagine if you were going forward before the electorate and were described simply as &ldquo;Party&rdquo; without the <Col N="343" /> specific party to which you belong being mentioned because all others were &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;. The generic term is &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; but on the ballot paper you have the benefit of being known to belong to a particular party and that is why you get the votes.  If you had been described simply as &ldquo;Party&rdquo; that would not necessarily mean that you would get all the Fianna Fáil votes that you get when you are described as a Fianna Fáil candidate. Clearly it is, discriminatory to describe one group in a generic term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; and others as belonging to a specific political party.  It is not an accurate description. I think we should ensure the registrar can satisfy himself that the description is an accurate one.  Somebody should be able to describe himself as an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; as long as the registrar is satisfied that is an accurate description.  I do not see the advantages of saying that everybody who is not a member of a political party should be described as &ldquo;Non-Party.  I cannot see the reason the Minister describes what we are proposing as being a loose form.  It is not a loose form, it is accurate as it is defining the candidate by the work he is doing for which he is standing for election.  I urge the Minister at least to consider this amendment again and come back to us on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Let me reply to Senator Mullooly's very quick thinking in suggesting the problems that would be created if an &ldquo;Independent Party&rdquo; was formed.  Having seen what the Minister proposed and being worried lest it would go through, I hope now that with both sides of the House supporting this amendment the Minister will be influenced and at least agree to take this away and to come back to us on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already looked at the possibility of forming an &ldquo;Independent Party&rdquo; out of the sheer frustration of thinking that we may be labelled from now on as &ldquo;non-persons&rdquo;, &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  It is a most offensive thing to call a person &ldquo;a non-person&rdquo;. That is exactly what we are being asked to accept.  If Senator Mullooly <Col N="344" /> looks at section 25, the registration of political parties, he will find it is quite difficult to register as a political party and that it is not likely the registrar would accept the name &ldquo;Independent Party&rdquo;&mdash; although that is still something that has to be decided.  Senator Mullooly's objection does not stand because somebody could just as easily go to the registrar and ask to form a party called the &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; party.  Where would we be then?  What will we do if somebody goes and says he wants to call his party the &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; party?</P>

Senator Costello is not naive &mdash; he knows that is precisely the reason this is being put in so as to make it as difficult as possible for us.  I will be seriously seeking to challenge whether this can be put through.  Senator Costello made a very good point: why not have a bit of equality and describe candidates as just &lsquo;Party&rsquo; or &lsquo;Non-Party&rsquo; That would be a very fair description.  If the Minister is prepared to accept that candidates from all parties will go under the term &ldquo;Party&rdquo; I will be very happy to accept that the Independents go under the term of &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;. I think the Minister will have to accept that I am going as far as I possibly can to meet him.</P>
      <P>There is one other point, but I am a bit reluctant to say this.  Perhaps I will wait and see if there is any give on the Minister's side, but will I be allowed to come back once more with one other quick suggestion?</P>

      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; should certainly be allowed because it is a downgrading to persons to have them described exclusively as &lsquo;Non-Party&rsquo; and not give them the option of being described as &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;. Without going into all the points that have been made already, I very strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment put forward by Senator Hederman on this point because it is not common sense to exclude the use of the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; in this matter.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1963 the name of a political party could not be included on the ballot paper.  There was a polite fiction that each candidate was contesting the election as an individual.  The Electoral Act, 1963, recognised the reality that most people vote on a party basis.  It introduced a system for registration of parties.  Candidates who wished to contest as individuals or did not wish to register their supporting organisation as a political party could describe themselves as &lsquo;Non-Party&rsquo; or leave the space blank. The present section continues this arrangement without change.  The arrangement has worked reasonably well for almost 30 years and there are no grounds for change at this stage.  The expression &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; is neutral and its meaning is quite plain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">

      <P>It indicates that a candidate is not a candidate of a registered political party.  It is a simple statement of fact, like non-smoker, non-drinker, non-runner, non-racial, non-fiction, nongovernmental and non-political.  I do not see now any hidden meaning or implication can be taken out of it; nor do I believe that non-aligned candidates in general dislike the expression or finding anything objectionable about it.  In the 1989 General Election 29 candidates opted for to use the expression &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; while only 13 candidates decided to leave the space blank.  If there was strong dislike of the expression one would expect the numbers to be the other way around.</P>
      <P>Regarding the reference to non-Catholic, that expression can sometimes cause offence because it tends to be applied to persons who are Catholics, perhaps Anglican Catholics.  The word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; has several meanings and unlike &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;, is not neutral.  It carries the strong implication that persons who are not described as independent must be somehow less free, less self-reliant or have less initiative.  Some non-aligned candidates would like to use it because it is a political claim, a form of advertising.  In effect, the word constitutes the type of political reference that section 52 is designed to deal with.  I have no objection to candidates stating their political position, but it should be done in the straightforward way laid down by electoral law.</P>
      <P>There is also the possibility that at some stage a group may decide to seek registration as a political party under the title &ldquo;Independent Party&rdquo; or some variation of that title.  This is not an uncommon name for a political party; a party of this name regularly nominates candidates at presidential elections in the USA and there was once an Independent Party in Northern Ireland.  For good reasons I am not able to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The core of this issue goes back to the fact enunciated by Senator Hederman that there are votes involved. The term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; is a less useful <Col N="347" /> term after one's name on a ballot paper than the term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; has all sorts of connotations suggesting that those politicians are unable to make up their mind or unable to figure out where they stand politically, whereas the term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; states their position positively, indicating that they are not dependent on anyone and may make up their own minds on any issue.  There are limitations to that position, but it is a choice which the public should be left in no doubt about.</P>
      <P>The other side of the argument is that people do not describe themselves as &ldquo;Non-Party.&rdquo;  They describe themselves as &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; because they recognise that it attracts votes.  There is a significant minority of Independent representatives in this country, many of whom have been elected to local authorities; and those of us who are non-university and not appointed by the Taoiseach are conscious of staying on the right side of the electorate at election time.</P>
      <P>Much attention is paid to independent councillors throughout the country by people on all sides of the House.  The &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; vote at local elections amounts to about 10 per cent, if not more.  That is a significant minority of people who are discriminated against by the use of &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  If one refuses to describe oneself in negative terms, the alternative is to describe oneself as nothing at all &mdash; to leave a blank &mdash; with the implication that one has nothing to say about one's political position.  Those choices are not fair.  It should be possible to continue using the present political terminology.  The term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is widely used and I can see no reason why it should not be put on the ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not showing any flexibility here.  It seems that he shows flexibility about trivia and concedes unimportant points to create an impression of openhandedness but he has stood firm on all amendments proposing significant improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was clever of the Minister to mention <Col N="348" /> non-smokers and non-drinkers.  May I ask the Minister to name the opposite of a non-drinker?  It is a drinker.  Not a vodka drinker or a gin drinker but a drinker.  The opposite of non-party would be party, but the Minister is not prepared to countenance that.  The opposite of non-smoker is smoker.  One does not define a smoker as a Carrolls' smoker or a Virgina Sweet Afton smoker.</P>
    <P>The Minister by his analogy has made the case for us.  If there is to be discrimination between smoker/non-smoker, drinker/non-drinker I am happy with that.  Similarly we will have non-party/party but we will not have non-party/Fianna Fáil Party in the same way as we will not have non-drinker/gin drinker.</P>
    <P>May I also say to the Minister that until 1963 no party was mentioned on all ballot paper and that is now it should be.  The Minister went on to say that it is accepted that people vote on a party basis.  Who accepted that?  The political parties did, but they may get a surprise when they find that because of this approach some people will vote for anybody except somebody with a political party affiliation. I appreciate the flexibility shown here this morning by some Members.</P>
    <P>The Minister also suggested that the present system should continue, because it has worked reasonably well for 30 years.  For whom has it worked well?  The party people?  The thrust of this debate is to allow political parties to feather their own nests by making sure, as Senator Costello said, that Independents are obliged to use a negative terminology or no terminology after their name and thereby lose votes.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Minister perfectly but I think he said that in 1989 13 candidates left it blank and 29 put Non-Party. Those 29 people may well have been strong party people who did not get a nomination, but that is not what Independents are.  There is a chasm of difference between a party person who has not succeeded in getting a nomination and who opts to stand as non-party and an Independent candidate of no party affiliation.  Non-party is perfectly acceptable <Col N="349" /> and probably described those people accurately.  Non-party people wanted a party nomination but could not get one. That is not what Independents are, and I put it to the Minister that the 13 people who left a blank were genuine Independents. The Minister went on to say that using &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; would be a political claim or even an advertisement. What does he think the words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; means on a ballot paper?  Is that not an advertisement?  How can the Minister say it is all right to advertise if one is in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party or the Progressive Democrats but if one is an Independent one is penalised?  Finally, the Minister's Government had no hesitation in making the best deal possible with independent Tony Gregory.  Independents can be useful on occasion and the Government may need their support again.  I ask the Minister and everybody here to bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with this amendment and I do not accept that a major problem would be caused by inserting the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  I say that for two reasons. First, it would express a political reality since the formation on the State.  We have Independent candidates.  I support Senator Upton's point that there is something positive about the word &ldquo;Independent while the &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; tag is somewhat negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians whether at local or national level serve the people and some of the most distinguished performers, whether in council chambers or in either of the two Chambers of this House have been Independent candidates during part or all of their career.  Many distinguished people have used that term with pride to distinguish their political viewpoint.  The term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is understood by the Irish electorate and has more general acceptance than &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  Quite frankly, I have problems with the term &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;; I have none with &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; but for the sake of progress I would accept both.  I appeal to the Minister for the reasons well advanced by my <Col N="350" /> colleagues to reconsider his view on this matter.</P>

      <P>It is important to realise that our democracy is based on the party political system.  We should tease out this amendment to its logical conclusion when we may encounter differences of opinion among Independents or Non-Party candidates or whatever they are called. According to the party political system a candidate's political party is inserted after his or her name.  That description indicates their general ideology on various matters because parties adopt specific policy stands on recurring issues. That description does not apply to Non-Party or Independent candidates.  Three people may have &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after their names but might hold totally different views.  That contradicts Senator Upton's point.  One of those Independent candidates could object to being described by the same word as another Independent candidate.  That may be the case already because I notice the Independent Members are not here in force to support this amendment.  Senator Hederman is here on her own.</P>

Senator Hederman might be delighted at some time in the future to say that she was Non-Party because if &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; were down after every Non-Party person she might find that situation objectionable.  It might be in Senator Hederman's better interest to keep her independence of viewpoint by being Non-Party &mdash; if that is what she wants to be &mdash; rather than tied up in a lobby of Independents with differing views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran made a point about differing opinions and the accuracy of the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;. That is a moot point but I would argue it the other way.  We are trying to be more accurate with descriptions and a Non-Party <Col N="351" /> categorisation is a far from accurate description of anybody.  &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; are known as such in the community. The word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is an accurate description of their political position, and we are concerned with providing an accurate definition and description of electoral candidate.</P>
      <P>Non-party does not indicate anything; it is a category, a generic term that embraces all those who do not belong to any party and, therefore, must be inadequate.  We are trying to improve on that.  The Minister said that until 1963 &mdash; something I did not know &mdash; there were no political parties mentioned on the ballot paper, a fair situation because nobody was discriminated against. However in 1963 it was decided that that was inadequate; it afforded a categorisation but not a description and steps were taken to add the name of the political party.  That was a step forward and we should now take a further step forward in the interests of accuracy and appropriate description.</P>
      <P>They said that in 1989 29 people allowed themselves be described as Non-Party whereas nobody chose to put nothing in the place reserved for party name.  Two poor options are available to candidates and they may choose the devil or the deep blue sea.  Candidates went for the negative rather than for a blank; their choice was blank or negative &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;. If a positive option were included people would no longer opt for &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My strongest reason for supporting Senator Hederman's argument is that we have obtained an improvement on the 1963 legislation that sought to define and to describe each political party under the general categorisation of political parties. We now have a specification which has led to a fairly accurate description.  That is why we may vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or others.  We should not throw all other candidates into a Non-Party negative category.  We should distinguish them by the title those people are known by in the community and that is Independent.  I urge the Minister to <Col N="352" /> take that on board and to come bank with a third option of &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;.  If somebody wishes to leave it blank good and well; if somebody wishes to use &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; good and well, if somebody wishes to be &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; good and well.</P>

      <P>I ask Senator Finneran not to provoke me again in that manner.  Senator Finneran said that democracy in this country is based on the party political system.  I would like to remind the Senator that there is no mention in our Constitution of political parties and they are of a certain insignificance since they are not mentioned in the Constitution.  Senator Finneran said that political parties had general ideologies, and I accept that parties <Col N="353" /> hold specific views on various subjects.</P>
      <P>The same applies to a candidate.  A candidate has a general ideology but when a person votes for a Fianna Fáil candidate, such as Joe Soap, they have no way of knowing what Joe Soap's beliefs or ideas are because they have been subsumed under the title of the political party.  Senator Finneran is not helping the Minister's side by saying that a party has an ideology; an Independent candidate also has an ideology and that is what they are putting forward to the people and asking to be elected on.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran's remarks about Independent candidates not being of the same mind applies also if they are obliged to call themselves &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  Perhaps Senator Finneran was not here when I said that an Independent, according to the dictionary, is a politician who does not commit himself to any party but reserves the right to think and act for himself.  That is the word we want because it sums up our position perfectly.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their interest in this amendments and for their support. If the Minister is not prepared to take this on board, or to consider it and come back with some suggestions on Report Stage, I appeal to those Senators who have given support, and in some instances qualified support, to show their independence on this occasion by putting their feet where their mouths were a little while ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly it seems that the Minister is going to keep to his stonewalling attitude and I find that distressing.  Questions raised by Senators on all sides have not yet been answered and the Minister adopts a position of saving no more when he is unable to give satisfactory valid answers. The Minister said it would be complicated to have three options &mdash; Non-Party, Independent and a blank space.  I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with all those who put their names to my amendment, but could the Minister consider dropping Non-Party and retaining a choice of blank or Independent? Would that allay the Minister's fear of confusing the electorate with three different <Col N="354" /> descriptions?  That would give a more accurate assessment to the electorate so that people might know who they are voting for.  The Minister might contemplate that course of action and come back with suggestions along those lines on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; is not a specification either, so the logic would be to leave the two categories of &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; but while that would be logical, it would not be accurate.  In 1963 an attempt was made to improve the description by allowing individual party names to go forward, so we should not leave the Non-Party categorisation unchanged and Non-Party is not specific enough.  One side has been improved but not the other.  The terminology is inaccurate and it is wrong to be specific in relation to Members of political parties, and on the other hand, to lump all those who are not, under the negative umbrella <Col N="355" /> of Non-Party.  That does not do them justice and it would be improper for us to leave this provision in the legislation. It is an instance of blatant discrimination and the least the Minister can do is to take one of the options he has been offered, namely, a choice of blank, Non-Party and Independent or the option suggested by Senator Hederman of blank or Independent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 62:</P>
      <P>In page 39, subsection (1), line 28, after &ldquo;officer&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a petition of nomination signed by one thousand electors, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to allow people to be nominated for election by means of having their nomination paper signed by 1,000 electors.  Earlier in this debate the Minister has from time to time drawn attention to the practices which exist in other European countries, in support of both the arguments he has made in favour of retaining parts of the Bill and those which he has used by way of opposition to amendments.</P>

      <P>Excuse me, Senator.  May I point out that amendments Nos. 62, 63, 64 and 65 are related and all may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>That opens up the discussion quite significantly.  As I was saying, the Minister in the course of his interventions in the debate has made reference to practices in other European countries.  I would like to do so in support of amendment No. 62.  According to information supplied to the House of Commons in 1985, Belgium, Denmark, West Germany and Italy do not require candidates to lodge a deposit but instead they can support and validate their nominations by means of a signature system requiring up to 700 electors to support their candidature.  We are proposing that, if 1,000 electors sign a nomination in support of a candidate, that should be sufficient.  Alternatively, in amendment No. 63, we are suggesting that the nomination deposit of £500, which has to be lodged, should be reduced to £100.  We have put in a provision whereby if people who are unemployed want to contest an election, the deposit should be waived entirely in their case.  In addition we are proposing that subsection (2) should be deleted to maintain consistency.  We are also opposed to the section.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to the business of people being required to make deposits.  I have in front of me an article written by Richard Humphreys in which he cites the opinion of the late Professor John Kelly in his book on the Constitution.  In the course of that opinion Professor Kelly argued that it may be unconstitutional to require someone to lodge a deposit in support of their nomination.  It may be in conflict with the Constitution and essentially invalid. There has also been a judgment from Mr. Justice O'Higgins in 1984 which again seems to suggest that it might be unconstitutional to require candidates to lodge a deposit in support of their nomination in order that it may be validated.  When the Constitution, in article 16.7, states that elections &ldquo;shall be regulated in accordance with law&rdquo; what is involved, according to the late Professor Kelly, is the matter of elections, not the matter of somebody's candidature for that election. This is a very important opinion.  It is the opinion of a very distinguished constitutional lawyer.  There appears to have been some support for that opinion expressed by Mr. Justice O'Higgins in this case in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conflict with those opinions, first, is the question of having to deposit even £100, which is relatively small.  Raising that deposit to £500 is a very significant burden for many candidates in elections. It is also consistent with the thinking processes <Col N="359" /> and the behaviour of persons such as Mrs. Thatcher, who in the course of her administration in Britain introduced similar provisions in the Representation of The People Act, 1985, where the deposit was increased from £150, a level which was set in 1918, to £500.  I just wonder if the old Thatcherite virus has blown across the Irish Sea and infected the body politic on this side of the water. No doubt it has.  I am wondering if the extent of the infection is so great that it has reduced the Government to direct transcription almost, a sort of a cloning of Thatcherite thinking.  There are, of course, lots of other exhibitions of Thatcherite thinking in the country, but that is a somewhat distasteful example of it.</P>
    <P>Some of the major political parties have loads of money &mdash; some of which has been subscribed by these people who have now taken to unburdening their souls, in relation to their subscription patterns, at the Beef Tribunal.  Certainly, £75,000 would supply the deposits for an awful lot of candidates.  It would not be a burden to parties that can get that type of money through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that level of subscription, would be a kind of speculation to see how much would be retained, as a kind of inverted form of the lottery, seeing how much you lose in deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For small parties and for Independents who would like to contest elections on separate issues, or indeed who would find the cost of contesting elections a considerable burden anyway, the fact that they must put at risk an additional £500 is a very serious burden.  It is a very serious burden on people who would probably have a reasonable chance of losing their deposit.  That certainly would <Col N="360" /> discourage quite a number of people from smaller parties from going forward to contest elections.  It will certainly be another imposition on Independents who do not have a political organisation behind them and, indeed, for the most part, do not have access to significant funds.  Accordingly, the fact that they will have to put £500 down as a deposit will certainly discourage them from standing and presenting their case to the public.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept some of these amendments.  There is considerable doubt as to whether the provision that my deposit should be required to be lodged is in accord with the Constitution.  There are two opinions which clearly suggest that that may not be the case.  There is no point in risking somebody taking a constitutional action and the whole process being turned on its head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will not find the Minister as intransigent in his opposition to this amendment as we did to the last one, which I greatly regret. Here we have another serious and quite fundamental attack on both Independents and members of the smaller parties who want to go forward for election. There are a substantial number of points to be made, some of which have been made by Senator Upton, but the others I hope to cover in my contribution. One of the things which strikes me is that the Minister is always happy, and has been happy this morning, to quote for us what happened back in 1920 or 1963 or whenever.  It has all been grand from that date to this, and therefore we should take that as a very good reason for continuing things as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement when he came into the House indicated that the deposit was set at £100 right back in 1923. I would like to give the Minister some of his own arguments and say, well, if it was grand in 1923 why not just leave well enough alone.  It should not be changed. In this one, of course, the Minister switches his argument and very conveniently says, no, it has been at that level since 1923 but now we are going to change it, <Col N="361" /> because it will suit his purposes and that of his party.</P>
    <P>The value of money has changed, but a great many other factors have changed also.  This is what we should bear in mind. This morning the Minister seemed to be totally frozen in 1923, or whenever the first legislation was brought in.  I do not believe that in those days the three line whip worked in the way it works now or that there was the very substantial lack of accountability which operates now, when in many instances politicians in those parties can get out of their commitments by just saying, there is a three line whip and that is that.  Also, what has changed dramatically is the extent to which party politicians have taken over control of everything in this country, from the Presidency to the Dáil, to the Seanad, to the local councils of every kind.  It is a part of their all pervasive presence.  They have infiltrated everywhere, even down into residents' associations and community groups, which were a marvellous manifestation at one stage of a new flowering. They, of course, in turn were taken over, because the political parties thought they had power in them.  I remember when we were discussing Second Stage that a Member on the Opposition benches said that only party candidates should stand. It is not a big step from that to saying that only candidates from one party should stand, as happened not too long ago in the USSR and other places.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing another anti-democratic measure in what he is proposing here.  I have said consistently, since I started to speak on this Bill, that democracy should encourage people to go forward and stand.  If we believe in democracy we should not try to push them to the side or make it difficult for them.  Sad to say, from what I have heard this morning I do not believe that those who brought in this Bill really want or believe in true democracy.  There is nothing more anti-democratic than to jack up the deposit to £500, which is undoubtedly a large sum of money for a lot of people.  As Senator Upton said, it may only be a drop in the ocean to a major political party who are able to get <Col N="362" /> funds from all over the place, because they have very slick party machines to gather in money at a great rate, but I am telling the Minister it is a great deal of money to people who would have every right to stand.  Democracy should encourage people to stand and then let the electorate decide.  This morning we saw the position with regard to the prisons.  Even if declared elected, prisoners cannot become Members of the Dáil.  It is up to the electorate to decide.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an example from my recent experience.  Sadhbh O'Neill stood for the Green Party in Dublin City Council.  She is a student.  She never knocked at one door.  She did nothing that the normal politician might be expected to do when they go around canvassing. People said it was very irresponsible of this girl to go forward and then to go swanning off to America.  In fact, she went off to America to do a course on environmental matters, and more power to her.  But what happened to her?  When she was away in America, never having knocked at a door, she was elected to Dublin City Council.  I am quite satisfied that she would have been a typical example of what the Minister and those who designed this Bill had in mind.  She would have been considered a frivolous or vexatious candidate.  That is what people called her.  They did not like it one bit when they saw that she got elected.  Of course, 20 years ago most people did not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;.  Times move on.  Everybody seems to move on, except the Minister and those who have compiled this Bill.  They want a situation where they can make it difficult for people to stand for election.  I bitterly regret that and resent it.</P>
    <P>Political commentators and others are amazed that there is such a low poll in many elections.  Is it all that surprising? There are only uninspiring, boring candidates, who are all a long time in the political party.  If an election was livened up a little bit by new fresh candidates it would be better.  I am not saying that they are going to be anyway flippant, but there is nothing wrong with adding a little <Col N="363" /> colour to an election rather than having it dull, bring and colourless.  I do not equate that with seriousness.  This is a most regrettable development.  If the Minister wants a deterrent, he is not going to deter crackpots by this measure. By this measure the Minister is deterring poor crackpots, but he is not deterring wealthy crackpots.  They can just as well go.  This is all a matter of whether one is wealthy or poor.  That is the Minister's idea.  He talks about freezing out frivolous candidates.  Who is the Minister or anybody in this room or in this Chamber or the other Chamber to decide what is a frivolous or a vexatious candidate?  I have given an example already of Sadhbh O'Neill.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the purpose of a general election is to determine the Government which the country will have for the next five years.  I accept that.  It is also important that we elect people who are going to form the Opposition.  I do not see that everybody in the Opposition has to be from one of the big, powerful parties, or to be someone who has a lot of money behind him.  People excluded by this measure might become very good and worthwhile members of the Opposition. Nobody should be deterred from standing because of money.  The Minister and those who drew up his Bill know very well that there is a change.  We have seen a change, both at the last local elections and elsewhere.  We saw people like the Roscommon Hospital candidate and the Cavan Potholers candidates.  These people run and may be elected out of a deep frustration.  They have no other way of expressing their views or of having their wishes brought to the attention of the powerful and those who are in a position to do something about them.  There will be more and more of them.  That is why the Minister wants to bring in this undemocratic measure.  He knows that they are coming; he can see it.  He wants to try to do what he can to make sure that it is as difficult as possible for them.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear the Minister's reply to the suggestion made by the Labour-Party that we should have <Col N="364" /> one thousand signatures.  Why does he not think that is an adequate method?  It should be obligatory to pay £500 or get the 1,000 signatures.  That is a very good amendment.  When I was looking for a nomination to run for the Presidency &mdash; I make no bones about it, I am not ashamed about it, I feel it is my entitlement as a citizen of Ireland to seek a nomination to stand for the Presidency &mdash; I was not able to get a nomination. There are not 20 non-party Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Progressive Democrats &mdash; I hope they will be here to support this amendment &mdash; put a recommendation into one of their Programmes for Government that for the Presidency it should be possible to get 20,000 signatures.  I got 20,000 signatures but I still did not get a nomination.  If they suggest that a candidate can go forward for the Presidency with 20,000 signatures I do not see why, on a matter of principle, they would not support this amendment where we are looking for only 1,000 signatures.  I do not mind if it is 2,000 signatures.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points.  I hope the next step will not be that, having introduced £500 to determine frivolous or vexatious candidates, the Minister will start introducing a £100 deposit fee for the electoral franchise to deter frivolous or vexatious voters.  I know that sounds ridiculous now, but what the Minister is proposing is, in my view, equally ridiculous and unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made against the proposed increase in the deposit fee.  The Government would be well advised in the first instance to consider whether the proposed increase is not unconstitutional.  In fact, as Richard Humphreys suggests in his article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> to which Senator Upton referred, we must consider whether the idea of a deposit is not in itself unconstitutional. Article 16 of the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to stand for election.  It says nothing about their property qualifications or what they have in the bank and that is essentially what it is.  It is a residual link between property <Col N="365" /> and franchise.  There is still a lingering attempt to suggest that one is not entirely respectable unless one can cough up a few quid in support of that electoral ambition.</P>
      <P>It was the Minister who, on another section of this Bill, objected to the amendment extending the franchise to emigrants.  I made a substantial contribution against the idea of votes for emigrants as a result of which, I am informed, I am being lambasted all over the United States.  It was the Minister who added the most fundamental reason to my arguments, namely, that the proposal might well be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the idea of a deposit might well be unconstitutional as Richard Humphreys argued in that article.  As Senator Hederman said, who is the Minister &mdash; and I do not mean this in a personal sense &mdash; to decide on or talk about frivolous candidates?  There is a high quota of frivolous candidates in both Houses who are not short of a few bob, but that did not deter them from getting there.  I, like Senator Hederman, think democracy is large and tolerant enough to wear the idea of frivolous candidates who manage to get through the system. If there is a Monster Raving Loony Party it adds colour without threatening the fabric of democracy.  Mr. Humphreys in his article pointed out that in the change in Britain in this regard, which we have slavishly imitated as the late John Kelly would remind us, there has been a real prospect of a threat from the National Front and a resurgence of racism, but there is no evidence that there is any threat of that kind here.  There would seem to be no reason to back up this claim to discourage frivolous candidates, which was suggested in the memorandum. It is partly the idea that there is a link between respectability and a few pound.  It is partly a kind of patronising supercilious, po-faced attitude which makes us all wear collars and ties and think people who do not do so are slightly suspect.  I am giving a point there to Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea that frivolous candidates should be discouraged is a paternalistic <Col N="366" /> and snobbish attitude.  I rather like the frivolous candidates.  I was in Canada when there was an election.  There was a party there which greatly added to the colour and liveliness of the occasion by having policies such as &ldquo;Slowing the arms race to a Walk&rdquo; and proposing to &ldquo;paint the three mile limit with the national colours so that the fish would know to stay inside&rdquo; and so on.  This does no harm to anybody.  It is not a serious threat to democracy.  I distrust the supervisory, paternalistic mentality behind this proposal.</P>
    <P>I think it is a cynical and cruel exercise to promote joke candidates.  Such a candidate can be pushed forward by people in a cynical spirit, perhaps to win a bet or simply to have a bit of fun at the expense of some poor person who is not intellectually equipped to know what is going on.  There is no question of money there or of raising the deposit.  The Minister knows what I am talking about here. If there had been a greatly increased deposit in a local election in a certain southern city about seven years ago, it would not have discouraged the running of a certain candidate, whose canditature in my view was a cruel and cynical exercise. Raising the deposit will not stop that kind of thing.  We have to accept again that this is part of the electoral procedure and democracy.</P>
    <P>This is heavyweight stuff.  This is using a steamroller to crush nuts &mdash; I am not unintentionally punning.  As for the stated intent behind the provision, namely, that frivolous candidates will confuse the electorate, we have more paternalism here.  The electorate must not be confused at any cost because, of course, they have a limited capacity to think for themselves, and we know better, do we not?  This is the old mentality again.  The kind of mind behind this section would prefer that there was no electorate and that the job could be done without them.  As some academics say &ldquo;would the university not be a great place if there were no students?&rdquo;  I imagine there are certain politicians and public servants who would say: &ldquo;would there <Col N="367" /> not be a great Ireland, if we had no people and no electorate?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to listen to us on this point to respond in the same generous spirit which the Government have already shown in section 167, dealing with opinon polls, which, it has acknowledged was arguably unconstitutional and could not stand up against the rational arguments made against it.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to these points.</P>
    <P>There is a very genuine point which has already been made.  Unlikely as it seems to people who have money in their pockets, there are people who might have legitimate political ambitions but who could not find the £500.  Whether the whole concept of a deposit is unconstitutional is debatable and, proposing to increase it five-fold is essentially antidemocratic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments put forward to date by my colleagues Senator Upton, Senator Murphy and Senator Hederman have been substantial.  I would like to add a few points to what has already been said.  The Minister, as indicated in the explanatory memorandum, is increasing the deposit to discourage frivolous candidates whose intervention might cause confusion to electors, and to ensure that each candidate is genuinely seeking election.  The present figure of £100, fixed in 1923, is no longer an effective deterrent.  What the legislation is doing is to link the old, hoary idea of franchise with property and money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been made over the years to break that link.  In fact, the greatest progress to the extension of democracy was to limit the link of the property owner and the business person.  In the old days a person could not become a candidate for Parliament unless he was able to maintain himself.  As late as 1923 the legislation required a candidate to put down a deposit of £100, a very large deposit.  At the time, almost 70 years ago, there still were the remnants of the old era which still made, psychologically in <Col N="368" /> the mind of our legislators, the inevitable link, or the necessary link as it was, which had not been broken between property and the franchise.  We should distance ourselves from that link.  I hope we are concerned about ensuring that the franchise is as open as possible and available to every citizen without favour and without a property or financial qualification. Increasing the existing financial qualification five fold is a deliberate attempt to establish finance as the criterion and could deter somebody from going forward as a candidate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is talking about this provision deterring frivolous candidates. What is a frivolous candidate?  The frivolous candidate is presumed, by implication, to be a poor person.  He can be deterred by a financial obstacle.  There can be a rich frivolous candidate who will not be deterred by a financial obstacle of £500.  This would discriminate.  Part of the restrictive element running through this legislation indicates that finance is something that is there to protect the franchise.  An obstacle is put in to keep undesirable elements out of the scenario. All it does is discriminate against the poor and those who cannot participate fully because of the money.  In 1923 £100 was a large sum of money.  We have not fully broken the link of property as a qualification for the exercise of franchise.  I had hoped that we had totally broken with it, but this legislation indicates otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the sentiments expressed in that fine article by Richard Humphreys, the lecturer in University College, Dublin, when he saw the origins of this coming from the Representation of the People Act, 1985, in Britain, where the 1918 figure was increased from £150 to £500 &mdash; exactly similar to what is here. As has been pointed out already, there were certain reasons which were well grounded on that occasion.  Britain has had a development in recent years which we have not had.  The ordinary man in the street there could say that there has been a range of relatively frivolous candidates coming forward.  Whether or not that is desirable is another matter.  Candidates <Col N="369" /> who are going forward, like the Raving Loony Party could be described as not being there for serious reasons, though that depends on one's opinion. They were addressing that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, they were trying to address the fact that there was a swing towards fascism and that certain candidates were presenting racist scenarios.  Their provision was to deter candidates of this nature.</P>
    <P>In our case we have had a history of very responsible candidates, who have been generally single issue candidates and who have gone forward in this country because certain issues have developed from time to time.  An example of that is the present Independent TD, Deputy Tom Foxe, who went forward in Roscommon in the last election as a hospital candidate.  There have been pothole candidates, who have been referred to already, haemophiliac candidates and the Army wives' candidates, where the women put themselves forward as Army candidates because their menfolk were soldiers and were debarred from standing. We have a good history of candidates who are not in any way frivolous going forward on single issues.  What we are trying to do here is to introduce a solution to a non-existent problem.  That has come up again and again in this legislation.  We are introducing responses to issues which have not arisen.  I do not see why we should go down that road.  I do not think that the Minister can give any valid reason why it is desirable to bring into operation a response to something that has not emerged as a problem.  If it did, the Minister could introduce an amendment to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>We are putting forward an alternative in the amendment.  We are saying that the Minister should go ahead with the provision for a £500 deposit, but allow a reasonable alternative for those who may not have financial means.  The suggestion that a certain number of signatures of electors be obtained is a reasonable suggestion and is eminently practicable. It is in operation in quite a number of European countries at present.  I do not know what is going to happen after the <Col N="370" /> Maastricht Treaty but we have ratified the Single European Act and it now governs our activities.  We have participated in Europe and will continue to participate in Europe.  This might be one area of integration we could pursue.  Perhaps we would go along with our European colleagues &mdash; Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Italy &mdash; which have got, as an alternative means of nomination, a certain number of signatures.  I understand it is only 700.  They have larger electorates to deal with in a given constituency.  Why not introduce an element of flexibility.  It has been pointed out by almost all the contributors here today that the financial impediment operates in a discriminatory fashion against one sector of the population rather than against the other sector.  Let us have an alternative for those other people who can demonstrate, by collecting 1,000 signatures, that they are not frivolous and are not vexatious.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 63, there is a further proposal that we would reduce the amount to what existed in 1923.  It has served us reasonably well for the last 70 years.  I would like to hear the Minister give an example of how that £100 deposit has not served the function of deterring frivolous or vexatious candidates. Could the Minister give us a single example of one frivolous or vexatious candidate who has slipped through because there was only £100 as a financial deterrent?</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 64, we propose that the deposit should be waived for unemployed candidates.  Whatever about having a deposit of £500 for those who can clearly afford it, if a person is unemployed and wishes to stand for election, surely that must be a discriminatory obstacle in the way of that person going forward?  On £55 unemployment benefit at the present time one would have to accumulate ten weeks' dole money to put down the deposit to stand for election to the Oireachtas.  For that ten weeks one would have to exist on water, not even on bread and water.  It seems reasonable that any candidate who is unemployed and who wishes to contest an election as his democratic right under the law and <Col N="371" /> the Constitution should not be debarred by a very significant financial obstacle being placed in the way.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 65 we are asking that that section stipulting legal tender be deleted.  The returning officer should have the option of deciding what he should he take.  That is a totally unnecessary section.  Whether it is our legal tender or some other legal tender, as long as the actual substance of the quantity of money is supplied that should be the determining factor.  What happens if somebody comes along with an ECU after Maastricht? What is the legal tender then?  Is it the Irish púnt?  Is it sterling?  Is it the currency of one of the member states?  I would hate to say that it might be a Danish kroner but, if it is, will they not accept an ECU?  We are going to be paid from Europe in ECUs.  We are going to have a common currency, but what is the legal tender?  It is wrong at this time to insist on or to specify that legal tender should be specified in the Bill with the ongoing situation in relation to European Union.</P>
    <P>Finally, for me, the principle is that we should be endeavouring to extend the franchise and extend the opportunity of becoming Members of the Oireachtas to every citizen who is so qualified.  We should seek to facilitate them by not putting any obstacles in their way.  In that context, as has been referred to already, there is the possibiity of a constitutional questioning of this provision which might lead the Minister into trouble in the future.  The Minister would be doing well to provide the alternative at this point &mdash; improve the situation, introduce flexibility and avoid having to appear in the courts and having the legislation overthrown because of this provision.</P>

      <P>I want to make an observation on amendment No. 64, which seeks to add &ldquo;provided that this deposit shall be waived for unemployed candidates&rdquo;.  Do the Senators who put down this amendment consider that all outgoing TDs or Deputies, once a general election is called, are basically unemployed? <Col N="372" /> If you read Deputy Nealon's book, most of the outgoing TDs are full time politicians.  Does that mean outgoing TDs are considered unemployed and therefore do not have to pay a deposit?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not think it does.  I may be wrong, but I have a feeling that the regulations were changed recently.  I was under the impression that retiring or outgoing TDs continued to be paid for some time after they ceased to be TDs if they lost the election; I was under the impression that they continued to be paid during the period they are contesting the election.  Of course, this is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  It is encouraging and it may tell us all something about our own thinking process in regard to where we are hoping to go from here.</P>
      <P>I have heard some of our colleagues in the other House talk in terms of there being arrangements made that if somebody loses their seat they get paid for either three months or six months afterwards. I was under the impression that the regulations have been changed to allow TDs to be paid while the Dáil is no longer in existence.  It is something I am sure the Minister will be able to clarify for us.  However, that is something of an aside.</P>
      <P>I have great difficulty understanding the concerns which the Minister appears to have about the problems and difficulties which frivolous or vexatious candidates could give rise to.  I do not dispute that there have been some frivolous candidates who went forward and constested elections.  Some of them got nowhere politically and that was the end of them; some duly went to get elected.  I do not honestly believe that it made much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to take the case that Senator Murphy talked about from the nameless city in the south of Ireland &mdash; and none of us would want to be too clued in to be able to fill in the missing bits &mdash; if we accept the general tone of what Senator Murphy was saying and if we accept the worst possible interpretation of what he was saying in terms of the candidature of <Col N="373" /> the individual in question being frivolous and so on, I want to ask the question: did it make any difference to the proper functioning of the council to which that gentleman was duly elected?  In my view, it did not.  That southern city seems to trundle on its way and I do not think it has been seriously damaged at all.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House of another candidate who, for many years, was a member of an urban district council. During election time, because the man was illiterate, one of the standard events of the campaign in a public house in the town where he was a member of the town council was getting this gentleman to tear down his own posters.  The publican told him they were the posters of one of his opponents that he did not particularly like and he promptly proceeded to tear them down.  The functioning of that town, and indeed the functioning of the town council, was not seriously damaged by the fact that that gentleman got elected and continued to be elected for quite a time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am saying is that we should not get ourselves unduly worried about the occasional frivolous candidate who contests elections and about the occasional frivolous candidate who gets elected.  I think the political and democratic process in this country is well able to take care of that.  There are a certain number of people in this country who are prepared to indulge themselves and are quite happy to vote for what they know only too well to be frivolous candidates.  As long as the frivolous candidates do not become a serious problem after they are elected.  In many ways it provides for these people a way of expressing themselves.  It provides them with a means of making a statement about the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the slightest doubt that if you began to see significant numbers of frivolous candidates being elected, the public would run a mile from them and you would not be long seeing the whole <Col N="374" /> system coming back into order.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons I think the Minister is worrying unduly.  In many ways it might even lighten elections which can be very boring for the public from time to time.  Certainly, they can be very trying for the candidates, with which is something we are all only too familiar.  The odd bit of levity, the odd funny candidate, does not make any difference or damage the system.  History in this country and in other countries shows that it has not made a significant impact on the political process or done any worthwhile damage.</P>
    <P>Was there not a bicycle candidate in Dún Laoghaire not so long ago?  Dún Laoghaire seems to me to have trundled along its merry way; it does not seem to have been seriously damaged.  The candidate in question got a fairly significant vote and I do not think it did any harm. Most of his votes, in due course, transferred to other what one might describe as very sensible candidates of other parties. I know for certain that some of the people who voted for that gentleman did so in the certain knowledge that those votes would finish up with sensible candidates they felt they would like to have voted for anyway, but they were expressing themselves; they were using the system, and in some way they were also sending a certain message to the political system &mdash; in other words, they were prepared to go that far in an effort to make a political point.  I think that in many ways we are worrying about nothing.</P>

      <P>Section 47 restates the law which requires that a candidate at a Dáil election must lodge a deposit with his nomination.  This provision has been part of the electoral law since 1923.  The only change proposed by section 46 is that the deposit be increased from £100 to £500.  The section, which is just eight lines long, has attracted five amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 62 proposes to require, as an alternative to the deposit, a petition of nominations signed by 1,000 electors.  While this suggestion may <Col N="375" /> appear an attractive proposition it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to administer.  I do not know how it would be possible for a returning officer to check the validity of such signatures. Even checking that each one of the alleged signatories was a registered elector would be a time consuming and painstaking task.  It will be noted that the amendment does not require that they should be electors of the constituency concerned.</P>
    <P>Senators should remember that the candidate at a Dáil election may submit his nomination paper to the returning officer right up to the time for the close of nominations.  The returning officer must rule on the validity of a nomination paper within one hour of its delivery to him. Clearly, it would be quite impossible for the returning officer to verify the signatures in the time available.  This would entail acceptance of the signatures at face value.  Anybody can write 1,000 names on a piece of paper and this would render the whole exercise pointless.  The requirement for a deposit at elections is a well established and accepted feature in the electoral system.  It appears to be the simplest and most convenient method of establishing the bona fides of a candidate. The alternative proposed in the amendment is not really practicable or workable in our situation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 63 proposes to reduce the deposit from £500, as proposed in the Bill, back to £100 &mdash; in other words, the amendment proposes to retain the <i>status quo</i>.  The unnumbered amendment after amendment No. 65 opposes the section in its entirety.  The effect of this would seem to be that there would be no test or requirement in relation to nominations.  Amendment No. 64 proposes that the requirement for a deposit should be waived in the case of unemployed candidates.  Requiring a deposit is an earnest of the serious intention of a candidate and is refunded if the candidate attracts a certain minimum of support. The minimum is being reduced from one-third to one-quarter of the quota in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> If any candidate, no matter what the circumstances &mdash; even a person who is out of work &mdash; is genuine and has serious policies and a significant level of support, he or she will have little difficulty in putting together a deposit of £500.  I do not accept that making an exception for one category of potential candidate is warranted. There would be, of course, the administrative difficulties.  What evidence of unemployment would a returning officer be required to or entitled to demand?  How would the expression &ldquo;unemployed candidate&rdquo; be defined? Could an extremely wealthy person, who has no recognised occupation and is not employed, be described as unemployed? What about the spouse of a wealthy person who is not gainfully employed outside the home?  How do we justify exclusion of persons who may be very poor but are not technically unemployed? Would the returning officer be required to apply a form of means test?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 65 proposes to delete subsection (2), which provides that the deposit at a Dáil election should be made by means of legal tender or, with the consent of the returning officer, in any other manner.  Acceptance of this amendment could put the returning officer in a difficult position.  He would probably be obliged to accept a deposit in whatever manner it was tendered, despite any doubts he may have about the value of a cheque proferred by a candidate.  In practice, returning officers let it be known that they will accept only cash or a bank draft.  In this way all candidates are treated equally and embarrassment is avoided in relation to the question of whether it would be prudent to accept a cheque in a particular case.  The present arrangement is clear and fair.  We should not put the returning officers in a position of having to inquire into the financial affairs of a candidate, or his proposer, and to make potentially embarrassing judgments in relation to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has allayed any of our concerns about this matter.  He has sought to demonstrate the obstacles to providing alternatives. <Col N="377" /> The simple fact is that there are alternatives in existence in other states and the approach we should have here is to try to facilitate the exercise of democracy to the greatest extent.  He talked about the verification of signatures, that the time span would be a problem.  It could be a matter of regulation that signatures would have to be available for a certain length of time to ensure that there would be time for checking them, if that was a problem but to simply rule out the possibility of signatures because he has certain reservations about them does not stand up, because it has been demonstated that signatures as an alternative to a financial deposit are feasible.  This has worked and is operating in member states of the European Community and surely we can introduce something that has been tried elsewhere and found feasible.  I would like the Minister to address that. To my mind, his objections are not sufficiently substantial to rule out the alternative we are proposing in amendment No. 62.</P>
      <P>Regarding the unemployed, the Minister is not anxious to allow a consideration to be given to the unemployed on the grounds that it would be difficult to determine precisely who is and who is not unemployed.  We have our own means of determining that.  We see regularly on the newspapers the number of people who are unemployed according to the criteria established, which is the live register.  Those people who are signing on are the major category who would be considered as people who are unemployed and are in receipt of social welfare for their livelihood.  I think that would be a useful criterion to start with in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the last point about the legal tender, surely the point should be to facilitate the candidates in as wide a fashion as possible?  I do not consider it a major problem.  If the £500, as it is in this case, or its equivalent in recognised financial currency, is available, it is not a difficult job for the returning officer to go out to the bank and check the rate. It could be done in the space of a few minutes.  It is not something that is a <Col N="378" /> major problem, so I do not regard it as a sustainable objection.  It is something one could regard rather as a nuisance; it might put him to a bit of trouble.  Nevertheless, it is not a sustainable objection and certainly not when we consider that borders are to be abolished.  In County Louth along the Border with Northern Ireland money is pretty much interchangeable. Therefore, what is and what is not legal tender, particularly after the borders go in the context of European Union?</P>
    <P>I would not disagree with any of the objections put forward by the Minister, but I would not say they are substantial objections to the procedure we are suggesting here to improve the representation of all sectors of the community irrespective of their financial standing.  That is where the Minister has gone wrong.  In this section he has discriminated against those who have no financial standing in the community in favour of those who have.  It is simply a matter of not just of eliminating that but also providing an alternative for those people who are being discriminated against by this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened in great detail to the arguments presented by Senators Upton and Costello and I wonder if the two Senators are serious in some of the suggestions they put forward. It is very simple to put 1,000 names down on paper and submit them to the returning officer.  I pointed out here on Second Stage that I remember in the 1969 election a candidate went to the wrong constituency to get nominated and, having been there, he then took a taxi to the constituency where he wanted to get nominated.  He duly paid his £100 deposit, went home, end of story.  He did not even vote on the day of the election, but he ended up with 600 votes at the end of the day.  The only reason he put his name on the ballot paper was because he wanted to unseat his namesake, and he succeeded in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said also on Second Stage that I thought the deposit of £500 should be increased.  I believe that anybody who cannot get £500 is not a candidate who <Col N="379" /> has a chance of getting elected to Dáil Éireann.  We should be very serious about the issues involved here, and not alone the question of the deposit.  Senator Fitzgerald made the point that technically all Members of the Dáil, once the election is called, are regarded as effectively unemployed under this section of the Bill.  I do not think that is what anybody here has in mind.  If any candidate putting himself forward for election to Dáil Éireann and having to launch a campaign for three to four weeks is not able to come up with £500 for the deposit I do not think he has much chance of getting elected.  As far as I am concerned, to include those amendments would mean you could well have a situation where there would be a huge number of candidates in a general election and undoubtedly it would distract from the candidates who seriously contemplate election.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred earlier on to a situation which arose in a southern city, and I do not think any of us would like to see a repetition of that.  Equally, I do not think that any of us would like to see a situation where people could just walk in off the street, give in their name and say &ldquo;Right, I am standing in a general election&rdquo; without the necessity to lodge a deposit.  That would not be in the interest of democracy and I certainly understand the comments by the Minister when replying to those amendments.</P>

      <P>To put your mind at rest, a Chathaoirligh, I think I speak for some of the Senators at least when I say that this and the previous amendment were among the most serious before us. I am not saying that some of the others are unimportant, but they are certainly less important than some of these.  I find the contribution of Senator Naughten, <Col N="380" /> when he said you are only reputable if you have money &mdash; and in essence that is what he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. Senator Naughten made that clear that only reputable candidates should be allowed stand.  I probably understand what Senator Naughten intends to say, but what is behind this Bill is far more serious and more sinister.  What it is, in fact, is attempt after attempt to narrow it down and to make it more difficult. Earlier we had the question of the Non-Party designation and now we have another attempt here.  Not only can people who are not in the major political parties call themselves Independent, but they also have to be well off and be able to produce the money.</P>
      <P>I find the whole trend of this very disheartening, and the more I listen to the Minister and the reasons he is putting forward the more I am convinced that it is an erosion of our democracy.  The Minister referred to the difficulty of verifying the 1,000 votes, but I am sure the Minister and his officials know that something like this is done in a great number of other countries.  In a plebiscite they must have perhaps 10,000 votes.  I know that in some countries 20,000 votes are needed &mdash; in Switzerland it is a huge number of votes.  With modern technology it is quite simple, because the voters register is on computer and somebody only has to spend a short while checking them on a computer to see if they are on the register.  Therefore, I do not think that argument will hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about is this notion that somebody other than the candidates and the electorate can decide.  I got confused earlier when I was referring <Col N="381" /> to it and I did not get a chance to say it here when the Minister came into the House at the beginning of the debate. Talking about swamping the ballot paper with the names of large numbers of irrelevant candidates is a most patronising attitude.  I find it unbelievable and unspeakable that that could be actually written down.  In my view, the only people who would get in any way confused are those voters who just go out and blindly accept that because they had good turns done for them they want to vote for the party.  They do not know whom they want to vote for; they just want to vote for the party.  That is the situation in which they could get confused and swamped by what are so disparagingly termed &ldquo;irrelevant candidates&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anybody who is going out to vote will have no difficulty.  I resent the way the Irish electorate are constantly being denegrated.  Our electorate are well able to discern the difference between the candidates they want to vote for and candidates who might not be serious.  They do not need this Minister or any other Minister to start telling them who is a relevant candidate and who is serious about getting elected.  The whole thing really stinks, as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I referred to Sadhbh O'Neill; whoever thought she would get elected?  I dislike the whole idea of this business of &ldquo;distracting from serious candidates.&rdquo;  Who is a serious candidate?  As I said earlier, it is only the people who are in major political parties who are serious candidates? I would like to hear from some of the people in the Opposition.  Let us hear from them what they feel about these rather insulting remarks to the Irish electorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with what Senator Hederman said about the Irish people and their capacity to indulge themselves in a little bit of frivolity from time to time by way of voting for frivolous candidates &mdash; but they have no problem at all in becoming quite serious when it suits them and indeed when they feel it is in their own best interest.  Sometimes <Col N="382" /> a little bit of frivolity does not do any harm.</P>
      <P>Primarily, A Chathaoirligh, I rise to take up some of the points which were made by Senator Naughten, and in particular I want to take up the point he made in relation to unemployment.  It is a clever point.  It was well made by Senator Fitzgerald, who is a wise old Senator and is very well able to get in useful debating points, but it does not have any substance. To qualify to be unemployed in this country you have got to be available for work.  Look at anyone who is contesting an election and the one thing that they are not is available for work.  There is nothing worse than contesting elections in terms of the way it drains one's resources and so on.  That point is completely irrelevant and has no substance.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Naughten's concerns about obtaining the 1,000 signatures &mdash; letting people write down the same name 1,000 times or 1,000 different names once &mdash; I do not think that creates a problem that cannot be overcome.  This system exists in other European countries and I can see no reason we would not be able to build in the same safeguards in this country that they have in other European countries.  I do not believe the Irish people are any different in how they might abuse these matters compared with other European countries.</P>
      <P>My final point relates to the £500 deposit, which Senator Naughten did not seem to think created any great difficulties. Again, I begin to wonder if people's perceptions and views of £500 deposits are not conditioned somewhat by the tendency of certain companies to give rather large donations which would certainly remove any worries that one would have about the problem of a £500 deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to candidates who are Independent, who belong to small parties, the reality is that for many of these candidates to get elected they have to contest elections over and over again.  That is the route which many people who have made it into this House and the other House have followed.  If people are going to be deterred from getting started into the <Col N="383" /> whole business and process of politics by the size of the deposit which they will have to put at risk, well then I think that is not a good political, democratic process.  I believe there are some people who would be prevented from ever making it to either this House or to the other House if that kind of money is required.</P>
    <P>There were many very distinguished people in Irish politics who got derisory votes when they first put their names before the Irish people.  While I am sure the £500 would not have been a problem to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, it is well for everyone to remember that when he first stood for election he got a very small vote, and look where he went from there.  The last time he stood he got somewhere between two and three quotas.  Certainly, the number of votes he got was rather enormous. It illustrates the point in relation to very many people who have had to start off on very small beginnings and in difficult circumstances.  If one finds oneself in that kind of circumstance, then that type of money can be a disincentive and can be unsuitable and unhelpful to the democratic process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The first element in this provision is that there is a presumption that abuse can only be deterred by a financial obstacle being put in the way. That is something that has to be eliminated from it.  The next point is the provision of an alternative.  There are two ways of going about it: either have a deposit as the deterrent in relation to frivolous and vexatious candidates, or have some other form.  We are suggesting that the other form be a certain number of signatures.  It would not have to be a great number of signatures.  The Minister may come up with an alternative.  We put forward our alternative on the basis that it is already in operation in other countries in Europe and in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has to ensure that what he is doing is in accordance with the Constitution and that he is not debarring people on frivolous grounds, that he is <Col N="384" /> not putting frivolous obstacles in their way.  The Minister may find himself charged with using frivolous reasons to debar somebody from their entitlement to be a candidate.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to an important point made by Senator Hederman. She said that when she looks at the whole tenor of the restrictions that have been imposed in this legislation so far, she sees something which is suspicious and alarming: the concept of restriction to &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;, not being prepared to allow the term &ldquo;Independents&rdquo;, which would be the normal nomenclature for people who are not members of a specific party. There is also the question of preventing candidates from going forward and the question of a deposit for an appeal.  The direction this legislation is taking introduces sufficient restrictions to ensure that the Fianna Fáil Party get an overall majority.  It is putting restrictions on existing categories of people &mdash; on students, for example.  It would be a normal thing for students to register at home or at work.  That has been limited, despite the Supreme Court decision on the matter.  I do not like the direction in which these restrictions are going.  There is something I cannot put my finger on, but it is certainly undesirable and antidemocratic.</P>

      <P>Clearly, we do not agree with section 47.  We would not have had so many votes on it if it had been agreed; the number of votes called indicates the seriousness with which we consider this section.</P>
      <P>We are very disappointed the Minister did not deign to consider the proposals we put to him.  Having listened to the wide ranging arguments from all sides of the House the least he could have done was to take our proposals on board and consider the alternatives and come back to us on Report Stage.  We are very disappointed, because in this section we are going backwards rather than forwards, we are raising the deposit to stand for election by 400 per cent.  This is entrenching the property and wealth consideration as a barrier to exercising the franchise; this is a throw back to the early days of parliamentary democracy rather than a step forward into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The Minister may yet rue the day that he rejected these amendments because it seems likely that a major constitutional question will be raised about the insubstantial reasons for disbarring somebody on the basis of financial requirements for standing for election.</P>
      <P>Again, I wish to express my deep regret the Minister did not take on board or consider the points we have put before him.  I am opposed to section 47 as it stands.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In page 39, subsection (1) (e), lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;one quarter&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;twenty per cent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we are suggesting the fraction of the quota which a candidate would need to obtain before being eliminated from the election should be reduced from what is proposed here, one quarter, to a fifth or &ldquo;twenty per cent&rdquo;. Primarily this is a way of mitigating the effects of the increased deposit requirement of £500, a five fold increase.  The regulations require that a candidate receive one third of the quota.  The reduction from one-third to a quarter is not proportionate to the level of increase in the deposit which has gone up fourfold. If you were arguing for a <i>quid pro quo</i> you might suggest there should be a four times decrease in the fraction of the quota which would have to be obtained prior to elimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially we are trying to create an environment where it will be possible for people who want to contest elections to do so.  We want to create a climate in which people will not feel inhibited from putting their names on the ballot paper because of the fact they have got to put £500 at risk.  Now £500 may seem a small amount of money to some of our colleagues on the other side of the House, who in the course of conversation during the recent intervals referred to the very large sums of money spent on election campaigns.  However, £500 would be a significant percentage of the total amount spent by an Independent candidate or a candidate representing a poorly organised party or a small party.  Many of those <Col N="391" /> candidates would consider spending perhaps a total of a few thousand pounds on the campaign.  You would amount a moderately successful campaign for £2,000 or £3,000.  Candidates from small parties or belonging to major parties which are not particularly well organised in an area might spend that amount and £500 is a considerable fraction of it.  In those circumstances candidates really have very little prospect of winning, and most of them would be well aware of that.  In addition, the fact that they would be gambling £500 would be a disincentive to contest the election.</P>
    <P>It would also be a problem for some of our own Labour Party candidates in parts of the country where our party is not well organised.  It is important that the public should be given a choice and have the option of voting for Labour Party candidates in some of the constituencies where we do not have a strong organisation &mdash; for example, like some of the constituencies in the west.  The fact that President Robinson polled so well in some of these constituencies is an indication that some people in those constituencies may want to vote and support the policies our party stands for.  I think the people should be given that choice. The present fraction of the quota, which admittedly has been reduced from a third to a quarter, should be reduced somewhat further to at least minimise the risk of losing the £500 deposit when people representing small parties with low levels of support put their name forward for election.</P>
    <P>As far as the major parties are concerned, this is not a big problem.  They have the money and they can come up with the deposit.  Indeed, the deposit in the case of a great many candidates is supplied from central funds.  The deposits would be a very small fraction of the total election budget of a major party, which, I understand, runs in excess of £1 million, and perhaps if the full truth were known it may amount to more than £10 million. That is the amount of money you are talking about.  So risking the loss of a few deposits of £500 is not a deterrent to the <Col N="392" /> major parties, but it certainly would be a deterrent to some of our candidates in areas where we are badly organised.  I think it would be an extra deterrent to candidates who want to stand as Independents or who are members of others small parties who are not well organised in certain constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly welcome the reduction in the quota from a third to a quarter.  Obviously, the benefit is eliminated by the increase in the deposit from £100 to £500, which is an increase of 400 per cent.  Again, our major objection to it is that it is once again creating a financial barrier, which is not logical. For example, it is quite a creditable performance to get a quarter of the votes in any constituency.  Let us say the quota is 8,000 which would be the norm: 25 per cent of that means you have to get 2,000 votes, and that is certainly no mean achievement.  Second, those who are eliminated first do not benefit greatly from transfers, so we are talking about first preference votes.  A very large percentage of their votes, in fact, will be first preference votes, because the fact they are eliminated and lose their deposit means they do not go on to benefit from our proportional representation transfer system, so a very large percentage of that 25 per cent will be first preference votes.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly is that one loses the entire deposit of £500 if one does not reach the magic figure of 25 per cent.  The procedure should be to return part of the deposit in proportion to the number of votes received &mdash; in other words, if you get 10 per cent of the quota, you should get back 10 per cent of your deposit and so on.  That would seem more reasonable than losing the entire amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ironically the person who suffers most in the election also has to suffer again financially.  Those who win the election would not worry about their deposit because they have been elected to the Dáil and will receive a salary.  Obviously, they will recoup the money that has been spent in the election, whereas somebody who has not got elected loses the election, loses the seat if he had one and, of course, <Col N="393" /> he loses the deposit as well.  If we were trying to be logical about this procedure a proportionate amount of the deposit should be returned depending on the number of votes received.  At a minimum we should reduce it from 25 per cent to 20 per cent of the quota, which is not an unreasonable reduction.  It would be reduced from 33? per cent at present to 20 per cent, a 13½ per cent reduction compared with the enormous increase of 400 per cent in the deposit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the case they made that only candidates from large parties would not be affected by the huge increase in the deposit, the Members of this House are proof of democracy at its best, because good candidates get elected to this House without big money backing them.  In years gone by when my late husband was a candidate, there were gentlemen on the panel with big money behind them who were not elected, the opposite was the case.  It is great that we can be elected to this House or to the Dáil without big money behind us.  It is wrong to say that someone could not put his name forward for election because he did not have the deposit.  I have to make that point because I have longer service than my <Col N="394" /> two colleagues who were making this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Senator Upton deserve to be considered seriously.  It is not good for the democratic process to erect too many barriers to prevent people from participating in it.  I disagreed with Senator Upton on the question of the deposit.  The £500 now required is equivalent to what £100 was worth in 1923.  While the democratic process depends on it being open to as many people as possible, you can make a hash of it if you throw it wide open.  Setting the deposit at £500 takes care of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The amendment requests the deposit be returned to a candidate securing 20 per cent of the quota.  I largely agree with Senator Costello when he said that, on average, 25 per cent of the quota represents about 1,500-2,000 votes.  A candidate who puts down a deposit of £500 and gets 1,500 votes can justify his candidature in the electoral process.  He is a creditable candidate contesting the election and that is sufficient to justify the return of his deposit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It is another step along the road to make things easier for a candidate to stand without losing his deposit.  It amazes me that Senator Honan can speak so knowledgably and authoritatively for the whole country when she said that in all her 40 years in the public area, no one has ever been impeded from standing for want of money.  That is an extraordinary statement.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality in County Clare may be that people there are rich, perhaps very rich farmers; they live on the western seaboard and are very near Shannon Airport.  However, I can assure Senator Honan that there are many poor areas in Dublin where people have not been able to run for election because they did not have the necessary funds.  If they now have to pay a £500 deposit &mdash;<Col N="395" /> Senator Howard's figures were very helpful &mdash; they could get 1,500 votes but still lose their deposit.  The reality is that the major political parties run three candidates knowing that the person at the bottom will not get elected.  They put his name before the electorate so that he will become well known, and when the candidate at the top dies or retires, the second candidate will be elected.  They know the candidate will lose his deposit because he has not reached the quota but they can afford to do that.</P>
      <P>I am not going to start mud-slinging but we have all been reading in the newspapers how the political parties get their funds.  I am not picking out any particular party because I understand that the practice is widespread.  My point is that it is easy for them to put up candidates and pay the £500 deposit because if the candidate loses the deposit he will at least be better known the next time he stands.  It is not possible for many Independents to do that.</P>
      <P>I was very amused when Senator Honan started to say this House was proof of democracy at its best.  I was going to say there is very little democracy in this House because of the way the party whip is applied.  Members may speak in favour of an amendment, but they will have to vote against it because of the party whip.  However, that was not the point she made.  She said you do not need large financial backing to get elected to this House &mdash; I accept that, but that is not the case in the Dáil.  As I understand it, we are speaking about the election of Members to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48 restates the law in relation to the return or disposal of a deposit of a candidate at a Dáil election.  Under subsection (1) (e) the threshold for the return of a deposit is reduced from one-third to one-quarter of the quota.  Amendment No. 66 proposes to further reduce the threshold for the return of a deposit to 20 per cent of or one-fifth of the quota.  As the House is aware, the existing deposit is £100 and the threshold for the return of a deposit <Col N="396" /> is one-third of the quota.  Section 48, as drafted, provides for a reduction in the threshold to one-quarter of the quota.</P>
      <P>The reduction is intended to take account of the increase in the deposit to £500 and so lessen the impact of the increase so far as serious candidates are concerned.  This provision is designed to strike a balance between the necessity to discourage candidates who are not serious and the need to ensure that inconvenience to serious candidates is kept to a minimum.  I belive that by setting the threshold at one-quarter of the quota, the section strikes the correct balance. There is a danger that reducing it further could undermine the whole purpose of the deposit.  I suggest the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to suffer from some type of fixation with seriousness, frivolity and this type of concepts. Are they that important, and has lack of seriousness been a major problem in Irish politics?  I do not think so.  Certainly it has not been in the context the Minister is referring to, although there might be a case to be made that seriousness is lacking in Irish politics if it is viewed from some other considerations.</P>
      <P>I want to take up some of the points made by Senator Honan.  First, money talks in elections.  Let nobody be in any doubt about that.  That is one of the reasons that money is spent the way it is, although it is not spent foolishly by many political organisations.</P>
      <P>The second point Senator Honan made was that she never met anybody in County Clare who was unable to contest an election because of lack of money.  Let me say to Senator Honan &mdash; and I have been out of that county for a while now &mdash; that I strongly believe that if somebody in County Clare was unable to contest an election for lack of money they would be the last person to admit it.  It would be a disgrace to the family and not the kind of thing to be readily acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the point made by Senator Howard in relation to 1,500 votes being about the number of first preferences that somebody needs to qualify <Col N="397" /> under the 20 per cent figure in the amendment. It seems to me that 1,500 votes is a significant number of votes to receive. Any of us who contest elections would be delighted to pick up 1,500 votes or to know they could be obtained in a certain area.  There are not many Oireachtas Members who got more than 1,500 votes in the recent local elections.  A large number of people started off with considerably less than that number and yet they are significant politicians.  I regard 1,500 votes as a significant level of support to obtain and if somebody gets that level of support then their candidature has been justified and they should not forfeit their deposit.</P>

      <P>In page 41, subsection (3), lines 1 and 2, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete paragraph (a).  In a case where the name registered is not the name by which a person is commonly known that name would be misleading and liable to cause confusion.  Accordingly paragraph (a) is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 68 and 69, the same could be said of a name that was unduly long.  That may be misleading and cause confusion and for that reason (c) is not necessary.  The third point covered in paragraph (d) is that a name containing a political reference is not allowed on the ballot paper.  That is untenable and would create enormous difficulties if it were implemented.  I am amazed the Minister should make a proposal <Col N="398" /> of that nature.  May I illustrate my case with an example?</P>
    <P>The name de Valera, as we would all agree, contains a basic political reference in this country and if this provision remains in the Bill Deputy Síle de Valera, because her name contains a political reference, would not be eligible to contest Dáil elections anywhere in this country. The same might hold for a member of the Labour Party, called Mr. James Connolly Heron.  That is his grandfather's name; it is on his birth certificate and passport and so on.  That name contains a political reference which might be significant for a Labour Party candidate.  That candidate would be debarred from contesting elections because of this provision.</P>
    <P>The name de Valera is a particularly stark example because it is so unusual.  It could be argued that the name Connolly is quite a common name and for that reason may not have the same immediate political connotations as the name of de Valera.  That thinking might be applied also to a name like Haughey, although that does not have the same degree of specificity and direct association as de Valera.</P>
    <P>I presume there is a relatively small number of people called de Valera in the county so that name when applied to someone undoubtedly carries political connotations.  If that provision remains in the Bill a conscientious returning officer would have to exclude Deputy Síle de Valera.  I am sure it will make for a delightful conundrum when the returning officer in County Clare faces this dilemma with Deputy de Valera who I presume will contest the next Dáil election for County Clare.  It would be a wonderful occasion and add a new level of spice to the historical association of the de Valera family with the County of Clare.  It will seem a remarkable paradox that a county which put de Valera on the road politically should be prevented from electing his grand daughter because of a provision inserted in a Bill by a Government in which de Valera's Party is the major partner.  I am amazed that de Valera's Party should allow a provision to be inserted in a Bill which might prevent a <Col N="399" /> member of the de Valera family from contesting Dáil elections.</P>

      <P>There are a considerable number of questions to be asked in relation to this section.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to Senator Upton's points and to a few of my questions.</P>
      <P>Section 52 says that a returning officer may object to the name of a candidate on a nomination paper if such name is not a name by which the candidate is commonly known.  Somebody who may not be commonly known by their name in Irish may wish to use their name in Irish in elections.  At an earlier stage of our discussion Senator Ó Cuív said that he had problems with the way his name was entered on the ballot paper.  We are entitled to use the two official languages but if somebody wishes to put their name forward in Irish when they may be more commonly known by the English form, are we saying that they should therefore be disbarred?  Problems like that give rise to questions which I do not think the parliamentary draftsman anticipated.  In any case what does it matter if a candidate uses a name by which they are not commonly known?  Surely a name becomes commonly known only when somebody is elected or has stood for election a number of times?  As pointed out by Senator Howard earlier on, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, stood three or four times; he evidently did not do well enough the first time and his name was not commonly known then.  I do not see the reason for this unless it tends to mislead and that contingency covered by paragraph (b).  Why bother with something as trivial as this when at attempted solution might cause other problems for users of Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 68, we are asking that &ldquo;unduly long&rdquo; be deleted. We had this argument before on the question of space for the description of a candidate and whether or not a candidate should use a name that in the opinion of the registrar was unduly long.  We should not bother with this matter; regulations <Col N="400" /> if made should determine the amount of space available rather than allow the registrar discretion to decide on suitable length, otherwise we cause unnecessary problems for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) refers to political references and Senator Upton has given a number of examples of political references which could be construed from the names of sitting Deputies.  Why should a person's name on the nomination paper not contain a political reference? This is politics, after all, and if Seán Dublin Bay Loftus wants to describe himself as a Christian Democrat or to include Dublin Bay in his name, what is wrong with that?  He is naming the single issue that he wishes to be identified with.  If he wants to add &ldquo;Rockall&rdquo; to it, as he has done in the past, I do not see the problem.  Neither do I see a problem with a councillor like Ballyfermot Jackson a local councillor in that area using that title.  The problem is more imaginary than real and the restrictions being introduced here are unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 69, which is consequential on amendments Nos. 67 and 68, refers to subsection (4) which says &ldquo;The returning officer shall object to the description of a candidate in a nomination paper which is, in his opinion, incorrect, insufficient to identify the candidate...&rdquo; We had an argument here before lunch about the problem of describing somebody who is not a member of a political party and that issue falls into this category.  The term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; is insufficient to identify a candidate and according to this subsection a non-party candidate may be ruled out on the grounds that his description is incorrect or insufficient to identify him.  Non-party must be the most inadequate political description possible.  I would like to hear the Minister's reply to these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This section brings together the various provisions of existing law in relation to the ruling by the returning officer on the validity of nomination papers.  Apart from subsection (7), which is simply a statement of fact, the section reproduces existing law without <Col N="401" /> any change.  Amendments No. 67 and 68 propose to delete the provisions in subsections (3) and (4) which provide that the returning officer at a Dáil election in ruling on the nomination of a candidate shall object to the name if it is not the name by which the candidate is commonly known, if it is unduly long or if it contains a political reference. Amendment No. 69 proposes to delete the requirement that the returning officer shall object to the description of a candidate which in his opinion is insufficient to identify the candidates or unnecessarily long or contains a political reference other than where appropriate as reference to a public or elected office held or formerly held by the candidate.</P>
      <P>The provisions proposed for deletion are largely those inserted by the Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Act, 1986.  The intention of the law relating to the nomination of candidates is clear.  It envisages that what will appear on the nomination paper is the name by which the candidate is normally known, his address, his ordinary occupation and, if he is a candidate of a registered political party, the name of the party or, if he is not, the expression &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; if he wishes to use it.</P>
      <P>Prior to the enactment of the 1986 Act a way has been found of frustrating the clear intention of the law and of getting all sorts of references, political and otherwise, on the ballot paper.  Such references were included either as part of the name or under the occupation heading.  In many cases the purpose of including this extraneous material was to confuse, mislead or deceive the electorate.  The purpose of the 1986 Act was to put a stop to this and to restore the situation to what is clearly the original intention of the law.  I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. A good case has been put forward by Senators Upton and Costello highlighting the denial of rights to persons standing for election to describe themselves as they wish.  I heard the Minister say that this was all inserted in 1986.  I am very much aware of why it was inserted; <Col N="402" /> I was myself one of the causes.  It was inserted to disallow me at a local election &mdash; not in a national, presidential or European election &mdash; but at a local election from entering my name as I wanted to.  I was involved in the community and I wished to have &ldquo;community&rdquo; after my name in the same way as other candidates for local elections describe themselves by reference to parties etc.  Being unable to do so, I and my colleagues Seán Dublin Bay Loftus, Councillor Brendan Lynch and I think Vincent Manning, changed our names by deed poll and I became Carmencita Hederman Community and I was known and addressed as such thereafter by the corporation.  I was fortunate through the oversight or stupidity of whoever prepared the ballot paper, because my name should have contained a hyphen.  A hyphenated name contains a small dash whereas the dash in Tras Honan-Fianna Fáil is considerably longer.  But perhaps in an effort to assist me and my colleagues &mdash; whoever drew up the paper may have realised the justice of our situation &mdash; I ended up on the ballot paper with Carmencita Hederman-Community containing a dash as long as that of Tras Honan-Fianna Fáil and we were very pleased.</P>

      <P>Always anxious to contain the progress of anybody who shows independence of spirit or who manages to describe themselves accurately &mdash; I and my colleague described ourselves as what we were &mdash; the Government in 1987 tightened up legislation to prevent us doing so.  I reverted to my original name subsequently but Councillor Brendan Lynch, who did not, was addressed at every council meeting as Councillor Brendan Lynch-Community. He became known as such and every letter he received from the corporation used that title.  He was known to everybody as Councillor Brendan Lynch-Community. At the last election however, thanks to the tightening up to which the Minister referred, the returning officer, <Col N="403" /> the city manager, would not allow him to use &ldquo;Community&rdquo; in his name although the city manager had for the last 12 years addressed him as Councillor Brendan Lynch-Community.</P>
      <P>Legislators are out to get at Independents. We realise that and it gives us some pleasure to realise that all this legislation is necessary to do us down. Reference has been made to Vincent Ballyfermot Jackson and Seán Dublin Bay Loftus is another example.  Seán Dublin Bay Loftus is well known by that name, but it could be decided that that was misleading.  Everybody here knows him as Dublin Bay, we do not even call him Seán around City Hall.</P>

      <P>That comes in as well. A good point was made by Senator Upton with regard to the name de Valera and its undeniable political connotations. A community is a body of persons leading a common life or a body of persons in the same locality.  Would the Minister tell me in what way it could be construed as a political reference?  Those are dictionary explanations for the word.</P>
      <P>I greatly resent the Minister's reference to a desire by Independents to confuse, mislead or deceive the electorate. That is totally untrue.  I and people like me wanted to describe ourselves accurately.  We were allowed to call ourselves &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; and we had no ambition to confuse, mislead or deceive the electorate.  On the contrary, we wish to enlighten the electorate and make it easier for them to understand who are and what we stand for.  I find it personally offensive that the Minister should say I was trying to confuse, mislead or deceive the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>My Labour colleagues have not sounded as convincing on this amendment as they did in the previous few.  Nonetheless they have raised a number of issues and I want to focus in particular on section 52 (3) (a).  The Minister can anticipate that in this House <Col N="404" /> this Bill will be gone through with a fine comb.  Worthwhile opinions may emerge and it might be good for the Minister to leave himself room between now and Report Stage to look at some of the points made here.</P>
      <P>I do not like being told by the Minister or anybody else that this is an exercise in bringing together existing law with the implications that there can be no question about it and questions will not help get the Bill through expeditiously.  I do not support Senator Hederman.  I do not accept that name changes, additions or anything else, will ever succeed in confusing the electorate.  The electorate are not that simple.</P>
      <P>However, I want to come back to paragraph (a) where it says &ldquo;is not a name&rdquo;&mdash; and &ldquo;name&rdquo; is singular &mdash;&ldquo;by which the candidate is commonly known;&rdquo;.  I want to point to implications which have not been raised here.  I do not like referring to absent Members but Senator Ó Cuív, who was mentioned earlier, to the best of my knowledge is known in Connemara as &ldquo;Dev Óg&rdquo;.  A party colleague of mine in Clare County Council is known as &ldquo;Sonny&rdquo; Scanlon; his name is Patrick Joseph Scanlon.  If Patrick Joseph Scanlon were to insist on putting his full name on the ballot paper he could be told by a responsible official that that is not the name by which he is commonly known.  Is it the correct name of a candidate or the name by which they are commonly known which is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other complication I foresee arising from this provision is this.  If Patrick Joseph Scanlon insists on registering himself by that name and the returning officer agrees, arising from what the Minister has said it may then be open to somebody to challenge the validity of the ballot paper and through that, the election because a candidate is described on the ballot paper by a name by which he is not commonly known.  Paragraph (a) uses &ldquo;name&rdquo; in the singular and people are conscious of their right to challenge decisions in the courts.  If I wanted to disrupt an election and found Patrick Joseph Scanlon entered on the ballot paper for Sonny Scanlon, I would have <Col N="405" /> an opportunity to go to the High Court claiming that an election was illegal on that account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard made some valid points particularly when he referred to Senator Ó Cuív being known as &ldquo;Dev Óg&rdquo;. That is how I encountered him in the Seanad election.  There is nothing wrong with that; de Valera was his grandfather, but if that is the case, it contains a built-in contradiction.  If he uses the name by which he is commonly known, it will contain a political reference. The man is in a terrible dilemma.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>When he goes to contest an election if this business is followed through to the letter, he will be debarred. In addition, it creates an unacceptable dilemma for the returning officer who at that stage may decide to amend the Senator's name.  What type of amendment would be put on Senator Ó Cuív in those circumstances?  Would his nomination be declared invalid?  The Minister should at least agree to go back to the drawing board on these provisions and come up with something more practical and realistic.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a preoccupation with seriousness and legalism and a determination to avoid frivolity in the business of contesting elections.  People, as Senator Howard said, know only too well what serious candidates are about politically. That is the reality of Irish politics and we are tying ourselves into a big knot and getting ourselves hot and bothered about unduly long names and misleading the Irish public while the Irish public are well clued in whan it comes to choosing where to put their mark when they take their biros out of their pockets at election time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been as straightforward as I can with this Bill and I am disappointed and not convinced by the arguments put forward by Senators today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions which these amendments <Col N="406" /> propose to delete were inserted by the 1986 Act.  The Government of the day regarded these provisions as vital and I do not know whether these Senators have had the opportunity to look back on debates of that time.  To help them I would like to draw their attention to columns 934 to 936 of the Seanad Report of 16 December 1986.  The speaker was the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Boland, and I am reluctant to take up the time of the House by reading the full speech.  However, I will read a short extract from it.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Instead of following that straightforward path, however, some organisations and individuals have tried to show virtually how clever they are by finding ways around it.  A way has been found of frustrating the clear intention of the present law and of getting all sorts of references whether political or otherwise, onto the ballot paper.  This is done by including names or titles, either as part of the supposed name of the person involved or as part of the occupation heading.  In many cases the purpose of including that extraneous material has merely been to confuse, mislead or deceive the electorate. Senators will remember that at recent by-elections in Northern Ireland this device was resorted to by a particular organisation to put forward a number of candidates right across constituencies who purported to be known by the name of Peter Barry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Republic.  In recent weeks the media reported the intention of a person to advance their name and occupation as being identical to the name and occupation of a Cabinet Minister in the present Government, with the intention of confusing or misleading the electorate, and obviously causing unnecessary difficulty in any election which might be held in that constituency. It is important that the potential abuse or loophole should be closed off.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Labour Senators <Col N="407" /> that their party was also a party to those decisions by that Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to bring this to a close.  We have talked about it for almost 55 minutes.  I accept that it is an important amendment, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important amendment and I think we need to reply to the Minister.  To my mind, the Minister has made our point for us.  We are saying that the four paragraphs here &mdash; (a), (b), (c) and (d) &mdash; tautologous.  Everything the Minister referred to is liable to cause more problems than they will solve. Instances have been given of people, commonly known by names other than their proper names, who may find themselves disbarred if they use their correct names.  Candidates who are vexatious, seek to mislead, confuse, and deceive and provide inaccurate information, but if a candidate provides his proper name he will be disbarred unless he is commonly called by that name.  People are entitled to use the Irish or English versions of their names to describe themselves, but they could be disbarred from being nominated, or considered by the returning officer as being properly nominated, because they are not commonly known by the version on the nomination paper.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) refers to a name containing a political reference.  I think that is a minefield.  Examples have been given already in relation to the de Valera name. Let me give another; I know a gentleman whose Christian name is Eamon de Valera Sharkey.  There is a clear political reference in his name, because his father was a great de Valera supporter and he decided that his eldest son would have the name of the man he admired.  That is not a fault, that is an admirable thing, but it does contain a political reference. Under this legislation that could disbar him from being properly nominated as a candidate for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give even another example, which has been relatively common in <Col N="408" /> recent times.  The daughter of a politician may go forward for election and, having married, retain her father's name for political purposes and it is proper that she should.  An example, of course, is our own Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. I am not sure how that name could be construed under this legislation as it contains a reference to her father who was a TD, and her name helped to get her elected.  This is a minefield, particularly, in relation to paragraphs (a) and (d).</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) refers to a name being &ldquo;unduly long&rdquo; which is something we should not bother with.  As we said, we could get around that by providing equal space for each name.  We have never had instances of abuse of that kind and it is not proper to introduce restrictions where there has not been a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister could take on board what we are saying and not pay too much attention to what former Minister Boland said. He is a member of another political party. The substance of what former Minister Boland was saying, I believe, is covered in paragraph (b), which provides that the returning officer shall object to the name of a candidate where, in the nomination paper, such name &ldquo;is misleading and likely to cause confusion&rdquo;.  That, to my mind, covers the multitude.  If we keep the other paragraphs also, we are only leading ourselves into trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Boland was quoted at length. Deputy Boland and I shared common membership of the Fine Gael Party but, as far as I am concerned, that is as far as it goes.  I am not bound by the opinions of any former Minister of my party or anybody else.  I strongly believe &mdash; and I know this view is shared by others, including Senator Honan, that this House has a duty to assert its own independence. Simply telling me what ex-Minister Boland said some time ago is not dealing with the question I raised.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a specific question.  I am sure the Minister has advice available to him on this.  It concerns section 52 (3):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The returning officer shall object to the name of a candidate in a nomination paper if such name &mdash; (a) is not a name by which the candidate is commonly known;</P>
    <P>I referred to a person in my county whose Christian names are Patrick Joseph, he is commonly known as Sonny.  If, for example, the returning officer insists that that name should appear on the ballot paper and if the man in question wishes to be described as Patrick Joseph, what comeback has he?  If the candidate should succeed in getting his name Patrick Joseph on the ballot paper, even though he is commonly known as Sonny, is the integrity of that ballot paper safe from challenge in the courts, in view of subsection (4)?  It is a very direct and simple question and I should like a simple answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach and the Minister have been urging us to speed up the debate, saying we have already debated this amendment for one hour.  I think the debate on these amendments could be speeded up significantly if the Minister would answer the questions that are put to him.  Senator Howard asked a very direct and specific question, which also concerns me.  I do not know the man in question but it would be a grave injustice if that were to happen.  If the Minister addresses that problem to our satisfaction, I am sure we would be happy to move on to the next amendment, but if the Minister does not address the problems we have, I do not think he can expect us to do anything but continue to raise the same objections.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senators Howard and Hederman.  In this area of electoral activity we have had our fair share of law, people have been through <Col N="410" /> the legalities of it and quite a number of people involved in politics understand the regulations and the laws in this matter very well.  These provisions are set pieces for landing people into the courts.  In some cases it will be because they have been genuinely discriminated against and have been at the receiving end of unfair decisions, other people will simply seize an opportunity, which is available to them, to create difficulties during elections. I would like to repeat what Senator Costello said in relation to the proposal to delete paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) and specifically refer to the paragraph the Minister quoted in relation to the one time proposal to run ten or 15 candidates with the name of &ldquo;Peter Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.  That difficulty would be readily catered for by paragraph (b).  It would be ruled out on the grounds that is would be misleading and would be liable to cause confusion.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider what has been said, to go back and have another look at this subsection and perhaps come back to us on Report Stage. This is a matter of genuine concern.  The present wording is a recipe for problems at election time which will be very unfair to a number of candidates who will find themselves discriminated against.</P>

      <P>This section is discriminatory. It militates against local democracy.  It gives free postage for Dáil elections but not for local elections.  I do not see why such discrimination or such anti-democratic sections should remain in the Bill.  If we value local democracy &mdash; and if we had local democracy in this country &mdash; we would want the electorate to know what the issues were as we do in a general election.  This section makes it clear what I, to my great distress, have discovered since I came to the Seanad. In spite of the very grandiose language they use in Europe about subsidiarity being a basic plank of the European Treaty and being so important if we are to have more centralisation in Europe, <Col N="414" /> must be counterbalanced by local democaracy, when it comes to the crunch the Government will say they will not do anything.  I raised this issue here after they signed the Council of Europe charter on local self-government and I got an emphatic no, they would not do it.  That is evidence that they do not tolerate the possibility that local democracy could be introduced in this country.</P>
      <P>When you were absent from here and there was an Acting Leas-Chathaoirleach, we were speaking about Maastricht. When I raised this issue, I was told it had nothing to do with Europe and that it was a national issue; there was a Fianna Fáil Acting Chairman.  It is outrageous that this section, puts the emphasis on giving free postage only to candidates at Dáil elections and not local elections.  I protest in the strongest possible terms.</P>

      <P>The Senator is talking on the amendments I have ruled them out of order because they involve a charge on the Revenue.  The Senator can make her point on it and has done so.  Is the section agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the amendments have been ruled out of order because they would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  The section merits comment because this facility &mdash; which one could only describe as privilege &mdash; is given to one group &mdash; candidates to Dáil elections; is not given to those involved in local elections. However, NUI and Trinity candidates to Seanad elections are entitled to free post. This means there are anomalies in the system which we have to iron out.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell us why he intends to entrench this anomaly in the system.  There should be free postage for candidates to Dáil elections, also for local and Seanad elections.  The latter groups can reasonably feel aggrieved because they do not have the facility which is afforded to Dáil candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add to some of the points made by Senators Costello and Hederman on elections to the Dáil and <Col N="415" /> Seanad.  I presume the purpose behind making free postage available to candidates is to enable them to get their message across to the electorate.  No one here would have any doubts or reservations about the importance of candidates to local government being in a position to get their message and ideas across to the public.  In many ways there is a better case to be made for making free postage available to candidates in local government elections because local government elections do not attract the same degree of national publicity as general elections or the same turnout.  I do not want to say that the increased turnout is entirely due to the fact that free postage is made available to candidates in general elections; nonetheless, it may be a factor. In local elections every local election area has to be considered separately.  It has problems and issues specific to the particular area.  Those problems and issues cannot be dealt with at a national level. The provision of free postage to candidates in local elections would be very important.  In local elections there is an increased number of Independent candidates. There are large numbers of people new to the political process who do not have much back-up or advice.  The provision of a one mail shot for such people would allow them to get their message across to the public and help the democratic process.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the point of view expressed already. Local elections do not, as was stated earlier, attract national media coverage either on the television or in the national papers.  Having regard to the vastness of some of the electoral areas and to the difficulties of communication in the rural areas, there is an absolute necessity to support the point made already.  There should be the same facilities granted for local elections as there are for Dáil elections. The case for such facilities for local elections is even stronger.  I would strongly urge the Minister to take that matter on board.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I do not wish to take up the time of the House by going over the various points that have been made.  I accept those points, particularly in relation to the local government elections.  I am also concerned that the section is silent on the availability of free post for Seanad elections.  It would be a dereliction of duty on our part if we did not refer to that particular aspect of it. I would certainly invite the Minister to comment.  There appears to be discrimination in the section in relation to Seanad elections and also in relation to local government elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the case made by Senator Howard.  It referred to a Dáil election and must surely include a Seanad election.  I am very much in favour of making post available to anybody who is standing for election.  I believe we should take pride in our democratic process here and assist it in whatever way possible.  I regret that the Minister has not availed of the opportunity to make postage available to candidates in Seanad elections.  Outgoing candidates have postage, but other candidates are at a disadvantage.  They do not have that same advantage of having free postage available to them.  I would <Col N="417" /> like to hear the Minister explain why the opportunity was not availed of on this occasion to make such a facility available to new candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting somewhat concerned that there does not appear to be a willingness to exchange views or to respond to what are legitimate points being made.  I have been told that this Bill relates to Dáil elections as been presented by the Minister on 13 December last.  It is entitled &ldquo;an Act to provide for the registration of electors and the conduct of elections to Dáil Éireann and to amend and extend the Presidential Elections Acts, 1937 to 1986, the European Assembly Elections Acts, 1977 to 1986, the Referendum Acts, 1942 to 1987, the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Acts, 1937 to 1973, the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts, 1947 to 1972, the Local Government Elections Acts, 1963 to 1991, and to provide for related matters&rdquo;.  What we are discussing here are &ldquo;related matters&rdquo;.  The local government elections are part of it.  I do not want to be fobbed off by being told I am wide of the mark.  I am not.  It is there in the Title of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to what Senator Howard has said, I would like to add to his remarks, which I totally agree with.  There is not a line of demarcation between Dáil elections and local elections. In practical terms there is a very close relationship between them.  In fact, in the context of personnel, it is rather unpractical to put them in separate compartments. The people whom we should be concerned about here in the context of local elections are very much isolated. They are community candidates.  We have many of them in the country at the moment.  I do not accept, for reasons expressed by Senator Howard and by others, that local election candidates should be excluded from this consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as confused as Senator Howard.  I read exactly what he read out.  Section 10 is an entire section <Col N="418" /> devoted to the registration of local government electors.  There are further references on the pages.  Section 13 is riddled with references to local government elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same problem as the other Senators.  We have a section here which refers specifically to nominations. It refers presumably to nominations in relation to the Dáil elections. The actual Bill describes itself as having a broader category in relation to Seanad elections, amending the legislation, local elections and related matters.  When we look at the explanatory memorandum it seems to confine the purpose of the Bill purely to Dáil elections.  We have a confusing statement of intent in this legislation in terms of the explanatory memorandum and in terms of what is said on the last page of the Bill itself.  We have within the section definitions in relation to whose entitled to elect, who is entitled to be on the franchise in relation to Dáil elections, Seanad elections, local elections and European elections.  That is covered within the content of the Bill itself.  I do not think that it is appropriate for the Minister, as Senator Howard said, to fob us off and say that this matter is not relevant.</P>
      <P>If it is not relevant here we would appreciate the Minister telling us where it is relevant to be raised in the context of the legislation, I would say that there are two areas that should be addressed here.  First, the Seanad, which allows for free postal service being granted to a certain category of Seanad candidates, whereas other categories are denied this service.  Second &mdash; and this is something that has not been referred to date &mdash; the European elections.  Will the Minister refer to that also?  What is the proposal there?  What will the situation be in relation to European elections, which of course are becoming a much more urgent matter now and will be in the years to come?  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the matter is irrelevant and give us no answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that we have had a paucity of answers in relation to our specific questions <Col N="419" /> throughout the course of the day. That has led to arguments, because we have not got replies.  There have not been specific replies, or even general replies, to a lot of the points we have raised. At the same time the Minister is not responding to us on the floor.  He is not prepared to take the Bill back and come back to us on Report Stage.  We are not really getting a decent deal in this House in relation to this legislation.  Let me assert also that this legislation has been introduced in this House.  This is the first teasing out of this legislation.  We have a particular burden of responsibility to ensure that the legislation is teased out to the full.  It is not as though it has been dealt with in the other House and is coming up to us.  It has been initiated here.  It would be a dereliction of duty if we did not probe it as thoroughly as we are attempting to do.  It is disappointing that the Minister and his advisers are not coming up with responses to the real questions we are raising here.  I would like the Minister to be much more responsive and forthcoming in his attitude towards his legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to assure the House that if there are any misunderstandings then I am not responsible. I am very clear on my functions here.  The Bill deals primarly with Dáil elections.  There is a separate code for the Seanad.  There is a separate code for the local elections.  There is a separate code for the European elections.  I want to make it very clear here that I have endeavoured to be helpful to all Senators during the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Again, the Cathaoirleach has ruled an amendment out of order.  Therefore, we are not in a position to discuss free postage for local government elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point that has been made by the Minister.  We can, however, discuss the contents of the section.  There is no question about that. I have disallowed the amendment on the grounds that there was a potential change <Col N="420" /> on the Revenue.  May I ask if Senator Costello wishes to comment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is not accurate for the Minister to say that the amendments have been ruled out of order and, therefore, there is no need for a reply.  We were asking questions in relation to the entire section.  We are seeking clarification on matters in the entire section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 57 deals with the law in relation to the right of candidates to free postage at a Dáil election.  A change from existing law in this section means that a person who is a candidate in respect of more than one constituency at the same election will in future be entitled to free postage in respect of one such constituency only.  A further new provision will allow the Minister for the Environment, after consultations with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and any other interested parties, to vary by regulation the free postage arrangements provided for in this section.  Such regulations would require prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that the facility in the Bill will enable the Minister to grant free postage to local election candidates for local elections?  Could we have a little more clarification on what the possibilities are under this regulation in this section?  Could the Minister let us know what would be the position in the European elections, or what would be the position in relation to local elections? In other words, does that provision enable the Minister to make regulations which would allow for free postage in local elections or in European elections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting more confused every time the Minister replies. Does that mean the section to which we objected so much &mdash; section 52, dealing with the way a candidate puts his name on the ballot paper &mdash; will not apply to a candidate at a local election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, we are not re-opening the discussion on that.  We have agreed the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Members were speaking of local government electors being given free postage.  Arising from that I understood the Minister to say that this Bill was not concerned with the local elections.  It is only concerned with the Dáil elections.  I am asking, therefore, if I am not misunderstanding the situation, whether it is a fact that other sections of this Bill, such as section 52, will not apply at the local elections?  Will I be able to stand at the next local elections and call myself Carmencita Hederman, Community, if I want to?</P>
      <P>The Minister said when dealing with this section that the change in the legislation from last time is that a candidate standing in more than one area will only be allowed to have free postage in relation to one area only.  Does the Minister not think that by jacking up the fee to £500 he is a bit hard on them?  He is not even giving them free postage if they are standing in more than one area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, after protracted debate we have agreed section 52.  The point being raised by Senator Hederman is extremely relevant.  How are we to know, as we debate each section, which election it refers to if the Minister is taking the attitude that he has taken on this section?  The Title of the Bill has been referred to by Senator Howard. That clearly states that it refers to all elections, as far as I can make out, including local elections.  How are we to know which section refers to which election when it is not stated in the Bill which election we are dealing with as we come to each section?  The matter will have to be clarified before there is any further discussion on the Bill.  It is pointless to raise matters here which are relevant to local elections if the Bill does not refer to local elections.  Obviously, it did not arise in the debate on section 52.  If it had arisen, what would the Minister's reply have been?  It is relevant on this section to know where we are going on the Bill. I would ask the Minister to have the matter clarified.  If he cannot clarify it now, perhaps he would clarify it when the matter comes up for debate again.  If we are debating it tomorrow or the next day &mdash; I do not know what the Order of Business is &mdash; perhaps the Minister would clarify it.</P>

    <P>This motion is very appropriate at this time because it deals with all the types of funding we have and, very importantly, the referendum we will have on 18 June.  In that regard, the need for highly skilled workforce is essential for Ireland's future economic well being.  The effects <Col N="424" /> of the Single European Market on peripheral regions of the Community, such as Ireland, will be particularly significant. In order to counter the handicaps under which Irish industry already operates, such as the small size of our domestic market and our relative geographical remoteness, Irish industry needs to achieve particularly high levels of efficiency.  This can only be done by the acquisition and application of a highly skilled and enterprising work force.</P>
    <P>The recently published report from the Industrial Policy Review Group drew attention to the need for Irish education and training systems to be more relevant to the manpower needs for industrial enterprise and development.  The group concluded that:</P>
    <P>The present Irish education and training arrangements need to be more applicable to present economic employment conditions, to the specific manpower needs of industry and to the nation's development needs.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that we should look to the training systems in other countries that have proved to be effective in providing a highly skilled and adaptable work force.</P>
    <P>The German system, in particular, was held up as a model from which Ireland could learn in order to improve our vocational training system.  In this regard I understand that an Irish delegation have just returned from a very successful visit to Germany where they were able to examine the German dual system of vocational training; and FÁS and the Department of Education, the CII and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were represented on that particular group. Vocational training in Germany is largely the responsibility of industry where the State plays a secondary role.  This responsibility has been accepted by German industry for hundreds of years and training is seen as an investment rather than an expense.  The German vocational training system for young people is the dual system so called because it involves practical vocational training and provides experience in the <Col N="425" /> workplace, backed up by theoretical training and general education provided in State run vocational schools, which are attended for one to two days each week by the apprentice.  Very importantly, attendance is compulsory.  Approximately 90 per cent of all 16 year old school leavers participate in the dual system.  There are approximately 380 recognised training occupations in the dual system which represent a basis for more than 20,000 specialised occupations.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we look at that type of system of education development of our education and training schemes for the future.  As an adaptation of that system and heading in that direction a number of initiatives have been taking place in this country over the last couple of years.  There are a number of projects involving co-operation between Irish education and labour agencies and they featured prominently over the past three years.  For example, CERT, the national training agency with responsibility for the tourist industry, together with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, have developed a European tourism programme for VPT working with AFTA, a French vocational training agency.  A new module on vocational skills, tourism, language and culture was developed and introduced into existing vocational training programmes for the tourism industry in both countries.</P>
    <P>A further example of the co-operative nature of the programme involves FÁS, the training and employment authority, also working with the Dublin vocational education committee on the development of a training module for the trainers of young disadvantaged people in vocational training.  FÁS and Limerick University have also co-operated on a local basis on pilot projects involving training of trainers working in community training workshops and Youthreach centres in the mid-west region.  I am very much aware, being from the mid-west, of the activity that is taking place there.  There are very substantial success rates in that programme.  I am pleased to <Col N="426" /> note also that the education and labour bodies have also been able to work together both on a national and international basis with a framework for the PETRO programme.  I am confident of further co-operation in the years ahead, which is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the Youth Exchange Bureau for the work they have carried out in the provision of technical assistance for the programme in both Departments since 1988.  The Minister is responsible for the European Social Fund and it is an extremely important portfolio.  It provides massive financial support for training and employment programmes in this country. In the five year period to the end of 1993 over £1 billion, or almost 40 per cent of all the Structural Fund resources approved for Ireland will have been received from the European Social Fund. When aligned to the matching Exchequer finances £2 billion will be spent on those vocational training and education programmes which are confinanced by the European Community.</P>
    <P>The scale of investment in the development of human resources and its contribution to national training and education provision is very apparent in all of the schemes.  Equally, the increase in the annual leave of European Social Fund transfers has been dramatic.  In 1989, for example, the ESF receipts totalled £139 million and in 1991 £371 million was transferred to Ireland from the European Social Fund.  That is a massive improvement in funds by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
    <P>ESF support spans a range of economic sectors as well as assisting programmes for the disadvantaged and the disabled. Training provided by FÁS is comprehensively supported together with vocational training programmes in the regional technical colleges, which meet the skill needs of industry and the services sector.  Training for the hotel, catering and tourism areas provided by CERT and the third level colleges in the educational sector is largely financed from the Social Fund.  Training for farmers, fishermen and foresters is assisted.  Training for <Col N="427" /> young people, long term unemployed and the disabled is significantly supported by and fundamentally dependant upon financial resources provided through the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of European Union envisages an even wider scope for the intervention of the Social Fund after 1993. Possibilities for the funding of new areas in the education and health sectors are now under review within the European Commission.  Being involved in the educational sector, I am very pleased at the whole development in relation to specific funding for the educational sector and the huge amounts of money that will come on stream specifically related to education and training post-1993.  It will be absolutely vital in the whole development for our young people.  The scale of financial resources available to the Social Fund primarily to achieve their objectives of economic and social cohesion in the less developed Community regions such as Ireland will be further substantially increased.</P>
    <P>To date we have been able to fully draw down on the Community funds provided for training and employment programmes. The outcome is positive, but with the present level of the unemployed it cannot in itself be seen as a barometer of success.  In formulating his contribution to the national development plan, which will form the shape and content of the next Community support framework for Ireland, the Minister will no doubt assess the effectiveness of the huge levels of expenditure on training to date which I have outlined.  As he is the Minister with responsibility for the European Social Fund, I know he is determined to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from such expenditure and that the central objective of equipping those trained to skills and competencies to get jobs is realised.</P>
    <P>The achievement of that objective may require a better balance in the type of training now being assisted by the Structural Funds, with a greater emphasis on training for those sectors with the greatest potential for growth and the provision <Col N="428" /> of jobs.  Its achievement certainly requires a far more positive approach on the part of employers in identifying and providing for their own training needs and in the influence on the content and relevance of vocational training programmes provided by State agencies and the institutions.  It is in that regard that it is extremely important that we look very closely at the dual system that operates under the German scheme, where in fact the employers take it for granted that they are the people who will benefit directly from all of these training schemes.  Therefore, they have the responsibility to ensure that they take on the burden of training those people and state itself has, as I mentioned already, just a secondary role.  It is regarded in Germany as an investment and not as an expense.  That is the way it should be. The people who will benefit in the long term from all of these things are the people who should make the biggest contribution to it in the long term.</P>
    <P>If the enhancement of the job prospects of trainees dictates that the quality of the training, which is co-financed by the European Social Fund and by the Irish Exchequer is a more fundamental criteria than throughput numbers, then that reality should be recognised and acted upon.  We have seen in recent times a far greater emphasis on the quality of training provisions supported by the European Social Fund.  While the measurement of the effectiveness of training schemes is a complex issue, in my view the primary focus will be its impact on the unemployment situation. The new Treaty will reinforce those achievements and bring Community action into areas which benefit the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>Consumer affairs is a subject for a special chapter; so are education and health, as I have mentioned already.  The citizens own rights are recognised in the Treaty.  These benefits exist apart from the wider benefits which Economic and Monetary Union and the improvements in the cohesion dimension will bring. Education, health, environment and culture are of vital and immediate significance <Col N="429" /> to the individual citizen.  We should bear all of this in mind when we consider our vote on 18 June.  It is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Non-ratification would sacrifice Ireland's contribution.  It would throw away 20 years of effort by successive Irish Governments and the commitment of the Irish people over that period.  Without even considering what we would lose by not having access to the benefits of the new Treaty, it is clear that we would put at risk the achievements of the past two decades.  On that note, I just want to restate again how important it is that we have a massive &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.  I ask all the people to just sit back, take a look at this in the quite of their homes and ask themselves a simple question: &ldquo;What alternative do we have in view of the huge benefits that have accrued to us over the past years and that will accrue to us in future years?&rdquo;.  If people ask themselves that specific question there is absolutely no alternative but a massive &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a very important motion and I would like to congratulate Senator McKenna for bringing it forward.  I cannot agree fully with the motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the significant contribution being made by the European Social Fund to training and employment in this country...</P>
      <P>There is not a large contribution being made to training and employment in this country by the European Social Fund in comparison to our EC colleagues.  I agree, of course, with the section that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> requests the Minister for Labour to ensure that in the rules to be adopted covering the fund for 1994-1997, the fund will make an even greater contribution to training and employment.</P>
    <P>The whole area of training and employment and the use of training to create employment has to be looked at again and a total revamp of it undertaken.  In comparison to our EC colleagues we have not been successful in obtaining the full advantage from the contribution of the Social Fund to the economy.  In fact, Ireland has been very successful in obtaining money from the European Social Fund, and our EC colleagues are often amazed at the numbers we supply as having been trained under the schemes benefiting such funding.  But the fact of the matter is that the training on the ground at the end of the day is uncoordinated, lacks direction and does not achieve what is referred to in this motion: &ldquo;a contribution to employment in this country.&rdquo;  The most blatant statistic to confirm this is our unemployment levels. Despite the artificial changes in the calculating system, we are now facing 300,000 unemployed.  Even with the great contribution from the Social Fund to create skills, we still have too large and unacceptable unemployment figures. That is the main statistic that evaluates how successful we are in obtaining marketable skills.</P>
    <P>With regard to comparison with our European colleagues &mdash; and Senator McKenna compared us with Germany &mdash; we have a big gap with Europe in skill levels.  We have one of the lowest uptakes in training for industrial purposes.  We will have to look at the sitution again, because European industry will be more skilled and more competitive.  We must increase our skills in industry, but we are failing to do this in comparison to our competitors.  We must ensure that we have a high level of skill in industry to match the competition there at the moment and the increased competition we will have from our partners in Europe.</P>
    <P>Irish industry is a poor trainer.  In fact, the incidence of training in industry is <Col N="431" /> lower in Ireland and the duration of training is half as long as our European competitors. This not only applies for operative level but right up to managerial level.  Irish industry is not as active or as committed to systematic training and development of its employees up to managerial level as our European competitors.</P>
    <P>I note from the report entitled &ldquo;Industrial Training in Ireland&rdquo; by Dr. Frank Roche and Mr. Paul Tansey in connection with the Culliton report that the large companies train more than the small companies, overseas companies are more active in training than native companies and modern companies are more active than traditional companies.  Overall, our training duration and courses are just half that of our EC colleagues.  Our supply side for training, the number of trainers and training organisations, is excellent in comparison with our EC colleagues.  It is the demand that is the problem.  It is the lack of commitment from industry that is creating the difficulty despite the contribution coming from the European Social Fund to such training.  We have a definite skill gap between our employees in industry and our European partners. That gap must be clearly identified, measured and a training programme to ensure that we are competitive with our European partners must be established.</P>
    <P>It is significant that FÁS, who obtain more money than any other organisation from the European Social Fund, spend just one eleventh on training support for people at work to improve their skills. Some 90 per cent of the FÁS budget for training is allocated to unemployed people.  Half of this is on training provision directly and the other half to work experience and community-type work, such as social employment schemes and so on.  It is significant that half of the FÁS budget for training, some 45 per cent, is directed towards work experience and community-type work programmes.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the level of skills training in these is practically non-existent in most cases.  There is no co-ordinated approach to directing the work experience or the <Col N="432" /> training, if present in those courses, to achieving employment afterwards.  There is no placement policy for such people. They go on a course for 12 months or whatever and at the end they go back on the unemployed list.  The main achievement of such programmes is to reduce the unemployment figures.  That has been repeated over and over again but it deserves repetition.  Dr. Roche and Mr. Tansey identified and looked at the success of the long term unemployed in obtaining subsequent employment.  They said:</P>
    <P>There is a near unanimous unwillingness to recruit among the long term unemployed.  Given the scale of new entrants to the labour market over the next decade, the strategy of providing industry training to the long term unemployed is questionable on economic grounds.</P>
    <P>I am saying is that the second part of Senator McKenna's motion should be clearly looked at with a view to having an overall review and a root and branch approach to the whole area of employment to ensure that we are training people for employment and not just training people or giving them work experience for the sake of doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on this important motion relating to the European Social Fund.  It is opportune to reflect at this time on the real benefits which Community membership has conveyed on this country since our accession in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community funds are the materials expression of solidarity with those member states whose economic development compares unfavourably with the more wealthy Community countries.  Financial transfers are intended to be used to progressively bridge the gap in economic performance and give expression to the concept of economic and social cohesion. A public realisation and appreciation of their value in assisting a country like ours to put in place a sound basis for economic and social progress is important.  It is <Col N="433" /> meaningful to people and reinforces the concept of Community solidarity.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty envisages economic and monetary union by the end of this century.  It recognises the difficulties which this fundamental development can give rise to for the poorer member states and proposes enhanced supports to alleviate those difficulties.  Accordingly, Structural Funds assistance is an integral part of Community policy and underpins moves towards European Union in the time scale identified at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour I have responsibility for overall policy in Ireland relating to the European Social Fund.  I want to give the House some insight into the contribution which that fund has made and the levels of financial support which it has given us to date.  In the ten years from the date of our accession to the European Community in 1973 up to 1983 the total of Social Fund payments which we received amounted to IR£326 million.  Last year alone, 1991, payments received from this source amounted to IR£371 million.  In other words, a sum greater than that paid in the course of the first decade of our membership of the European Community was received by us in the last calendar year alone from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>This year over IR£428 million will be spent on co-financed vocational training and employment programmes in this country.  This significant level of expenditure is intended to fund the training of more than 175,000 people in the current year.  Fifteen different training agencies benefit from EC financial support and provide training schemes to assist in the achievement of national policies for economic development and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>This year the Department of Education will get from that £428 million a sum of IR£125 million from the Social Fund; they are the biggest beneficiary from those funds.  That money makes a fundamental contribution to providing vocational education in the second level system, to supporting a wide range of courses run in the regional technical colleges and to co-financing vocationally-oriented <Col N="434" /> programmes in our universities. Structural Fund transfers to the education sector fund the payment of maintenance grants to students.  At present, there is a review going on in which a response will be available from the Government in due course.  It will also contribute to the salary costs of trainers and teachers, finance purchases of teaching materials and the addition, or modernisation, of the stock of buildings and equipment.</P>
    <P>The European Union Treaty envisages a more liberal interpretation of the possibilities for EC funding in the education sector.  With the high proportion of our young people in education and the commitment of Irish parents to providing the best educational opportunities for their children, this reinforced EC emphasis on supporting the Exchequer contribution to education is clearly welcome in this country.  A young country like ours stands to benefit to a proportionately greater extent.  While the population of most countries is quickly ageing, by the end of this century we will have 100,000 young people participating in third-level education alone and up to 72 per cent of our total population of working age.</P>
    <P>The potential for increased financial assistance to the third level sector of education from the European Social Fund is great.  The realisation of our economic potential, the high educational standards which apply and the participation and completion rates in our third level colleges all combine to make a compelling case for the promised liberalisation of funding possibilities from the ESF which the ratification of the European Union Treaty presents for us next Thursday week.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund will assist the activities of FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, by allocating IR£103 million to that organisation this year.  Those funds are essential towards ensuring that the unemployed, young people, those in employment and those undergoing apprenticeships have access to training and retraining programmes. Those programmes will enhance their employment prospects, <Col N="435" /> their skill levels and their facility to adapt to conditions of increased competitiveness and technological application.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another sector which benefits from the European Social Fund. Almost IR£9 million will be provided by the ESF this year for training at all levels particularly within CERT.  When matched by the Exchequer contribution over IR£13 million will be spent on training for the tourism industry in 1992.  This training is being organised by CERT and by the Department of Education in CERT training centres, in regional technical colleges, at the Cathal Brugha Street College of Catering and at other third level institutions.  The EC is co-financing management training, skills training and courses particularly devised to equip persons who have been out of work for long periods to gain an expertise and real hope of access to work in the tourism industry, which has so much potential for growth and the generation of worthwhile employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the EC Structural Funds are contributing very significantly to the establishment of the new purpose built CERT training centre now nearing completion at Amiens Street in Dublin.  The total cost of this project is almost IR£5 million and its completion this summer will allow CERT to more efficiently and effectively train in the order of 10,000 people each year.  Over 85 per cent of those trained on these programmes find work on completion of their courses.  The continuation of this level of training activity is fundamentally dependent on the continuing financial support of the European Social Fund.  The availability, therefore, of 8,500 new jobs in the Irish tourism sector per year answers some of the points which Senator Neville made in relation to the rate of placement and job opportunities available to our trainees. CERT have done a wonderful job in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Social Fund also assists training in the primary economic sectors.  This year over IR£11 millions will be spent on training <Col N="436" /> provision for farmers, foresters and fishermen.  Of that IR£11 million, £7.3 million comes from the Social Fund.  The EC is strongly committed to assisting with the development of human resources so that the fishing and forestry industries, which also have such potential, can expand quickly and generate much needed employment opportunities particularly in rural communities.  The EC is very much disposed to consider significantly increased financial allocation for these sectors in the course of the next phase from 1994 to 1997.  Equally an emphasis of facilitating and encouraging the widest development of rural communities is evident from the vantage point of the EC.  Off-farm and alternative economic enterprises will in future years play an increasingly important part in determining the economic well being and living standards of such communities and providing supplementary income for farmers on the land.</P>
    <P>The maximisation of the potential for growth and development in these areas is critically dependent on the provision of proper training at all levels &mdash; on the availability of highly developed skills, the applications of modern technology, the identification and development of enterprise potential and the existence of trained and competent managerial and supervisory personnel.  The Social Fund makes a very significant contribution already to enhancing potential for further development through training.  As I have indicated, its disposition is to contribute to an even greater degree to the provision of those training programmes directed towards contributing to economic development objectives in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A cornerstone of the political determination for a more integrated European Community is the need to bring about greater economic and greater social cohesion.  From the perspective of the European Social Fund this objective must incorporate continuing support for the disabled and the most socially disadvantaged, a point perhaps missed by Roche and Tansey in their report.  Training for these categories does not always <Col N="437" /> respond to considerations which are exclusively informed by the development needs of an economy.  The regulations to govern the European Social Fund in the period 1994-97 will have to take account of this fact because it is important that there be clarity on the purposes for which Community financial assistance is provided and realism in determining the outcomes which it can achieve.</P>
    <P>In saying this I am fully conscious of the very considerable assistance which has been provided to date from the European Social Fund.  Programmes have been funded to assist with the intergration of disadvantaged young people into the labour market, to address the problems of the long term unemployed and to provide training for the significant section of our population who suffer physical or mental handicap.  This year alone the European Social Fund is contributing almost IR£73 million to co-finance training programmes for these disadvantaged and disabled sections of our population.</P>
    <P>From the end of the last year the European Commission no longer contributes to spending on the social employment scheme.  As a consequence, the Exchequer has this year to fully fund the SES at a total cost of almost £73 million. This scheme is exclusively aimed at those long term unemployed people who are over 25 years of age.  It allows for part-time employment on improvement schemes which deliver amenity or environmental benefits to local communities throughout the country.  Participation on the scheme should assist in the rehabilitation into working life of those who have suffered from long spells of unemployment and improve their chances of getting work.  I know that this scheme is generally valued and does confer benefits.  I am anxious to have it reinstated for assistance from the Social Fund post-1993 and I will be making a very strong case with that objective in mind.  It is clear also that programmes such as the social employment scheme cannot be assessed exclusively by reference to economic criteria.  There is a need for a training element in those <Col N="438" /> schemes because that is the essential criteria which ESF funding will be obtained from the European Community.  I have been speaking to public authorities, county councils and corporations who have successfully employed many people on that scheme over the past few years. It is important that we get as much funding as possible from that direction otherwise, in a metaphorical sense, we will all land on our backsides.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, my concern is to have a clearer view of the economic and social objectives of training and employment programmes to be assisted under the Community Support Framework for Ireland in the years 1994 to 1997.</P>
    <P>Apart from ESF funding for conventional training provision, over IR£20 million has been provided under three human resource Community initiatives &mdash; Euroform, Now and Horizon.  Euroform deals with pilot training initiatives related to technological change and the effect of the completion of the Internal Market.  NOW seeks to further promote equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training. Horizon funds are devoted to initiatives to assist the disabled and the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Participation in all three programmes is dependent on the establishment of linkages with compatible projects in other Community member states so that knowledge and experiences gained are enhanced and reinforced as a result of this transnational dimension.  A novel feature of these three programmes is that for the first time many voluntary and community groups have had access to Social Fund moneys to develop proposals in accord with EC guidelines and, where successful, have received Community funds to carry through the projects which they initiated.  In most cases these funds have dramatically improved the potential of these voluntary and community groups to realise their objectives and have had a very positive impact at the local level.</P>
    <P>Many now benefiting through involvement in these initiatives have for the first time been directly touched by the reality of the EC and realised the substantial <Col N="439" /> material benefits which it provides.  An appreciation of the reality of Europe at the local level is something which we have all been endeavouring to foster for some time.  In the area of training and the overall development of human resources the NOW, Euroform and Horizon EC programmes are having a very positive and beneficial impact.</P>
    <P>I have tried to give the House some insights to the wide range of training and employment related activities which the European Social Fund is co-financing in Ireland.  The level of national training provision is centrally dependent on this support.  In the five years 1989-93 the ESF will have contributed well in excess of £1 billion and transferred 65 per cent of the cash applied to fund all our co-financed training, education and employment programmes. In the period from 1994 onwards we can realistically look to even greater financial support and intervention rates of up to 75 per cent to enable us to continue and expand this centrally important task of education and training our people.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour I will ensure that the training provided supports to the greatest extent possible economic development and the creation of jobs. In recent times the emphasis has rightly been put on the quality of training and the skills differential that exists in many areas, as referred to by Senators McKenna and Neville.</P>
    <P>When comparisons are made with levels of skill and expertise which are required and commonplace in the central economies of Europe we recognise that these are improvements which we must make here to ensure that the very high levels of investments which I have outlined yield the maximum benefit.  With this in mind I have recently established in my Department an evaluation unit to look in particular at the quality of the full range of co-financed training provision and the extent to which it meets established objectives.  This is a central task and one to which I, as Minister for Labour, and the Commission of the European Communities are fully committed. <Col N="440" /> We want the best value for money and we want the best return in job creation and enterprise development terms.  On the other hand, as I have stated, I will not allow an excessive preoccupation with economic development to detract from the funding of training programmes for the disabled and the socially disadvantaged sections of our society.  While there is a need to clarify and disentangle the objectives of economic and social expenditure, equally the commitment to social cohesion in the Maastricht Treaty in my view requires that we continue to provide for the training needs of those whose potential to contribute to the realisation of national economic objectives is not immediate.</P>
    <P>I look forward to negotiating the adaptation of the regulations which now govern the operation of the European Social Fund.  These will inform the emphasis of ESF funding post-1993.  In this exercise I will have full regard to the needs of all sections of our population.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that proper training and development is fundamental to economic growth and social progress.  Where adaptations are necessary to achieve the maximum level of Social Fund support for Ireland, these will be introduced.  I am examining the need to expand the apprenticeship system in line with the German dual model, which was referred to by Senator McKenna in proposing this motion to the House, and the need for an employer-led apprenticeship system. We need more funding for employers. We need to change the whole ethos of Irish industry, particularly in the small and medium sized enterprises, so that employers look upon training as an investment rather than as a cost.  These are important policy issues which need to be determined immediately, given that I intend to publish a White Paper on manpower policy in the next few weeks which will seek to co-ordinate all these strands.</P>
    <P>I thank the Seanad for its interest in the impact which the Social Fund has had on training activity in this country.  I appreciate the co-operation and support of the Seanad.  It will assist my efforts to <Col N="441" /> increase this level of Community support for the Social Fund in the year ahead.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Labour to the House and thank him for a positive and enlightening speech.  I also pay tribute to Senator Neville, who has just left the House, for the positive way in which he responded to this debate. It is regrettable that the benches opposite are empty.  Indeed, it would be remiss of me if I let the opportunity pass without asking where are those people who have been most vociferous in seeking a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the past few weeks?  Senators Ryan and Murphy gave a press conference yesterday urging a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, but where are they today when we are discussing this most important issue pertaining to Europe, our involvement in Europe and the benefits we will derive from it?  One can only assume that they take this for granted.  Those campaigning for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on 18 June have a penchant for taking an emotive issue and building on it; but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of informing the people how their children will benefit they are not to be seen or heard.  It would be wrong of this House not to say that they are remiss in their duty by not being here to respond to this debate.</P>

    <P>This motion is timely having regard to the forthcoming referendum, because it is important to highlights the benefits the Irish community receive from full membership of the European Community.  As usual, once you have the bird in the hand you tend to forget about everything else. Parents take for granted that their child is pursuing a certificate course in electronic or mechanical engineering, or is doing a diploma in university or many other diverse courses.  They take it for granted that the fees are paid, that they receive a maintenance allowance and that their books are paid for.  It is natural not to ask questions in that situation.  Forty thousand young students in colleges throughout the country are benefiting from ESF funding.  We should stress to these young people that the money is not being supplied by their parents but that it is coming out of Europe.  A total of <Col N="442" /> £121 million comes directly from ESF funds to the Department of Education every year.  It caters for 20,000 middle level technician trainees and students in regional technical colleges, 10,700 vocational preparation and training courses, 4,000 vocational training opportunities and 4,000 apprentices.  That is not to be sniffed at and it is money we would not receive if we were not part of Europe.  I would ask those who are promoting a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on 18 June where they think the money will come from if we desist from participating fully in European Union?  They are being foolhardy. They should reconsider their decison and vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the interest of our young people.</P>
    <P>The NOW programme seeks to promote equal opportunity for women in vocational training and employment. Many innovative programmes have been developed to facilitate the participation of women in this area.  Traditionally, such programmes were not pursued by women and in some cases women were excluded from participating.  We now have a integration through the Now programme. Women may participate fully in those programmes and their re-entry to the job market will be enhanced as a result.  It is important to highlight this, having regard to the many unfounded and mischievous statements being made about the implications for women in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <P>The institution of the European Community has always been a positive influence in relation to women obtaining their rights, which had been denied to them in many western cultures in the past.  Full participation in Europe will ensure a continuation of this trend, and we must encourage that; but the greatest encouragement must come from the women themselves.  They will have an opportunity in the referendum on 18 June to openly and strongly say that they see their participation in Europe as an opportunity of enhancement and of ensuring that they play a meaningful role in our immediate communities, in our country, and, indeed, in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the performance <Col N="443" /> of CERT and the tourist industry in general.  In 1987 this Government set up a programme to develop this natural resource and create jobs in the tourism sector.  Who would have thought in 1987 that our catering industry today would be held in such high regard throughout the world?  Who would have thought that so many companies in the manufacturing sector would be presented with ISO 9000 awards, awards for excellence? Through their training programme in catering and tourism, CERT are demanding quality.  Because the level of education and the innovative training that is part and parcel of CERT courses, we are now seeking a quality mark in the catering industry.  Not too far down the road, like the manufacturing industry, our hotels, restaurants and those involved in the catering and tourism industry will seek marks of quality.  That is what we want to achieve because unless we achieve standards of excellence, we cannot and will not stand apart.  The opportunity is there; £51 million was provided in this area from 1990-93; 28,000 jobs were created in the catering industry alone during the period of this programme, not to mention tourist-related areas.  From where did this money come? It came from Europe and we will receive further funding there under the Cohesion Fund because our European partners see certain inequalities.</P>
    <P>Europe provides us with an opportunity through the ESF, EC funding and the operational programmes to stand alone, to make sure that our people acquire skills and, having acquired them, to apply them in setting up their own businesses in co-operation with CERT, FÁS and under ESF programmes.  With those skills and expertise we can create jobs in the indigenous sector.  We would be foolhardy, to vote anything but &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on 18 June.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is a young man with many bright ideas and I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Labour.  His speech this evening has been <Col N="444" /> enlightening and is a reminder of all the schemes funded through the Social Fund. Senator O'Keeffe said it was disappointing to hear people on the other side of the House, who are here morning, noon and night, pontificating about the lack of effort on the part of the Government promoting a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote next Thursday. If these moneys were not coming into the country what state would the country be in today and where would we get the natural resources for training programmes?</P>
      <P>I am extremely proud of this scheme and FÁS schemes.  When the FÁS schemes were introduced in the seventies I was one of the first people to get a scheme going in the village of Tarbert. Four old folks' homes were built under that scheme, enabling families who had been living in very poor conditions in the countryside to move into the village. Thereafter FÁS schemes continued to expand.  Over the past number of years approximately 28 stonemasons &mdash; a dying breed &mdash; have been trained in my area of Kerry under a FÁS scheme.  They are now earning a living and training other young people.  People with such skills are badly needed.</P>
      <P>The young people being trained under FÁS schemes will be future leaders not alone in Ireland, but also in Europe.  I know young people trained by FÁS, who have set up their own businesses in Germany and are now offering employment to other young Irish people.  Therefore, it is disappointing that people are campaigning for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved with CERT over the past number of years, numerous people from my county got high awards through CERT and are now in senior management posts in big hotels all over Europe.  The amounts of money paid in the first decade by the European Social Fund and the £428 million that will be spent this year alone to co-finance vocational training and employment programmes, are staggering and it is important that those moneys are spent in the proper way.  The German system is held up as a model but I am sure that Irish <Col N="445" /> people going over there will enlighten them as well as acquiring new skills.</P>
    <P>There is need for change in the running of FÁS schemes; there is no point training 100 people for jobs in carpentry when only ten jobs are needed.  The same applies to blocklayers, mechanics and so on.  I see people being trained to acquire skills which will enable them to work in different areas.  In Kerry people are being trained to take tourists on nature walks, etc., that is a skill in itself.  Tourists come here to see our sloblands and birdlife and Irish people attend nature courses and are being trained to take people on nature trails.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am delighted with the report he has given us because it copperfastens the reason the people of Ireland should come out &mdash; and this is only one angle &mdash; next Thursday and give a majority &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and I also welcome the Minister for Labour to the House and wish him well in his portfolio.  It is healthy politically to see a young man in such a senior position and I compliment him on his actions to date.  He has shown a steady hand in situations that he had to deal with up to now and I have no doubt he will make a great impression in that portfolio in the years to come.</P>
      <P>Today we are discussing the European Social Fund.  It is of vital importance that all aspects of European involvement are discussed because people are homing in on certain aspects of European development. They are homing in on matters that have not happened yet, without reflecting at all on our involvement in Europe over the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to reflect on and compare the situation when we joined the EC with the present. Some 20 years ago the Irish people took a bold step and decided to join the European Economic Community.  They did it on the basis that the Irish people were Europeans long before that.  In fact, anybody who has ever travelled to the cities in Europe will <Col N="446" /> find Irish names in the records of the universities, and involved in freedom fights.  The Irish have been involved in European affairs and have had glorious achievements in European cities down through the centuries.  We are geared to Europe.</P>
    <P>Many young Irish academics are proving themselves to be very successful in Europe.  The Irish people are regarded extremely highly in Europe.  They have proved themselves to be equal, if not better, than their counterparts.  Our fine educational system is partly responsible. I believe our educational system is second to none in the European context.  The European Social Fund has played its part particularly as far as regional technical colleges are concerned.  ESF funding provides opportunities for people to get third level education to national certificate and, in more recent times, to national diploma and degree levels.  These opportunities were not readily available prior to that because third level education was available only to those who could afford it or who were grant-aided on the grounds of ability.  Through Government lobbying for EC funds that scene changed and young people who had done reasonably well in their leaving certificate got the opportunity to continue to third level education and study for a certificate, diploma and in some cases a degree.  This was a major step.</P>
    <P>We have to consider whether moneys from the Structural Funds can be used to provide further opportunity in education. I am delighted the Government are emphasising the future development of education which is of vital importance.  I hope when final proposals for EC Structural Funds money are agreed we will create further opportunities to educate our young people at all levels.  Jobs are important but it is vitally important that people are equipped whether it be by academic or vocational education before they go on to the jobs market.  We have been conscious of that.</P>
    <P>I am sure Ministers have agonised on this matter at Cabinet down through the years.  When the Minister for Finance asked each Department to make cuts I <Col N="447" /> am sure it was with reluctance that education was asked to bear the brunt.  In fairness Fianna Fáil Cabinets in particular have shown down through the years two things are important to them, health and education.  Health involves the protection of the under-privileged and the poor, and education provides opportunities for our young people in the future.  Successive Governments are to be complimented, and in particular this Government are to be complimented, on the way they have set their priorities in favour of the education of our young people.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund plays a major part in a great many other activities whether in the training of the handicapped, the provision of courses to develop our tourism industry or whatever. One way or another the European Social Fund has played a major part in the development of Ireland in recent years and I have no doubt that with the involvement of the present Minister for Labour, a young progressive man, we will see further opportunities in that field. I hope that on 18 June the Irish people will realise their priority is to further enhance the opportunities that are now available to our young Irish people and thus lay down opportunities for future generations.</P>
    <P>Why should we, as Irish people, deny opportunities to the future generations of this country?  What is being built at present is a peaceful progressive and cooperative Europe.  Ireland and the Irish people want to be part of that and by being part of that we are providing for our young people opportunities that would not and could not be provided by a small national standing in its own. European involvement is of vital importance. Irish people think as Europeans and I ask that they vote for European Union on 18 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>In winding up this debate may I again compliment and congratulate the Minister on his very positive speech this evening.  It was enlightening to hear him outlining in detail the enormous <Col N="448" /> contribution the Social Fund makes to all aspects of education and training. I would like to thank the other speakers, Senators Neville, O'Keeffe, Dan Kiely and Finneran.</P>
      <P>May I refer in passing to those who were absent.  I agree with the views of speakers who said this is one of the most important debates we will have in this Chamber.  On other occasions people would be lining up to make a contribution on some petty debate.  I am absolutely amazed that when such an important topic is being discussed those people who are vociferous on most occasions were absent from the House.  However, that is their loss.</P>
      <P>I would accept by and large what Senator Neville said in relation to the application of the Social Fund.  By no stretch of the imagination is anyone suggesting that everything is absolutely perfect. Of course, people accept there is room for improvement and as the Minister said in his speech we must make the best use of the funds we get.  It is recognised that we must take advantage of what we get.  I am a little concerned at what Senator Neville said on unemployment. It is extremely important that the long term unemployed are given the opportunity to acquire new skills because otherwise they would have very little hope of getting employment when the opportunity arose.  We have to acknowledge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS schemes have been of tremendous advantage throughout the country. Young people have developed particular skills when participating in projects that have taken place in every single community, urban and rural.  FÁS schemes have been of enormous benefit to local communities.  I am sure everybody in this House is aware that applications come before the county council at every meeting for extra FAS schemes to come on stream.  That is proof positive of their success.  We have to give credit where credit is due and compliment the Minister and the Department of Labour on the operation of those schemes and the magnificent contribution they have made to life in rural and urban areas.  May I just <Col N="449" /> say to Senator Neville that while I respect Dr. Tansey greatly and am aware of his work, he is not always right.  From time to time he makes mistakes and what he advocates is not always correct in the final analysis.  His theories on how the Department of Labour and so on should operate, cannot be taken as Bible.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned tourism in his speech and I am delighted at the potential for job creation in the tourism industry. We have not even touched the tip of the iceberg in relation to the opportunities that are there to be exploited in the tourism related industries.  I am very pleased at the Minister's statement that £9 million is being provided by the EC for the development of off-farm and alternative enterprises.  It is extremely important that opportunities be given to people to develop off-farm or alternatives enterprises in the tourism sector.  Moneys from the Social Fund should be drawn down so that people will come up with projects to develop off-farm enterprises to augment their income from farm enterprises. I am delighted at the response to this type of development at present, because people are extremely interested in it and I can see such developments being of major importance in the years to come.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there is the possibility of extra funding for education. As the Minister said, assistance from the European Social Fund to the Department of Education is in excess of £121 million per annum.  By any yardstick that is a very significant contribution.  The assistance covers a range of vocational training and educational programmes, from courses for young people who have completed their compulsory schooling to post graduate courses in universities, as well as courses for the long term unemployed and for young people who left school with no qualifications.  It is important that we mention the Green Paper on Education at this juncture.  I understand there are proposals to develop a two tier second level education system with greater emphasis on vocational education geared towards the needs of industry.  Again we come back to this suggestion, and I take Senator Neville's point on the use of <Col N="450" /> moneys from the Social Fund for training and so on.  We are at one in suggesting that industry has not played its part in training.  That is why I instanced, and the Minister mentioned it as well, the two tier system in Germany, where industry itself takes the major responsibility for training and sees expenditure on training not as an expense but as an investment, and the State plays a secondary role in that area.  That is an extremely important point and we must take this on board when spending ESF funds.</P>
    <P>May I stress again the importance of funding from Europe?  The proposed doubling of the Structural Fund is extremely important.  I reiterate the point other speakers have made already; can anybody who looks at the benefits that have accrued to this country, both economic and socially, in the past 20 years since we joined Europe and the future potential benefits to accrue to this country advocate that we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 18 June?  It is a simple question.  I do not know how any right-thinking person could advocate to the general public that they should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Those engaged in kite-flying, innuendo, and scare-mongering on side issues that have absolutely no bearing on the referendum should consider the damage they would do to this country if they were to be successful.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his very positive contribution and all those who contributed to the debate.  I ask the House to give unanimous approval to this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this motion.  In so doing it would be appropriate if we were to wish the Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, who is ill, a speedy return to health and to his official duties.</P>
      <P>It is with frustration that I raise the subject of Rathkeale Community College. This issue has been going on now for 26 years.  Twenty six years ago, in 1966, the Department of Education suggested that joint facilities should be provided between the two schools in Rathkeale &mdash; the vocational school and the secondary school run by the Sisters of Mercy.</P>
      <P>At that time the Convent of Mercy decided to build a new school but following a request from the Department of Education they withdrew their plans. A contract was signed 26 years ago to construct the school at Rathkeale.  The Department informed the schools at the time that a comprehensive education plan for the town and the area would be introduced and that the suggestion of building the schools should be put on hold.  In 1973, almost 20 years ago, as a result of an initiative taken by the teachers of both schools, the Minister accepted the need for comprehensive education facilities by way of a community college or school in Rathkeale. In 1975 the Department outlined its policy on Rathkeale, to amalgamate the two schools and form one comprehensive school.  Authorisation for the new community school was given in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984, plans were put in train to purchase a site and in 1986 a schedule of accommodation was agreed.  In December 1990 the then proposed community school was changed to a community college and the vocational education committee then took over responsibility for it.  One and a half years later we are still asking the Department and the Minister <Col N="452" /> for Education to provide a new comprehensive school in Rathkeale.</P>
    <P>The areas serviced include the national schools around Rathkeale, Croagh, Cappagh, Kilfinane, Ahalin, Ballingarry and Granagh.  The present structure is totally unacceptable.  In expressing frustration, I am just mirroring the frustration of the parents and the people of Rathkeale because of the inadequate and totally unacceptable facilities for second level education at the Convent of Mercy in Rathkeale.  The school is comprised of prefabricated buildings, some of them almost 30 years old.  In extremes of weather, this creates enormous difficulties both for teachers and pupils.  In winter, the pupils and teachers are obliged to wear heavy clothing and their overcoats, and in summer it is very difficult to keep the building cool, especially in very hot weather.  They must cross the yards in all types of weather between classes to use toilets.</P>
    <P>I do not know many places like Rathkeale who have had to contend with this situation.  It has been going on for too long and people are very frustrated by it.  I ask the Minister to please give us a commitment tonight that work will start on this school by the end of this year.  I am not asking him to say it will start tomorrow or within the next two months, but that it will be started before the end of this year.  That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    <P>I dread the return to school after the summer holidays when parents realise that their children are going back to the existing conditions.  The vocational education committee have informed me of their commitment to the new college. At present, Stage 3 documents &mdash; detail design and contract documents &mdash; are with the vocational education committee and the acting chief executive officer informed me as late as today that they will be with the Minister within the next six weeks.</P>
    <P>I will quote from the vocational education committee letter:</P>
    <P>In reiterating the vocational education committee's commitment to establishing the new Community College as soon as is humanely possible, I should perhaps quote the Chairman <Col N="453" /> of Co. Limerick vocational education committee, Clr. Jim McCarthy who recently stated &ldquo;You can rest assured that the putting in place of the new College is regarded as an urgent priority by the vocational education committee.  Rathkeale students and teachers richly deserve a new post-primary school.  We are fully committed to this and I personally pledge the vocational education committee's total support towards bringing about the achievement of this objective in the shortest possible timespan.</P>
    <P>This was reiterated in a letter on 23 March 1992 from Mr. Seán Burke, the acting chief executive officer, who informed me that &ldquo;the college project in Rathkeale is at Stage 3 of the planning process and the Department have agreed that Stages 4 and 5 be combined and taken as one&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister not to bounce back and forth from the vocational education committee to the Department of Education because that is what is happening.  When we ask the vocational education committee they sometimes say it is with the Department and when we ask the Department they say it is with the vocational education committee.  Would they get together to try to expedite the plans and get the school started?</P>
    <P>This is my third time to raise the matter and I make no excuses; I raised it in 1990 with the then Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, and in April 1991 with the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  I ask the Minister of State on behalf of the pupils, parents, teachers and the people of Rathkeale to please give us some concrete information when this project will start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which gives me the opportunity to outline the present position in this case.  I should begin by explaining that while this project has been in planning for a number of years, changing circumstances, some very recent, illustrate how the planning of such large projects must often be amended at an advanced stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> In 1983 the Sisters of Mercy informed the Department that they could not proceed with the new secondary school. They were agreeable to participate in a community school and this development, with the agreement of the County Limerick vocational education committee, was approved by the then Minister for Education.  Following this agreement the project proceeded in accordance with the standard building procedures of the Department.  A site was acquired, a schedule of accommodation was agreed by the school authorities involved, a design team was appointed and architectural planning commenced.  Architectural planning proceeded and had reached outline sketch scheme stage in early 1990 when, in common with all such building projects the project was reviewed in the light of current and projected enrolments for the area and in the light of the annual drop in births for County Limerick of 21 per cent in the years 1980 to 1988.</P>
    <P>Arising from this review it was apparent that the long term trend in pupil numbers indicated a requirement for a 400 pupil school rather than for 500 pupils as was being planned up to now.  In view of this reduction in pupil requirement the schedule of classroom accommodation being planned had to be revised in consultation with the school authorities.  Following on from the revision in the accommodation the architectural plans had to be revised and this has proceeded.</P>
    <P>I should also refer to another very significant development which occurred towards the end of 1991.  At that point the religious authorities involved decided to withdraw from participation in the proposed community school.  Arising from this, the then Minister for Education approved the development of the school as a community college under the aegis of the County Limerick vocational education committee who are now responsible for the project.</P>
    <P>In mid-1991 the vocational education committee were asked to have their design team redesign the plans in the light of the changed circumstances in August 1991 the vocational education committee's design team submitted the revised outline sketch scheme.  This submission <Col N="455" /> was carefully examined in the Department and further correspondence took place with the vocational education committee with regard to some additional amendments.</P>
    <P>In March 1992 the vocational education committee were given approval to proceed with the next stage of architectural planning.  In addition, in order to assist the vocational education committee in speeding up the planning of the project, the Department have allowed the vocational education committee to proceed with the remainder of planning in accordance with an alternative streamlined set of procedures normally only applied to smaller projects.  This will illustrate the Department's commitment to assisting the vocational education committee to plan this project as quickly as possible.  Currently, therefore, the Department are awaiting the submission by County Limerick vocational education committee of the next stage of architectural planning.</P>
    <P>I hope I have illustrated the many factors which can prolong the planning of major educational building projects but have also shown that the Department are co-operating with the vocational education committee in proceeding as quickly as possible.  I must point out, however, that while every effort will be made to assist the vocational education committee to complete the planning as quickly as possible, the project is not nearly ready to commence construction and until the planning has been completed it would not be possible to give any indication of when it could be ready to advance to that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  My motion is in relation to the Central Model School in Marlborough Street, which is in the grounds of the Department of Education.  It has been in <Col N="456" /> a decrepit and derelict condition since 1982 when it was partially destroyed by fire.  This school is specifically under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education. The school consisted of pre-fabs for a ten year period.  The pre-fabs that were put in place in 1982, after the burning down of the old Central Model School, were ten years old at that time, so now we have 20 year old pre-fabs which are quite unsuitable.  They are far too hot in summer and in the winter they are far too cold.  As well as that they are in a very bad condition.  The lifespan of pre-fabs of this nature is only about 50 per cent of what they are at present.  They should never have been erected.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on three occasions &mdash; in November 1989, in May 1990, in November 1991 and now I raise it in June 1992.  Deputy O'Rourke was the Minister, although there was a change in November 1991.  She stated that approval had been given for the reconstruction and refurbishment of the school and the intention was that it would be constructed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The last time I raised it, in November 1991, I was told that the only thing stopping it from going ahead was the fact that the primary school building budget had been reduced from £16 million in the 1991 Estimates to £11 million, which had not been foreseen, and therefore it was not in that particular programme for reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1992 Estimates we were told by no less an authority than the representative of the then Minister for Finance that a million pounds had been set aside specifically for the development and reconstruction of this school and that everything would follow the normal set of procedures from that point onwards. Bills of quantity and architect's plans would be prepared, and it would go to tender before April of this year.  Two years have gone by and it has not gone out to tender yet.  I understand that the architect has been taken off the work drawing up the plans, that it will be a number of weeks before the plans can be drawn up and that it is questionable whether it can go out to tender before the summer at all.  We are talking now of <Col N="457" /> a possible date in the autumn at the very earliest.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the statements and promises we have been given over the last number of years.  In the last three years I have been told almost exactly the same thing.  It seems as though it is within our grasp and then it eludes us again because promises made have not been fulfilled.  What worries me most is that since the appointment of the present Minister the urgency seems to have gone out of the situation and the work seems not to be done in the Department in relation to putting this out to tender.  It is alarming that the architect seems to have been taken off the project since the appointment of the new Minister.  I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <P>What is the status now of the Central Model School in Marlborough Street on the Department of Education grounds? We were told that it was going to be one of the projects that would be dealt with through the budget this year, that the funding for it had been provided, but now the work seems to have stopped.</P>
    <P>The people who suffer are the children. They are there in inadequate pre-fabricated accommodation.  The roof leaks and much of the floor is quite rotten.  The steps of the emergency exit have simply rotted away.  In the case of fire or any emergency, a child who wanted to get out the back urgently would drop to the ground, because the three wooden steps have literally rotted away and are lying on the ground outside the building.  The boys toilet is in very bad condition.  There is no office for the staff, no staff room or office in which to carry out administrative work.  It is a derelict building in the grounds of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has done a lot of work to refurbish his own office in the Department, but nothing has been done for the children for whom he is responsible.  It is scandalous and I hope we do not have another broken promise, as we had when we were told that £1 million had been put aside specifically for this development.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Minister that we are undoubtedly in breach of the health and safety legislation we passed in this House not so long ago.  If an action <Col N="458" /> were taken by any of the parents the building would have to be vacated.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider that we have a school where the staff and the pupils have worked under very difficult conditions over the last ten years.  The situation has been described as temporary since 1982 and it was to be remedied &ldquo;at the earliest possible moment&rdquo;. Much effort was put into maintaining numbers.  We are talking about an inner city school, where the children mainly come from the surrounding flats complexes, and it is a difficult situation.  The quality of education is good and there is good morale among parents and staff. That is due to the superb efforts that have been made.  If this refurbishment programme is put on the long finger again and the morale of the people is eventually sapped, as could well happen, then we will find ourselves in a hopeless situation.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible reflection on the Minister for Education and on the Office of the Minister for Education that in the backyard of the premises in which the Minister resides and does his daily work there are some of the worst school conditions imaginable in this city and country.  I hope we will have a positive response from the Minister and that he will be able to give me a timescale for having this project implemented and executed.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline the situation with regard to the rebuilding of the Central Model School, Marlborough Street.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, these schools, which cater for children of the inner city area, are situated in the Department of Education complex in Marlborough Street.  Since the fire which severely damaged the school building in 1982, the school has been accommodated in prefabricated classrooms, which were intended as a temporary measure, pending the rebuilding of the school building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school presently has 221 children on rolls with 12 teachers and I accept that this accommodation must now be replaced.  Five prefabs were again destroyed by fire in early 1990.  To this end provision has been made in the Primary School Expenditure Programme for <Col N="459" /> 1992 for the refurbishment and restoration of the building, which incidentally has been served with a preservation order.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the work is in the region of £1.2 million.  The Senator must be aware that an almost fireproof building is necessary here, due to the experience of the two previous fires.  I should point out to the Senator that the fact that as a preservation order has been placed on the building and that the interior was badly damaged in the fire means that the work involved will be of a very complex nature in order to retain the present facade.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to gut the interior &mdash; a specialist job in itself &mdash; and then rebuild from the inside out, so to speak. The fact that the building has been exposed to the elements since 1982 with consequent damage to its structure does not help matters.  It is probable that separate contracts will have to be placed for the individual segments of the project.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that working drawings and tender documents will be ready next month and that the contracts will be placed later in the year.  Due to the nature of the work involved and the large volume of architectural work on hand at present, it is just not possible at this time to give a definite date as to when work will begin.  However, the Senator can be assured that there will be no unnecessary delay in the project and in view of his interest in the matter, he will be kept advised on progress.</P>
    <P>Being in the inner city region, and also so near to the financial centre, the rebuilding of the model school is of great importance so that the whole inner city area in that region will be given a much needed fillip.  Indeed, it is unacceptable that pupils and teachers should be accommodated in an all prefab complex and it is the intention of the Minister for Education to go ahead with the expensive <Col N="460" /> replacement school at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I welcome the sentiments expressed by the Minister.  Of course, these sentiments have been expressed on the last three occasions as well.  What I have got is a statement that it is hoped to begin work next month and that it is hoped it will go out to tender some time later in the year.  It is very vague.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Justice our concern that the new Family Bill has not been introduced.  The decision of the Supreme Court to deny women automatic right to the family home must be corrected forthwith.  It is my view that the decision of the court underlines the failure of the Oireachtas to deal with the changing social realities in Irish society.</P>
      <P>It is now six months since the corrective legislation was promised and I believe that the Government should return to women their rights to share ownership of the home.  Irish society must recognise that work done in the family home by a married women, as a wife, must be taken into account by a court deciding whether or not she has had a legal interest in the home.  A person whose spouse is dead is in a much safer financial footing than a person who has a broken marriage.</P>
      <P>There is extreme concern in women's groups, individual women, and indeed men, concerning the matter.  It is the job of the Oireachtas to ensure that progress in social areas takes place.  The Minister for Justice has a duty to ensure that the legislation in the area of home ownership is corrected without undue delay.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 June 1992.</P>
