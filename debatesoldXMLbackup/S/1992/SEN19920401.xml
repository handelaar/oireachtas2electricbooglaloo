      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the coal ban to Bray town and its environs.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline her plans for the retention of the Shannon stopover.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Honan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline the Government's policy on regional airports and also the status of Shannon today and during the full term of the Government.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross, Jackman and Honan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Jackman and Honan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The business for today is item No. 1 and item No. 2 to be taken between now and 6 p.m., item No. 2 to conclude not later than 6 p.m.  Item No. <Col N="3" /> 16, motion 44, will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House will remember that last November Fine Gael, under the name of Senator Neville, introduced a Bill to decriminalise suicide and there was a general agreement on all sides in the House that it was a worthy Bill and should become law as soon as possible.  At that time we were promised by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, that the Department of Justice would shortly have a comprehensive Bill which would take that matter, as well as others, on board.  We were told the Bill would be ready by Christmas, but we are now almost at Easter and there is no sign of it.  Given the wide degree of support in all parts of the House and the considerable public support this party got for the contents of that Bill, I am asking the Minister if he ascertains from the Department that the promised Bill is not imminent, will he consider at this stage if our party reintroduces the Bill to see it through as a Private Members' Bill in the normal way? I believe there is a need for the Bill. Rather than waiting indefinitely, since there is so much agreement on the matter, it would be good for the Bill, good for the House and good for us all if he could agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of items I have raised over the past number of weeks with the Leader of the House on the Order of Business.  There is a need for us to have outlined a programme of legislation it is intended to initiate in this House over the next number of months. The Leader of the House has given me assurances that he has been in contact with various Departments and that he was assembling a list of proposed legislation. It is time we got some indication from him on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Christmas I have been raising every week the need to have a debate on developments in Northern Ireland.  I have been saying that for a wide variety of reasons and I do not intend going <Col N="4" /> into all the reasons today.  It is critically important for people in the North that they hear our words, even if they do not see our actions on these issues.  Words are important.  They really are the way in which eventually attitudes will be changed.  I could not over-stress to the Leader of the House how important it is that we discuss this issue.  It does not impact on anything that is happening in other places and there is no reason we should not debate it.  Since I started to call for this debate 38 people have died in the North through assassination, murder, bombing, etc.  Since I asked for a debate last week two people have been killed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I sense that and I did not intend to do that.  I wish to re-emphasise the urgency for us to give our views on that subject.  We are sick and tired of funerals.  I have members of my organisation in the North attending funerals. I have had members losing their own children up there.  It just gets worse and worse and I think we should at least speak out if we cannot do anything else at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House what is the latest position in relation to the proposed debate on the Maastricht Protocol?  In that regard, I hope the Taoiseach will hold his nerve in the face of the opposition he is now facing.  The last thing this country needs is a divisive referendum on these matters.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the decision of the Minister for Health to hold an inquiry into the matters which are at present being considered in relation to Beaumont Hospital and the neurology department there.</P>

      <P>You are making statements now, Senator Upton.  Will you please address a question to the Leader of the House on the business of the House for today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of <Col N="5" /> the House if he would consider at some stage in the future allowing a debate on health so that we can consider these matters and can help to reach a solution to what is a very serious problem for many people.</P>
      <P>Finally, a Chathaoirligh &mdash; and I know this is something that is very dear to your own heart &mdash; I repeat my request that we have a debate on banking, and I think the &ldquo;O'Keeffe initiative&rdquo; should go after that in brackets.  Has the position changed, given the developments which we have seen in this matter over the past week with the continuing escalation of the banking dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House to convey our concern at the means testing of the ESF maintenance grants for third level students.  I am asking now because students at this moment are getting ready for their leaving certificate examination and are totally perplexed as to whether they will qualify for grants.  Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Education to abandon his proposals for the means testing of the maintenance grants because, effectively, from figures I have got seven out of ten students&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to comment on what Senator Upton said about an inquiry.  I think it is lamentable that professional and business people should behave in such a way that it leads to inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, I have already ruled Senator Upton out of order and I must be consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that. Perhaps we could establish an inquiry centre like the Financial Services Centre where we could take on all the inquiries, there seems to be such an enthusiasm for them.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is being mischievous, and not for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Never, I could not be mischievous. If I was, a Chathaoirligh, I know that your good humour would allow you to approach the subject in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>May I ask a serious question?  It could be taken as mischievous, but is actually quite serious.  We had indications over a period of months that we were going to have a Bill to deal with the subject of telephone tapping.  This precipitated a particular political situation which seems to have disappeared.  I ask the Leader if he will give an indication if it is intended to take the telephone tapping Bill in this session.  I do not, of course, expect an answer today, but perhaps the Leader could let us know tomorrow?</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader also to express concern to the Minister for the Environment about the appearance on Ballybough Road of a Benetton advertisement showing a burning car where it constitutes an incitement to people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Order of Business for today, as the Senator well knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get it to be part of the Order of Business.  I understand there is a case before the courts at the moment dealing with the Gaming and Lotteries Act as a result of which some amusement arcades may open.  Should a particular result emerge, will the Leader inquire from the Minister for Justice whether the Government will ensure that these pernicious dens are not permitted to re-open all over the city.  They are being refurbished at the moment, which is very ominous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to this House in the weeks ahead after he has the beef tribunal behind him and make either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not funny.  There should be statements in this House or a debate on whether we should restructure the IDA and SFADCo when we read in the papers recently the cost of a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in his request that the Government introduce a Bill to decriminalise suicide.  Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Industry and Commerce our concern with the proposal that the Goodman group purchase the assets and factories of the UMP group.  We would be concerned that a monopoly situation would arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it is not relevant to the Order of Business for today, and the Senator knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of concern.  The result could be detrimental to the agricultural community and reduce their income further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he has any further information on when the Taoiseach will visit the House, particularly in the context of what my colleague Senator Upton referred to, that we would be very interested in assuring him that we would like him to keep his nerve in relation to the matter of a referendum, so that the country will not be subjected to the trauma and confusion experienced in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, may I ask the Leader of the House if he will consider now that we should have a debate on education in view of the recent statement from the Minister for Education that he intends to bypass one of the steps of producing a document on education, despite the fact that it is in total breach of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and that we are not apparently going to have <Col N="8" /> the wide ranging public debate that was outlined.  I am requesting the Leader that we now have an opportunity to debate the matter.  We were looking for a debate on education before and my understanding is that the Leader of the House indicated there would not be a debate until such time as the Green Paper was produced.  Now it appears we are not going to have the Green Paper, so that when we do have a document it will be a White Paper, which will be a preliminary to legislation.  There are too many fundamental philosophical and educational issues involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to ask for a debate on the banks, the O'Keeffe initiative that was referred to already. I think it is important.  We were again foregoing that.  I think we should have that debate now because of the industrial action and the IBOA ballot at present. We now have a unilateral decision by the banks to change the conditions of the workers in the banks.  I think it is high time we had a debate and I would ask the Leader of the House to facilitate us in that.</P>
      <P>Finally, I refer to Motion 46 on the Order Paper in relation to the Nicky Kelly case and ask the Leader of the House if he has any up-to-date information as to whether at this time the Attorney General has reported to the Minister for Justice, whether the Minister for Justice has referred the matter to the Cabinet and whether we are going to get a decision on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if we could have an early debate on the processing and marketing of beef in the light of the statements which have been made this morning with regard to the possible ownership UMP by the Goodman group.  A full debate in this House would be appropriate and timely. That debate should take place at an early date.  It would not be advisable, in my view, that any type of monopoly would <Col N="9" /> develop.  I would also like to ask the Leader if we could have this long-awaited debate on banking at an early date. Finally, I urge that we have a debate on Northern Ireland as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the calls that have been made for a debate on Northern Ireland.  We have been suggesting this since Christmas. Over the past few months, it seems to me we have been preoccupied with matters that are far less important.</P>
      <P>I would also like to echo Senator Costello's question in relation to what happened the proposed visit from the Taoiseach.  Apart from anything else, he might welcome a visit to this House, which would afford him temporary political asylum.  Seriously, the Leader promised us the Taoiseach would come to this House and the fact that the visit has not materialised is a great disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be important to note today that this is the first day of operation of the Radiological Protection Institute.  As I mentioned on the Order of Business last week, there was a nuclear accident in Russia.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House that at some stage we might have a debate on the whole question of nuclear energy throughout the world and Ireland's role in that.  I am sure the House would like to wish the Radiological Protection Institute well in opposing nuclear energy throughout the world.  Perhaps the Leader would consider a debate on that issue at some stage in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter that was raised by Senator Manning related to the proposed legislation on suicide.  I sought clarification on that last week and I have not yet received it.  Certainly, I would be in a position to consider whatever option would be best.  Hopefully, the Minister will give details on that quite soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned legislation. I know that the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulations) Bill, 1991, will <Col N="10" /> be with us after Easter.  I hope that will be published on Seanad paper quite soon. One or two other Departments have suggested to me they would be keen to initiate legislation in the House and I hope that will materialise.</P>
    <P>In relation to Maastricht, in this House we have made every effort to continue an all-party approach to our proposed debate.  I hope we keep that and perhaps when all parties have had a chance to debate the proposed wording of the amendment to the Protocol, we will come back to the House on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to a debate on the banks dispute, I mentioned before that, in view of the labour relations situation there, I genuinely feel it would not appropriate at this time to have a debate in the House. I will certainly pass on Senator Jackman's comments to the Minister for Education. Senator Honan mentioned the IDA. Next week the debate on the Culliton report will be an ideal opportunity to raise points relating to the IDA.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's visit, I am convinced that the Taoiseach will come to the House.  Perhaps with the reforms being made in this House, it might be an opportune time for him to come here and make some comments on the House itself and I will suggest that to him.</P>
    <P>As regards the Nicky Kelly affair, which was mentioned last week, I have not the update on that this week.  In regard to the point on education, the Taoiseach answered that query this morning.  They are still deciding what position will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  In regard to Senator Haughey's questions, I am sure we will get a chance to have a debate after Easter on nuclear energy.</P>

    <Title>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1992: Motion.</Title>
    <Col N="11" />
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1992,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in Draft was laid before the House on 30 January 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This draft order proposes to amend the list of investments in which trustees may invest funds under their control.  The order is being made under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958. That legislation is designed to protect the beneficiaries of trusts by offering a range of suitable and prudent investments.  A trust deed may, however, give wider powers of investment to the trustees, in which case the 1958 Act does not apply. Notwithstanding these limits on the operation of the 1958 Act, the legislation makes an important contribution in this area.  We are all only too aware from recent controversies in the pensions area of how easily the rights of beneficiaries can be ignored and sometimes abused.</P>
      <P>The 1958 Act itself sets out a list of investments, but under section 2 of the 1958 Act the Minister for Finance is empowered to amend the list of authorised investments by order.  A draft of the order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a motion of approval passed by each House before the order can be signed.  Approval of this order was given by the Dáil on 6 March 1992.  I am now asking the House to agree to the proposed order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged under the 1958 Act to consult a number of &ldquo;referees&rdquo; in regard to any proposed order to amend the list of investments.  These referees are the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the President of the Irish Stock Exchange, the President of the Incorporated Law Society, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee and <Col N="12" /> a judge of the High Court nominated by the President of the High Court.  The referees have all been consulted and no objections have been raised to the terms of the present draft order.</P>
    <P>The existing list is quite long and detailed and I can make copies available to the House if this is desired.  The original series of investments set out in the Act has been amended by order 11 times. The typical investments authorised are gilt-edged securities, deposits with banks and building societies and certain unit trusts.  This type of investment is very much the safe and secure sort, which is as it should be in the case of trust fund investments.</P>
    <P>This draft order provides for the addition of three new investments to the list.  The first of the proposed investments is interest-bearing deposit accounts with ABN AMRO Bank NV.  ABN AMRO came into being last year as a result of the merger of the Netherlands' two largest banks, Algemene Bank Nederland NV and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV. ABN AMRO is the largest bank in the Netherlands and the sixth largest in Europe.  ABN itself has been present in Ireland since 1972 through its subsidiary, ABN AMRO (Ireland) Limited.  ABN has a majority stake in a local stockbroker and has established several companies in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>The newly merged bank has been licensed by the Central Bank to operate a branch in Ireland.  Certain parts of the business of the Irish subsidiary have been transferred to this branch.  Interest bearing deposit accounts with the subsidiary already have trustee authorised status and ABN AMRO has asked for the same status to apply to interest bearing deposit accounts with the branch.  The Central Bank supports the ABN AMRO request and I have no doubt that its inclusion on the list is warranted.</P>
    <P>I propose also to add to the list Irish Life's Charité Unit Trust, Cash Fund and Fixed Interest Fund only, and the following three AIB Unit Trusts: (i) Allied Irish High Income Bond; (ii) Allied Irish Capital Growth Fund; and (iii) Allied Irish Charicash.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> There are a number of unit trusts already on the list.  The guidelines in these cases require that the unit trust should invest only in trustee authorised investments.  Both Irish Life and AIB have given such undertakings.</P>
    <P>I know it will be useful to the House if I outline how applications for inclusion on the list are dealt with in the Department. To enable individual applications to be assessed on objective grounds a set of criteria has been drawn up for unit trusts, banks, building societies and life assurance products.  A unit trust seeking a listing must provide details of its legal financial and administrative arrangements in relation to the trust &mdash; for example, a copy of the deed of trust.  In addition, it must be an authorised unit trust under the relevant UCITS or unit trust legislation and have been in operation for three years.</P>
    <P>There are also several other detailed criteria as follows.  The Minister, after consultation with the Central Bank, must be satisfied that the company has a satisfactory record of compliance with the supervisory requirements of the Central Bank.  Further, the unit trust may only invest in Government securities and/or deposits placed with licensed banks or building societies.  It must offer to buy back units from trustees at the quoted market rate and the criteria for admission to the list to be met on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>In the case of deposits with a bank or building society, the criteria also require that the bank or building society must be authorised to operate in Ireland and must have carried on business for at least three years.  I also require the Central Bank to assure me that the bank or building society has complied with the Central Bank's prudential standards and requirements.</P>
    <P>In relation to life assurance products, the applicant must supply specific information on the particular investment product to enable the Department to assess its suitability for listing.  As before, the life assurance company must hold an authorisation to transact life assurance business in the State and must have been established and actively trading with the <Col N="14" /> public for at least three years.  A satisfactory record of compliance with the supervisory requirements of the Department of Industry and Commerce must also be shown.</P>
    <P>In so far as particular financial criteria are concerned, the company must have assets of at least £50 million within the State and exceed by 50 per cent or more the EC minimum solvency margin requirements for life assurers.  A certificate of solvency to this effect is required from the company.</P>
    <P>The life assurance product should be based exclusively on Government securities or cash deposits with deposit taking institutions duly authorised and should have been on the market for at least three years preceding the application.  The company must be committed to maintaining the product on the market for the foreseeable future and must continue to meet the criteria for listing on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>These are strict requirements, and properly so.  They are not excessive, however, in the light of the integrity and financial soundness which one would expect of any well established financial institution.  I seek to apply the criteria in a reasonable manner.  Thus, in applying the three year rule the Department will take into account whether the business is being transferred from one authorised firm to another.  In this case it is reasonable to give credit for the period before the transfer in applying the three year rule.</P>
    <P>I have gone into some detail in setting out these criteria so as to be helpful to applicants and to ensure as far as possible that there is seen to be a level playing field for each type of applicant.  The criteria were drawn up after consultation with the Central Bank and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>While the additions to the list concern specific institutions, the opportunity should not be allowed to pass without a mention of the financial sector generally. The financial services sector in Ireland has developed rapidly in the past few years and has now assumed a very important role to the Irish economy.  The <Col N="15" /> importance of the sector is reflected in the fact that 35,200 people are now employed in the area.  The Government realise the importance of this sector and have tried to create the right conditions for it to flourish in, particularly with the advent of the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>To meet the challenge of the Internal Market the Government have overhauled the legislation on banking, insurance, building societies and trustee saving banks.  The purpose of the legislation is to liberalise and free the institutions and markets to help make them more responsive to compeitition.  We are at present working on the regulations necessary to ensure the opening up of the Internal Market in banking from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>A further tangible proof of the Government's commitment to this sector is the International Financial Services Centre.  To date, some 190 projects have been approved with new jobs promised totalling over 2,800.  All the main financial sectors are represented in the centre &mdash; banking, insurance, fund management, leasing, unit trusts, etc.  Dublin has become a recognised financial centre of repute providing good quality financial services.  This reputation has a beneficial spin-off effect on all domestic financial institutions when it comes to competing in world markets.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the financial services sector can respond to the challenge of the Internal Market.  However, domestic institutions must not ignore the home market.  The EUROPEN report published in 1990 identified two important areas for success, that is, controlling costs and developing new products to meet competition.  I am encouraged by the moves made by particular firms to gear up to meet the new compeitition.  In the final analysis, it is up to the individual firm to chart its own course through 1992 and beyond.</P>
    <P>Service to the customer must be an essential feature of any such chart.  I have no doubt that in the case of trustees the <Col N="16" /> products and deposit accounts being added to the list will prove their customer worth and, accordingly, I recommend the order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no reason we should oppose the order before us.  It is a technical motion and I suspect very much an in-house issue within the financial institutions and the Department.  I welcome the Minister to the House and the case he has outlined for support for the motion today.</P>
      <P>Not wishing to nit-pick, the Minister left out a paragraph of the script he supplied to us.  I am sure there was nothing sinister in that but, for the record, he may like to include it in his reply; it was the second paragraph on the fourth page of his script.  I assume we can take as said the information contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained in detail the case before us.  It is not for me to object to or question in any way whether ABN AMRO, the Irish Life's Charité Unit Trust, Cash Fund and Fixed Interest Fund and the three AIB unit trusts, namely, Allied Irish High Income Bond, the Allied Irish Capital Growth Fund or the Allied Irish Charicash Fund, should or should not be included.  I assume from what the Minister said that the referees have all been consulted and raised no objections and their certificates of solvency have to be in order, therefore, we cannot but welcome the extension of the guaranteed service to the customer in this area.  I would be interested to know how many financial institutions, unit trusts or whatever have applied for cover under this specific area and been refused and if so, why?  There are six or so named before in the Order before us, but how many were left off?  Were there any the referees considered should not be included in the draft Order?  Were there any where the certificates of solvency did not meet the stringent requirements I imagine are required by the Central Bank and the Department?  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if there was a downside to applicants in this area because we could learn from this and it would also <Col N="17" /> underline the strengths of those institutions that are on the list.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the recent controversy in the pension area and how easily the rights of beneficiaries can be ignored and abused.  Perhaps he could develop his thinking on this as it is an area which has caused concern for a long time.  In the United Kingdom, there have been cases of blatant abuse of pensioner rights and the pension funds have been switched from their original intention. Will the Minister indicate what precautions are being taken in this area, given the examples that have underlined problems that can exist and say whether this could happen here?  Is further legislation planned to tighten up this area? Given that people work all their lives and maybe put a little aside for their old age and retirement, often to fund their own pension schemes, it is essential that we allay any fears that may exist in his area. We must remember that it is very difficult to save today because of the cost of living. Perhaps the public need to be made more aware of safe investments and need to be given advice in a language that they understand.  The technical language used in the financial investment field is intimidating to the average person, and even reasonably well educated people do not understand precisely what is involved or cannot make their way through the field of financial investments without very expensive and sophisticated advice.  I would be interested to know the Minister's views on the recent controversies and on what still needs to be done to tighten up this area to protect pensioners' investments and pension funds generally.</P>
    <P>I welcome ABN AMRO's inclusion on this list given that they are a major European bank and the largest in the Netherlands.  They have invested considerably in this country over the last two decades.  The question might be why it took so long for them to be included. Obviously their request only come to hand reasonably recently because I can see no reason they would not have been included before now if they had wished. They are major investors in Riada and Company, Stockbrokers, and have committed <Col N="18" /> themselves to Ireland and financial investment here in a big way; this is but a further extension to their bow.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to working on the regulations necessary to ensure the opening up of the Internal Market in banking from 1 January, 1993, compliance with the Single Market and the various directives and regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, as we watch the spectacle of the banks dispute develop &mdash; and I hope it will not escalate &mdash; one wonders what work is being done at the directors' tables for 1 January 1993 and the Single Market and whether the Minister has any concerns about the banks' ability to comply with whatever requirements will be upon them once the Single Market is with us.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's views on whether the present industrial relations difficulties in the banking system will cause them any problems complying with the 1 January, 1993 deadline and if he is satisfied that the work done to date by the banking and financial institutions will allow them to meet the deadline on the various Euro requirements to comply with Single Market regulations and directives.</P>
    <P>This is a very important area and, because of other difficulties in the banking system, one we should not lose sight of.  As the so-called abortion controversy is distracting from the real issue of the Maastricht Treaty, I would hate the difficulties in the banking system to distract from the real job the banks have to do to comply with the deadline.</P>
    <P>We are happy to support the motion before us and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Senator in welcoming this order and give it my support.  It is very important that this type of legislation is provided to protect investors by offering as wide a range of investments as possible.  I agree with Senator Doyle's remarks in relation to pension funds and the difficulties experienced by people, particularly the ordinary man and woman in the street who may have a few pounds to invest and who <Col N="19" /> do not quite understand the mechanics of the Stock Exchange, investments and so on.  They rely to a large extent on professional people to do the job for them and in relation to unit trusts this is extremely important.</P>
      <P>The people I am most concerned about are those with small amounts of money to invest.  They try to ensure they spread their investments as widely as possible. Understandably the unit trust is a very important mechanism in this regard. They rely to a large extent on professional advice and the workings of professionals in that area.</P>
      <P>It is important that people have as many facilities and opportunities as possible to invest.  It is understandable that where a range of financial services are developed the scope for greater risk-taking is extended.  We must guard against the wider opportunities for individuals to misappropriate funds in one way or the other.  I agree with what Senator Doyle said in relation to pension funds and that people participate in superannuation and pension fund schemes in good faith.  They think that money is being properly invested and they will have fairly good pensions when they retire.  Experience in Britain, and in this country on a few occasions, has shown that, in some circumstances, that is not the case.  Given the opening up of the EC in terms of financial services and investments, it is an area to which we must pay special attention.</P>
      <P>We must protect the rights of small investors &mdash; people who think their pension funds are being looked after or small investors who have money to invest &mdash; with every means at the disposal of the Minister and the State.  We have seen examples on television particularly in relation to the problems of the Maxwell group in Britain where huge sums of money were misappropriated and it was the small saver who was hurt most.  We must ensure that this does not occur in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated that the financial sector has opened up in terms of banking, insurance, building societies <Col N="20" /> and so on in preparation for full integration into Europe.  That is extremely important.  We must give our banks and unit trusts the opportunity to compete with the competition from Europe in the years ahead.  I join with the Minister in complimenting developments in the Financial Services Centre.  This is a very successful development.  There are 190 projects in operation which have resulted in a number of jobs being created and there is the possibility of more projects locating there with a consequent increase in the numbers of jobs in the area.  All that is to be welcomed.  It is recognised at this stage that in terms of our economic development, it is in the services sector that there is the most opportunity for job creation.  Anything that can be done to improve that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this order before the House and wish him well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on bringing such non-controversial legislation before us today which he felt would go through on the nod.  I do not intend to make life difficult for him, or indeed make it particularly easy for him, but of course this order should be supported, and has been supported, by all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us an opportunity to mention the Financial Services Centre and I will make one or two comments on that.  This order is part of the ongoing procedure and legislation which is intended to reassure investors and give them protection and maximum security in areas such as trustee investments.  I do not think there should be any quarrel with what the Minister has authorised in this order, particularly in the case of ABN AMRO which as Senator Doyle quite rightly said, has a large vested interest in this country and which has had the confidence and the courage not only to invest a lot of money in this country by setting up a subsidiary but also to invest in a large and successful stockbroking firm here.  What the Minister is doing by authorising interest-bearing <Col N="21" /> deposit accounts with ABN AMRO is recognising the stake they have here and the security of that stake.  He is also internationalising the trustee investments which are available to trustees in this country and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I assume it is appropriate to talk about the criteria that are applied to these trustee investments.  I am not quite so sure the presumptions on which they are based are as safe as the Minister would like to think.  I am not even sure that Government stocks are quite as safe as the Minister would make out.  They are as safe as one can get but it is appropriate to remind the House that Allied Irish Banks had a serious crisis some years ago and that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in terms of the life assurance industry also had a serious crisis some years ago.  Both those companies would easily fulfil the criteria spelled out by the Minister today.  In other words, we have a requirement that they should be in business for three years and have capital of £2.5 million.  While those companies would have satisfied the criteria and any investments in deposits in them might have been in danger at that time.</P>
    <P>What I suggest perhaps it might be more appropriate and the Minister might take it on board &mdash; is that there might be a suggestion that the spread of investments in unit trusts should be wider than that mentioned in the Minister's statement. He says they must be in cash or gilts.  While they sound safe, if the money in these funds is invested in one interest-bearing deposit in one bank which is suspect, presumably the trust itself can go down as well because the criteria set for the banks are not strict enough.  The Minister might think of requiring these trusts to spread their investments more widely rather than allow them to put them into one single investment because if that investment goes down or that safe area is in danger, the whole trust could be in danger.  I would have thought it more appropriate to have a spread of investments.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the Minister up on one or two things he had to say about the Financial Services Centre in general. I suppose it is inevitable that the Minister <Col N="22" /> would pat himself and the Government on the back about the financial services sector.  It is not strictly relevant to this order, but I know the Chair will give me the same latitude as he gave to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's satisfaction with the financial services sector. I note the continuous assertion of the IDA, the Government and their spokespersons that not only is the financial services sector here flourishing but the Financial Services Centre is flourishing. I do not, quite honestly, believe that statement stands up to scrutiny.  It is based on the fact that if it is stated often enough and if there are enough buildings and physical activity at the Customs House Dock, people will believe that this construction and enterprise has been successful. I suggest to the Minister, in the humblest possible terms, that the Financial Services Centre, judged by the targets set for it in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1987 and by the Government when they took office, far from being a success, is a failure.</P>
    <P>The assertion that it is successful is dubious because the Financial Services Centre, as I understood it, was set up to attract a large number of major multinationals to Ireland.  It has turned out to be more a tax haven than a productive centre.  The targets set for employment which was the <i>raison d'être</i> of the Financial Services Centre have not been met.  It depends on who one listened to at the time whether the targets set for employment were 8,000 or 11,000 and it depends on how enthusiastic people were at the time about the centre.  However, the targets have not been met; we are now five years down the road and they are far from being met.  Anybody who examines the Financial Services Centre will see that the quality of the financial services companies which have set up there, far from being large multinationals putting down an anchor or a headquarters in Dublin, are nearly all very small subsidiaries of large or small institutions.</P>
    <P>One of the great failures of the Financial Services Centre is that not only have the employment targets not been <Col N="23" /> met but it is very doubtful whether many of the jobs which exist there are new jobs.  What happened, as the Minister well knows, was that the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks moved into it at first in order to take up the space which was being provided and in order to encourage others to come in there.  They relocated a great number of their operations across the Liffey, they received tax concessions in return and they simply re-employed people in the centre whom they had employed in Ballsbridge and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>These two operations are, by far, the largest in the Financial Services Centre and the operations coming in from abroad are very small, and what are euphemistically called niche operations settled there.  The numbers employed by these operations from abroad are nearly all in single figures &mdash; six people, seven people, nine people and only one or two employ between 12 and 20 people.  The number of Irish people they employ is even smaller because many of these operations bring in their own employees.  The employment figures are very optimistic. I suggest they employ mostly people from overseas and, unfortunately, do not offer new jobs.</P>
    <P>One of the strange things about the Financial Services Centre &mdash; maybe the Minister could comment on this &mdash; is that it is now being filled with solicitors and accountants.  I cannot understand the reason good, professional companies, like McCann Fitzgerald, Arthur Andersen and others, have been encouraged or allowed to relocate in the Financial Services Centre.  It may be that the space is simply not being taken up but it seems that these companies are now making use of tax rebates and allowances which were not intended for them or for any similar operations.  I suppose the reason for it is that the space must be taken up in order to make the centre a success and, as a result, solicitors and accountants are now permitted to locate where they were not meant to locate in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I suggest that any note of self-congratulation <Col N="24" /> on the Financial Services Centre should not be uncritically accepted by the public, by the financial services sector or by anybody else.  The targets of employment are far from being met.  Those who moved there in the first instance received tax concessions.  There is no anchor tenant, major multinational financial company or bank from abroad locating there except in a very small way. What we need is a critical and realistic assessment of the Financial Services Centre from the Governemnt rather than the sort of self-congratulation we get day in, day out, in the newspapers, in the Seanad and in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This order, as far as it goes, is welcome. It is lacking in information.  As Senator Doyle said it would be interesting to know how this bank was singled out for authorisation.  It would be interesting to know if anybody has been refused authorisation. I would like to see the list the Minister promised of authorised investments, if he could make it available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who participated in this short debate for their work and comments. Senator Doyle asked me about pensions funds.  It might be worth mentioning briefly the current EC directive on the pensions funds.  It is a broader issue than trustee authorised investments because pensions funds do not usually limit themselves to trustee investments. While the focus is very much on deregulation and removal of national restrictions in line with the standard Community approach of liberalisation, there is a prudential code to ensure that funds are managed in the appropriate manner and there is no major accumulation of risk.  The importance of security is recognised.  In view of the variety of regulations in individual member countries it will be an achievement to make progress, however modest, in the harmonisation of pension fund legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One topical provision of the draft directive is the proposed rule of self-investments of pension funds and the difficulties that have arisen.  There are clear <Col N="25" /> dangers associated with imprudent self-investment by pension trustees in the parent and affiliated companies of the employees.  This has happened in a number of cases.  In the use of pension funds to invest in worthwhile enterprises, even the parent company can help stimulate economic development, but the bottom line must always be the interests of beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, with my consent, recently introduced regulations under the Pensions Act and these provide that any self-investment or concentration of investment in excess of 20 per cent of the assets of a fund is not taken into account for the purpose of certifying the adequacy of the assets under the minimum funding standard. These regulations will enhance the security of members' rights.  I agree with Senator Doyle's concern to close any loopholes on this matter.  These regulations are a further step in the Government's commitment to provide a proper regulatory framework for the protection of employees, which together with a number of aspects of the regulation of these issues concern me.  I spoke recently on other essential aspects of regulation and regulatory controls.  I agree with Senator Ross that in these matters one can never be sure that one is totally up to date or in possession of the best regulations and expertise.  I would never say that we should spot examining these matters.</P>
    <P>On the new bank regulations, I am satisfied that the banks will be able to meet the EC regulations; they already comply with EC directives on own funds and insolvency ratios.  However, it is up to the banks to lay their own corporate plans.  We have seen the building societies gear up with new products and expert staff and with new links with other providers of financial services in the state; the banks, presumably, will do likewise.</P>
    <P>Referring to Senator Ross' point on the criterion of safety, there are degrees of safety in different types of financial investments.  I try to aim for the highest standards and I accept the point that improvements are always possible.  As <Col N="26" /> regards the restriction of Government gilts and interest bearing deposits, I take the point on the spread of investments. However, a deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies deposits exists, albeit with a maximum of £10,000.</P>
    <P>To clarify the point regarding Ambro Ltd., which Senator Doyle made, it is a subsidiary of ABN AMRO and that has trustee status.  The purpose of their inclusion today is to include the interest bearing deposit associated with the new branch formed, that is the ABN AMRO Bank.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Doyle's comments on the technical jargon used by the insurance industry.  I have been battling with that myself in recent months, having been away from the phraseology for a few years and there are some aspects I have never been involved in.  The insurance industry has tried to write its policies in clearer English and I will consider what might be done on the broader front.</P>
    <P>There are a number of applicants involving equities, equity funds and unit linked funds being considered at present. I do not wish to name any.  Normally when they are refused it is for a period of three years.  That would only be applied if they do not comply with the three year rule.  The referees would not usually object but may raise questions to be followed up with the applicant.  That is the normal procedure.</P>
    <P>The supervision of pension funds and the Pensions Board are being dealt with by the Minister for Social Welfare.  On the question of the Financial Services Centre and Senator Ross' comments, I was merely making the point that much employment is provided there; the figure of 35,000 is in my script.  It is a substantial employer.  We often hear more about other sectoral interests that employ less than that number of people.  I am sure Senator Ross claims some success over the years for being part of that growing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross was there <Col N="27" /> during the process of developing it through the difficult years.  The centre is a substantial employer not just in the financial services sector, and by and large the jobs are sustainable, which we can all feel satisfied about.  In regard to the centre, I suppose in five years one would like to see greater progress but I remember being down there in Christmas 1987 when the first hole in the ground had been made so it is less than four years since the first people moved in.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as Minister for Finance in recent times I have had the pleasure of seeing AIB and the Bank of Ireland move in; Andersen House has taken over a whole block and a total of 190 projects have signed up for accommodation. Many of these are small and many institutions have moved to this country for the first time.  The companies involved in the recent controversy were all new to the country.</P>
      <P>I met a number of deputations, many of whose members were non-Irish but many of their staff were Irish and a considerable number of young graduates have been recruited in the past 18 months or so.  Figures were supplied by the various deputations on Irish Employees.  A few companies were engaged in some controversy with the German revenue authorities.  Other companies have expanded by a small fraction but the 190 institutions there is a significant number. There are plans now to continue the centre's development and I have certain concerns there; the centre is a new concept and like a new company, it would be unreasonable to assess its future on the basis of three year's achievement.  I am concerned that all of the people who have signed up are not yet located in the centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know and I agree here with Senator Ross. Some 2,800 jobs have been promised, the vast majority of which are meant to be new.  I asked about the proportion of <Col N="28" /> new jobs on a recent visit to Andersen's House but I did not get a precise figure. I know from my recent visits there that most senior and junior staff would not have been working with their present company three years ago; it would be fair to take as a base the start of building on the Financial Services Centre if we are to judge how long these people have been there.  I recently met the executives of AIB there and only two of the eight were there two years ago; maybe they brought out the new people only but I do not believe that.</P>
      <P>I had talks with the Ulster Bank in recent days &mdash; they are opening new offices in the centre &mdash; and the vast majority of their staff are new.  By and large, the senior staff of a number of these companies will have been brought from other locations to develop the new service.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross that the projections outlined at the start of the project have not been achieved.  Those of us with some say in these matters must continue to see its development pursued actively, that the various companies which have signed up must come on site, and that their activities hold credibility worldwide.  The centre must be promoted positively and observe criteria that will satisfy the international finance community. I agree with Senator Ross that we must ensure proper development or in five years we may run into difficulties. It behoves me as Minister for Finance to encourage its development and I believe it needs a push to achieve that.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about the erection of the next buildings and about the completion of other buildings and employment of people on site, and I have spent some time in the last two weeks trying to pursue these matters to a conclusion. If people operating there do not locate themselves on site &mdash; this is outside the spirit of the centre and possibly contravenes the legal provisions governing the centre &mdash; the Financial Services Centre will not proceed as planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the banks dispute.  Senators will be aware that the banks situation is in the balance and it <Col N="29" /> would not help to go into detailed discussion at this time.  Suffice to say that I hope both sides will come to an agreement. The Minister for Labour and I, from my own side, have been monitoring the position.  The economy is not as dependent &mdash; as I said recently in the Dáil while standing in for the Minister for Labour &mdash; on the associated banks as it was during the strikes of 1970 and 1976, but a prolonged dispute could still have unwelcome economic effects and I hope normal services will be resumed following agreement wihin the normal industrial relations channels.</P>

Referees, rather than giving outright refusals, allow applicants three years to comply with the requirements.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for taking this motion.  Last week I referred to areas I wish to cover &mdash; the <Col N="30" /> absence of proper hospital and health facilities in the mid-west region with particular regard to the provision of proper consultancy services akin to those available in other health board areas.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board are seriously concerned in this regard and a plan has been drawn up to correct the situation by bringing facilities and services in the mid-west up to the level of other health boards.  To this end, in October 1989 the Mid-Western Health Board requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the consultant manpower requirements for the mid-west in the light of a large number of consultancy vacancies both current and pending in the mid-west area.  In response the comhairle set up a committee of seven of its own members to carry out a wide ranging review of consultant services in the mid-west; they produced an in-depth comprehensive study of hospital services and compiled a dossier of information on the level of activities in the four acute hospitals in the mid-west &mdash; the Limerick Regional Hospital which included its associated maternity hospital and the orthopaedic hospital in Croom; St. John's Hospital; Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Management and consultants at these hospitals were afforded the opportunity of making an input into the final report. Problems identified in that report indicate the crisis prevailing at present in the mid-west health service and appropriate action to correct the situation was outlined. The report stated that major changes were occurring in the consultant establishment in the mid-west areas mainly through retirements.  The number of retirements up to 1995, together with vacancies existing at present, constitutes 29 per cent of the total establishment.  In addition, there are ten newly appointed consultants who have taken up duty in the last two years.  The extent of the change involves in excess of 40 per cent turnover of consultants in the area.</P>

    <P>The changes occurring through retirement are more profound than might appear.  Modem training programmes are radically different to the training of <Col N="31" /> consultants in the past.  Changes in specialisation have happened at an increasing rate within each of the major disciplines of medicine.  Being less of a generalist than his/her predecessors, the modern consultant is more dependent on the availability of colleagues in allied specialties.  Medical litigation is an increasingly constraining factor in attempting to practise as a generalist.  All this will have a bearing on the situation now developing in the mid-west.  Because of improved employment conditions young consultants are not willing to undertake the onerous commitments of continuous on-call which consultants of 30 or 40 years ago accepted as the norm. It is not possible to replace like with like in the case of retiring consultants in the mid-west.</P>
    <P>The hospital scene in the mid-west has, over the last three years, undergone dramatic alterations.  Developments have included the closure of Barrington's Hospital and the consequential relocation of services to Limerick Regional Hospital and to St. John's Hospital.  The increased demand on the facilities of the Limerick Regional Hospital which were in any event badly in need of improvement has resulted in grave strain on services in that hospital.  Staff of Limerick Regional Hospital have worked commendably under extremely difficult conditions and are only too aware of the difficulties there.  The maternity unit in Cahercalla Hospital in Ennis was closed and virtually all births in the mid-west are now centred on the Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital with an increased gynaecology workload being undertaken at the Limerick Regional Hospital and to some extent at St. John's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In 1988 there was a significant and permanent scaling down of the bed complement of each mid-west acute hospital. The reduction of beds at St. John's Hospital was fixed by the Department of Health at 22 per cent; 230 beds overall were lost in the mid-west in 1988.</P>
    <P>Existing consultant services are totally inadequate and compare unfavourably with every other health board area.  The <Col N="32" /> administrative area of the Mid-Western Health Board comprises Limerick, both city and county, with a population of 164,500; County Clare with 91,300 and Tipperary North Riding with a population of 59,500; the total population of the board's area is 315,500.  The most striking feature of the population profile is that 58 per cent of the total population in the mid-west resides within a 20 mile radius of a central point in Limerick city. From the viewpoint of hospital services this is particularly important since there is a single centre which a majority of the population regularly access for a variety of services, including shopping, entertainment, etc.</P>
    <P>The largest acute hospital in the area is the Limerick Regional Hospital, which has a scaled down bed complement of 376.  Since the closure of Barrington's Hospital the only other acute general hospital centrally located in Limerick city is St. John's Hospital &mdash; a small voluntary hospital with 90 beds plus a ten bed day unit.</P>
    <P>In 1990 Comhairle na nOspidéal's consultant manpower statistics indicated that the mid-west, which contains 8.9 per cent of the population of the country, has only 6.1 per cent of the total consultant establishment.  The consultant population ratio in the mid-west is one per 4,600 population compared to the national average of one per 3,200 population. The comparative figure for the east is one per 2,300 population; in the south it is one per 3,300 population; and in the west it is one consultant per 3,100 population.  In the mid-west, the consultant ratio of one per 4,600 population is the worst of any region in the country. All these indicators point to an under-provision of consultant manpower in the mid-west.  To achieve the same consultant population ratio as in the south, that is one consultant per 3,300, an additional 25 to 30 consultant posts would have to be created.</P>
    <P>The current deployment of specialists is designed to deliver a general &mdash; and this is important &mdash; rather than a specialist service in the two main disciplines of medicine and surgery.  Further the relatively <Col N="33" /> even distribution of general physicians and surgeons between the four centres makes it extremely difficult for special interests, to be developed within the overall group of consultants.  Comhairle na nOspidéal state that Limerick Regional Hospital is only marginally stronger in general medicine and surgery than the other three hospitals; I contend that it cannot therefore be properly called a regional centre for the two clinical branches of hospital practice, medicine and surgery.</P>
    <P>At the same time the resources of the smaller general hospitals are not used to their full extent for the delivery of appropriate specialist services, for example, outpatient clinics and day care services.  It follows, therefore, that referrals for specialist services must flow from the mid-west to other centres.  Seventeen per cent of patients from Clare, 15 per cent of patients from Limerick and as many as 26 per cent of patients from Tipperary North Riding were treated in hospitals outside their health board area in 1990, reflecting the absence of proper services in the mid-west and a major weakness in the consultant manpower profile in the area.  This, in the comhairle's view, constitutes the major priority to be tackled in providing proper medical services for the mid-west.</P>
    <P>While problems of space, facilities or lack of beds exist at all four general hospitals, the deficiencies at the Limerick Regional Hospital relative to its activity and regional role are the most serious and acute.  There are only three theatres and a recently opened day theatre for a total of 16 operating consultants.  The orthopaedic surgeons cannot get access to the theatre for acute trauma except outside normal working hours.  Gynaecology is restricted by the same problem. The radiology department is divided in two by a public corridor and it is unacceptable that the public should be constantly passing through a radiology department where patients wait on stretchers, in wheelchairs, and in various stages of undress for X-rays.</P>
    <P>Key areas such as the availability of theatre time to enable surgeons to operate <Col N="34" /> and the availability of a reasonable number of beds are very basic.  There is an urgent necessity to give early relief to the area of theatres, beds and diagnostic facilities.  Looked at from the perspective of consultant manpower, the other three general hospitals, Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's, are small hospitals which cannot be expected to encompass the multi-disciplinary spectrum of consultant level services which modern medicine requires. Their immediate catchment population is insufficient to generate enough overall clinical activity to justify the broad range of consultant expertise in medicine and surgery which their present roles as general hospitals open to all types of conditions and emergencies would require. However, they do have resources and potential to facilitate the delivery of nonresidential specialist care to their local catchment populations, thus minimising the necessity for patients to travel to a major specialist centre and alleviating the demand on the hard pressed facilities at the centre.</P>
    <P>In terms of consultant staffing levels, An Comhairle is firmly of the view that the standards to be adopted should at least equal those currently provided in other parts of the country with similar sized population.  It is only fair to expect in the mid-west that the level of services outlined by An Comhairle should be funded by the Government.  The majority of major teaching hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway serve populations in the region of 200,000 to 300,000.  The population of 315,000 in the mid-west is entitled to hospital services of similar scale and complexity from a specialist viewpoint as those provided for similar sized populations elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Mid-Western Health Board is to develop the hospital services on the basis of a flagship hospital with complementary and supplementary roles for the other acute hospitals in the area. We believe that the regional hospital should be the flagship hospital of the region and that adequate investment should be allocated by the Government <Col N="35" /> to ensure that the hospital is brought up to the level of similar hospitals in other regions.</P>
    <P>The present state of development in the mid-west falls considerably short of the situation elsewhere.  Other areas with populations of similar size already have a consultant manpower profile akin to what we are seeking to have provided in the mid-west.  Funding to develop the specialist, as distinct from general, services on a regional basis for the mid-west as a whole should be provided in Limerick city utilising the services of the four general hospitals in the area in a complementary fashion in order to maximise the potential of all existing facilities.</P>
    <P>I have in front of me a chart of the allocations to health boards between 1975 and 1990.  The capital allocation to the mid-west region was about £12 million, to the southern region, which is nearest to us it was £62 million, to the western region it was £40.5 million, to the southeast region it was £60 million, to the eastern region it was £43.5 million and to the midland region it was £30 million.  We are the poor relations in the mid-west getting only £12.5 million.  This information was given to the Mid-Western Health Board by the chief executive officer at a meeting of the board on 13 December 1991.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to another area of health care which is causing concern in the mid-west.  At present there are 499 mentally handicapped people in the area for whom the health board do not provide either day or residential care. This represents 29 per cent of the mentally handicapped people in the area.  Of the 499 persons requiring assistance, 183 are considered by the health board to be in urgent or immediate need of services; of those, 137 are in need of residential care &mdash; 60 of them have moderate handicap while 77 have severe or profound handicap.  There is a great deal of concern about this in the mid-west and the friends of the mentally handicapped in the region have set up an organisation to lobby for funding.  It has been estimated that the cost of providing the facilities necessary <Col N="36" /> for the mentally handicapped in the mid-west would be £6.5 million.  In the region of £350,000 was provided for that service this year.  Of the 183 who are considered to be in urgent and immediate need of services, only five extra will be provided with residential care in 1992.  This is totally inadequate.  I would ask the Minister to convey to the Government our concern and request him to ensure that funding is provided to relieve this growing problem.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this proposal and the concern of the people in the mid-west who have to deal with the handicapped, their parents and those caring for them.  Next summer more people who are in need of residential care will come out of various institutions into the mid-west.  That care is not available to them.  We must recognise that, thankfully, the mentally handicapped are now living longer than heretofore because of an improvement in modern medicine.  Places in the hospitals and in the centres do not become vacant as quickly as they did in the past and there is therefore a need for additional facilities.</P>
    <P>As a Member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, I wish to refer to the paltry provision given to that committee to do a very important task.  The provision for 1991-92 for consultancy and publicity work of the joint committee is £40,000. Compare this to the cost of investigations into just one company which came under the auspices of the joint committee &mdash; the former Sugar Company, now Greencore. It cost the State £2 million to investigate the difficulties which arose in that organisation.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee, as the State's watchdog on 27 companies, is given £40,000 to complete its work.  That is derisory and would be comical if it were not so serious.  A new and proper approach to the work of that body should be taken by the Government. It is a very important watchdog over the State's interest and investment in 27 companies, but it is inadequately funded.  This shows the Government are not taking the work of the committee seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> The Oireachtas Joint Committee drew up a series of recommendations with regard to its own position in the past 12 months and I would like to refer to some of those recommendations.  The committee, as currently resourced and empowered, is severely handicapped from carrying out the incisive and pervasive examination required of it under statute.  Considerable resources in themselves will not guarantee 100 per cent effectiveness; nevertheless it can be argued convincingly that it is unreasonable and disingenuous to require the Oireachtas Joint Committee to act as an alert watchdog with only extremely limited resources &mdash; in the region of £40,000 in 1992.  In order to do its work effectively the joint committee made five key recommendations:</P>
    <P>(i)  it be given power to compel witnesses to attend or produce documents and that penalties apply for non-compliance in accordance with procedures to be determined by law;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the question of the privilege of witnesses be resolved by extending qualified privilege to witnesses before public meetings of the Joint Committee;</P>
    <P>(iii)  a formal mechanism be provided to facilitate debates on its reports;</P>
    <P>This is an ideal House to debate the reports of joint committees of the Oireachtas.  We should use this House more to bring the views of Oireachtas representatives to bear on reports completed by that committee.  The two remaining recommendations were:</P>
    <P>(iv)  adequate resources be provided; and</P>
    <P>(v)  the review of the <i>sub judice</i> practice be expedited as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to raise another issue, the mistake the Government made designating one of the best and the most successful harbour in the west &mdash; Foynes Harbour &mdash; as a local rather than as a commercial port.  The Government have <Col N="38" /> effectively downgraded its status which will seriously inhibit the development of the port at Foynes; they should immediately reverse this decision.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality states:</P>
    <P>The strategy for commercial seaports will place particular emphasis on the provision of appropriate port capacity and quality port infrastructure, strategically located in relation to the main internal transport arteries.</P>
    <P>The strategy will promote investment in ports which are essential for the efficient and economic movement of export goods and the import of raw material for manufacturing.</P>
    <P>In this context the following commercial ports have been selected by the Irish Government for priority investment: Dublin port, Rosslare Harbour, Waterford and Cork ports.</P>
    <P>Foynes was not selected by the Irish Government for priority investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that Foynes has not been selected by the Irish Government for priority investment. The Government should reverse their decision.  The report goes on:</P>
      <P>The development of these key ports is designed to ensure that the services and facilities available to Irish exporters are upgraded so that they do not suffer any further competitive disadvantage in relation to their European counterparts, particularly in the areas of access transport.</P>
      <P>Foynes is also excluded from being upgraded so that it does not &ldquo;suffer any further competitive disadvantage&rdquo;.  That infers that Foynes will in fact suffer further competitive disadvantage in relation to its European counterparts.  The report also states that in order to improve the efficiency of these key ports, it will be part of the development strategy to discourage the tendency towards the fragmentation of routes and services.  I cannot accept that to go to ports other than those mentioned, including Foynes, will lead to fragmentation of routes and services.  Foynes should develop in unity with the ports which are designated commercial ports.  The report also states that it is designed to encourage and assist identified key ports to handle all natural traffic arising and attract shipping operators into the key ports, not the local ports.</P>
      <P>Foynes is in the process of completing and sanctioning a development plan which will cost in the region of £20 million.  I will not quote in detail from the plan because it has not yet been sanctioned by the board in Foynes, but it is about to be sanctioned.  We will be asking for money through the Structural Funds under the programme on peripherality.  From the point of view of Government policy, it looks as if we will have an uphill battle because we are regarded as a local rather than a commercial port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> I sincerely ask the Government to review their approach to Foynes as it has developed faster and is more successful than any port in Ireland.  In relation to activity, it is now third in size and to downgrade it is a slight on the port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Act which covers a wide range of allocations, public expenditure and Estimates.  It is a matter which deserves thought.  It is essential, given the vast amount of money expended, that key areas get priority, that resources are allocated in as fair and just a manner as possible and that obvious priority areas which may have been neglected in recent years are considered for additional funds this year.  In some areas where there has been under-funding, a radical rethink is needed.</P>
      <P>The first area I would like to mention is tourism, an important industry which must be marketed and motivated.  I am concerned that Bord Fáilte has suffered a reduction in its grant at a time when it is reviewing its targets.  After the Gulf War, which caused difficulties in the American market, Bord Fáilte went into other areas and was successful.  The Board, its members and all those involved, are to be complimented because the Gulf War would have affected their operation, the tourism industry in this country and the number of people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year there is a presidential election in America.  Traditionally in an American presidential year, fewer Americans travel abroad.  We must now examine how money is being allocated to other markets and to other areas.  It is clear that marketing and selling this country must be a priority and must be tackled in a very professional manner.  Tourism is big business.  We must get away from the idea that people just come here and that we can depend on the man above to send a few months of reasonably good weather.  We must market all-year-round special interest holidays, such as shooting, fishing, hunting and other leisure <Col N="41" /> activities for which people come to Ireland.  We must be realistic.  This is not the Costa del Sol.  We must market our other advantages.  Every support must be given to those whose job it is to attract extra people here.  There has been a lot of talk about a jobs forum and various training schemes but enticing more tourists to come here is one of the most sound and secure ways of providing extra jobs in this service industry.  The extra people would spend money and there would be spin-off benefits to the hotels, guesthouses, town and country houses and bed and breakfast establishments in our cities, towns and villages.  I condemn the reduction in Bord Fáilte's grant this year.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money is spent on State security that is, the Garda Síochána, Army, marine service and other related back-up services, including civil defence and the FCA.  Vast amounts have been spent on State security in recent years. The violence and damage in Northern Ireland are costing every person in this country increasing amounts each year. We would all like to compliment the Army and Garda for all they have done in this area and we hope that talks will bring an end to the incessent violence there.  This is the first day of the fourth month and more than 30 people have already been killed this year.  I regard it as a slightly cynical exercise when the leader of the Provisional IRA, for election opportunistic reasons seems to change tack.  I do not recall him saying that he repudiates or condemns the actions of the IRA, At times all we hear from the IRA are apologies for their mistakes but before we could even think of talking to them or taking seriously any of their comments, there must be a total condemnation of violence.</P>
    <P>Large sums of money are expended in our courts on criminal or civil matters.  I appeal to the Minister to look particularly at the lower end of our courts system to see what improvements can be made. Some of our court buildings are an absolute disgrace; they would remind you of Dickensian or Victorian times.  In some areas they have broken windows, and in others, rats share the room with the <Col N="42" /> justice.  These matters must be looked at if we are to provide a proper system of justice.  Whether a person is charged with a serious or a less serious crime in a district or other court, it is important that all aspects of justice are dealt with fairly and that proper facilities are provided; barristers, solicitors and probation officers must have proper interview or consultation rooms to speak to clients, offenders or people who have been convicted. Everybody &mdash; justices, prison officers, clerks etc. &mdash; are entitled to higher standards of accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is not right that Dún Laoghaire courthouse should be the responsibility of Dún Laoghaire Corporation while the Department of Justice is supposed to be administering justice.  The offices dealing with the administration of justice should come under the Department of Justice. Many of our courthouses leave much to be desired.  A programme should be initiated over a few years to up-grade, up-date or, if they are beyond repair, bulldoze them.</P>
    <P>Another important area coming within the Department of Justice is the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  We are all aware of the expenses involved in the purchase of a house, particularly a second-hand house which has the added cost of stamp duty, basically another form of tax.  The overall cost of Land Registry fees is £200, £21 of which is in respect of the Registry of Deeds.  Is this a fair system?  I am not advocating that there should be an increase in the fee for the Registry of Deeds but there is a difference of £179 between the cost of registering a house and not registering it. This does not seem to be fair or equitable.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the fact that the grant to An Bord Pleanála has been reduced.  We are all aware of the importance of proper planning and having an appeals procedure in place.  A further reduction in this grant will lead to hardship for individuals and builders who may have thousands, or indeed millions, of pounds tied up in the building area.  At present there is a two month delay from when an application of appeal is submitted to a local authority and An Bord <Col N="43" /> Pleanála make a decision on that appeal. If their funds and the numbers of inspectors who have to examine files &mdash; in some cases quite complex files &mdash; are cut back it will mean further delays.</P>
    <P>The additional fee in relation to appeals, particularly by residents' associations or other responsible bodies, is prohibitive. Residents' associations may depend on a £5 or £10 annual subscription from people living in their estate and there will always be those who will not contribute.  Something should be done in relation to this.  When one lodges an application one has to pay a great deal of money including perhaps, a development levy.  Therefore, An Bord Pleanála should make decisions more speedily without rushing them through.  Appeals may be made regarding a vexatious neighbour, a small dwelling or a planning appeal, all of which must be dealt with seriously.  A planning appeal should be dealt with within a specified period, say, six months.  In that way, when a person makes an original application they will know that within six or eight months they will be able to go ahead with their project. Many people who secured financial help are in considerable difficulty. People may have expended money in order to buy land and enter into a development where jobs are at stake and they suddenly find that their assets are being whittled away in interest charges. The Minister should look at the procedures of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly the cost of inquiries.  It has got out of hand particularly in the light of the end result, reports being left on the shelf and not being acted upon.  The figures quoted in regard to the present beef inquiry are extremely high.  If people give up other opportunities they deserve to be paid the top rate, but some of the figures quoted in relation to what will be paid are outrageous and something must be done about the matter.  We have been told about the fees paid in relation to the Greencore inquiry.  In future, certain parameters should be laid down from the first day.  I am glad the Minister for Justice <Col N="44" /> is to take action to recover some of those costs; it was because of the actions of certain individuals that those costs were incurred in the first place.  These inquiries must not be allowed to run and run and become the equivalent of &ldquo;The Mousetrap&rdquo; in London, with, perhaps no result at the end.  In the next couple of days we will be discussing the Social Welfare Bill; some of those involved in the inquiries are being paid, for a couple of hours, the equivalent of what people on social welfare benefit are paid in a year.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the Department of the Marine and, in particular, the commitment of the Minister for the Marine to the upgrading and development of harbours around the country.  As I do not wish to go on a harbour tour around the country, I will confine my remarks to the harbour near me, Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The facilities there need to be upgraded and a commitment given to the long term retention of the car ferry.  I hope the Minister will give an assurance that one of the best harbours in Europe can be further developed.  People should have a choice in relation to car ferries on the east coast.  We are all well aware of the ongoing difficulties in relation to the cargo terminal in Dublin. Sealink should be given a commitment by the Minister.  With funds forthcoming, certain developments can take place and improvements can be made but none of that will be done without money.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the funding of the Ombudsman's office.  Many of us were horrified last year when there was an apparent attempt either to downgrade the responsibilities of the office or reduce its funding.  We are all aware of the undoubted success of that office since its establishment and I would like to see its responsibilities being expanded.  This office provides the man in the street with an opportunity to obtain justice and get results.  Having approached a Member of the Oireachtas about some matter a person can obtain back-up assistance from the office of the Ombudsman.  In some cases the Ombudsman may get more recognition than the Member of the <Col N="45" /> Oireachtas who makes the representations on their behalf.  I hope the commitment towards that office will continue.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a couple of areas where grants, estimates and allocations have been made, but there are many more which come under the umbrella of this Act.  I hope the Minister will be able to respond to the points I have raised, if not today then at a future date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Energy to the House this evening.  We are debating the national energy policy but my interest is in a specific and particular part of that policy.  It relates to the decision by Bord na Móna to close the briquette factory at Lullymore.  I would like to dwell on this for a short while because it is something of special interest to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lullymore is in the constituency I represent and it affects people in Kildare. There are 109 jobs now at risk because of the decision by the board to close the plant from 5 June next.  Those people have a payroll of some £2.5 million and there are hauliers and other people associated with the company.  You can see that the decision by the board has a very serious effect on the economy of a part of County Kildare where traditionally the economy has centred on the bogs and on the production from the <Col N="46" /> bogs.  Over recent years that has been running down regularly and there are very few other job opportunities in that part of the country.  That is why it is of such concern, because it is difficult to see where these people will find jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the board's activities, it is notable that between 1987 and 1991 the labour force of Bord na Móna, if my information is correct, fell from some 6,000 people to 3,200 people.  One would have thought that would have had a fairly dramatic effect on the performance of the board, on its costs and so on but, as I understand it, the wage bill for the board only reduced from £74 million to £62 million in that period when the workforce was almost halved.  That does not appear to have had a very dramatic effect on profitability.  As we all know, the indebtedness of the board has increased and is now at £185 million.  One must, therefore, question whether the reduction in the workforce has had the desired effect.</P>
    <P>The Lullymore plant is one of the older plants.  It is 35 years in service, but there has been a very good record in that plant. It has performed well over the years.  I know that in the figures the board produced to recommend closure of the plant they said that costs were 20 per cent greater at Lullymore than they are at other peat briquette plants operated by the board.  It is very easy to prove matters like that.  Statistics are very flexible, as we all know, and the figures I have seen from Lullymore indicate it is profitable and that it consistently sells what it produces.  Mill peat reserves in the catchment area are sufficient to keep the factory running for over 20 years, according to the figures provided by the local action group.</P>
    <P>There are 109 people employed at the plant.  Their gross earnings last year were about £2.5 million and obviously the loss of that spending power will have huge effects in an area which is already depressed.  The contribution of the workforce to the Exchequer in 1991 was in excess of £1 million.  It must be said that Lullymore is in an ideal situation to service the Dublin market.  It is close to <Col N="47" /> Dublin and that should have some bearing on costs.  The board has produced figures to show that solid fuel sales and sales of briquettes are declining, but I would ask the board &mdash; and I have asked them &mdash; what efforts they have made and are making to market their product and to sell it in the face of competition from products like gas.</P>
    <P>Peat briquettes are environmentally friendly.  They can be burned in Dublin and I think they are an excellent fuel. The labour force in Lullymore, which has declined too, has been increasing its productivity all along.  In the years 1983-84 it produced 60,000 tonnes of briquettes with a workforce of 220 people and this has increased to 70,000 tonnes from a force of 109 people.  The commitment of the labour force and their ability to increase productivity has been well demonstrated by these figures.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is about the people in west Kildare and about the impact the national energy policy is having on them, particularly the policy of Bord na Móna.  In that respect, therefore, I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions.  The first question is, what can the Minister say to the workers at Lullymore, in particular, what powers does he have to change the Bord na Móna decision or to alter it in any way?  In the event that he is not in a position to change the decision of the board, what assurances can be given about the future of the employees of the Lullymore briquette factory, their prospects and how will they be affected?  Will it be a question that there will be compulsory redundancies in Lullymore? What is to be the future of the employees?  Finally, is the Minister prepared to meet a representative group from the workforce at Lullymore factory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Minister for Energy to the House.  The debate before the House is a useful one and the fact that the Government side have put the motion down is to be commended.  I believe we should <Col N="48" /> be discussing and reviewing energy policy on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with several matters, I wish to say I will be sharing some of my time with Senator Naughten.</P>
      <P>Energy is very important to this country, particularly because of the high costs involved.  There is also the whole question of pursuing an energy policy which will do the minimum damage to our environment.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the policies being pursued by his Department are geared towards maximum protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that energy costs here are very high.  We all remember the oil crisis in the seventies which had a disastrous effect on this country, in terms of jobs and so on.  A lot of that was outside our control, but there are other matters within our control.  I hope it will be part of our policy to develop alternative sources of energy and not to have all our eggs in the one basket, so to speak. In the case of oil, we have no control; we simply have to pay the going rate &mdash; but we should be seeking all the time to develop various alternatives, particularly those that do not adversely affect the environment.</P>
      <P>What is our policy in relation to safety? It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the ongoing difficulties associated with Sellafield.  Can the Minister assure us that he has been pursuing this matter at EC level, particularly in regard to inspections and reports?  We read recently about reactors in Eastern Europe causing problems and perhaps being closed down.  In relation to Sellafield, our ultimate aim at European level must be to have it closed down.  In the interim, outside inspectors &mdash; and I hope the Irish can be represented at such inspections &mdash; must examine the situation and bring any problems to the fore.  Too many matters have been swept under the carpet.  It is important that adequate safety measures should go hand in hand with an energy policy and that there are adequate inspections to ensure that, at all times, the people are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the previous speaker said about the situation which has <Col N="49" /> developed at Lullymore, County Kildare.  I hope the Minister will give the workers some assurances in relation to their redeployment if jobs have to go.  It appears that this plant was successful, even if some of its operations were outdated or outmoded, and one must ask should its updating have been looked at earlier.  It has been suggested that the marketing approach was not conducive to selling more of the product.  A clear, concise, direct and adventurous marketing policy has to be pursued.  I hope when the Minister replies he will be able to give some assurance to those people who are victims of a managerial decision.</P>
    <P>As I said, various matters have to be pursued in relation to an energy policy. First, it is important that we promote energy saving companies, as happened in the United States with business expansion scheme tax relief for initial capital. Second, we should encourage energy saving in public buildings by allowing public bodies retain half the savings achieved against their base line energy budget.  Third, we should install computerised traffic controls, improve urban traffic management and promote a switch to public transport.  A reliable public transport system, or car pooling and car sharing would lead to a great financial saving to those who used them.</P>
    <P>We should also introduce compulsory fuel efficiency labelling for vehicles and equipment.  We should revise planning legislation to ensure that all new housing developments meet specified new minimum energy conservation standards, which would cut energy loss by one-third compared to existing standards.  We have already discussed the cost of motoring here.  With tax being brought back towards pre-1977 levels and with very high costs of motor insurance and the prohibitively high cost of fuel, we must look at the total tax take in this area and work towards reducing the cost.  Any reduction should be passed on immediately because increases are all too quickly passed on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and look forward to hearing from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for sharing his time.  As he stated, this debate is very timely because over the past 12 to 18 months we have seen the disappearance of the coal burning power station in Arigna with the loss of 220 jobs there.  That source of energy, coal burning is no longer available unless we import coal from half way round the world.</P>
      <P>The time has come when we must decide on a clear energy policy.  We must decide how great a percentage of our energy we are going to extract from natural gas and whether we are going to pipe it throughout the country or use it for the manufacture of electricity.  The generation of electricity from water seems to be on the downturn and one wonders why such an environmental friendly source of energy would not be encouraged to a far greater extent.  We see also a changeover to windpower; I understand a major windfield is in the course of construction in Ballincorrig, County Mayo.  What exactly is the future for that?  What is the Department of Energy's policy on that? Is it intended to encourage more of those windfields, because I know of one other developer who is very interested in getting into that source of power and to sell the electricity to the ESB?</P>
      <P>We also have a source of energy which is very close to your heart, Sir, and mine, that is, peat.  I will not deal with petrol and diesel as Senator Cosgrave has dealt with them very effectively.  He pointed out how those resources can be improved by the greater use of public transport and improved traffic flows.  I intend to deal with the whole question of peat development, which is one of the vital issues for the future of the midlands.  Senator Dardis referred to the closure of Lullymore, but we also are faced with the closure of Ballyforan as a source of energy production.  Such closures have a devastating effect on rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the time approaching, perhaps in two, three or four years, when if the finances of Bord na Móna are not put into shape we will have stations like Rhode, Ferbane, Boora and others closing with devastating effect across the midlands. <Col N="51" /> The finances of Bord na Móna must be tackled seriously.  Unless they get share capital and equity the company will have no possibility of survival.  They cannot carry a debt just short of £200 million and pay interest; I understand interest payments by Bord na Móna last year were in the region of £22 million.  No company can tolerate that burden and the sooner the finances of Bord na Móna are got into shape so that they can go into the marketplace and produce new saleable commodities, the better.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon and east Galway we are extremely concerned about Ballyforan and all the development that took place in the Derryfadda bogs.  More than £20 million was ploughed into it by Bord na Móna in drainage, railroads and office accommodation, and all of that will be lying idle by the end of this year.  That cannot be tolerated.  I cannot see how taxpayers' money can be used, or abused, in that manner.  I recognise that much of this is due to bad management in the past.  Indeed, I pointed out at a meeting on Monday where in November 1982 the then Minister for Justice cut the sod in Ballyforan for the building of the briquette factory but four months later the then general manager of Bord na Móna went to the new Government and said they wanted to defer the project. That is the type of bad management I am talking about that existed at that time.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ballyforan has a future. From what I have been told by the ESB, with the growth in the demand for electricity and the fact that some of the power stations in the midlands will have to be closed down due to the bogs being worked out, there is a future for Ballyforan. I am appealing to the Minister on behalf of the workers and the people of the Ballyforan area to at least give an extension of one year's manufacturing to Ballyforan so that the workforce of 32 can be retained.  If that requires a transport subsidy, so be it.  It is much cheaper to pay a transport subsidy to move the peat from Ballyforan to Shannonbridge or Lanesborough than it is to pay people unemployment assistance.  Certainly, it <Col N="52" /> is a far greater asset that this strategic resource would be utilised for the benefit of the people of the area and for the benefit of the families of the people who, by and large, donated that bog to Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Do not let anybody try to tell me Bord na Móna bought that bog; they did not, they confiscated it.  Some people were paid for it, others were not.  They have a huge resource of 17,000 acres of bog there.  What is going to be done with that? I think it is an issue that must be dealt with.  Is that bog going to be left lying there for the next 25 or 30 years, or will it be utilised in the interest of the people who gave that bog to Bord na Móna on the clear understanding that there would be jobs there for their families and friends?  That is not happening.  I would like to know what is going to happen to that major resource.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies very clearly made their view known with regard to the future of Bord na Móna.  I think that committee's proposals should be seriously considered.  Prior to Bord na Móna moving into the Ballyforan group of bogs, the Derryfadda group of bogs as they are known, we had a huge area of forestry there.  We also had the Sugar Company manufacturing grassmeal and employing 40 people.  All those jobs are gone and we are left with nothing in their place.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  I am appealing to the Minister to ensure that the processing of peat continues there in 1992 and that in the long term something is done to restructure the finances of Bord na Móna.  I am not just talking about Ballyforan or about Lullymore; I am talking about the whole of the midlands when I talk about a restructuring of the finances of Bord na Móna. That is of vital importance and I appeal to the Minister to address that issue as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing energy policy.  This is a very broad and important subject and <Col N="53" /> I would like to address a few points.  I accept that the main thrust of the debate to date has been on the whole question of energy policy in relation to Bord na Móna.  From a national economic point of view, from an import substitution point of view and also from a jobs point of view, logic would say that it would be reasonable not to run down the operations of Bord na Móna.  Before the internal accounts of any State company are taken into account we must from now on investigate if we are just saving a company some money and actually adding a bigger burden on the Exchequer.  In simple terms, would the subsidy Bord na Móna would require to keep the likes of Lulleymore open and develop the bogs in Roscommon be less than the extra cost in social welfare, social housing, health etc. that will be incurred if these people are put on social welfare, plus the loss in revenue from PRSI and tax?  In my view, unless that sum balances in favour of the redundancy, leaving out all the social consequences, it would actually be cheaper from the State's point of view as the only shareholder in Bord na Móna, to keep the jobs going.  If we start doing the sums this way we will actually wind up increasing the State bills on every front.</P>
    <P>We also have to look at energy policy in general.  As a small island nation we are very dependent on our own sources of energy.  I welcome proposals to link us into international grids.  I raise the question why another drive is not made to try to really co-ordinate and interlink the energy policies of both parts of this island.  My understanding is that in the North there is a surplus capacity for the generation of electricity.  I know there have been problems with bombings, etc. and interconnectors, but I feel we should try, and try again, to get across to people, in the interest of the island.  North and South, of unity of the people and of our economy and in every positive way that the idea of having a single energy policy, particularly in gas and electricity, makes economic sense.  It is somewhat ironic heading into 1992 &mdash; it will really happen in 1993 &mdash; that we will not have the energy <Col N="54" /> production in this country integrated on those two fronts by that time.  That is a pity.  If we did, the savings plus the cooperation would be to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>I would like to address next the question of the monopoly of the ESB.  I know there have been calls for privatisation.  I know there are people who would be anxious to split it up.  To my way of thinking that is something that certainly should not be considered lightly.  I am all in favour of allowing people private generation of electricity to feed into the national grid, but I could not agree with the idea of in some way privatising the grid itself.  Doing such a thing would in my view, inevitably have this consequence. At present you have an equalisation of cost &mdash; in other words, we pay the same for a unit of electricity in the most remote parts of Ireland &mdash; but in a situation where you allow the profitable transmission part to be hived off you would find that those who live on the periphery, in the areas where the people interested in private enterprise transmission live, would be left with a much more expensive source of power.</P>
    <P>Another issue in connection with the ESB that we have to address is the question of alternative energy, of putting more resources into wind power, wave power and various types of biomass, etc. It always seem to me that when there is a crisis &mdash; an oil crisis, an oil shortage, a rise in oil prices &mdash; suddenly we get enthusiastic about these things, but by the time we have made any progress the crisis is over, the ideas are put away again for another day and there the matter rests.  However, sources of energy which can be regenerated have attractions over and above their renewability and their cost because they also tend to be the most environmentally friendly types of energy one could have.  We must once again provide resources for the research and development of various types of alternative energy.  Most people see alternative energy as a hobby but it must not be beyond the wit of man to harness the phenomenal amount of energy in both <Col N="55" /> wind and wave power.  I am sure that if the resources were provided, ways could be found to generate considerable amounts of energy from these sources.</P>
    <P>Another issue that must be tackled is conservation.  We cannot continue to use more and more energy in the western world.  There are only finite supplies of fossil fuels.  We must recognise that many environmental problems are caused by overuse of energy.  Again, no more than the sources of alternate energy, this is an issue that tends to become popular at times of crisis, and then tends to fade into the background when energy supplies are plentiful.</P>
    <P>Tá seanfhocal sa Ghaeilge a deireann: &ldquo;ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb&rdquo;, agus creidim go mba cheart go mbeadh polasaí an-deimhneach arís ar chumhacht a úsáid ar bhealaí i bhfad níos éifeachtaí ná mar atá sí á úsáid i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>On the issue of conservation, we know, for example, that modern street lights give something like a quarter extra power and only use two-thirds of the amount of energy.  We have domestic light bulbs that use one-fifth the amount of energy to provide the same amount of light in lumens.  There are a number of methods for saving vast quantities of energy; for example, if even half the light bulbs in domestic dwellings were changed from the existing ones to energy efficient bulbs the savings in energy used would be considerable.</P>
    <P>As one involved in industry, I know there are many ways to conserve energy. Many generating schemes waste the byproduct of heat they produce.  Many industrial furnaces are similarly wasteful of heat.  Heat is a usable form of energy. It is very important to examine how we could make better use of our energy resources and cut down on the total amount of energy we use.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with conservation, Bord na Móna and the ESB.  I would like to talk about one other subject, that is, the possibility of carbon taxes being introduced and their possible effect on the economy, particularly the economy of the west.  The Minister, coming from <Col N="56" /> Galway, is only too aware of the huge transport costs we in the west have to bear.  The idea of carbon taxes has been mooted in Brussels to discourage people from burning fossil fuels.  In principle, none of us can argue with that because we all know the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels. However, if carbon taxes are introduced across Europe without taking account of the different, absolute, non-discretionary requirements of various industries and locations in relation to the use of fossil fuels, particularly for the burning of diesel and petrol, will be further disadvantaged. Those living on the periphery will be further disadvantaged.  I know that would not be the intention of such a tax, but it would be the effect.  If carbon taxes were to become a reality those on the periphery should have the least tax imposed on them as it is vital that they have access to markets.  If open and free markets mean anything and if we want to level the playing pitch in Europe, we cannot continue to place unfair tax burdens on those people living on the periphery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Energy is a very important issue.  Some cynics might ask what policy? We did not know we had a policy to debate.  However, it is extremely important that we have a comprehensive national energy policy.  When I talk about policy I am talking about it in the broadest terms because when we discuss energy we must discuss all sources of energy &mdash; natural energy, produced energy and human resources; there is human energy also.  We have made some strides in this area but I am not sure to what extent there has been a co-ordinated policy. There is some evidence now of co-ordinated activity from the Department of Energy.  I suppose the Department of Finance are using their muscle in that direction also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way from the mid-seventies oil crisis when industry was almost totally dependent on oil.  We are <Col N="57" /> now less than 50 per cent dependent on oil and that is very welcome because oil is not an indigenous energy source &mdash; it is imported.  I am delighted that we have very definitely turned our backs on the nuclear energy.  I am sure nobody now would dream of being associated with Carnsore even though there were strong proposals and backing from previous Ministers for Energy who would not like to be associated with it now; far be it for me to name any Minister.</P>
    <P>We have done very well to ban the burning of bituminous coal in Dublin city.  That is a welcome and progressive move as far as the environment is concerned. Bad energy policy can be detrimental to the environment.  On the other hand, we have been wrong to place so much emphasis on coal.  We have moved from using oil to using coal.  That is particularly true in relation to Money-point, County Clare, where we have created far greater capacity in terms of electricity production and generation than we need, using imported material, in other words, American coal.</P>
    <P>We have perhaps failed most in responding to human needs where we interfered with indigenous energy generation. I refer to two areas: Lullymore in the midlands and Arigna on the borders of Sligo, Roscommon and Leitrim. What I find appalling is that both decisions were taken unilaterally by the authorities.  Lullymore is the oldest briquette factory in existence and Arigna is the last remaining coal producing mine &mdash; it was operating in the last century. Communities were established in both areas and in the case of Lullymore, land was compulsorily purchased by Bord na Móna.  Then, out of the blue, a decision was taken to abandon those communities. This is an intolerable way of dealing with matters.  It is one thing to say that an operation is inefficient, it is another to abandon a community.</P>
    <P>In the case of Arigna, 200 jobs were lost in 1990-91 when the mines closed down, and now a further 50 jobs have been lost with the closure of the power station.  The loss of approximately 250 jobs in a small rural area has catastrophic <Col N="58" /> effects on a community.  The approach that should have been adopted was the one I argued for at the time &mdash; I am sure the Minister will remember it.  We should have put in place a task force to examine the possibility of providing alternative employment for the Arigna community by developing the indigenous material that was in the ground, coal, and particularly crow coal that could have been used for the production of cement in Drogheda.  In other words, by diversifying a new industry based on that natural resource would have been created and as a result, the community would not have been scattered to the four corners of the world.  Soon there will be nothing but sheep looking over the hedges in the west.  Now, United Meat Packers have closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have afforestation and sheep runs in that area but no people.  I am worried that the same type of approach is being taken in relation to Lullymore.  There, too, a decision was taken unilaterally although there were a number of options.  The factory was producing a surplus of 45 per cent.  Employment could have been reduced on a temporary basis in the four briquette factories.  This would have been more humane than hitting an entire community and putting 109 or 110 people out of work.  Production could have been reduced in that way.  New markets could have been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna have incredibly valuable products &mdash; milled peat, briquettes and horticultural products for gardens and farmland.  It is difficult to see how there could be a lack of markets if there was a proper marketing policy.  It is ironic that the people of Lullymore are being penalised for over-production.  It is at our peril that we do this with an indigenous resource like peat and allow this community to join the dole queue.  I understand that last year Lullymore paid the Exchequer more than £1 million in taxes. Now, the Exchequer will have to pay social welfare to those people who have <Col N="59" /> joined the unemployed.  There are not likely to be many jobs available for the people in the midlands, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo.  When we are talking about an energy policy we must be sensitive to the human factor.  There are many forms of energy.  The last coal mine in Ireland has been closed and turf as a form of energy is being used to a much lesser degree than in the past.  Gas is a new source of energy.  However, there is a huge variety of energy sources &mdash; wind, water, oil, waste and biomass.  When we talk about an energy policy we must see how we can utilise energy sources that are environmentally friendly.  That must be the criterion for any energy policy.</P>
    <P>The new clean energy source of Kinsale gas came into operation towards the end of the seventies.  That was a very welcome development and I am glad we are exploring the possibility of a connecting link with Britain.  I hope the pipeline to Northern Ireland will be constructed and that a connecting link with Northern Ireland, Britain, and the Continent will be established.  This would be very important, especially if there is a danger of our own resources running out at some future date.  I would like to see this energy form extended to medium sized towns in Ireland, although it is not available in certain areas of Dublin.  That is something I would like to see as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Electricity is a major form of energy and is one we have focused on more than any other in recent times.  However, I have certain reservations at the way it is generated.  We closed down the power station in Arigna.  We rely less on peat to generate electricity and we have put almost all our eggs into the one basket of Moneypoint.  There must be a big question mark over that because we are relying on a single generating station which at present has excess capacity.  There is every intention of extending the amount of electricity generated there but we are relying on cheap imported coal from America to do so.  At present it is cheap imported coal but we would do well to remember what in 1973 we relied on <Col N="60" /> cheap imported oil and then it simply ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the privatisation of the generation of electricity. It is too important a resource.  It is a national resource and is needed for the development of the country in industrial and domestic terms.  I would hate to see it going down the same road as the beef industry which became privatised and we know what happened there.</P>
    <P>We must concentrate on alternative sources of energy and on energy conservation. One-third of energy generated is lost in the process of generation.  I ask the Minister to place particular emphasis on conserving energy resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this House on the subject of Ireland's energy policy.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister for Energy in 1989, it was clear to me that the single most important objective of energy policy must be to maximise the contribution which this sector can make to the nation's overall economic development. A modern-day economy must have adequate and secure supplies of energy available at the lowest possible cost if it is to prosper, if it is to generate employment for our workforce and if it is to provide the modern standard of life to which Irish people now rightly aspire.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Government's energy policy is very practical and simple.  It is to ensure that consumers can obtain energy at the minimum possible cost consistent with security of supply and environmental considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of complicating factors which have a significant impact on how that policy is implemented.  First, Ireland's position as an island on the edge of Europe places us at an immediate disadvantage as regards access to the world energy market.  Secondly, there is as yet no integration between our electricity and gas systems and the European networks. Thirdly, we are not rich in energy resources and are thus obliged to import some 70 per cent of our energy needs. Fourthly, we have a small and widely <Col N="61" /> dispersed population and this adds to the cost of supplying energy.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons, therefore, that the security and diversity of energy supply must be given primary importance. In recent years two other key objectives have emerged.</P>
    <P>First, as our economy has come to depend more and more on exports the relative price of energy in Ireland, compared to that of our trading partners, has gained in importance.  This has highlighted the need for greater competition within the energy supply system so as to enable Irish business improve its competitiveness through lower energy prices.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the growing concern to protect our environment has forced us to look closely at the relationship between supply and demand and, in particular, to focus on improving demand side management so as to achieve greater efficiencies in the use of fuels and greater conservation of primary energy.</P>
    <P>The energy scene in Ireland cannot be viewed in academic isolation.  It involves significant interactions which are affected by internal, and especially external factors as exemplified by the three major threats to security of oil supply since 1973.</P>
    <P>The Irish energy scene has evolved considerably over the past decade.  In 1980, some 70 per cent of our total primary energy requirement was met by oil. Only 22 per cent of our energy needs were met from our own resources.  This position left us very vulnerable to supply disruptions and price rises associated with the volatile oil market.</P>
    <P>As a result of consistent Government policy since then, the picture in 1990 was much better.  While total energy consumption has increased by 20 per cent we now depend on oil to meet only 46 per cent of our needs.  Indigenous energy has increased by 10 per cent and now accounts for 32 per cent of our requirements with all the benefits that implies in terms of our balance of payments and employment.  The use of natural gas has increased from 6 per cent to 16 per cent over the decade while peat and hydro have remained static at 15 per cent and <Col N="62" /> 1 per cent respectively.  Imported coal and Irish natural gas have replaced a large part of our oil requirement.</P>
    <P>The development of indigenous energy resources is an important element of national energy policy from the point of view of increasing security of supply and diversity of fuels in the market.  The impact on the balance of payments position and on employment must not be overlooked either.  In this context, the Government are determined that Bord na Móna will continue as a major contributor to Ireland's energy needs in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The company's core business is the provision of milled peat to the ESB for the generation of electricity.  Bord na Móna must continue to concentrate on reducing, to the lowest extent possible, the cost of producing milled peat for the ESB.  Given current world energy prices, it is likely that having achieved these reductions the cost of peat for electricity generation will still be comparatively high.</P>
    <P>This raises wider issues not solely relating to energy policy.  Bord na Móna employ more than 2,000 people, concentrated mainly in the midlands region. In the absence of new employment opportunities being brought onstream, any substantial reduction or phasing out of peat fired electricity generation would have major social and economic consequences for the region.  These issues will have to be tackled collectively by the Government to ensure that the policy objective of low price secure energy is achieved.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have made reference to the problems facing Bord na Móna and particularly the recent announcement by the board that the briquette factory at Lullymore is to close. As I have already indicated publicly, I very much regret the necessity for this decision but there does not appear to be any alternative.  Total briquetting capacity in the four factories amounts to almost 560,000 tonnes whereas projected sales in the current year amount to about 400,000 tonnes.  In effect, capacity exceeds current and foreseeable demand <Col N="63" /> by a little more than the equivalent of a factory's production.  Bord na Móna estimates that sales of briquettes will decline over the next decade so that overcapacity will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>The reason Lullymore was chosen were detailed by Bord na Móna in information issued to public representatives which I will quote and put them on the record of Seanad Éireann.  Factory production costs at Lullymore are close to 20 per cent greater than the average of the other factories.  The numbers of employees and the costs associated with redundancy payments at Lullymore are less than 75 per cent of those involved in any of the other factories.  The factory at Lullymore is considerably disadvantaged by comparison with the other factories in relation to indoor storage facilities.  The impact on sales revenue arising from the closure of Lullymore is considerably less than would occur if any of the other factories were closed.  If a factory is to be closed, the combination of factories which optimise the remaining production capacity in relation to demand is that which excludes the factory at Lullymore.</P>
    <P>I am convinced Bord na Móna must continue to be a major contributor to the Irish economy for many years to come. This contribution must be based on the provisions of viable and sustainable employment within the company's operations. In the short term, this requires that the board must reduce its level of borrowing and concentrate its attention on reducing costs.  I am acutely conscious of the importance of Bord na Móna to the economy of the midlands in particular and it is for precisely that reason that I want to ensure that Bord na Móna is positioned to operate as a viable company, providing secure and viable employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked me some specific questions in relation to the situation at Lullymore, particularly as to whether there would be compulsory redundancies. I am pleased to inform the House that the chairman of Bord na Móna has informed me that there will not be compulsory redundancies.  There <Col N="64" /> will be an offer of voluntary redundancy and an offer of redeployment.  He also asked me if I would meet with workers representatives.  If the workers representatives would first seek a meeting with the management of Bord na Móna, and possibly with the chairman and members of the board of Bord na Móna, and if after such a meeting they still wished to see me I would be pleased to meet with them.  I must make it clear that I fully support the board's decision.</P>
    <P>Senators Finneran and Naughten spoke at length on the need for development of bogs in the Derryfada area.  The problems which face Bord na Móna generally and which gave rise to the closure of Lullymore, also apply to Derryfada. The bogs in Derryfada were developed with the intention of building a fifth briquette factory.  That plan had to be abandoned when it became clear that there was no market for the output.</P>
    <P>While the change in the fuel mix over the past decade has reduced our dependence on oil and has improved security of supply, it is accepted that the greatest threat to security still relates to oil supplies. In order to further reduce this risk I have given special attention to emergency measures, including improving our national stock position.</P>
    <P>Oil supply security is also directly related to the quality of our oil infrastructure. If, in order to cut down on expenditure, we reduced the infrastructure simply to a product import and distribution operation, then our economy would become an oil &ldquo;price taker&rdquo;, being forced to accept Rotterdam prices.  Also, a slimmed-down infrastructure would leave the country vulnerable to supply disruptions as we are positioned at the outer edge of the oil supply chain.</P>
    <P>The Whiddy oil terminal is a very valuable national asset.  Its million tonnes of oil storage capacity would cost at least $120 million to build today.  Its important strategic role was emphasised during the Gulf crisis, when I directed that 205,000 tonnes of crude oil be placed there to help keep the economy moving in the event of oil shortages, which were then widely expected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> The thrust of my policy, therefore, has been to retain as many elements of the oil infrastructure as possible in order to deliver secure supplies at the most economic cost.  Consequently, the return of the Whitegate refinery to normal commercial operation and the reactivation of the Whiddy oil terminal is a high priority. An operating, profitable, oil terminal together with a profitable refinery, supplying competitively priced products, would confer both local and macro-economic benefits in addition to extra security at no net cost.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution, of course, would be a discovery of an Irish oil source and that now leads me on to deal with matters relating to exploration policy.  In order to intensify the search for oil and gas my Department are currently conducting a complete review of our licensing terms for offshore exploration.  The purpose of this is to ensure that our terms are attractive in today's exploration climate.  The other major initiative in the exploration sector is the introduction of petroleum tax legislation in this year's Finance Bill. The new licensing terms will be in place by June this year and, combined with the certainty which will then emerge on the taxation front, will provide the encouragement to international exploration companies to once again operate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that Marathon Petroleum has agreed to undertake a programme of seven exploration wells in addition to a significant amount of seismic data acquisition.  Also, in 1993 a licensing round will be held for &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; acreage off the west and north-west coasts and already there has been a significant level of interest in this area since the announcement of the round.</P>
    <P>The development of our natural gas resources has meant a saving of £2 billion on our imports bill to date.  1991 also saw the first production from our second gas field at Ballycotton.  Although modest in size, Ballycotton has proved that it is possible to commercially develop such deposits.</P>
    <P>While I hope we will discover more gas offshore it is only prudent to act now in order to ensure that gas continues to be available in the future.  To that end, Bord <Col N="66" /> Gáis Éireann in close co-operation with my Department, have planned an undersea gas pipeline from Dublin to Scotland. This interconnector will enable us to import gas.  The pipeline will cost some £287 million in current prices and we will receive a grant of some 35 per cent of the cost from the EC.  Work on the installation will start later this year and will be completed in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the event that a new large Irish gas field were to be discovered, the existence of this pipeline will enable us to export gas.  In fact, the gas interconnector between here and the UK could give a stimulus to gas exploration activity as exploration companies would no longer be constrained by the limited size of the Irish market.  They would be free to export gas to the UK if the home market were unable to absorb additional supplies.</P>
    <P>In recent years the greenhouse effect has become a focus of attention in the EC and the UN.  The House will be aware that the EC decided in 1990 to limit CO² emissions in the Community as a whole to that year's level by year 2000.  The strategy proposed to meet this objective includes energy efficiency and conservation, switching to fuels with lower CO² emissions, and fiscal measures.</P>
    <P>The policy being developed contains first the &ldquo;no regret&rdquo; form of action such as energy conservation and efficiency, then fuel switching from high emitters such as oil or coal to low such as natural gas.  In order to stabilise CO² in a cost-effective way, however, it is likely that higher energy pricing through the use of fiscal instruments may be needed to complement national and Community energy efficiency programmes.  This is where the notion of a &ldquo;carbon tax&rdquo; stems from.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe, however, and my EC colleagues agreed with me at the Council that other major questions must be addressed before we embark on that course of action.  One important question is whether the imposition of a tax would lead to a reduction in energy consumption and ultimately achieve the desired environmental effect.  We also have to examine the macroeconomic effect a tax would have on the country as <Col N="67" /> a whole and whether it would be compatible with a sound energy policy.</P>
    <P>Events last week in the former Soviet Union will have reminded Senators of the dangers inherent in nuclear power generation.  Government policy has consistently over the years stressed that safety issues and the risk of serious accidents with trans-boundary implications are still at the very basis of the nuclear question.  As this debate is concerned with national energy policy, I do not propose to deal further with that issue on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, fuel substitution is a limited option.  While renewables technology is still under-developed, it can make a major contribution to fuel saving and must be utilised as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>In the case of hydro the potential for any major increase is limited as there are no suitable large-scale sites available. There is a range of small-scale sites, generally in remote locations dotted around the country, which offer potential for mini hydro schemes.  Where it is shown to be viable in economic and planning terms, I will continue to support the development of this resource.</P>
    <P>The other renewable sources most likely to be relevant in Ireland are wind and wave and we have an abundance of both these resources particularly along the western seaboard.  Exploitation of both wind and wave power is highly capital intensive.  In order to produce a reasonable return on investment in wind energy, assuming there are no grants or other financial supports available, a considerably higher price would need to be paid than that currently available from the ESB for bought in electricity. However, it also has to be recognised that unlike fossil fuels, there are no social or environmental costs associated with renewables and consequently there is a case to be made for paying a higher unit price for the electricity produced from these sources.</P>
    <P>The 6.45 megawatt wind farm which will be constructed at Bellacorick in County Mayo later this year, with assistance from the EC Valorean Fund, will play a key role in the development of renewables in Ireland.  Wind has the <Col N="68" /> potential to supply a much greater quantity of energy than hydro-electric power which is why it is worth pursuing even if the technology is not as well developed.  I hope the Bellacorick project will be a great success and a forerunner of greater things to come.</P>
    <P>Measures to improve energy conservation and efficiency have an importasnt role to play in reducing fuel and environmental costs and in deferring the necessity for capital expenditure on new capacity for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Consumer information is probably at the core of trying to secure a new vision of the part of the final end-users to the benefits of energy efficiency.  Unfortunately, energy conservation is not given as high a priority as it deserves by most householders and businesses.  Insufficient or poor quality consumer information can lead to misguided decisions and distorted expenditure priorities.  Therefore, consumer information, encouragement and persuasion have a key role to play in the promotion of greater energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>However, the role of legislative and administrative actions must also be examined to supplement these efforts and to ensure, if necessary, that the community's interests as a whole are not neglected. At European Community level, Ireland is playing its part to ensure that the current momentum is maintained leading to the early adoption of further measures to promote energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>The development of reliable, fully automatic, combined heat and power (CHP) generating systems, capable of unsupervised operation for long periods has opened up a new field of energy saving.  However, the economic viability of CHP projects depends critically on the demand for heat and power at particular sites being reasonably well matched so that overall energy use can be optimised and energy losses kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I believe our utilities also have a vital role to play in energy conservation.  The ESB are engaged in a campaign to promote the efficient use of electricity.  They are actively promoting the use of more efficient lighting, water heating and insulation in Irish homes.  The ESB are also engaged in surveys and energy audits <Col N="69" /> to promote greater efficiency in the industrial and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there is need for a co-ordinated approach by ESB and BGÉ in relation to certain aspects of energy policy.  It is important that State companies, pursuing separate corporate objectives and competing with each other for market share, would not lose sight of broader national policy objectives.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on now to consider some of the wider issues in the energy scene.  The European Commission is pushing hard for liberalisation of gas and electricity markets in member states and for maximum use of trading opportunities between member states.  I have already indicated to the EC that Ireland strongly supports the effort to achieve a Community market for energy and that the markets for electricity and gas are central to that objective.</P>
    <P>A major step in that direction was made during Ireland's Presidency in 1990 towards the adoption of the transit directives for electricity and gas which provide the right for electricity and gas utilities to negotiate transit across neighbouring transmission grids and the transparency directive which provides for publication by the Commission of information on prices charged to industrial consumers.</P>
    <P>The Commission holds the view that the liberalisation of electricity and gas markets will be of enormous benefit to consumers.  They are convinced there are considerable in-built diseconomies in existing systems which are defended by vested interests in both industries.  I must say there is a natural logic to this view and, independently of the EC, I have for some time now given careful consideration to changes which might be made in the structure of the Irish electricity system.</P>
    <P>I recently brought proposals to Cabinet and I am pleased the Government have approved my proposal for a major review of the ESB with the intention of introducing competition into the electricity sector and increasing the transparency of costs.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Senators, who may have misinterpreted these proposals, that there are no proposals in my Department for the privatisation of the <Col N="70" /> ESB.  I envisage that the ESB will be split into two separate State companies, one for transmission and distribution and the other for generation; both companies would remain in public ownership.  Any private company could choose to build a power station at any time and its power would be made available for sale to the distribution company on equal terms and in a competitive manner.  The distribution company would charge for use of its network but would not profit from buying and selling electricity.  It would also be responsible for construction and operation of international electricity links.  The reason for this approach is simple; there is scope for competition in the generation business and no necessity for a monopoly.  There will also be scope for competition between generators in Ireland and those in other EC member states if an electricity interconnector were to be established.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the points made by other Senators.  The potential for buy-up fuels and energy crops has been raised during this debate by Senator McDonald.  The major obstacle to the use of vegetable oil as an alternative to gas, oil and diesel is the cost of production. Having listened to Senator McDonald I wish to give the House the other side of that picture.  If Irish farmers were to be rewarded for growing oil seed to the same extent as they are at present rewarded for growing cereal crops the cost would be twice as great.  Furthermore, to meet Ireland's need for road diesel with sunflower or rape seed, it would be necessary to devote about half of Ireland's arable land to oil seed crops. I am sure the House will agree this would not be practical or economically viable. I will, however, continue to monitor progress in relation to that technology.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely asked when unit one at the Tarbert power station will be reopened.  I am pleased to inform him that I understand the likely date for its reopening is April 1993.  I was asked by Senator O'Keeffe about electricity interconnection between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The ESB and the Northern Ireland Electricity Company have recently announced a joint plan for co-operative strengthening <Col N="71" /> of electricity networks in Donegal and Fermanagh, in areas where networks are weak and consumers are particularly at risk from breakdown due to equipment failure and storm damage.  Both companies are anxious to see the North-South interconnector restored, but unfortunately, as the House knows, the problem is related to terrorist activity rather than technical or economic matters.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the House and to the Senators for the points they have made. Any points I have not responded to will be carefully considered in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to address this House on this important issue.  In the time available to me I will make some brief comments on the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that a decision has been made and that work is about to commence soon on an interconnector for gas and I hope eventually we will have an interconnector for electricity also.  It is well known there is surplus capacity in Northern Ireland and we should not only connect to Northern Ireland but across to Britain, which, in turn, is connected to the mainland of Europe.  That would give us security of supply and competition that we do not have to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased also to note the Minister is thinking of breaking up the Electricity Supply Board into two companies, one to control transmission and the other to control generation.  However, that move will not generate competition because we will still have only one source of electricity leaving us vulnerable to the kind of action we saw last year when a few people with an imagined grievance were able to bring the country to a virtual standstill.  The only way to avoid that and to ensure an electricity supply at a reasonable price is to have real competition which we can have if we buy electricity from outside and let the generation plants at home compete for the market.  Alternatively, we could break up the existing generation capacity of the ESB, and enable a number of companies, plus private companies as the Minister said, to compete for the market.  Until <Col N="72" /> that happens, we are going to remain vulnerable to strike action and we are not going to get the kind of service or energy cost-effectiveness we might have.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister said that Whiddy is a strategically important oil terminal, but he only vaguely mentioned Whitegate Oil Refinery.  My understanding is that Whitegate is in need of a significant capital injection to bring it up to modern-day standards and we must decide soon whether to do so or not. Presumably it is still strategically important for Ireland to have its own refinery even if it refines only a proportion of our total supply.</P>
    <P>In the broader context, I think the Minister would agree the world as a whole must do more to protect renewable supplies of energy.  Given present levels of population &mdash; and world population will double within the next 40 years &mdash; if all national economies were developed to European standards, let alone to that of the US and Japan, we would have a serious environmental problem with regard to energy utilisation and supply.</P>
    <P>Our generation and generations before us have lived off the capital of fossil fuel that built up over millions of years and it has afforded us a standard of living we were not really entitled to.  We have had energy at a cheap price, but it behoves our generation and the next generation to ensure that energy will be available for future generations and that requires investment and research.  The best prospect for a long term solution is nuclear fission.</P>
    <P>With regard to nuclear energy, the Minister rightly said that there are risks associated with it but without the energy currently generated by nuclear fission or nuclear energy plants we would have both an energy and an environmental crisis.  Whatever the risks attached, we could not do without nuclear energy at the moment.  I am not suggesting that we build nuclear power plants, although Japan and several other countries are doing so.  Our economy does not warrant a nuclear plant of its own but I would not mind seeing Ireland being connected with mainland Europe for energy supply; France produces 70 per cent of its electricity from nuclear energy and has <Col N="73" /> nuclear energy available at a fairly competitive price.  We might buy energy from there to generate some real competition at home.</P>
    <P>We could do much to conserve energy. Most buildings and homes in Ireland are inadequately insulated; most of our vehicles are inadequately serviced and are not working efficiently.  I am sorry to note that in his budget speech, the Minister for Finance took the extraordinary step of making a significant cut in the price of petrol and no cut in the price of diesel when we all know that diesel is more efficient and more environmentally friendly.  I was disappointed, too, in relation to road taxation, that while the Minister increased taxation he also imposed a ceiling of £800 which means that while I will have a 20 per cent increase in taxation on my modest vehicle, if I were driving a Rolls Royce I would save about £600.  That does not make sense to me.  We should be discouraging the use of large gas guzzlers, as they call them in the US.</P>
    <P>On the international scene Ireland should be playing its part in discouraging the extraordinary wastage of energy occurring in some economies particularly the United States.  The US, with about 5 per cent of the world's population, accounts for over 30 per cent of total oil consumption each year.  We have a voice and we should make it heard to ensure that the developed economies take steps through research and investment to ensure that generations still unborn will have an adequate supply of energy and that our environment will not be damaged by the kind of energy exploitation in which we and our predecessors have indulged.  We want to provide a better environment and a better standard of living for the generations that will succeed us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for giving this worthwhile debate three hours over the past two weeks.  I thank the Minister for being here for the two days of the debate and also for giving a very comprehensive and detailed reply.  He has covered all areas and aspects of Irish energy policy and I compliment him for clarifying that there is no question of <Col N="74" /> privatising the ESB but that he proposes to devolve the ESB into two companies, one for distribution and one for generation of electricity, which is a welcome move.</P>
      <P>I was also interested in what the Minister said about the possibility of CHP &mdash; a heat and power cogeneration system. This system is receiving much attention abroad and is in operation there to effect. It is being debated here and in the task force report from the Ballyforan area one of the six recommendations of that report was the introduction of CHP.  Dr. Paul Monaghan of UCG who is recognised as a European energy expert and is <i>au fait</i> with the concept of CHP gave technical and professional advice to the task force that CHP could be used effectively in Bord na Móna, Ballyforan, or any other area provided we had the back-up of ancillary companies to take the peat being wasted at the moment.  I understand that CHP is used very effectively in a peat station in Finland.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna and the peat component of the national energy policy is the main bone of contention at the moment and was one of the reasons I looked for this debate on energy policy.  Bord na Móna as a supplier of national energy is dying a slow death; it has terminal illness at the moment requiring major surgery or a large dose of vitamins for its relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>If surgery is needed Bord na Móna will not survive but we will be left with the debt, just as we were when B &amp; I went out of business.  A shot of vitamins at this stage might be more appropriate than surgery.  I have looked at the figures for Bord na Móna and they are frightening.  They have been told to get their act together, to make their company viable, profitable and commercially safe.  The company decided that a number of measures, including the shedding of 3,000 workers, was the way to achieve these requirements.  The measures taken by the company have reduced the wage bill from £74 million to £62 million but the debt has increased <Col N="75" /> from £165 million to £189 million.  The major measures taken by Bord na Móna have neither brought down the wages bill sufficiently nor brought the debt under control.  The company is now making a profit but that profit is absorbed by bank interest charges on the £189 million debt. Therefore, Bord na Móna does not have resources to explore areas important for its development.</P>
      <P>Lullymore is closing because Bord na Móna can sell the briquettes out of only 2.8 of their briquette factories.  They cannot sell them because the do not have resources for marketing and promotion. They cannot get into further areas of development because they are fearful that any steps in that direction will upset their delicate balance.  It is now opportune for the Government to make a decision regarding Bord na Móna in the midlands and I am glad the Minister in his speech indicated that there is a collective decision to be made on this.  He said it raises wider issues, not solely relating to energy policy; Bord na Móna employs more than 2,000 people concentrated mainly in the midlands.  Of course the implications do not relate to energy policy alone and that is why Bord na Móna must be dealt with in such a way as to allow it to maintain its social and economic activity in an area where a natural resource is processed and brought to production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lullymore and Ballyforan are examples of the measures that Bord na Móna has to take to keep within that thin red line of credit imposed on it.  It has been instructed by the Minister and the Government to put is financial house in order.  There are 32 highly skilled men in the Ballyforan area &mdash; top class lorry drivers, machinists, welders, mechanics and so on &mdash; from 24 to 38 years of age. They have an excellent processing setup &mdash; workshop, offices, machinery, raw material and an outlet.  If the IDA set such an operation in place tomorrow we would see Ministers, TDs and councillors slapping them on the back and if this operation cost £9 million or £10 million, we would say it was very good value because technology was involved and it <Col N="76" /> had a great future.  For £150,000 this operation can be kept in place for a year.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna says production costs £3 a tonne extra in Ballyforan because the peat has to be transported by lorry to Shannonbridge.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of a transport subsidy.  I do not mean this to continue in the long term, but the people of Ballyforan &mdash; State agencies and local communities &mdash; have produced a task force report with very valuable, well documented and well thought out recommendations. They need time and breathing space for this task force report to be evaluated and to see if any of recommendations can be effective.  I believe at least one of them can be effective and one or two are being investigated.  I am asking the Minister to consider a transport subsidy for the operation in the Ballyforan area.  I am also asking him and his colleagues in Government, collectively, to look at Bord na Móna's social responsibility to the midlands.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report speaks of IDA involvement in share capital in semi-State companies.  This is an opportunity for the Government, through the IDA, to take share capital in Bord na Móna and to allow it to develop rather than contract. The Government should look at Bord na Móna in a new light, on the basis of what it can do for the future, rather than tell it to sink or swim on the basis of its economic performance.  It is not appropriate for us to spend a large amount of advertising for foreign jobs through the IDA while, at the same time, we allow a very important part of this country, of our national energy policy and our national energy itself to go by the board taking with it opportunities for jobs and economic and social development in the midlands.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna's very serious debt problem was not entirely the result of its own decisions.  Bord na Móna was forced into decisions in the seventies because of the oil crisis.  It was prompted into decisions on a political basis a number of times and shunted down side roads away from its existing policies.  All those shuntings, nods and pushes helped Bord na Móna to build up this debt.  While the Minister, Deputy Molloy, has not been <Col N="77" /> personally responsible for this situation in Bord na Móna, that does not absolve him from decisions which brought Bord na Móna to its present position.  I ask the Minister and the Government to recognise that Bord na Móna has a part to play and that the time is opportune for the Government to take a stake in its operations on a share capital or other basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister should request or instruct Bord na Móna to give consideration to Ballyforan.  If he does, he must provide the necessary funding; £150,000 for 32 jobs for 12 months with an opportunity for major development in the future is not a high price to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have long been on record as being an admirer of the Minister.  I welcome her particularly on this issue which is one of the great success stories of the Government.</P>
      <P>I am seeking an extension of the coal ban to Bray because it has been so successful in Dublin.  It was very courageous on the part of the Minister and the Government to take the very dramatic and even traumatic step in 1990 to ban bituminous coal in the Dublin area.  It was an experiment because the Minister did not know exactly what the effects would be, how difficult it would be for people on low incomes and whether it would work.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that it has been a tremendous success and that she has achieved her objective of clear air in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should now consider extending this ban to areas outside Dublin which are affected by smog and smoke.  The boundaries of the area covered by the coal ban <Col N="78" /> are Dún Laoghaire on the south side, Lucan to the west and Malahide to the north.  The Minister stated in an interview in 1990 with <i>The Irish Times</i> that the restriction area could be extended, if required, to improve air quality further and suggested that the Bray area could be included the following year &mdash; 1991 &mdash; depending on smoke levels.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what the smoke levels are in Bray or if they have been measured yet.  My belief is that they have not.</P>
    <P>I hope, as a result of this debate, the Minister will respond by saying it is now intended to monitor smoke levels in Bray, Greystones and perhaps other areas of Wicklow in the near future.  At the moment we can only depend on visual observation in Bray.  The bituminous coal ban extends to the outskirts of the town but north Bray, the area you enter when coming from the smoke-free zone, is the worst area of the town.  I spent last Saturday in Little Bray which lies in a valley. The density of the smoke in that area was suffocating.  I do not know the level of that smoke, but I have no doubt that last Saturday it was well above EC levels. Anybody who was sick, who suffered from asthma or had breathing difficulties would have begun to choke in that atmosphere. It was undoubtedly damaging, and a danger to the health of the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think this happens every week or every day but it happens with a frequency which is intolerable.  It is obviously as bad as, if not worse than, the problem was in Dublin when the Minister decided to tackle it.  I have photographs of the Little Bray area, in the Old Court estates and around Herbert Road, on the other side of the Dargle.  These demonstrate that there is an incontrovertible case for making Bray a smoke free zone. Even if the monitoring has not been done, you have only to look at these photographs to know there is a danger to the health of people in that area who suffer from breathing diseases.  In the 1990-91 winter it reached almost crisis proportions.  It appears not to have been quite so bad last winter but that is probably because it was not such a cold winter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to put some monitoring <Col N="79" /> stations into the Bray area as soon as possible in order to ascertain, as a matter of urgency, what the smoke levels are.  Now that the worst period is over it may well be inappropriate to put up monitoring stations until next winter. The least we can expect, however, given the visual smog is that we should have monitoring tests taken in that area quickly.  A group of people associated with St. Gerard's school in Bray took private tests of the smoke levels in Bray and although the results are not official I am assured that they showed frequent breaches of the EC limits.  It might be appropriate for the Minister to seek the results of those tests.  By contacting St. Gerard's school to find out what the results were she could save her Department a great deal of work.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly where the smoke is coming from but it is not purely only from domestic burning of bituminous coal.  One of the unfortunate features of Bray is of planning gone wild.  Factories which cause pollution are situated in the middle of residential areas, particularly the lithographic factory on the banks of the Dargle which spews out the most appalling pollution and smoke at irregular intervals into a residential area.  It makes the lives of the people in the Dargle valley almost impossible.  I recently visited the people who live next to the factory.  They cannot sell their houses; often they cannot go out into their back gardens; they cannot live a normal life.  These people are living in what should be an amenity area, one of the jewels of County Wicklow, yet a factory there is polluting the atmosphere. That should be looked at in the context of planning rather than imposing a smoke ban.  We should cease erecting factories which pollute the atmosphere in residential areas.  I do not know if that is happening elsewhere or with great frequency in Dublin, but if we continue this practice we will add to the smog problem in residential areas.  I have asked the Minister to look at this when she is considering extending this coal ban to Bray.</P>
    <P>As Bray is on the perimeter of the smoke free zone, it must be the next area into which the Minister will consider <Col N="80" /> extending the zone.  The Minister rightly mentioned in her interview with <i>The Irish Times</i>, and probably elsewhere, that the Bray area would have to be looked at as the next object of this ban, which is encouraging.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give a commitment this evening that, at the very least she will order the monitoring of the smog in the Bray area as soon as possible and if it is above EC limits that Bray will be declared a smoke free zone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by thanking Senator Ross for his compliments and for raising this issue in the House tonight.</P>
      <P>I share the Senator's concern that the residents of Bray, and the residents of any other area, should not have to endure polluted air.  Obviously, it would be my intention anywhere the public have to live in polluted air conditions to bring in and support through Government action any measure necessary to alleviate that situation.</P>
      <P>When I came to office at the Department of the Environment almost three years ago we had an enormous smog problem in Dublin.  Smoke pollution was being caused, essentially, by the burning of bituminous coal and it seemed obvious to me that the thing to do was to get bituminous coal out of the system.  It was difficult.  There were many teething problems despite the success and I would like to thank Senator Ross for complimenting me on the success of the coal ban in Dublin.  There have also been many operational problems with regard to the supply of alternative fuels and difficulties of that kind.  The ban has proved that taking coal out of the system was successful and it is ultimately the greatest weapon we can use to ensure that the community and residents generally are not exposed to unacceptable levels of air pollution from smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Bray, my view is no different from what it would be for anywhere else.  If there is a significant air pollution problem in Bray I would have no problem doing in Bray what I did elsewhere, but there are a number of difficulties, of course.  Bray was considered <Col N="81" /> when we were imposing the ban in Dublin.  I did consider extending the ban to Bray and Leixlip and some of the towns in Wicklow and Kildare, but there were enormous difficulties involved. First, we felt it might not be operationally feasible; second, obviously, it would be more expensive.  In any one year an extension of the ban would probably cost an extra £250,000 in terms of subsidies because we give £3 a week to approximately one in three families in Dublin. These would be very low income families or on social welfare; this costs just under £6 million a year.  To extend the ban to Bray and Leixlip which would be the two more obvious areas, would cost a further £250,000, approximately, per annum. We could not do that until we identified the precise smoke levels in Bray.  I am sure the Senator as a member of Wicklow County Council, is aware that from next winter the county council intend to place two monitors in the Bray area for continuous monitoring of the atmospheric pollution.  When we have those monitoring results we can make whatever decision is necessary if there is a problem or if we are in breach of European Community air quality standards.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the example that has been followed in Cork could be put in place in Bray.  This winter &mdash; which is almost over &mdash; the fuel trade in Cork, on a voluntry basis, came together and decided to supply a low cost competitively priced product in order to alleviate the smog that was developing there.  It has been extremely successful. It has proved to me that not everything has to be done by regulation and Government order.  Many very fine things, particularly as far as the environment is concerned, can happen through voluntary agreement and voluntary effort. Perhaps even in advance of next winter we could have some discussions with the fuel trade that supply the Bray area with a view to taking some measures to alleviate the problem.  Of course, the key would be to have the trade supply products that are competitively priced and are good substitutes for bituminous coal.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Ross mention Little Bray and say he was there last Saturday because about two years <Col N="82" /> ago, St. Gerard's school under the supervision and guidance of an environmental consultant carried out an air quality survey of Little Bray, monitoring the smog level.  I understand from the school that not even on one day did the level exceed the European Community requirement.  As the Senator is probably aware, the European Community requirement is that if you reach over 250 micrograms of smoke per cubic metre of air per 24 hours &mdash; or something in that order &mdash; for four days, on the fourth day you are in breach of the European Community Directive.  I understand that no such levels occurred in Little Bray even for one day.  That is interesting in the light of the Senator's experience.</P>
    <P>I have found, as a result of the coal ban in Dublin and all the attention it has received, that many people have a perception that there is smoke in the air when there may not be.  I do not say that lightly or sarcastically.  On a number of occasions last winter and the previous winter I wondered if the levels were high. When I got the monitoring results the next morning I discovered they were not. Sometimes, because of all the attention to and the public awareness of smoke pollution, we are more perceptive, look more closely and are more sensitive to smoke.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator Ross that when I see the results of the continuous monitoring that Wicklow County Council will put in place next winter, in conjunction with the urban district council, I will not be slow to act or to propose to the Government the kind of measures I believe to be necessary.  It may well be necessary to take the same decision we have taken in Dublin.  However, we have only had two winter experiences in Dublin and we still have difficulties.  I want to acknowledge that.  Improvements have to be made again for next winter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the development of industrial premises close to residential areas.  Obviously that is a matter for the local planning authority.  I too would share his concern if such developments added to smoke pollution in the atmosphere close to built-up residential areas.  Anybody emitting substances into <Col N="83" /> the air would require an air pollution licence and presumably strict conditions could be attached to ensure that it did not contribute to adverse smoke levels in the area.  It is not for me to interfere.  I believe in the principle of subsidiarity, and it is for local authorities to decide how to plan their areas.  I would, however, take a view, as a matter of general principle, that industrial premises of that kind as far as possible should not be located close to residential areas.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the regulations to ban the sale, distribution and marketing of bituminous coal in Dublin we also made a provision that any new housing developments in the Dublin area had to have, as well as an open fire, an alternative heating system.  Although a directive was not given to local authorities to bear this in mind in giving planning permissions, I will look at that matter to see if, in relation to new developments in the general Bray area, we could apply a condition of that kind.  It would ensure that we did not add to the problem.</P>
    <P>In Dublin we have had a smoke problem since 1980.  Throughout the decade, we gave grants to put in fireplaces to burn more coal and we allowed new developments with open fireplaces to burn bituminous coal.  That was obviously a mistake.  In urban centres like Bray, any new housing development should have an alternative heating system.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Ross for raising this issue and to assure him that I and my officials will keep in touch with Wicklow County Council.  I will have the monitoring results supplied to me weekly when it begins next winter and if it is necessary to take the kind of steps he suggested, as we have done in Dublin, I will not be reluctant to do that if the resources are made avilable and if the Government agree.  In the meantime, perhaps Senator Ross and his colleagues <Col N="84" /> could initiate some discussions with the fuel trade in Bray similar to those in Cork which proved extremely successful. However, that does require a supportive and friendly fuel trade.  If you do not have that you will not get agreement.  There are many reasonable people in the fuel trade who realise that coal will not be used for domestic heating much longer. I believe that in a few years bituminous coal will no longer be burnt in any house in an urban area.  Alternative heating systems will be the norm, perhaps even as soon as the end of this decade.  Most people in the fuel trade realise that.  For that reason many of them are putting great effort into developing and sourcing alternatives to bituminous coal and they may be only too happy to be involved in any campaign on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and, in particular, the way she turned the tables on me by suggesting that I tackle the problem myself by initiating discussions with the fuel trade in Bray.  That is a new departure in Adjournment matters and I shall certainly do so.  In return, I would ask for a commitment that, if the monitoring levels taken in Bray next winter are consistently above EC levels, she will then extend the smokeless zone area to Bray itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can give a commitment that I would support such an extension.  Obviously, it would have to be subject to Government approval because additional funding would be required to pay the subsidy to low income families. It would certainly be my intention to do so if the levels exceed the EC standards. I would only be too happy to do in Bray what was done in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 April 1992.</P>
