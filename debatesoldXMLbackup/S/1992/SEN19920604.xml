      <P>I have notice form Senator Ross that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to further extend the urban renewal scheme in Bray, County Wicklow and to extend the scheme to Wicklow town.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to clarify the proposals made by An Taoiseach to develop a deep water transhipment port on the Shannon Estuary; and to make a statement on the suitability of Foynes as a location for the port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the measures he is taking to deal with the recent problem caused by the toxic effect of cucumbers; the action he is taking to protect consumers; and the initiatives he is taking to deal with the difficulties this discovery has caused the Irish producers of cucumbers.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross, Neville and Upton as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross and Neville's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Upton may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Before I give the Order of Business I want to give the details for the Maastricht debate: the debate will be tomorrow from 10.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. We suggested yesterday that it was in the interest of the House to have the most up-to-date debate and information.  The Minister will open the debate and he will have 15 minutes; each Senator will have ten minutes and the Minister will have five minutes to conclude.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be item No. 1 until 1 p.m.; there will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.; from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. we will take item No. 2.  I suggested yesterday that we would carry over item No. 2 to next week, or whenever is suitable.</P>

      <P>I commend the Leader of the House for the way he organised the debate on Maastricht tomorrow and for the fact that the Minister will be present.  Hopefuly, he will have something substantial to say.  I suggest that the Leader ask the Minister, if, at the end of the session, he will take questions from Members.  There probably will be questions that will need to be teased out, and it would be very useful if the Minister could answer questions at that stage.</P>

The Leader told me &mdash; and I think he told the House &mdash; that the Maastricht debate would be from 2 p.m. I find this change an embarrassment because I booked a studio to do a broadcast about James Joyce and I cannot get out of it.  I did so on the understanding that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I find it ironic that I will be excluded from the debate, but I have to accept it; if that is the will of the House, that is the way things go.  I will pass from that, having registered my mild and very gentlemanly protest, and ask the Leader in light of comments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader give time for Motion 41 to be taken?  This deals with the Adelaide Hospital and is becoming ever more urgent.  I am aware that Senator Ross raised this matter on the Adjournment and very kindly gave me some time on it but this, I understand, does not preclude a fuller discussion, particularly in the light of the comments reported in today's media by the chairman of the board, Professor David McConnell and in the light of what the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, said during the debate where he expressed the hope that the ethos of the Meath Hospital would be included.  I understand the Meath Hospital is being particularly difficult on this.  If the ethos to which the Minister referred was a fact about 50 years ago, there was a coup in the board of the Meath and almost every non-Roman Catholic consultant was fired&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the meantime, I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Ministers for Justice and Foreign Affairs the concern many of us feel at the handling of cases such as that of the Libyan, Marey Gutraini, who I understand in recent days was taken and beaten by officers which is in violation of his constitutional rights.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Leader on the way he has arranged the debate for tomorrow morning.  I also compliment him on the time-span of ten minutes, which is perfectly adequate. What is the position in relation to the Education Bill I spoke about yesterday, namely, the one which is designed to make grants available to third level students who are of mature years?  Can we expect to have a debate on item No. 47 which is in the name of the Leader and in the names of all the Fianna Fáil Senators.  It relates to the setting up of a press council.  I am very interested in that and I would like to know what he has in mind.  Will the press council have teeth?</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House of old times here when we used to have requests for debates on banking.  It seems to have been from another era.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has quite forgotten about the O'Keeffe initiative in banking and if we can expect the debate on banking to take place before the establishment of the O'Keeffe institute of banking studies.</P>

      <P>In view of the fever pitch of excitement about European union, have we lost sight altogether of <Col N="6" /> promises which were made?  June is normally the month for local elections.  We were promised eight regional authorities and sub-regional structures.  These are essential if we are to counterbalance the centralisation which will take place following European union.  The Taoiseach spoke to us about subsidiarity but we do not see it being put into practice.  Have we lost sight of this now and are we going to hear only about centralisation in the European context?</P>

      <P>I would like to raise the issue of the banking system in Ireland and to say that I have not forgotten it.  It is now over 12 months since I first looked for this debate.  Various issues have sidetracked it and we have not had the opportunity to have such a debate.  I now ask the Leader of the House if he can confirm today that such a debate will be held in the very near future.  On a previous occasion I asked for a debate on the common contract as it relates to consultants. It is a very important factor and one about which many of us have major concerns.  I ask the Leader of the House to make time for a debate or statements on this issue in the near future.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to modify the legal framework for planning appeals so that An Bord Pleanála will be able to determine them in a shorter time than at present.  The measures it proposes will improve the efficiency of the appeals process so that it will be possible for the board to determine virtually all cases within four months.  It will ensure, at the same time, that this streamlining and speeding up of the appeals system is achieved without any diminution of the essential fairness and thoroughness of the process.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides also for some changes to the provisions governing court challenges to the validity of decisions by planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála, the purpose of which is to facilitate the expeditious determination of such proceedings.  It proposes, in addition, that there will be a substantial increase in the fines for offences under the Planning Acts and that it will be possible in future to seek orders under section 27 of the 1976 Planning Act against unauthorised or non-conforming developments in the Circuit Court as well as in the High Court as at present.</P>
      <P>The physical planning system which has been in operation in this country for almost 30 years has, by and large, served us well.  The thorough examination to which development proposals have been subjected has ensured orderly development and efficient and environmentally acceptable land uses.  It is essential, nevertheless, that the process is kept under review to ensure that both its effectiveness and its efficiency are maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effective planning system should be capable of giving conclusive decisions on development proposals within a <Col N="10" /> reasonable time frame while at the same time ensuring that the proposals are subjected to the necessary detailed examination. Undue delays in the planning process are not in anyone's interest; they can in particular cause frustration for developers and could, in the worst case, lead to the abandonment of worth-while projects with the loss of the investment and employment they would provide.  It is essential, therefore, that we ensure that our planning system strikes the correct balance between the need for rigorous evaluation of proposals and for final decisions within a generally acceptable period.  I believe that the measures proposed in the Bill will give us this necessary balance.</P>
    <P>I would like now to explain the immediate background to the Bill.  Some time ago a comprehensive review of the systems and procedures of An Bord Pleanála was carried out.  This review led to various recommendations about the board's management and administration and these have largely been taken up by the board.  However, the review also identified features of the existing legal framework within which the board operate which inhibit the speedy determination of appeals.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable improvement in the board's performance since the review was carried out.  For example, between September 1990 and April 1992 the number of appeals on hands fell from 1,703 to 1,046 and the proportion of cases on hands for more than six months fell from 21.4 per cent to 3 per cent.  This is a marked change for the better, for which the board is to be commended.  At the same time, however, the time taken to deal with individual appeals is still not satisfactory. The truth of the matter is that the law as it stands at the moment will inhibit the achievement of further significant improvement.</P>
    <P>As for the general approach taken in the Bill, some concerns were expressed when it was before the Dáil that existing rights of appeal would be curtailed.  I should like to take this opportunity to assure Senators that no right of appeal <Col N="11" /> against the decision of a planning authority will be taken away by the Bill.  It will continue to be possible for any person to appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a planning authority's decision.  All the Bill will do is to create a more orderly and effective framework for dealing with appeals.</P>
    <P>The Bill's approach is to set out strict time limits for all stages of the appeals process.  These time limits will be reinforced by a clear statement of the rights of participants in appeals concerning submissions to the board and of their obligations in relation to the timeliness and completeness of submissions. It is because of these changes that it is possible for the Bill to propose a statutory objective of four months for the determination of appeals by the board.</P>
    <P>I would now like to briefly outline the Bill's provisions.  Section 1 is a standard form of interpretation provision.  Section 2 sets out the duty and objective of An Bord Pleanála in relation to the determination of appeals and the various other matters which it decides.  These other matters, including references under section 5 of the 1963 Planning Act as to what is or is not development or exempted development, account for only a small proportion of the board's overall workload.  The vast majority of cases coming before the board are appeals against planning authorities' decisions on planning applications.  Accordingly the Bill, apart from section 2, is generally concerned only with such appeals.</P>
    <P>Section 2 restates the general duty contained in section 4 of the 1983 Planning Act which requires the board to ensure that it deals with all appeals and other matters as expeditiously as possible. However, section 2, also sets an objective for the board to determine cases within a period of four months.  The board will be expected to comply with this objective in all but the most exceptional cases.  If, however, the board considers that it will not be possible or appropriate in a given case to meet the objective, it will notify the parties involved and inform them of the date by which it intends to give its <Col N="12" /> decision.  The board must then take all the steps open to it to ensure that it gives its decision by then.</P>
    <P>The four month objective will not take effect until six months after the enactment of the Bill.  This six month period will allow the board to adapt its procedures to meet the objective and to dispose of cases on hands.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noted that the four month period is an objective rather than a strict time limit and that suitable provision has been made for instances where the board cannot comply with the objectives. I am advised that an absolute time limit would not be acceptable as it might prevent the full consideration of all the issues in a very complex appeal.  The proposed objective goes as far as possible, therefore, towards placing a time limit on the appeals process.  I might add also that the board's performance in complying with this objective will be monitored by my Department.</P>
    <P>Various views have been expressed about the four month objective for the board.  Some consider that this period is too short while others are of the view that a shorter period should be specified for certain types of appeals.  I believe, however, that four months strikes the right balance and that it should apply to all appeals initially.  If it emerges in the light of experience that a shorter or longer period would be more appropriate for a particular class or classes of appeal, I could then consider using the power under section 2 to provide for such a period by regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 26 of the 1963 Planning Act under which appeals against planning authorities' decisions on planning applications are made to the board.  Under existing legislation the applicant for planning permission is allowed a period of one month within which to make his appeal but any other appellant must appeal within 21 days. The Bill proposes to increase the appeal period for third parties so that everybody will now have a period of one month in which to appeal to the board.  The fact that the third party appeal period is being increased is indicative of the even handed <Col N="13" /> approach towards all interests in planning matters adopted by the Bill and demonstrates that there is no foundation for any suggestion that it will tip the balance in the planning process in favour of development interests.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the requirements to be met when appealing to the board.  The most important of these is the requirement that an appeal must include the full grounds of appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based.  As matters stand, an appeal can validly be made by submitting a statement of appeal in the first instance and forwarding the grounds of appeal afterwards.  The interval between these submissions can be considerable and has led to delays in the determination of appeals.  Section 4 is designed to overcome this problem by ensuring that an appeal must be submitted in full at the outset.  Any appeal which is not accompanied by the full grounds of appeal will be invalid.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some concerns have been expressed that a requirement to submit the full grounds before the end of the appeal period may be too burdensome for appellants.  I am satisfied, nevertheless, that this provision strikes the appropriate balance between the rights of appellants and the need for conclusive planning decisions on appeals within a reasonable period.  The one month period will, in my view, allow an appellant sufficient time to prepare a detailed statement of case and submit it to the board.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 place new obligations on planning authorities which will facilitate the speedier operation of the appeals process. Section 5 requires a planning authority to make documentation relating to a planning application available to the public from the day of their decision on it.  This will ensure that a person wishing to make an appeal to the board against the decision will have access to all the relevant documentation without delay.  Under section 6 planning authorities will have to submit relevant documentation to the board within a <Col N="14" /> period of 14 days of being notified of an appeal and is intended to overcome certain difficulties and delays that the board have encountered in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 7 regulates the right of the other party or parties to an appeal to respond to the appeal.  The board will send a copy of the appeal to the other party or parties who will then have a period of one month in which to make submissions to the board.  Section 8 deals with submissions or observations to the board by persons other than the formal parties to an appeal.  It is well established in practice that such persons have a right to make submissions to the board but this right is expressly stated in planning law only for appeals involving environmental impact assessment.  This section will, therefore, put the matter on a formal legal footing for all appeals and, in most cases, will require submissions to be made within one month of receipt of the appeal by the board.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 prohibit the making of further written submissions except in the circumstances contemplated by section 9.  This is because of the difficulties posed for the board and the delays which arise when they receive further submissions at an advanced stage in their consideration of an appeal.  I am satisfied that this limitation is necessary for the effective operation of the appeals process and that these sections nevertheless afford parties and other persons a fair and reasonable opportunity to put their case to the board.</P>
    <P>While all participants in an appeal will generally be allowed one opportunity to make written submissions to the board, it may be appropriate in certain circumstances to allow a participant the chance to make a further submission.  For this reason section 9 empowers the board to request any participant to make an additional submission within a specified period if they think it appropriate in the interests of justice to do so.  If a response to this request is not received within the period specified, section 11 will authorise the board to proceed with the determination of an appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the board power to <Col N="15" /> ask any participant in an appeal to submit any additional documents or other information which they consider necessary for the determination of the appeal.  This section will replace the existing provision contained in section 18 of the 1983 Planning Act.  If the documents or other information are not forthcoming within the time allowed, the board under section 11 can then proceed to determine or dismiss the appeal according to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with oral hearings of appeals.  It will replace section 15 of the 1983 Planning Act and incorporates a number of changes.  I mentioned already that problems are posed for the board where further submissions on an appeal are forwarded to them when their consideration of the appeal is at an advanced stage.  A similar problem arises from requests for oral hearings which are made at a late stage.  To overcome this problem, the Bill proposes that an appellant who wishes to request an oral hearing must do so at the outset of the appeals process.  A request by any other party to the appeal will have to be made within the period of one month allowed for making submissions or observations to the board.</P>
    <P>The new section does not contain the Minister's power under section 15 of the 1983 Act to prescribe classes of cases for which oral hearings must be held, which has not been used to date.  I consider that it is best left to the board to decide whether an oral hearing should be held in a given case by reference to the circumstances of that case.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is essentially a restatement of section 17 of the 1976 Planning Act.  It empowers the board to take into account matters other than those raised by the participants in an appeal.  If the board proposes to take a matter of this nature into account they must notify the participants in the appeal and allow them an opportunity to comment on the matter.</P>
    <P>The next three sections largely restate certain of the board's existing powers under the 1982 and 1983 Planning Acts which facilitate the speedy determination of appeals in certain circumstances. <Col N="16" /> Section 14 empowers the board to dismiss appeals which they consider to be vexatious or frivolous.  This power, although infrequently used, is necessary to ensure that the board do not have to waste time in dealing with appeals which have no proper foundation in planning matters. Section 15 enables the board to deal with appeals relating to conditions by reference only to those conditions.  This ensures that the board do not have to deal with an appeal from first principles where it relates only to a condition or conditions attached to the planning authority's decision.  Section 16 allows the board to declare an appeal, or an application to which an appeal relates, withdrawn if they consider it to have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>Section 17 makes a number of provisions about the time within which certain matters relating to the appeals process must be done.  It provides, among other things, that an appeal received by the board after the one month appeal period has expired will be invalid. However, if the last day of the appeal period falls on a day when the board's offices are closed, the appeal will be in time if it is received on the next day on which the board's offices are open.</P>
    <P>Section 18 gives the Minister for the Environment power to make regulations prescribing certain procedural matters in relation to appeals and other matters coming before the board.  Any regulations made under this section will have to be laid before this House and the Dáil for a period of 21 days in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill contains a number of measures amending existing provisions of the Planning Acts.  First, section 82 of the 1963 Planning Act will be amended so that challenges in the courts of the validity of decisions by planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála can be concluded more expeditiously.  Such challenges will in future have to be taken by way of application for judicial review, which is generally quicker than plenary proceedings.  Before leave to apply for judicial review is granted, the High Court will have to be satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that <Col N="17" /> the decision challenged is invalid.  The decision of the High Court on challenges of this nature will be final except where it certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance. This will not, of course, preclude appeals to the Supreme Court on questions concerning the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution and the section was amended in the Dáil to clarify that this is the case.</P>
    <P>The second important provision contained in section 19 provides for the substitution of a new section for section 27 of the 1976 Planning Act.  Section 27 relates to court orders against development carried out without the necessary planning permission or in contravention of the terms of the permission granted. The new section will allow access to the Circuit Court as well as to the High Court for orders against such development and fulfils the commitment in this regard contained in the Review of the Programme for Government, 1989-1993.</P>
    <P>A further significant improvement made by the new section is the provision which will empower the courts to order land which has been subjected to unauthorised development to be restored to its condition before that development took place.  Planning authorities have found the existing section 27 to be a very effective means of dealing with planning contraventions and I believe that the improvements in the replacement section will considerably enhance the effectiveness of this procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 20 increases the maximum fines for offences under the Planning Acts.  The indictable offences of carrying out development without permission or contrary to the terms of the permission or contravening the terms of a warning notice will in future attract a maximum penalty of £1 million compared to £10,000 at present.  The maximum fines for summary offences will also be increased.  I am sure Senators will agree that these increased fines will act as a significant additional deterrent to contraventions of planning law.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for a technical <Col N="18" /> amendment of the 1990 Planning Act. Section 21 of that Act provided for compensation in limited circumstances in respect of decisions by planning authorities on applications for consent required under Tree Preservation Orders.  That section should have referred also to decisions of this nature given on appeal by An Bord Pleanála and this section of the Bill will insert the necessary reference to the board into the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 are standard provisions dealing with repeals and transitional provisions respectively.  Section 24 is also a standard provision relating to short title, commencement and collective citation.</P>
    <P>It is of critical importance also, of course, that there should be an efficient decision-making process at the planning authority stage.  I have indicated previously that my Department have informed planning authorities that the greatest possible number of applications should be decided within the statutory two month period.  Planning authorities have also been asked, in cases where additional information is sought, to decide such applications within a period of one month of receipt of the information. I would like to take this opportunity to assure Senators that I will continue to monitor the time taken by planning authorities to decide planning applications and that any action necessary to eliminate undue delays will be taken.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform Senators at this point that I hope to bring forward on Committee Stage an amendment dealing with the time within which enforcement action can be taken in relation to unauthorised or non-conforming development.  Some of the enforcement powers under the Planning Acts may only be used within five years of the relevant contravention but others are open-ended. I believe that these open-ended powers are unnecessary for the enforcement of proper planning and development and that their existence gives rise to serious practical problems, particularly for the property market.  Accordingly, <Col N="19" /> I intend to propose that a five year time limit will apply to the use of all planning enforcement powers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a clear indication of the Government's belief in the importance of an effective physical planning system and its proposals are a decisive response to the evident need for a redrawing of the legal framework for planning appeals. They will see to it that appeals can be decided within the reasonable period of four months without reducing the fairness of the process or taking away any right of participation in it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a positive debate on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is timely and very important legislation.  The concern of the general public in relation to planning matters and the environment was evident during the local elections campaign last year.</P>
      <P>This legislation has the full support of the members of my party even though on Committee Stage we will ask the Minister to consider certain amendments in relation to various aspects.  It is very timely legislation and I hope it will pave the way for better planning in the future. We should not lose sight of how local authorities and statutory bodies acted in the past or of the lessons to be learned from the very good things they did and also from the mistakes they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing worse in relation to the environment than areas which are badly developed not only in terms of bricks and mortar but also in social terms. Briefly, without going into the difficulties that have arisen, lessons can be learned from bad development in places like Ballymun, Darndale, the concrete jungle in Tallaght, and areas of my constituency like Mountwood and Fitzgerald Park where short-sighted planning in relation to housing did not take into account the fact that people would need other facilities in their areas.  While some of the matters I mention may not strictly be within the remit of this Bill, I hope that just as the Ombudsman reports from time <Col N="20" /> to time in relation to the operation of his office, the board from time to time will be in a position to bring forward reports in relation to the workings of the planning process and if a local authority makes a mistake in an area that the same mistake will not be made 100 miles down the road in relation to a different development.</P>
    <P>Obviously many of the problems I am familiar with are urban ones but they are also found in some of our larger towns and even in villages throughout the country. One would hope that we will not repeat mistakes made in other areas. That is why the board should make a report available to the Minister, his Department and officials which would be circulated to Members of both Houses, to local authority managers, and local councillors.</P>
    <P>One of the key provisions of this legislation is to improve the planning process. If a local authority were to give a decision to an applicant in relation to a planning application within the two month period, allowing for additional information being sought, then An Bord Pleanála should not unduly hold up an appeal.  There must be procedures to deal with the vast amount of appeals that are lodged.  In the past the delays, as the Minister has rightly acknowledged, were far too long and totally unacceptable.  They caused great difficulties for individuals, developers, residents' associations and people who did not have a lot of money behind them. Under section 14, vexatious appeals can now be thrown out.  In my own area recently we had a multimillion pound development coming on stream.  One or two individuals lodged an appeal and delayed the whole matter for eight to ten months and this resulted in the promoters going cold on the development.  There should be some system whereby appeals could be dealt with on a priority basis. There may be some minor appeals where an inspector, after a quick read of a planning and local authority decision, could either uphold or refuse the appeal.  Other appeals would take a long time to assess.</P>
    <P>We must also look at cases where rival competitors in business may use a John Doe simply to further delay an application. <Col N="21" /> I am glad progress has been made and it appears that An Bord Pleanála are beginning to function more expeditiously.  I hope the board will not be stymied through lack of funding or a reduction in the number of inspectors.  If we are to adhere to our ideal of a four month delay in the processing of appeals the Minister must indicate how the board will function and whether small appeals can be dealt with by certain inspectors. Where a developer or an applicant is appealing against just one condition, that should be dealt with relatively quickly. Obviously in relation to other appeals, time and serious consideration have to be given to them, particularly where small, active but probably under-funded residents' associations, or maybe a couple of individuals, oppose the might of developers. That is why there should be discretion in relation to payment of the appeal fee.  I believe it should be paid but if an appeal is allowed there should be a case made for a refund, or a partial refund, of the fee or else the board should be given power to recommend that the fee should be returned in certain cases. There are many individuals and, in particular, residents' associations who do sterling work and find it very difficult to come up with the necessary funds to lodge an appeal, particularly if they employ planners, architects and surveyors. Some consideration should be given to this.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important in relation to how we conduct the planning process and develop areas.  It is important that the individual's right is looked at and it is a right that must be used responsibly. I would like to pay tribute to a very prominent organisation, An Taisce, who have many fine members.  Objecting for objection's sake is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has to be looked at is the lodgment of a planning application and placing the initial advertisement in the newspapers.  This has been open to cynical abuse and criticism. People may place an advertisement in the most under-read newspaper in the area, maybe in the native tongue, possibly on Christmas Eve when it is unlikely that <Col N="22" /> individuals in an area and particularly residents' associations or those who would be most directly concerned, have very little chance of seeing it.  In my own area of Dalkey, it was only by chance that an application for a gun club and related facilities next to a largish housing estate was discovered at the last moment. It was one of these applications that could possibly have slipped through, unnoticed.  If people place advertisements in the newspapers in the native tongue thereby showing their concern that the language will not be under-utilised, there should be an onus on them to put it in the newspaper in a second language as well, preferably English, so that such abuses cannot take place.</P>
    <P>One matter the Minister mentioned which must be looked at very carefully is the enforcement of decisions and abuses where planning permission is granted but slight changes are made.  Then there is the question of retention.  It should be open to the board or to the local authority if granting an application for retention &mdash; sometimes it is of a relatively minor nature &mdash; to have the facility to penalise such persons perhaps by asking them to pay extra for deviating from the clear plan and from the clear consent given.</P>
    <P>An area I hope the Minister will look at is the history of developers, their track record and possible previous convictions if not necessarily to be used against them, to be taken into consideration when applications are being considered.  It is far too easy for shelf companies to be set up under a different name but with the same people involved.  They move a couple of miles down the road leaving a mess behind them for the local authority, the residents' association and individuals to try to clear up.  They start up again as if they had never been involved in a bad development in their lives.  If an application is made and the people concerned have a poor track record, if there are previous convictions or difficulties in relation to how previous developments were carried out, there should be a facility for delaying or making a decision until such time as they are called to account for what is left undone.  I recognise <Col N="23" /> that bonding has improved matters; at least, there is still some money left in the till to complete estates.  There are instances, particularly in County Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, where estates were left unfinished.  The local authority will not take them over. Poor old John Citizen is left in no man's land.  When it comes to trying to get a loan or a mortgage on property or trying to sell it, he is in neither one situation nor the other.</P>
    <P>At the monthly meeting of Dún Laoghaire Corporation we had a list presented under various headings, for example, developer in discussion, developer being prosecuted, and various recommendations.  Sometimes High Court proceedings are not recommended because the chances are the developer is in Spain or further afield and it can be very hard to track him down.  We must look at the history of developers.  We have people with a long track record who are well known to local authorities.  I would hope that local authorities would pool information so that a developer cannot go from Dublin to Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, Cork or Galway.  He should be liable for any mess until he clears it up.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must give a lead when it comes to proper planning and development. Hopefully, they will be supported by An Bord Pleanála and by councillors when it comes to refurbishment programmes, the renewal of dilapidated areas, renewal programmes for the inner city and the examination of tax incentives. They must encourage people who own delapidated buildings to apply for refurbishment or home improvement grants.  People must be encouraged to repair buildings which are old or run down.  Where they are being turned into apartments or town houses, or where there is redevelopment of derelict sites, local authorities must be supported by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably fighting daily at the Cabinet table for his slice of the cake.  There are many areas, for example Dublin, where applications are being <Col N="24" /> made to the Department for assistance in respect of various schemes.  They cannot all be granted at the same time but there are priorities.  Some housing schemes need improvements; there must be a reduction in the number of high rise flats built; facilities must be improved, such as putting in lifts which work.  Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent on Ballymun and other high rise flats trying to keep the lift system working. Obviously, there is a lesson for us all in Ballymun, when we look at the hardship that young mothers in particular, experience trying to drag go-carts, with one or two children in tow, together with bags of groceries, up to the fourth floor, or maybe the 12th or 14th floor.  That planning has not been repeated.  I am speaking from local knowledge, particularly about places like Mountwood Flats, where there are only four storeys.  There are difficulties there, and hopefully Dún Laoghaire Corporation will prepare a refurbishment programme.  I hope that when the application is submitted the Minister will recognise the difficulties there and give a clear commitment to provide the necessary funds so that the flats can be refurbished.  People can then, hopefully, identify with the area and community spirit will return.</P>
    <P>In some areas, particularly in County Dublin, such as Tallaght, Darndale and parts of Loughlinstown and Shankill, people may grow up in ghettos and those who have that extra bit of initiative or who get a break may leave the area; unfortunately, decent people are left there facing all the social problems and difficulties, despite all our efforts and those of the health boards and social workers to improve matters.</P>
    <P>It is important that the local authorities should have a say in such developments. An Bord Pleanála has a role to play.  I hope there will be discussions with the Department about the development of the various areas.  I listened to the Minister with interest, some weeks ago in Donegal.  He spoke about developments and about the foresight of the Department. Many Senators are members of local authorities.  We know at first hand <Col N="25" /> the difficulties in our areas and the problems that must be resolved.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal briefly with some sections of the Bill.  A small individual may come under pressure from the might of money, big publicity campaigns and developers.  Will this individual be catered for under this Bill?  Will he have his chance, whether he is appealing a decision or trying to take on some big developer or residents' associations? Some of the difficulties could be sorted out if developers in particular areas, were more open and at the initial stages contacted the secretary, or chairman of a residents' association to sound them out about a proposed development.  In my own area recently someone was trying to build 14 apartments over the railway line. This was only discovered by accident.</P>
    <P>There must be a &ldquo;firming up&rdquo; of the appeals procedures.  People should have access to files.  Obviously, this causes difficulty in areas, particularly where some planning departments in local authorities are understaffed.  Sometimes people have to get off work to go in to look at a file. Perhaps in some areas there should be an opportunity from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Wednesday or Thursday evenings, when shopping centres are open, so that people would have an opportunity to look at files and make notes.</P>
    <P>It is important, if this new procedure in relation to An Bord Pleanála is to work, that there would be co-operation. Information should be made freely available by the planning authority to An Bord Pleanála and to individuals who may be parties to an appeal.  This must be done expeditiously in order to maintain an appropriate rate of progress.</P>
    <P>Third party representatives in relation to applications can be useful.  From time to time, I write to An Bord Pleanála to ask them to consider certain matters following consultations and discussions I have had with residents or individuals in an area.  I am putting a point of view to them which should be considered and taken into account by the inspector when the decision is being made by the board. Local authority and Oireachtas Members who receive representations should be <Col N="26" /> able to make representations in relation to various applications.  I ask the Minister to ensure that that is being adhered to.</P>
    <P>There may be several angles to an appeal.  There could be something in relation to the house next door or some other part of a development.  Something happening down the road might have some effect.  The board should be able to get all documents relating to an appeal.</P>
    <P>In certain cases it is necessary to have an oral submission.  Experts, certain individuals in the area, public representatives and people employed professionally by the developers or residents' associations should have the right to appear in person at the oral submission.  Obviously, there will be many cases where this will not, and should not, be necessary.  Appeals, particularly vexatious ones, can be dealt with by the stroke of a pen.  There should be definite guidelines and procedures regarding an oral hearing.  Certain matters of public concern or of intense public interest in an area may mean that an oral hearing is probably the only way to resolve the matter by giving every party a fair hearing.  A case may look fairly black and white from the outset.  Where certain aspects have to be looked at, an oral hearing should be available.</P>
    <P>An oral hearing may take time.  There was one in Dún Laoghaire that went on for a few days but others have lasted for weeks.  When members of the board are out there, it means other work will not be done by them.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to give us figures at a later stage about the numbers of inspectors at present employed.  If this board is to adhere to the time limits, they should not be in the position which prevailed in the Ombudsman's office and other places in regard to staffing where they did not have the personnel to type the decisions when they were made.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  It goes a long way towards improving matters particularly in relation to our planning procedures and, more importantly, as to how our environment is protected and developed.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the question of penalties and abuses.  We are all aware <Col N="27" /> of comment and discussion about abuses, or alleged abuses, in relation to planning. There is alleged to be a lot of money at stake where offers may have been made, particularly to officials, by individuals, by companies or developers.  The officials at local authority level must have the very highest standards, as must officials who work for An Bord Pleanála.  It is difficult to get proof in order to bring a case.</P>
    <P>I support fully the increase in penalties referred to by the Minister.  It may even be necessary for the Minister to consider a remuneration scheme for those who bring information that pinpoint abuses. Some of them may be of a minor nature, but some have been serious and have gone undetected.  I hope the Minister will give a clear commitment that any mis-demeanour, any blatant abuse of the planning legislation will meet the full rigours of the law, and that people will go to jail.</P>
    <P>We must have the highest standards of behaviour by our officials.  There have been cases where the board made one decision and the inspector, who obviously was the person on the ground who did the investigating, made a totally different decision.  While it is the legitimate right of everyone to make general representations on any application, any improper suggestion, such as making a phone call to some member on the board or anything remotely approaching that must be rooted out.  I support totally the Minister in his proposal to increase penalties.</P>
    <P>This legislation will find favour with all the Members of this House, even though some of us may have amendments on Committee Stage, or have other items in mind which possibly should be taken on board.  In particular, the history of developers or defaulters should be examined.</P>
    <P>It is important, as we head into the late nineties and into the next century, that we should learn from our mistakes.  I hope we can undo some of them, but certainly we must not repeat the mistakes that were made.  As I have indicated, we will be supporting this legislation on Second Stage, but, on Committee Stage, <Col N="28" /> putting down various amendments and teasing out certain matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  In his short period in office he has proved himself to be a most efficient Minister.  I wish also to take this opportunity to thank him for visiting Kerry recently where he performed a number of official functions, but especially for meeting members of Kerry County Council and in the manner which he dealt with the many points raised at that meeting especially with regard to our serious housing situation &mdash; single rural cottages, group housing and personal grants, etc. I know we have left an impression on the Minister, and that he will bear us in mind for extra funding before the end of the year.  The Minister made a good impression across the party divide and his visit was much appreciated.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  It is an issue many local authority members are dealing with each day.  In recent years, the community have shown a major interest in planning, especially where large developments take place.  It is accepted that an effective planning system should be capable of giving good decisions on the relevant proposals within a reasonable period of time, at the same time ensuring that the proposals are subject to the essential detailed examination. Undue delays in the planning process are not in anyone's interest.  They can, in particular, cause frustration for developers and could, in the worst case, lead to the dropping of worth-while projects with the loss of investment and employment.  For this reason, we must ensure that our planning system strikes the correct balance between the need for regular evaluation of proposals and for final decisions within a generally acceptable period.  It is hoped the measures proposed in this Bill will give the balance required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe much good will come out of this debate.  There is no doubt there is need for reform of the planning system. The main planning legislation is almost 30 years old and legislation establishing <Col N="29" /> An Bord Pleanála is over 15 years old. The Bill before us deals with the appeals system, and in particular the delays in that system.  It hopes to rectify that situation.  Speeding up decision-making will be most welcome and in so doing avoiding a situation whereby appeals are with an Bord Pleanála for a very long period of time.  Under this new legislation, planning appeals and other matters can be determined by An Bord Pleanála within a much shorter period than at present.</P>
    <P>It also proposes new procedure arrangements for legal action challenging the validity of planning decisions, the aim of which is to facilitate the speedy decisions of such proceedings.  It is indicated in the Bill that An Bord Pleanála must deal with all appeals within a four month period.  This is most welcome, as many of us have seen situations where appeals had been with An Bord Pleanála for up to nine months and longer.</P>
    <P>The new Bill does not curtail existing rights of appeal to the board, hence the present position whereby a person may appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a planning authority's decision on a planning application still stands.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, we have seen much criticisms of section four applications. As a member of Kerry County Council over the past number of years, we have had a number of section fours, but in most cases they have arisen as a result of the development plan.  It is unfair to say the section four system has been abused.  It is now much harder to get a section four through, as it needs a 75 per cent majority of the members voting in favour.</P>
    <P>There should be some input by local representatives in the decision-making process.  In Kerry County Council, we have area planning meetings where the planning authorities discuss applications. Where there is a doubt they seek the views of the public representatives and this is most welcome.  Legal opinion is that local representatives are not the planning authority.  The officials and county manager have the say and make the final decision.  I believe the views <Col N="30" /> of the public representatives should be taken into account in planning decisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister when he states that there has been a considerable improvement in An Bord Pleanála's performance.  For example, between September 1990 and April 1992 the number of appeals on hands fell from 1,703 to 1,046 and the proportion of cases on hands for more than six months fell from 21.4 per cent to 3 per cent.  This is a major change for the better, and on which the board are to be commended. The time taken to deal with individual appeals is still not satisfactory.  The truth is that the law as it stands will inhibit the achievement of further significant improvements.</P>
    <P>The procedure introduced by the Planning Act, 1976, whereby any person can go to the High Court for an order against a development carried out without planning permission, or which does not comply with the terms and permission granted, has shown over the years to be effective.  However, the process has been too slow.  By allowing orders to be sought in the Circuit Court, the effectiveness of the procedure will be enhanced and matters will be speeded up.  It will certainly mean that planning authorities wishing to enforce the law will have a less costly and less onerous legal avenue open to them.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the maximum fine of £10,000 for conviction on indictment under the planning Act as it now stands is totally inadequate, particularly bearing in mind some of the serious offences involved.  The Minister's proposal to raise the maximum fine to £1 million is very welcome.  It will ensure that the penalty is a real deterrent to the small minority of developers who might otherwise be tempted to flout the planning laws with an eye only to profits.</P>
    <P>Overall the Bill's approach is a reasonable one.  A fair balance has been achieved between the need for a thorough and efficient development control process and the public interest in having final decisions on development proposals made within an acceptable <Col N="31" /> period.  I commend the Bill to the House and I compliment the Minister on the very important changes he has introduced.</P>
    <P>In section 12 the Minister referred to oral hearings.  The Bill proposes that any request for an oral hearing of an appeal will have to be made at the outset of the appeal process.  This will get over the problem posed for the board where a request for an oral hearing is received when consideration of the appeal is nearly completed.  It should not, however, cause difficulties for participants in appeals.  It should be known by the appellant when appealing and to any other party when making his submission whether he wants to seek an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be commended as far as public representatives are concerned.  Its main objective is to set a time limit of four months for the making of a decision by an Board Pleanála.  All public representatives are extremely concerned, and have been for a considerable time, at the lengthy delays in the decision making process of An Bord Pleanála.  In order to assist the board, I would ask the Minister to ensure that they would have the necessary staff, as they have indicated over the past number of years that they are completely understaffed.  They must have the manpower, and the required resources in order to achieve the Bill's objective.</P>
    <P>To summarise, this Bill will be welcomed as a measure to speed up planning appeals.  While there may be some reservations about the fact that all grounds of appeal must be submitted at the first attempt, the Bill probably strikes a balance between the needs to preserve the rights of the third parties and an equal need for the developer to have a quick determination of his planning application.</P>
    <P>The Bill could put some pressure on local authorities who will now be required to forward documentation to the board within seven days, in particular having regard to the large increase in <Col N="32" /> planning applications in some counties over the past few years.</P>
    <P>As a member of Kerry County Council, I note that the number of applications for planning now range from an average of 40 a week, and in some cases over 50. From listening to some of my colleagues speaking about the problems they have had in their local authorities regarding planning applications, I believe we have a very efficient planning authority within Kerry County Council to deal with the massive workload they have.  I am concerned with the extra work that will be put on them as a result of this Bill that they will need extra staff.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would give some indication as regards funding.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on his initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish to say how much I appreciate this Bill coming before us.  I have always had a great interest in planning.  It was very much a local planning issue that brought me into politics. Probably if it was not for that, I would not be here today.  It involved a planning issue in my own area and since then I have had a deep interest in planning matters.  None of my Dublin City Council colleagues is here, but somebody like Senator Eoin Ryan, who was a very good chairman of the Corporation Planning Committee could vouch for the fact that my big interest in Dublin Corporation during my 17 years there, has been in planning.  If I go on a little long this morning or if I get excited it is because I feel strongly and passionately about the issue.  I will be putting down a number of amendments at a later stage but I want to make some general comments now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will start by saying where I believe the planning process fits into our political structures.  We are getting away from a situation whereby people elect a representative once every five or six years and leave everything to him or to her. We are becoming a more participative democracy.  People want to be involved <Col N="33" /> in what is going on.  I heard something mentioned at the Dublin City Council meeting the other night with regard to the control of dogs.  The Minister gave extra power to the local authorities and in that context it was said by one of the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues that the was doing this because he believed in local democracy and that measure would be a flagship of his time in that Department. If so, I hope the Minister will be left long enough in the Department to bring about more local democracy and I hope he will be given the necessary time and opportunity.</P>
    <P>Life is getting more and more complicated and many public representatives may feel as I do that I could not manage now as an Independent councillor Alderman with 63,000 voters on my register as I did the first time I was elected.  I could not have dealt with problems without the help and expertise of constituents.  There is no longer any question of electing a representative and leaving them to get on with it.  The planning Acts &mdash; there are a number of them &mdash; guarantee citizens the right to information on planning proposals which may be of great concern and interest to them.  A proposal may involve their local area although one's comments should not be restricted to local issues.  The country belongs to all of us and so does the capital city, Dublin.  If I wished to comment on a major planning application for Kerry I would not consider it inappropriate for me to do so, any more than I would consider it inappropriate for a Kerry or Donegal representative to comment on a major planning proposal for Dublin.</P>
    <P>People involved in a planning issue need a forum in which to express their views and to know that their views will be taken into consideration.  That is important.  People want a say in what sort of a community they will live in and how it should develop.  They want to feel that they can influence the shape of their physical environment, and of their community in years ahead for themselves and for their children, whether in a rural area or a town or village.  Coming from Roscrea I am sure that the Minister has seen <Col N="34" /> changes there in his lifetime.  I do not know how long he has lived there.  Some of the changes are beneficial but there have also been less attractive developments which I will not mention.  The Minister knows them well.  I travel regularly through Roscrea and note the restoration of Damer House and many other commendable projects.  One should compliment voluntary organisations such as those who engage in the Tidy Towns Competition and others in Roscrea for their achievement.  I mention that to emphasise that local voluntary groups do excellent work.  Many people believe that voluntary groups do nothing but sit on the fence and object to proposals.  That is not so, nor do I believe it to have been the experience of people in this House involved in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The pace of change nowadays is intense.  We have seen the gravitation of population to towns and cities, the huge increases in urban population and the planning difficulties encountered in many urban centres.  Maynooth is a typical example of a town endeavouring to cope with an expanding population.  The response has been inadequate and bewildering at times.  This is where the whole planning process becomes important and it is crucial that legislation be clear.  It is bewildering even for semi-experts like ourselves in many instances and should be simplified as much as possible.  People should be encouraged to contribute to the formulation of planning legislation because no decision, no matter how wise, can satisfy everyone; some people are going to be hurt.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I hope the Minister does too, in the common sense of people by and large.  It has been my happy experience for 17 years as a public representative where I had problems, to have given the people involved all the information, keeping nothing back.  I found out as much as I could, brought them together and discussed it with them. They were enabled to see what the problems were and they remained reasonable. That is not to say that one will not get an occasional crank here or there.  This <Col N="35" /> fundamental fact should be borne in mind when considering the planning process.</P>
    <P>The Minister may think that time constraints are causing delays and problems and costing money.  I sensed an emphasis in his speech on effectiveness, efficiency, time management and so on.  It is very important to realise that if people are trusted with information, given time to consider it, provided with any back-up they may need, and have their views considered, they will generally accept the outcome even if it does not satisfy them. I think that we learned that bitter lesson from the history of chemical industry development applications in Ireland, when people doubted the information received from State institutions.  I urge the Minister to bear in mind the benefits of having popular support for the planning process rather than a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation between authorities such as the Minister and the Department on one side and members of the public on the other.  There is no reason that should happen but sadly, it often does and may cause delays.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development plan in my area, I was first elected in 1974 and the first development plan following that was in 1980.  I instituted in my area something called CP76.  We convened a meeting of 14 residents' associations covering virtually the entire area and formulated the representations we wanted to make regarding that development plan.  The good thing about that was that after sitting down together people could not shove a problem onto an adjoining area. It was not possible to say &ldquo;We do not want this extra traffic, your area must take it&rdquo;.  People had to be constructive and say, &ldquo;We have each to take our bit, we must come up with solutions that are beneficial to everybody&rdquo;.  In such cases people are reasonable, although I can speak only for my own local authority which is anxious to facilitate the involvement of community groups, etc. in the planning process.</P>
    <P>That is a change, because when I introduced the CP76 my group looked for £100 to help pay for maps and other <Col N="36" /> considerable work involved.  The chairman of the then planning committee, who was not a Fianna Fáil member, said on that occasion that it was outrageous for Alderman Hederman to ask the council for £100 to help people come up with plans which might be in conflict with official plans.  In other words, there were two plans, one made by people and another by representatives.  That practice has been discontinued in my local authority. Our attitude is to seek the views and participation of the public as much as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater access to information.  The community group in the corporation was instrumental in having the press brought in to all our committee meetings; prior to that they did not attend and people felt that things were going on behind closed doors.  Very often there was nothing nefarious going on but because the doors were locked to the press people suspected all sorts of skulduggery.  Admitting the press enabled people to find out what was going on.</P>
    <P>On the question of delays which is at the back of this new Bill, I would like to refer to the Fianna Fáil document which came out in 1991 for the local elections under the title &ldquo;Better Locally, Better Nationally&rdquo;.  In the section &ldquo;Creating a better planning system&rdquo; it said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is bringing in a better planning system.  It will balance the rights of citizens and the needs of the community while improving in the widest sense the environment in which we live.</P>
    <P>The three issues of concern there are the rights of citizens, the needs of the community and the environment in which we live.  There is no reference there to giving in to pressure from developers to do away with or shorten the time available for third party appeals.  On more than one occasion I had a motion passed by the planning committee of Dublin City Council asking for a speeding up of the planning appeals process and I want the Minister to consider my remark in that light.  It should not be speeded up <Col N="37" /> however, at the expense of private individuals and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>My final quote from that Fianna Fáil manifesto is: &ldquo;The new planning Bill will streamline the appeals process and speed it up while fully respecting the rights of individuals to have their case properly heard&rdquo;.  I had hoped that this Bill might give more consideration to the rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In the Progressive Democrats manifesto for the local elections they said:</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála will be required to give a verdict on all planning applications within a period not greater than four months from receipt of all documentation.</P>
    <P>Am I entitled, as an Independent Senator, to believe what I read in these manifestos?  I do not have the means to publish a 64 page manifesto.  Whatever I put down I guarantee to my constituents that I will stick to it.  The Progressive Democrats said &mdash; they are in Government and cannot be let off the hook, we must not place all the blame on Fianna Fáil &mdash; that there would be a verdict four months from receipt of all documentation. That is not what we have in this Bill.  Four months is the total time as I understand it but there is a difficulty in getting local authorities to send in documentation and in getting individuals, residents' associations, An Taisce and other organisations to send in their appeals. The Progressive Democrats promise is not being fulfilled in this instance.</P>
    <P>Delays have given planning a bad name to a certain extent; intolerable delays have held up the implementation of certain urgently needed development.  I contributed actively to two development plans in my time on the city council &mdash; I have been on the planning committee all the time and I accept that a development plan until it is implemented, is a sterile document.  That is why I am as anxious as anybody else that development plans be implemented expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that developers may moan and groan about loss of money involved but everybody here who has been involved with planning applications <Col N="38" /> must be aware of the extent to which they can affect people's lives.  An application may be lodged for something next door and those affected may be elderly people or a young married couple who have just bought a house and endure a heart breaking experience as they see the value of their property debased.  We have to remember those people and not only big developers.  I would like to see the verdict period reduced so that these people would suffer the minimum of worry during that period.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the time and effort put in at an early stage when local authorities are discussing a proposal may produce in the long run an understanding, co-operative public and public support for the planning process.  That outcome should be striven for.</P>
    <P>There are unnecessary delays in the planning process.  If there is a major application from a chemical industry and an EIS is required, it is understandable that it should take longer but there are instances where for no explicable reason a small kitchen extension or domestic application has also been held up.  An application of mine is being considered at present and I would like to raise it here, although I do not suppose I can get information on specifics, but it is a typical example and it is reasonable to bring it up.  In Dublin city, and in our area especially we have been trying to get the local authority to take steps to ensure that in the cases of listed and important buildings, owners are not allowed to rip out wooden sash windows that have been there since the houses were built and in many instances contain the original glass that twinkles and winks when the sun is shining.  People rip these out and put in the most hideous and incongruous substitutes. The local community, An Taisce and others have been trying to do something about this.  The local authority now tell us that we cannot do anything because of a court case taken and the residents' association have had to take the reference to the Minister to ask him to decide if a certain development was exempted.  The local authority would not undertake this responsibility.  I have not <Col N="39" /> yet received the date but I will stitch it into the record when I do.  Months have gone by, and maybe years but I do not want to be inaccurate on the record.  We cannot get a decision from the board on this reference.  What is holding it up? Why should it go on like this?  Could they not write and give some indication?  I am as frustrated as the Minister and other people seem to be with regard to this and I do not agree with his assessment of whose fault it is.</P>
    <P>I accept that difficulties are experienced by developers when they cannot have a free run at the planning process. They can incur considerable costs when people take vexatious appeals or ask for oral hearings as a delaying tactic.  I deplore these tactics as much as anybody else and have no time for them.  I would do anything I could if I knew of such a case to bring it to the attention of the board so that it might not continue.  There is no doubt that there are occasionally mischievous or frivolous appeals &mdash; I will give the figures I have but they are somewhat out of date.  An Bord Pleanála reports are also out of date; the last one I can put my hand on is for 1989.  I do not know if the Minister has a more up-to-date report and I would appreciate a copy if he does.</P>
    <P>Another reason Dublin Corporation and Dublin City Council are anxious to permit development is because of the generous tax incentives for people who develop certain areas when there is squalor and dereliction.  Work must be done in a certain timeframe and for that reason we would not wish to do anything to hinder development.  That does not mean we will agree to any development. We want a high standard development which will conform with our development plan and we are entitled to expect developers to come forward with plans in conformity with it.  Our job is to tell them what it is about.</P>
    <P>I am also aware, and I know this is of great concern to the Minister and to the Oireachtas, that development delays may cause loss of employment.  Since the board took up office in 1977, delays have <Col N="40" /> been minimised.  In 1963 Deputy Clinton suggested in the Dáil that time limits should be imposed; the objectives here are not new.  I do not know to which party Deputy Clinton belonged but the Senators will know which party to give credit to.</P>

      <P>We are told all the time by developers and by various bodies who fight for the interests of developers such as the construction industry, the housing industry and so on, of blackmail carried out by third parties.  In 1981 in the <i>Irish Business Magazine</i> it was alleged that third party blackmail was taking place, but in 1981 there were only ten vexatious appeals; in 1980 there were 13; in 1979 there were 14; in 1978 there were none and in 1977 there were none.  I took those figures from an An Taisce journal article by Mrs. C. O'Connor, former chairperson of An Taisce.  These figures do not tell a story of enormous numbers of vexatious or frivolous appeals; the numbers are modest.</P>
      <P>We know now that for a long time An Bord Pleanála have had the power to dismiss appeals.  In 1989 &mdash; here again I am restricted by not having a more up-to-date report from An Bord Pleanála &mdash; the board dismissed only 32 appeals, 1.4 per cent of total decisions for that year. That was not an excessive figure and it is quite reasonable for people to register a third party appeal if they are dissatisfied with the decision of a local authority.  My residents' association has often put in an appeal, talked to the developer and arrived at a compromise so that it was not necessary to sustain the appeal.  That is perfectly reasonable and legitimate.  I do not think that a figure of 32 appeals dismissed is worth worrying about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 5 of the 1982 Act the board <Col N="41" /> were given the power to consider appeals withdrawn, if they were abandoned or not followed up.  This happened sometimes when appeals were sorted out elsewhere. In the 1983 Act the board were given power to dismiss appeals as vexatious, frivolous or mischievous.  I am in favour of that and I have on occasion written to the board saying I believed an appeal was frivolous or vexatious and asking the board to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>The board can declare an appeal as withdrawn if the grounds for it have not been submitted within two weeks.  I do not think we should exaggerate the possibility of delays.  The board can write to somebody asking them to lodge the grounds for their appeal and I think I am correct in saying that if the information is not submitted within two weeks the board can consider the appeal withdrawn. I am sorry for dragging this out but we must get the facts straight.  An erroneous impression is sometimes given by those with money, power and expertise that their applications are constantly being challenged by third party appeals, a large number of which are vexatious and frivolous.  That is not the case and I am determined to get the facts straight.</P>
    <P>In 1989 32 appeals were withdrawn. The numbers I have given add up to 75 between frivolous appeals and those abandoned or withdrawn.  Out of a total of 2,348 appeals considered in 1989 that is not a large figure; in other words, 96 per cent of appeals were valid which is a very good record.</P>
    <P>It is not only third parties &mdash; I have admitted this &mdash; who on occasions put in appeals to thwart the system or to be vexatious or for some other ulterior motive.  I could give umpteen examples of people in my own electoral area who are involved in a development for which they have no planning permission.  If the corporation tries to halt the development or to take some action against those responsible, they are prohibited from doing so until the illegal development comes into use as such.  In other words, if a residential house is being converted into an office, corporation officials can see the neon lights going up, plastic windows <Col N="42" /> being put in and note other signs indicating that an office development is taking place in a residential area, yet the corporation cannot do anything since no material development occurs until the illegal development is put to use.  The corporation cannot act until the day on which the office opens; we expect that they will be able to take action but they cannot.</P>
    <P>An application for retention is lodged, the corporation has two months to deal with it &mdash; they could probably deal with it more expeditiously because it is a fairly black and white case.  In about six weeks the decision is given and if permission for retention is refused an appeal is submitted to the board.  This appeal may take six to eight months to be decided and if the board dismisses it another appeal may be lodged as the corporation prepare for court action.  The developer may have intended converting the entire house into offices originally.  This time the developer will ask to convert three-quarters of the house to offices keeping one residential unit.  They go through the whole process again.  Is that not a frivolous appeal?  I will give instances at a later date of how people have done this over and over again, to thwart the planning authorities and any possible legal action against them.  That is something we should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to the splendid book from An Bord Pleanála <i>Your Planning Appeal &mdash; a Guide</i> which our local authority has available, although I understand not all local authorities have it available.  It was brought out in 1985 and I suppose some parts of it would now be out of date.  In it they state:</P>
    <P>The Board has the absolute discretion to dismiss an appeal where,</P>
    <P>(a)  having considered the grounds of appeal, it is of the opinion that the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation, or</P>
    <P>(b)  having regard to the nature of the appeal ... the Board is satisfied that in the particular circumstances <Col N="43" /> the appeal should not be further considered by it.</P>
    <P>Appeals may also be dismissed by the Board where excessive delays occur in the lodgment of proper grounds of appeal.  The Board may also deal pre-emptorily with an appeal where it appears to it that the appeal has been abandoned or where a party to an appeal has failed to furnish particular information which the Board has sought and which it considers essential to enable it to deal properly with the appeal.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, the Board may declare that an application which has given rise to an appeal should be regarded as withdrawn, in which case formal determination of the appeal will not arise.</P>
    <P>Thus, it is made quite clear to the public that this facility exists for the board and that they should use it.</P>
    <P>The other feature is the considerable cost involved for residents' associations, voluntary organisations or an individual going ahead with a planning appeal.  The costs were increased recently and they are a huge burden now.  I have brought it up in this House with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Flynn, because I am constantly under pressure by organisations and individuals, but mostly organisations, in my area who find the charges are crippling and they can no longer afford to lodge an appeal.  You cannot even send in a letter to the board to bring some item of important information to their attention, withour paying a fee of £30.  It was £15 until recently and I think it was doubled.</P>
    <P>I had the rather galling experience last summer when there was an application in the centre of the city about which I felt very strongly.  It was an application which was totally out of conformity with our development plan and it came before the planning committee.  If it were not for my intervention it might have been granted but then they saw the light and admitted that it was a material contravention, that we could not grant it and it was refused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> The developers appealed it.  The date of the hearing was changed three times. I came up to Dublin to the An Bord Pleanála hearing from my holidays in the west, at considerable cost, financial and in every other way.  I got to the hearing and I just wanted to make my submission, but I would not be heard either as a Senator or an alderman.  The inspector was extremely apologetic but I could not be heard unless I put my £15 on the table.  I think that is outrageous. It occurred because I did not ally myself to some group.  I would have got away without paying if I had done so but because I did not, because I just wrote in and it was not in my own area, it was in the centre of the city, I had to pay the £15.  That is something other Members of this House may not know about and they might be interested in having it changed. I would be interested in hearing whether the Minister feels it is right that public representatives should have to pay these charges.</P>
    <P>The amount of work now done by local and voluntary organisations and residents' associations, etc., is enormous due to the fact that there is considerable under-staffing in the various departments of the planning authorities which have had to cut back the amount of staff.  The residents' associations do much factfinding work which the local authorities simply have not the resources to do.  They would much prefer not to have to do it. They find it very difficult to be involved continuously in fund-raising events so that they can raise money to pay these exorbitant charges for planning appeals. I think it is very unfair to penalise to such an extent those groups who have nothing to gain financially.</P>
    <P>The developer, on the other hand, has to pay also, and I do not deny that. However, at the end of the day, he will probably obtain a grant of permission and will, more than likely, be able to recoup his losses and expenses.  In addition he will probably make a tidy profit.  I do not feel quite so sorry for the developer, as I do for the residents' associations.  All they are doing is trying to protect the environment for their <Col N="45" /> neighbours or for the people who live in the area, or for the good of the country in general, perhaps for the good of tourism.</P>
    <P>We are being told now that the environment is all important.  The fundamental flaw in this Bill is that it penalises the small man, the small residents' associations, the voluntary organisations, An Taisce.  These are the people penalised by some of the very stringent sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>ENFO produces very good briefing sheets, this one is called <i>Planning and You</i>.  I would like to pay a compliment to ENFO for much of the very good work they have done.  Page 3 of this leaflet tells people how to get involved, what to do, how to deal with appeals, how to make their views known and how to help control development, etc.  It says:</P>
    <P>... it is your right and your responsibility to make your views known.  Although planning control rarely goes so far as to develop ideas for a street or house, the formation of street committees or even very informal groupings can be the first step in influencing local planning decisions. Generally, it is best to link up with other interested people but, if necessary, do not be afraid to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;. Organisations such as youth clubs, development associations, local An Taisce associations, Junior Chambers of Commerce, Macra na Feirme, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, neighbourhood committees, street committees and many other organisations can play a part in creating a better environment.</P>
    <P>People are being encouraged by ENFO but the Minister, in this Bill is penalising them and making it so difficult for them to make their appeals and get the information in in such a short time.</P>
    <P>There is one further line I would like to read from the leaflet because I found it extremely interesting and somewhat amusing.  It tells people to be positive and not to be begrudgers and knockers.  Then it says: &ldquo;Why not join a political party and become part of the action, rather <Col N="46" /> than forever being a &ldquo;hurler on the ditch&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We now have ENFO, a Government organisation encouraging people to join a political party, saying all the rest of us are only &ldquo;hurlers on the ditch&rdquo;.  A person like myself who is not in a political party can only be a &ldquo;hurler on the ditch&rdquo;.  Marvellous, is it not?  I am glad I am not in a political party.  However, we had that debate last night and I will not go over it again.</P>

    <P>I have not read the debates from the other House &mdash; I hope I get a chance to go through them to get a few ideas &mdash; but perhaps the Minister has been told this previously: the real problem lies in expecting everything to be in within one month.  For a voluntary organisation, that is unrealistic.  I do not know if the Minister or any of his officials has ever been involved in such an organisation, but perhaps they do not understand the problem. It is very easy when you are a Minister with civil servants and bureaucrats to hand you papers and do your research but that is not the way it is in voluntary organisations.  Even in an organisation like An Taisce, a national organisation, where there are only two full-time officers for the whole country, a great deal of voluntary effort is required and people work hard.  I hope the Minister will put up a good case if he intends <Col N="47" /> to pursue this extreme and outrageous provision requiring people in voluntary organisations to have everything in within one month.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will also find it difficult to comply with the rule requiring them to send in documents within 14 days from the date on which An Bord Pleanála makes the request.  As deliveries between the board and the planning departments can often take a number of days, this procedure would be very difficult for the planning authority to comply with. Therefore, I ask the Minister to make a very small amendment to this section; one or two small amendments were made to the Bill in the other House.  The 14 days should run from the date the request is received by the planning authority rather than from the date the request is sent out.</P>
    <P>A request for observations by An Bord Pleanála, in relation to an appeal under section 7 could be misdirected or delivery could be delayed.  Here again I would request that the time should be from the date on which the request is received by the planning authority rather than the date on which it is made.  I do not think my request is unreasonable.  What does the Minister think?  I will put down amendments along those lines when we come on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (2) (c) worries me.  This section envisages that the Minister could make regulations to enable the board to invite applicants, or appellants, to submit to the board revised plans or other drawings modifying the development to which the appeal relates and the board could grant permission for that modified development.  I told the Minister the sad story of the day I travelled on the train from the west and had to pay £15 to be heard.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to tell him the end of the story.  When I arrived I discovered that the appellants had put in new plans. The original plan was for a development consisting entirely of offices.  Now, unknown to any of us, they had come up with a new plan which was considerably altered.  Having paid £15, I made my case <Col N="48" /> and got a letter some days later from the board saying that because the plan had been modified so much, the board did not consider that it was close to the original application and the whole appeal came to nought.  The developers were told to go back to the local authority with their application and to start all over again. My journey from the country and my £15 went for nothing.  I was never given back my £15; perhaps I should ask them for it. In this Bill the Minister intends to make that scenario acceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has ever been to an oral hearing of a planning application, but this is what happens. You go to the planning application office, probably having stayed up the night before preparing the plans and getting the case ready, probably having spent a lot of money because you may have to employ experts to help you to put your case to the inspector.  I would like to pay tribute to the inspectors.  They are all very helpful and courteous and are always very polite to people who are involved in a planning application for the first time.  They never make them feel awkward, ill at ease or nervous.  They do everything they can to help.  However, let us get back to what happens when you attend an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>All the homework is done and all the facts are marshalled and you have the necessary experts with you.  You have probably had to give up a day at work if you are employed and got other people to give up a day's work also.  You get to the hearing and, as happened to me that morning, you find that the carpet has been pulled from under you because the developer &mdash; in this case it was the appellant &mdash; has now submitted a modified plan.  It is very deflating.  I felt deflated on that occasion because most of the main points to which I was objecting were gone out the window.  Happily, in that case, the board decided that this should not have been done.  The inspector decided to allow the hearing to go ahead and to hear both sides, but when it went before An Bord Pleanála they decided that this was not the correct procedure and the appeal collapsed.  The <Col N="49" /> Minister is now proposing to validate that position; he is proposing to make that acceptable.</P>
    <P>I will be putting down an amendment asking the Minister to amend the Bill to require that any material modification, such as that I outlined, introduced by the applicant or the appellant, would be circulated to all the parties involved in advance of the oral hearing.  What would have happened if it had not been an oral hearing?  What would have happened if that case was being decided by written submissions?  Would the appellant have been allowed to substitute that modified plan?  I presume that under the old regulations it would have been circulated, but I believe the Minister should amend the Bill to ensure that the modified plan would be circulated to all the other parties in sufficient time to allow them to give a considered judgment and so that they would not have to go to the expense and trouble of coming into an oral hearing to find that the oral hearing was on the modified plan.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments and suggestions will be taken in the spirit in which they are intended.</P>
    <P>I probably have more experience of these matters than any other councillor, Senator or Deputy.  I have 17 years experience.  I know self-praise is no praise, but I do not mean it as praise, I am simply stating a fact.  I know what the problems are.  I do know what it is like for residents' associations trying to cope. I am not magnifying the problem; I am telling the House the facts.  I have been to hundreds of oral hearings and I have been involved in umpteen appeals, and I know the difficulties better than anybody. I suppose the Minister's officials would say they know them better but I doubt if they have been to more hearings than I have.  Perhaps one of them was an inspector previously and knows it from that point of view.  It is not easy nowadays for these voluntary organisations who are quite rightly, anxious and interested to get involved, because they feel this is the way we protect our environment.</P>
    <P>We know how strongly the Minister's party feels about the environment.  We <Col N="50" /> know the former Taoiseach decided that Ireland's Presidency of the European Community would be called the Green Presidency.  This is not the first time I have complimented him on that.  I think it was a very enlightened and clever move on his part.  It certainly sent out the right messages to the other member states.  I would not be quite so sure that we were or are doing everything that was intended but I made my own personal contribution by riding my bicycle for that six months. I hoped that on one occasion I might meet the Taoiseach and I would say to him &ldquo;well, Taoiseach, this is my contribution to your Green Presidency,&rdquo; but I did not get the chance.  Unfortunately, I never met him when I was on my bicycle.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to reduce the time delays in the planning appeals area he should look at the numbers of staff.  This is where the problem lies.  With the huge decrease in staff numbers and the increase in the number of appeals you cannot expect the level of efficiency and the sort of timescale you are looking for. It is not possible.  During 1988 and 1989 staff numbers decreased by 20 per cent and the staff at planning inspector grade declined by 50 per cent.  Was the Minister aware of those figures or were any of the other Senators aware of them?  How can the appeals process be efficient and quick without planning inspectors?  That is where the Minister will find the root of the problem, not at the door of the third parties who are alleged to be holding up the whole process because they do not send in their information in time, or, indeed, with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies to the local authorities.  Every member here present is a member of a local authority and we know of the cutbacks we have had to make.  I do not object to them in many ways.  I am not one of those people who thinks we have all the money in the world.  We must have efficiency and we must upgrade our services in many ways but I do not think you can really expect that local authorities will be able to comply with the stringent requirements of this Bill, expecting everything to be in to the board within 14 days, not 14 days <Col N="51" /> from the date they receive the application but 14 days from the day it leaves the premises of the board.</P>
    <P>The staff in our planning department work under unbearable constraints.  They simply cannot undertake the work they have on hand and this will put added strain on them.  However, the Minister knows more than I do about the public service recruiting restrictions.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 a local authority has to send in various documents to the board. When the local authority deals with an application and they get objections from the public, from residents' associations, An Taisce or anybody who is entitled to make an objection to the planning authority, those objections must be considered. If the application goes to an appeal, would it not seem logical that the objections, which the public went to the trouble of sending to the local authority should be forwarded with all this information to the board?  However, when they are writing to the local authority asking for information they specifically exclude those objections and say they do not want the local authority to send them any objections.  I hope the Minister can clarify that for me.</P>
    <P>Why do they do this?  One of the reasons which I can think of is that if 20 people from an area wrote to the local authority voicing their objections to a particular development &mdash; and those 20 people wanted the board to know about their objections, of course they would have to pay £15 or £30.  Is this why the board specifically excludes the local authority from forwarding the objections? Did Senators know these objections were not forwarded?  Most people do not know it.  In fact the public believes that once they have written in to the local authority and put the point to them then, if it goes to an appeal, the observations will be sent on to the appeals board.  This is not so.  I will put down an amendment to section 6 to the effect that this should happen automatically.  The Minister and his officials will probably come back and say there will be a problem because if this was done, the objections would be <Col N="52" /> circulated to the other parties and the permission of the objector would be required.  Is there any reason those objections could not go to the board to be considered without having to be circulated to the other parties?  Is that possible? It might be a neighbour objecting to another neighbour or it might be an employee objecting to something his employer had applied for and an objection could work against him.  If that person knew the objection was going to be circulated it might inhibit him in the first place from making the objection to the local authority.  That is an amendment which would be beneficial and the Minister would be forever remembered by organisations, such as An Taisce and the voluntary organisations.  He would be a hero.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to report formally to this House on the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations.  I regard the results of the negotiations as being very satisfactory from the Irish viewpoint. This is not just my view, it is generally accepted in the industry that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the time of my appointment as Minister for Agriculture and Food I have accepted the objectives of the EC Commission in relation to Common Agricultural Policy reform.  These aims were to bring markets into balance by means of production controls, price policy and extensification of production methods; to keep a sufficient number of farmers on the land; to give an enhanced role to farmers as producers of quality foods and <Col N="53" /> as protectors of the environment; to achieve a more effective distribution of support; and to maintain the position of the Community as a major player in world agricultural trade.</P>
    <P>I did, however, have considerable problems in relation to the Commission proposals to achieve those objectives.  In the papers presented by the Presidency at earlier Councils, some of those concerns were eased.  However, going into the decisive Council in May, I was still some considerable way from being able to endorse an agreement.</P>
    <P>While I accepted the need for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy I set myself the overall goal of ensuring that it remained an effective support policy and I also set myself some specific aims for what I wished to achieve for Ireland in the negotiations.  Obviously, my primary objective had to be to achieve a framework which would allow Irish farmers and our agriculture based industries to prosper in the future.  I very much shared the Commission's aim of achieving a more equitable distribution of support. To me that meant putting more money into farmers' pockets rather than giving it to operators of storage and disposal systems.  At the same time, however, I wanted to safeguard our more competitive farmers and to make our industries more market orientated.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I had to accept that in any multinational negotiations the result is always a compromise between the conflicting aims of the participants.  In the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations a number of the other participants had considerably different views to mine.  However, while the result of such negotiations might be a compromise, the compromise which emerged can be weighted in different directions. It was my job as Minister to ensure that the result of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations was weighted in a way which achieved my objectives.</P>
    <P>Good results cannot, however, be achieved by wishful thinking, neither do they emerge over a few days, no matter how strenuous, at a Council in Brussels. In our case, months of preparation and <Col N="54" /> discussion were involved.  It was a hard slog.  I took every opportunity, not just at Council meetings but also in bilateral contacts, to make my colleagues aware of our concerns and needs.  My officials did likewise with their counterparts.  In the week before the decisive Council, I visited Lisbon and impressed on the President of the Council, Minister Cunha, the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy and what we needed to achieve in the negotiations to safeguard our primary industry.</P>
    <P>At the Council the discussions on Common Agricultural Policy reform were preceded by a series of bilateral meetings between Commissioner Mac-Sharry, Minister Cunha and individual Ministers from the member states.  This gave me a further opportunity to present the Irish position in the strongest terms to the people drafting the compromise package of reform measures.  That was on the Tuesday.  In the very early hours of the following morning we received the compromise paper.  I was gratified to see that most of my major concerns had been catered for in the document and that all the hard work had paid off.  There were still, of course, some remaining issues to be addressed, particularly in regard to the limit on the suckler cow premium, the milk quota reduction for 1992-93, the retention of the reduced sheep flock limit of 350 in the non-disadvantaged areas and the question of cereal co-responsibility levies and the individual base area.</P>
    <P>In the continuing negotiations, breakthroughs were achieved in all these areas. The herd limit was abolished for suckler cows, the milk and price quota cut was dropped, and flock limit was re-established at 500, the cereal co-responsibility levies were removed and the individual base area was granted.  The latter is particularly significant this year in that a proposed price reduction of 6 per cent for cereal farmers is transformed into a 2 per cent price increase.  This will increase the income of cereal farmers by £16 millions this year.  My one regret was that we could not get agreement to the introduction of a dairy cow premium.  From an early stage, even when a price <Col N="55" /> reduction of 10 per cent was proposed for milk, the vast majority of member states were opposed to such a measure. Only Luxembourg and ourselves supported the scheme and unfortunately we did not form a strong enough power bloc to force this through, particularly when the milk price was only to be reduced by 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I had set myself a number of objectives to be achieved in the negotiations.  I am satisfied that I have fulfilled those aims.  There is no doubt that a framework of support capable of being maintained for the future has been put in place.  The existing mechanisms which consumed money voraciously without maintaining farmer incomes could not be sustained either financially or politically.  Farmers, processors and traders can now plan on the basis of assured support arrangements and market conditions.  Producers in all areas will continue to secure the bulk of their income from the market-place, although at somewhat lower prices.  The reduction in prices will benefit consumers. I have already put in train a mechanism with my colleague, Minister O'Rourke, to ensure that the lower prices to farmers will be passed on and reflected in consumers' shopping baskets.  In many instances, producers should gain from increased consumption of cheaper products.</P>
    <P>I also wanted to bring about a more even distribution of resources and there is no doubt that in this we have been successful.  As a result of the negotiations direct payments to Irish farmers will increase by £340 million per annum to a total of over £620 million each year. While the current mechanisms helped to underpin farm incomes, not enough of the Community funding found its way through to farmers.  The new premia payments will ensure that it does.</P>
    <P>It is worth while recounting the amounts involved.  The basic male premium will increase from £35 to £158.  In addition, a special slaughter premium of £52.75 will be payable on all male animals slaughtered between 1 January and 30 <Col N="56" /> April.  I am convinced that this will transform our beef industry.  This aid was introduced specifically at my request to help redress our seasonal beef production pattern.  On top of that, an additional premium of £26 per annum will be payable on each animal qualifying for the basic premium on holdings where the stocking rate is below 1.4 livestock units per hectare.  The total beef premium payable can, therefore, be as high as £237 per animal.  This will more than make up for a 15 per cent reduction in beef intervention prices.  Of course, in the headage areas, the headage is payable as well as the premium.</P>
    <P>The suckler cow premium has also been increased substantially and including the extensification factor will amount to £150 per cow.  This is almost three times the current rate of £52 per animal. Over 700,000 animals per year will qualify for this premium.  All told then, Irish farmers will receive a high level of premium in respect of about 1.75 million animals each year.</P>
    <P>The results of the negotiations also achieved my twin objectives of safeguarding our more competitive farmers and making our agriculture-based industries more market oriented.  Farmers will receive somewhat lower prices for their products which will make them more competitive in the marketplace while, at the same time, their incomes are safeguarded by virtue of the compensatory payments.  Our agri-industries will also be able to compete more effectively because the cost of their raw materials and in the case of cereals that will have been reduced.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector the counter seasonality premium payments should help to maintain a year round supply of cattle for factories.  This is essential if our meat factories are to supply Community supermarkets on a continuous basis.  All major reports over the past 20 years have identified our seasonal production of beef as the major impediment to greater penetration of Community markets. Obviously, our factories cannot be expected to change overnight and the phased reduction in intervention levels, <Col N="57" /> together with the retention of safety net intervention, will give them the breathing space necessary to gear up their marketing arrangements to meet the challenges ahead.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the intervention levels which will obtain in 1997 at the end of the phasing-in period are almost 50 per cent higher than those which were agreed by the Council of Ministers in 1989.</P>
    <P>Because the negotiations have progressed over a period, people tend to look at the improvements secured in the decisive Common Agricultural Policy Reform Council rather than look at the changes in the original proposals.  I have to say that in all sectors we secured significant improvements on the original proposals.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the main improvements in the beef sector.  In the milk sector the original proposal involved a 1 per cent cut in quota in each of the years 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95 together with a 10 per cent cut in milk price.  There is now no quota cut being applied in the forthcoming year and any reduction in the following two years would be made only by the Council in the light of an assessment of the market situation before the beginning of each of these years.</P>
    <P>In the sheep sector the Commission had proposed reducing the flock limit for the full ewe premium from 1,000 in disadvantaged areas and 500 in non-disadvantaged areas to 500 and 350 respectively. The 50 per cent premium paid in excess of those numbers was to be dropped completely.  The limits have now been restored to existing levels and the 50 per cent premium will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>In the cereals area the price reduction will not be as severe as first proposed and compensation terms for price cuts and set-aside have been considerably improved.</P>
    <P>A measure of how well we have succeeded in the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations can be taken from a static analysis of the original Commission proposals carried out by the economic unit of the Department of <Col N="58" /> Agriculture and Food which indicated that net losses to the Irish farming sector could amount to close to £100 million when they would be fully operational. The outcome now achieved would more than compensate producers as a whole for the reform measures and could, in fact, involve a substantial net gain compared to 1991.</P>
    <P>The Commission has, by and large, achieved its objectives in the negotiations. I am satisfied that I have achieved my objectives.  There will always be some who will be dissatisfied with the outcome of any negotiations.  In fact, there will always be some who will be unhappy with the outcome of all negotiations. The majority view clearly is, however that the result of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations is in the long term interests of the Irish agriculture and food sector and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is now up to the Irish farming and Irish agriculture industry to respond to the new situation.  I have already established an expert group to provide a framework where we can best respond to the new situation.  That group has already had its inaugural meeting last week and will have a programme in place for me by the end of December.  By the start of next year, we can ensure that our industry, from farms to marketing bodies, will be well aware of their responsibilities in the new, internationally competitive, agricultural environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his opening address to us this afternoon on the Common Agricultural Policy reform package.  I would also like to thank him and his advisors personally for their obvious hard work and dedication in getting this package finalised.  It cannot have been easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A collective sigh of relief that at last something was agreed may have masked possible difficulties down the road when we analyse in detail some of the small print.  Reform was needed and there was no argument about that.  We were not going to get our own way.  We were not <Col N="59" /> going to get 100 per cent of what we wanted.  The Minister will agree that those of us who think seriously about agriculture being our primary industry for so long &mdash; and, indeed, for the foreseeable future &mdash; still have reason to have major concerns in many areas.  We have yet to see the legal nature of the way things work in Brussels.  It will take some time before we play out in reality the theory of what has been agreed.</P>
    <P>The reform package before us will change the whole structure of agriculture. Today's farmers, like some of our hurling teams in the past, will all grow old together.  They will be the last generation to have had the opportunity to develop our grass-based agricultural production.  They are the generation that got the chance.  Primary production areas are quota controlled &mdash; dairy, sheep, beef and tillage &mdash; in an effort to bring balance into the market and to decrease the storage costs of the massive surpluses.  The cheque in the post must undermine agricultural development.  Given the enormous collapse in farm incomes in recent years, there is some short term comfort from the concept that, regardless of what one does, one will get a cheque in the post just for having X number of animals, or compensation for X number of acres set aside.  In the long term we have got to see that this &ldquo;cheque in the post&rdquo; type farming undermines the national effort and particularly the future of commercial growth in the agricultural sector.  It removes the initiative to work.  Instead of green certs, farmers will need Ph. Ds. to fill in the plethora of application forms and to cope, as Alan Gillis put it, with the new industry of small print.</P>
    <P>What about the herdowners who were disqualified in 1991 for two years due to application difficulties, for example, with male beef premium, the suckler cow premium or the ewe premium?  They will have no reference year in which to establish their quota.  Are they ruled out forever from claiming in these areas?  There is a serious problem to which I would draw the Minister's attention immediately. Will we change the rules for those <Col N="60" /> who were disqualified last year or this year?  If we do not, even though they may have been producing beef or had a ewe flock for years, they will technically have no reference year because they were paid no premia last year or this year.  They will be ruled out on a technicality on the application form.  I would like the Minister's response as to how he will deal with that group of farmers.  There are quite a few who have got caught for different reasons on the application form.</P>
    <P>What about the stock relief implications of the reform package?  With the consequential decrease in the value of stock, will farmers using stock relief to compute tax liabilities now be caught in a major clawback operation?  Again the rules need to be looked at and, I imagine, changed.  There is a particular difficulty about the category I have just mentioned. We all supported the concept of stock relief to encourage farmers to increase numbers and production and to intensify when that was our philosophy.  Are these farmers all to be caught in a tax clawback, and in liability for back taxes because their stock will naturally be reduced?  I would like to know the Minister's views on this matter.  Major problems will arise very quickly in this area.</P>
    <P>The relief of agreeing the reform package now needs to be matched with hard facts, with the delivery on promises and some very serious analysis.  The GATT international trade talks must acknowledge the areas of reform and ensure they are put into what we refer to as the &ldquo;green box&rdquo;.  They are not subject to further reductions.  That is the Minister's intention and he has our support in ensuring that, whatever resolution is arrived at in relation to the GATT talks, farmers who have taken cuts now will not be subject to a further layer of restrictions because of GATT demands.</P>
    <P>There will be major job losses in the PAYE sector because of this CAP reform package, upstream and downstream of the farm gate, as farmers reduce inputs on the one hand to increase margins and to intensify, and on the other to decrease production to comply with the quota controls.  I would like the Minister <Col N="61" /> to try to quantify for us the impact on the agri-business sector because there will be impact as a result of these figures of 50,000 jobs at risk and there will be thousands more which will not now materialise in an area where we had hoped to expand and where much effort had been expended in trying to get it to expand.</P>
    <P>The factory farming of continental Europe is now favoured over grass based production.  They have cheaper cereal feed.  The Minister referred to a 29 per cent drop and the special maize silage supplement; that crept in unknown to most of us although the Minister and his advisers may have known it was coming. On the continent, maize silage is the main forage crop.  They have the advantage of the cheaper cereals; many zero graze, in fact.  There is a £75 per acre maize silage supplement.  How will our farmers with grass produced silage compete with a £75 maize silage supplement on the continent? That has very serious implications which have hardly hit the headlines here at all, certainly not for the average grass root farmer.  Perhaps the farm organisations are beginning to realise what is happening, but apart from the cheaper cereals which were hit by the competitiveness of our grass based agriculture a supplement for the maize silage they use on the continent is going to make life extremely difficult.  There is no such thing as a level playing field or fair competition there.  I would love to know the Minister's views on how he could accept that maize silage supplement which would militate against our farmers so seriously and against the UK farmers as well.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maize silage supplement, they also have an extra VAT refund in Germany, Italy and France. These factors will conspire to make our milk, beef and sheep meat less competitive in the market-place and to increase calf exports from this country.</P>
    <P>The mention of VAT refund brings to mind an area of concern of mine for some time: it is whether the Common Agricultural Policy is common at all.  It pretends to be, and on that basis we must <Col N="62" /> question the difference in national aids that are allowed to agriculture under the rules.  The fact that Germany, the Netherlands and the other wealthier countries &mdash; if I may use that expression &mdash; are in a position to give national aids to their farmers way above what this country could be expected to give, will distort competition.  There will be no level playing field.  I would ask the Minister to refer the distortion in agricultural competition because of the differences in national aids in the different national Governments to the Competition Commissioner to see if we can resolve it.</P>
    <P>It is easy for some countries to accept major cutbacks in agricultural enterprises, European compensatory mechanisms and subsidies in the knowledge that their own Governments will be able to top up their compensatory mechanisms to an extent that the farmers will no longer feel the pain.  We cannot do that.  National aids to agriculture in this country since 1987 have decreased by 50 per cent; in Germany aid has increased by 70 per cent.  Where are we going if the individual countries can support their farmers and cushion any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy whereas we cannot?  It is not leaving our farmers playing on the same field.  There is a major competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I will look now at the specific proposals in the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  We must welcome the winter beef premium.  It is a first and very welcome. It should help iron out some of the awful seasonality we have in this market. I am sure the Minister is aware of how markets operate when left to their own resources here.  I would have major fears that farmers would increase the price of stores going into the sheds by the equivalent of the premium they are expecting when the stores come out of the sheds. As a result, there will be no net gain to the serious winter beef producer.  They will not be able to fill their sheds at a price which will allow them an economic margin having over-wintered them. Bringing them on to beef in the sheds during the winter for the last few years has not paid at all.  I do not know what <Col N="63" /> one can do in a free market to resolve that, but if that happens I fear it will negate entirely the profit from the winter beef premium.</P>
    <P>There is even confusion among farmers who feel that the winter beef premium will be paid next spring instead of in spring 12 months.  It is already causing problems in marts when it is pointed out that there will be no premium next year. The winter beef premium will not be paid until 1994.  Distortion is beginning to creep in already under a misconception. What will it be like when they realise how the rules work?  We need more talking and explaining in that area to ensure that farmers are not their own worst enemies when it comes to the introduction of what should be a very good addition to the support package that was agreed in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The male beef premium has been increased also.  It will now be paid twice in the animal's lifetime: it will be paid at ten months of age and at 22 months of age; it will amount to £158 per head. There will be a regional reference herd. This is causing some questioning at present.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on how he thinks the regional reference herd will be established and how it will work.  What is the definition of a region in this context?  Where will the Minister draw the line?  The concept of regions comes into the suckler cow and tillage areas as well.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, Ireland is a single region, from the Brussels' point of view.  I gather from reading how we are handling these different areas that Ireland now will be subdivided into more regions when it comes to administrating the different premium subsidies.  We need fairly quick clarification how a region will be defined, and on what basis the country will be carved up into regions.  The tillage farmers want to know and the beef farmers will want to know.</P>
    <P>Confusion arose over a statement the Minister made in the Dáil.  I understand that the reference year will be 1992.  I am subject to correction on that.  From what the Minister said an inference was drawn <Col N="64" /> that he would average the years 1991 and 1992, and that that would establish the quota for an individual, or in a region if we are talking about male beef premium. Can we have an explanation whether the Minister has made a decision that 1992 will be the reference year in terms of the male beef premium and the suckler calf premium?  There is some confusion there.</P>
    <P>The suckler cow premium should be a tremendous help to all, and particularly those in disadvantaged areas.  Mentioning disadvantaged areas, could I make a plea to the Minister to speed up the appeals process, notwithstanding the excellent work being done by the appeals secretary?  It has got to the stage, with so many areas under appeal that effectively, we have a new review under the less favoured areas directive.  The last review took about three years before we got a decision from Brussels; by that time it had gone around the country twice and to Brussels and back a few times.  Is there any way, for the benefit of those farmers who are in the appeals system under the less favoured areas directive, by which we could speed up the process now?</P>
    <P>Many of the implications of the reform package which we are now debating will depend on whether one is in or out of a disadvantaged area classification.  Some who got in under the last review are up and running; they will qualify for the extra payments, extra grants and the bonus of being in a so called disadvantaged area.  However we all know many areas which should have been included in the disadvantaged areas classification the last time and it will be at least another 18 months before such areas get in under the present scheme if the process takes as long as it has always taken in relation to these reviews.  It is tedious and cumbersome.  It will be put into the computer, decisions have to be made at home and the whole thing has to be sent to Brussels.  Brussels will probably ask a few questions.  It will go backwards and forwards.  The last time they took six months from the time they got our submission until we got the final answer from them.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to speed up <Col N="65" /> the appeals process so that farmers will know, once and for all, whether they are in or out of the disadvantaged areas classification under the less favoured areas directive.  The suckler calf scheme in the disadvantaged areas will be a tremendous asset.  There will be individual producer quotas in relation to suckler cows as distinct from the male beef premium.  A national reserve is to be established by a 1 per cent reduction on numbers in non-disadvantaged areas and a 2 per cent reduction in disadvantaged areas.  Maybe I am missing something as I cannot see why numbers are being reduced more in disadvantaged areas than in other areas.  May I ask the Minister to explain the thinking behind asking so-called disadvantaged farmers to reduce their numbers further to create a national reserve and by a comparatively greater proportion than more advantaged farmers?  Perhaps to be disadvantaged one must be capable of carrying less stock.  I am not sure that that logic has applied to date in the classification procedure but it could be the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>The transfer rights in relation to the suckler cow premium are interesting also in that they do not attach to the land as in the milk quotas if I understand correctly and can be transferred within families or from producer to producer within a region.  My question in relation to defining the region is relevant here because there is no co-op involved when we are talking about suckler cows.  There is no distorting of deliveries in any area. Why the regional restriction on transfers of suckler cow production rights?  What would be the implications if one lived on the border of a region?  Some people who live just inside a regional border may want to sell to a neighbour on the other side of the regional border and this would be reasonable in the case of the suckler cow premium given that there is no distortion of other trade by movement of quota rights in this area.  I would like the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we will have much demand for the extensification premium &mdash; although in certain areas we may; I <Col N="66" /> think demand will not be as great here as for other supports.  There are changes in the original proposals for stocking rates but I still expect major problems in this area.  Do the original penalties remain unchanged?  Will a farmer who exceeds the stocking rate by the year designated be ineligible for a premium of any kind whether special male beef premium or the suckler cow premium or will the farmer be paid up to the stocking rate numbers that the acreage officially permits? The initial discussions implied that one would lose all premia if one exceeded the stocking rates.  Many farmers are concerned about the implications of stocking rates and about penalties for not complying with numbers.  I do not expect any demand for the Common Agricultural Policy conversion premium in this country and the situation will remain this way.</P>
    <P>In relation to sheep proposals, the low premium area has become a very important one.  We have doubled the numbers in our national flock in a few years.  The collapse of lamb prices this spring burned many a farmer's fingers badly.  The abolition of the variable premium in the UK last year and New Zealand access to the French market for chilled lamb present marketing difficulties to the Irish farmer attempting to dispose of lamb to the French market.  What are the Minister's thoughts in this area?  Is there any way in which we could bring sense and rationality into it?  Has the Minister plans to discuss with his opposite number Mr. Gummer in the UK and with the French authorities ways of bringing law and order into the French market which is vitally important to Irish lamb producers. I would like the Minister's views on that. With regard to the reference year, has the Minister opted for 1991 or is he averaging 1989, 1990 and 1991?  I think it is 1991 but I have been contradicted on that and I would appreciate clarification.</P>
    <P>The Minister is creating a reserve which I support but he is taking more from disadvantaged areas than from non-disadvantaged areas.  The transfer rights of quotas are interesting and satisfactory and the best we could get for sheep production. Those producing sheep on conacre <Col N="67" /> maintain their right; it is not the land but the individual to whom the production quota or the claim premia is attached.  Is the transfer of quota rights in relation to ewes restricted within regions we have yet to define?  If so, why?  When another trade is not being distorted, as would occur in the dairy industry if movement was permitted beyond regions, why the need to restrict the transfer of quota rights?  Perhaps there is an explanation but many questions have been asked about that.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about the Common Agricultural Policy implications for tillage farmers.  What agreement will there be about splitting our tillage crops between spring and winter cereals and how will that be handled in this package?  Rotation or set aside will be almost compulsory in this country. What is the official line on that?</P>
    <P>We read that the final legal text will be ready in September.  Is that correct? When will the flag be raised on all the new proposals?  Many of them will not come in until the next full agricultural production year in April of next year, but beyond that what dates are available? Is the Minister worried that we are still getting the same price for Friesian steers as for better quality continental steers? We have never been able to devise a system that rewards quality.  Even with present grading schemes in meat factories, farmers are not rewarded for quality production.  If our grass-based agriculture is to survive against the competition of zero grazed stock on the Continent, particularly with the competitive advantages of continental farmers, we must insist that quality Irish produce is recognised for what it is and that the farmers are rewarded accordingly.</P>
    <P>What have we done wrong?  Why after all the talk about rewarding quality over the years does a Friesian steer still make the same price as the best commercial continental steer?  Something is wrong. We have not got our production and marketing act together.  I would appreciate if the Minister will indicate what plans he has to resolve that problem because quality <Col N="68" /> production will be a key to the success of Irish grass-based production in the years to come, combined with effective marketing.  If we do not marry the two we are going nowhere and we all recognise that.</P>
    <P>Given our track record on marketing procedures I am not confident that we will be able to make up the difference necessary to compensate for the loss of the intervention system quickly enough to ensure a future for Irish farming.  We will need to increase significantly the amount we market directly.  Maybe the Minister has something up his sleeve.  The Culliton report had much to say in this area.  The Minister may have plans to ensure that the marketing arm of our State support structures is sufficiently effective and efficient to resolve problems that will become apparent as we decrease our reliance on intervention over the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed recently that beef cattle steers were not making money now, nor did they last spring.  An R3 steer at 800 pounds carcass weight commanded £1.5 a pound this spring, amounting to £840 gross before the addition of subsidies amounting to £35, bringing the total price for an 800 pound steer to about £875.  According to the tables which detail decreased reliance on intervention over the next three years and rates of compensation to cushion the farmer against price reductions in 1995, a price of 70p a pound will give an equivalent of £560 for an 800 pound steer.  When one adds on premia such as the winter premium, the male beef premium and perhaps the extensification premium amounting to a maximum of £235, the price in the spring of 1995 for an R3 steer will be £795 to the farmer, £80 less than in the spring of 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the farmers lost money in the spring of 1992.  What is in it for farmers when with winter beef premium and even extensification premium which will not apply to many, in three years time with normal increases in the input costs they will be £80 a beast less well off for cattle coming out of the sheds?  I do not know if farmers, particularly <Col N="69" /> beef farmers, have done their sums and realise that an R3 steer of 800 pounds deadweight will be worth £80 less then, even with all the extra supports.</P>
    <P>Is there a future for the Irish beef industry?  I would like the Minister's reaction. These are the plain facts when the small print is analysed and farmers get over the bamboozling they have had in the last few weeks.  I know the Minister will ask what it would have been like without these supports and that is a reasonable point, but if farmers cannot make money this year how will we have a viable industry if that scenario unfolds in three years time?  This is of major concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister regretted the fact that the position on dairy cows was not agreed, which would have been of enormous help to many dairy farmers throughout the country and is sorely missed.  It would have made a huge addition to the success of the package if that could have been achieved.  The Minister did his best without the support of other nations, apart from Luxembourg, in that area.</P>
    <P>I think 712 gallons per cow at the moment is the national average yield. There is much hidden print here where dairy farmers will get caught.  If they do not milk record in years to come and if they produce more than 712 gallons per cow, which the better dairy farmers now do, they will need certification from the Department to be paid for over 712 gallons per cow.  Can the Minister explain the reasons behind this aspect of the Common Agricultural Policy agreement? Is it to ensure that all farmers enter into a national milk recording programme? I would support that, although initially there will be difficulties for small farmers who are not yet suitably equipped.  But is that the ultimate aim?  Will penalties be imposed in the next few years on farmers who are not part of the milk recording system?  Again, the Minister's views on these points would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Whenever I talk on agricultural issues, I think of Brendan Behan's reference. When giving an opinion on Irish agriculture many years ago he said that in Holland agriculture was a science, in <Col N="70" /> England a hobby, and in Ireland a bloody misfortune.  He put if more colourfully than that but parliamentary rules do no allow me to repeat the words he used to describe the Irish misfortune.  We have come a long way since then and are going back a long way.</P>

      <P>What we are debating here today is of prime importance to the future for agriculture in this country.  As I said initially, it will be some time before we play out in practice much of the theory before us.  Problems will emerge as farmers read and get advice on the implications of the reform package, as they apply it to their own situation and as they work through the changes.  I urge all who are interested in agriculture to give serious consideration to this package and I urge Senators who find it amusing that some of us like to put time and thought into contributions on our primary industry not to be so facetious and cynical.  I am prepared to give all the time necessary, and to allow other Senators give all the time necessary to this subject.  I compliment the Leader of the House who has assured us that this debate will continue next week so that every Member of the Seanad who wants to contribute may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a county that has enormous farmer indebtedness.  Their indebtedness to financial institutions is a noose around the necks of Wexford farmers at the <Col N="71" /> moment.  Wexford farmers got into the dairy end of agriculture later than those of other counies, as a result of which when the reference year for the establishment of milk quotas was announced in 1983 many Wexford farmers were still only developing their milk production. Could the Minister, please, indicate whether he is still fighting the cause in Brussels of those farmers who built milk parlours and invested in plant and equipment to build up a 30 to 50 cow herd on the advice of Teagasc and who got caught half-way through their overall development plan to build up their production? Many farmers invested heavily on the basis that they would get a return from 50 or 30 cows, but before they could acquire the full number of cows they were cut-off by the 1983 reference year.  This category of development farmers who were prepared to intensify and to increase efficiency and production, as we asked them to do at the time, should get preferential treatment now because repayments on their loans is crippling their enterprise.  Many of them have been caught in a non-viable situation because they could not develop their quotas as they had planned and as their investment would have justified.  I ask the Minister to look at that category of farmer.</P>
    <P>Given that farmers are the primary guardians of our environment which is often forgotten, and given all the talk about environmentally sensitive areas and environmentally sensitive farming, perhaps we could have an indication as to whether there will be a national scheme, apart from the present pilot schemes to fund farmers in environmentally sensitive areas.  I am talking about ESAs rather than ASIs.  The present pilot schemes are successful; I stand to be corrected on that.  There are many areas in Wexford that would benefit from ESA financial support to ensure that the environment is protected and if as a consequence farmers there are not as efficient or as productive as they might be by using other less environmentally sensitive methods the Government must make up the difference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> The environment is a concern for all of us and we must hand over land to the next generation in as good, if not better, a condition as this generation of farmers inherited it.  Progress on ESAs could indicate when we might step into a national scheme as distinct from the pilot areas designated at the moment.</P>
    <P>This reform package highlights that we can no longer depend on guaranteed prices for stored products and highlights the importance of marketing for the future of our agriculture and food industry. Our track record to date on marketing, despite efforts of Bord Bainne, CBF and various other arms of State, has been lamentable, especially in the light of our intervention history during the last ten years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to ensure a future for grassland production in this country.  Farmers and farming enterprises deserve our support at this most difficult time, when farmers do not know what the future holds, find it difficult to make choices, even more difficult to consider investing and wonder if they can encourage their sons or daughters to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>At this difficult time for farmers there is one area where we can stand above the rest in Europe and demand support, and that is for grass based production because the whole philosophy of the Treaty of Rome that has brought us to where we are today in the European Community was based on concentrating production in areas of natural advantage.  Our natural agricultural advantage is grass.  Much in this reform package militates against grass based production.  Cheaper cereals, maize silage subsidies and our distance from the marketplace will all make it more difficult for Irish farmers with grass based products to compete on a level playing field.  We must reward quality and we must invest heavily in marketing.</P>
    <P>Time will tell whether this is a good package.  Some of the euphoric reaction to it was premature and ill judged.  Some of the comments of the prophets of doom were premature and ill judged too.  Only time will tell whether this very complicated and important reform package <Col N="73" /> will protect Irish family farms and commercial farmers.  Only time will tell whether this present generation will be the last generation of farmers who got a chance and whether there will be any future for our sons and daughters on the land.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy M. Ahern to the House.  I think it is his first time here for a debate like this and I wish him every success in his Ministry of Science and Technology, an area from which farming and agriculture in general have benefited over the years and I am sure that as more science and technology is made available to us agriculture will benefit in the years ahead also.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his negotiating team on the successful outcome of the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The outcome is better than expected and due in no small part to the leadership given by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and to his knowledge of the needs of Irish agriculture at this critical time.  When the original proposals were aired shock waves went through Irish agriculture because the proposals were not at all favourable.  If they had been accepted, those proposals would have succeeded in putting many family farms out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new agreement provides considerable benefits for both producers and consumers and presents farmers and the food industry with an opportunity to penetrate into and compete in an expanding market of some 340 million consumers. <Col N="74" /> Senator Doyle highlighted many of the problems arising from this new deal, and many of the questions to be answered and there is no need for me to repeat them.  There are always problems initiating new proposals but I am sure they can be sorted out in the near future.</P>
    <P>We will have to develop new markets which we neglected to do in the past relying too heavily on intervention.  We must capitalise on our image as producers of good wholesome food produced in a clean environment.  We can compete with the best in Europe.  A noticeable feature of this deal is that it has produced a framework for reducing prices to consumers without lowering incomes for farmers.  This should help the Irish food industry.  The Minister in the course of his contribution set out his priorities during those negotiations, and I agree with them.  They were the need to ensure that policy was modified in such a way as to give a more concrete expression to the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy laid down in the Rome Treaty, to protect the role of agriculture as the most important sector of the Irish economy &mdash; we cannot stress this often enough &mdash; to safeguard the income of farmers, to promote policy options which would result in the maintenance of the maximum number of family farms in the land, to protect the vital commercial element of our agricultural industry, to prevent discrimination against grass based extensive methods of production, to secure adequate and lasting budgetary resources and to seek to ensure that any reform package agreed would be secure in the context of an agreement under GATT.  The last priority is important when we consider the negotiations we will be faced with in the near future.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will hold on to what we have been granted, that there will be no change in what the Minister has negotiated and that American negotiators will not tell us that the subsidies paid to our farmers will have to be reduced further. I hope that will not happen because the Minister has negotiated a good deal.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed uncertainty in farming circles for the past two years or <Col N="75" /> so and it is good to see an end to this. Now farmers can plan their enterprise knowing the future shape of support and premium arrangements.  Farm incomes will be stabilised and the contribution of the agriculture and food industry to the well being of our national economy will continue and may even improve in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>On the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package, producers will derive a greater percentage of their incomes from direct payments and they will see a more equitable distribution of the community's resources among producers than in the recent past.  As a result of the negotiations, direct payments, headage and premia to Irish farmers will increase by £340 million to exceed £620 million per year.  Farmers can now react positively by increasing their productivity and will also benefit from a much more market led approach which will be adopted by the processing sector.  Among the sectors that will benefit under this new reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be the beef sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the premia to be paid to producers of steers over the next number of years.  While the intervention price for cattle will be reduced by 15 per cent in three stages beginning in 1992, the premium will compensate producers and at the same time tackle the long-standing seasonality problem.</P>
    <P>As anybody who has been involved in Irish agriculture knows, seasonability has been a problem for beef producers for many years. We have all witnessed the stampede at marts and at factories in November, December and January, the months in which farmers are usually marketing their cattle.  Farmers had to be out on the road, sometimes at 2 a.m. in order to take their place in the queue at the mart or at the factory.  I hope these changes will put an end to that problem. Farmers may in future be paid up to £237 in premia on their cattle compared with the present £35.  That is a great improvement and should help the farmers to <Col N="76" /> produce good quality cattle.  We have the best land and environment in the world for producing good quality beef, and I see no reason our farmers would not do so under this new scheme.</P>
    <P>BAC, or angel dust as it is more commonly known, has been a problem in the past.  We should continue to be very vigilant, because some cowboys are prepared to take chances and this will give the beef industry a bad name.  I do not want to see that happen.  BAC problems led to a reduction in the consumption of beef in the past and I do not want to see that happen again.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there has been an improvement in the Middle East market?  The Middle East was a great market for our cattle up to the time of the Iraq War.  I wonder if there has been any improvement in those markets, and what is the situation now.</P>
    <P>There is a vast improvement in the suckler cow premium and many people will take advantage of this scheme &mdash; an increase from £52 to £150, a remarkable increase.  I hope this will not lead to a recurrence of the situation which arose some years ago when we had so many scrub bulls.  I do not know what controls are in force in that area, but I hope farmers going into this scheme will be vigilant and will aim at producing a quality animal that is easily sold at the market or to the factory or wherever, and for which they will get the best price.  I hope they will not go into the scheme for the sake of grabbing the few handy pounds and flooding the market with inferior cattle. That would be a total loss.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning the main features of this package of reform measures which the Minister has negotiated.  The terms negotiated for the milk quota system are very good compared to the original proposals. Our policy should be to aim to safeguard the basic principles of the existing quota system and ensure that the other major producing countries adhere to similar restraints.  That is very important because we know we are not the biggest blackguards in this area.  It is the factory farms which create many of the problems.  Any quota surpluses should be <Col N="77" /> given to smaller producers.  It is important that the support mechanism at present in place be maintained particularly since we export 75 per cent of our dairy products.  Export refunds ensure a viable return from our exports to Third World countries.  The value of the export refunds currently represents about 64 per cent and 41 per cent of the return on butter and skim milk powder, respectively. Any reduction in the value of the export refunds would, therefore, have serious consequences for commodity prices and producer returns in the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>This situation in Eastern Europe is having an adverse effect on the dairy industry because cheaper dairy products are available on the markets there.  There is a great urgency for our dairy industry to rationalise its processing capacity into more efficient units and to reduce dependency on commodity products.</P>
    <P>The take up this year by Irish butter of over 50 per cent of total Community purchases into intervention highlights our dependence on the intervention mechanism and shows that we are completely out of step with our fellow Community members.  Fundamental restructuring is required in the dairy industries in order to eliminate the cost penalties which result from excess capacity and to provide the optimum conditions for diversification of our product portfolio.  This has often been talked about in the past, but very little has been done about it.  The long term success of the dairy industry will depend on how the challenges can be overcome.  I believe that our dairy industry can meet that challenge and compete successfully with our competitors in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to have more information on some of the new items in this agreement. One of those is the retirement scheme, 75 per cent of which will be funded by the EC and will improve the rate of land transfer to younger farmers while adequately providing for the security of the farmers willing to participate.  I understand this scheme will now operate between father and son or father and daughter, whereas the old scheme did <Col N="78" /> not apply to transfers within the family circle.  That is a major breakthrough.  We should all be glad to see it because there has been a tendency in this country for farmers to hold on to their land and, in some cases, the transfer to their sons or daughters took place very late in life. This scheme will be a good move but I would like to have more information on it, to see how it works.  I am sure the Minister will supply us with that information as soon as it becomes available to him.</P>
    <P>At the outset, in all those schemes, there is always confusion when it comes to filling in application forms and so on. I hope the application forms will be simple so that everybody will be able to understand them, because, in recent years we have had the problem of farmers not being able to fill in application forms, making mistakes and then being disqualified from receiving grants.  I do not want to see that happen on this occasion. Full use should be made of the Teagasc offices to ensure that farmers and farmers' representatives are briefed on the complexities of these application forms to make sure farmers understand them. That will be helpful to the Department in processing those applications.  There will be less confusion and dissatisfaction and everybody will be much happier.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his team on a job well done. We will look forward to seeing the implementation of those new Common Agricultural Policy proposals which he has negotiated for us.  I am sure that Irish agriculture and the food industry in general will benefit from all those proposals in the years ahead.</P>

    <P>In relation to the Minister's speech, the best was kept until the end.  He seemed to be turning philosophical in the last few lines of his script when he talked of it being impossible to please some of the people any of the time.  This is true.  I sincerely hope that statement arises from <Col N="79" /> reflection on political matters rather than from an exhaustion from them.</P>
    <P>When he left aside his script and began to speak off the cuff, he also referred to very interesting matters.  He spoke of the responses which the Department of Agriculture and Food now proposes to make to the new era and new realities we are facing.  In many ways that is really the question: what can be done?  If there is to be worthwhile change then we must reorientate our whole approach to agriculture and our commitment to quality and to markets but from what I heard earlier in this debate I do not see any great evidence that that will happen.</P>
    <P>The debate so far seems to have been centred around the problems of farmers, the price of bullocks and the difficulties of cereal farmers.  I do not want to diminish those things, they are of considerable significance.  The number of farmers is getting smaller and smaller, agriculture continues to be a declining segment of the economy even if it is still a very important one and unless we can bring ourselves to think realistically in terms of developing the food industry, the situation will continue to worsen.</P>
    <P>Quite simply, our record in relation to the food industry has been abysmal.  The changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, particularly in relation to intervention, can be expected to create a beneficial stimulus in relation to the food industry, but we have a long way to go. Considerable expense and effort will be required in order to develop a competitive industry on an international scale.  The Culliton report is not particularly optimistic.</P>
    <P>There are matters that must be faced immediately.  We must begin to encourage consolidation in the dairy industry. Senator Hussey spoke about that and I agree with what he said.  It is absolutely essential that the main co-ops should be consolidated.  There is room for perhaps three major co-operatives in this country and indeed the number which will be viable in the longer term may be rather less than that.  That is the type of capacity and scale we are talking about if this <Col N="80" /> country is to be able to develop a food industry which will be able to put products onto the European and world markets and to have those products clearly identifiable as Irish.</P>
    <P>In relation to Irish food on the European market, the reality is that it is simply not there.  It does not exist.  There are no worthwhile, serious, Irish food products in Europe and anyone who doubts that for a second has only to go into supermarkets in Europe and look for some Irish branded products.  You certainly will not find Denny's sausages or other Irish-made sausages there.  We have failed abysmally to put those products on the market.  I do not want to diminish the difficulties of doing that, but we just have not been rating.  The only way we can do so is by consolidation, particularly in relation to the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>The meat industry is an entirely different matter.  As far as that is concerned we are at square one; perhaps we are not even at square one, but in a terrible minus sitution.  As far as the meat industry in this country is concerned, things can only get better.  We seem to have bottomed out and I cannot visualise how things could get worse.</P>
    <P>We have had the abuse of angel dust. We have had the apparently never-ending saga of the Beef Tribunal and the awful things which are being revealed there, meat industry leaders chasing around hotels and offices in middle eastern capitals following Irish Ministers and trying to pin them down.  That is not the behaviour of a serious meat industry.  We sometimes lead ourselves into the illusion of thinking that this industry will be able to compete on international markets. Nothing could be further from the truth. This belongs to the Stone Age era.  It is absolutely dreadful.</P>
    <P>During the past two weeks we have had the cucumber poison incident. Cucumbers had to be taken from the supermarket shelves in this country.  I do not want to pretend that accidents cannot happen but after a fortnight, we still do not seem to have fully tracked down the cause of the trouble.  We still cannot establish, with certainty, the origin of <Col N="81" /> these cucumbers.  The most elementary forms of quality food assurance would have allowed us, in the first place, to track down the source of those poisonous cucumbers.  If we were even half serious in our effort to preserve our image as a producer of quality foods, we would have cracked the analytical problems of sorting out the toxic materials in these substances. If the report which apparently was given by the Minister in the other House yesterday, which was to the effect that these cucumbers were contaminated by a chemical which is used in their production, is true then it is appalling that we have not been able to identify that problem in a fortnight.</P>
    <P>These are the realities of the Irish food industry.  The Americans refer to &ldquo;cognitive restructuring&rdquo; in relation to football teams that were not playing well. There is a very great need for some cognitive restructuring in relation to the whole Irish food industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke about the necessity to reward people who produce quality products.  I could not agree more.  We have failed to do that.  We have certainly failed to put quality as a premium.  We continue to talk about it but, when you get down to brass tacks most people simply do not appear to be interested. They seem to believe there are short-cuts around everything and you can somehow talk your way out of every problem.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Hussey had to say about the difficulties of seasonality. At one time there was a 12:1 ratio between the peak output and the minimal output of milk in this country.  That may be all right for farmers, but it creates dreadful problems for people who are trying to process that milk efficiently because it requires enormously unnecessary expense in a plant to cope with the peaks, whereas if production could be at an even level throughout the whole year it would be easier.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, as far as the Common Agricultural Policy and farmers are concerned, it is quite simply a matter of damage limitation.  It is a matter of prolonging the agony.  Things will get worse.  The present package will create <Col N="82" /> very serious difficulties for cereal farmers and, while the effects on the dairy and beef farmers are not so significant, they are indicative of the shape of things to come.  We are now getting into quotas. That, in turn, means that we will limit our output and unless we are prepared to change radically, which I can see little sign of, then that means we will have great problems.</P>
    <P>As for the &ldquo;cheque in the post,&rdquo; I am not particularly impressed about the viability of this in the longer term.  I do not believe that such subsidisation will continue.  There are very serious problems in Europe.  On television any night you can see people involved in a terrible war in what used to be Yugoslavia.  Those problems will inevitably work their way into the centre of Europe.  They will work their way through the system and will create demands and pressure on the money that is available.  In the longer term I cannot see that money being available for countries such as Ireland by means of cheques in the post.  That whole system will be whittled away.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned Teagasc and I am glad he did, because Teagasc seems to be one of the forgotten aspects of the farming industry.  It is being pulled apart.  It has been at the receiving end of a winding down process.  Morale was first of all sapped and then the resources were taken away.  We are doing all this in the belief that we should develop quality products and the development of quality products must ultimately be centred around developments in technology and the capacity to master it.</P>
    <P>How can we expect to do that while, at the same time, we are winding down the basic technological support for the agriculture and food industries.  Let nobody tell me that Teagasc is not demoralised.  The people I met in the headquarters in Sandymount Avenue, are waiting for the axe to fall, wondering if they will finish up in one of the western centres, be landed in Fermoy or, dare I say it, become part of the new Environmental Protection Agency headquarters which Senator Doyle has informed us should be located in Wexford, and I am <Col N="83" /> sure she is pushing ahead to see that that becomes a reality.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not make much reference to the benefits which the changes will bring for consumers.  I am glad he did not, because that seems to be based on an acknowledgement of the reality that the benefits will be trivial, and will be so in the longer term.  There is not much in this package of reforms for Irish consumers.  Above all I would hope that what has happened would create a stimulus and a drive among people, particularly the farming elements and those in the food industry, to recognise that the way we are going really does not have a future.  We must start thinking in terms of developing products and getting them on markets.  That is expensive and difficult to do.  Our history and the behaviour which is now being exposed in the Beef Tribunal should leave nobody in any doubt about the enormous hills and mountains we have to cross.</P>

      <P>They are not a vegetable to which I have an attachment.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform package which we are discussing is profoundly important because it will create a change in direction in Irish agriculture and farming.  It will be a change in direction of a magnitude we have not seen since our original decision to join the Community in 1972.  This House must give it careful and detailed consideration because it represents a very fundamental change.</P>
      <P>It provides us with a challenge and a great opportunity to advance on the agricultural front and try to capture those markets which we have all talked about in this House and elsewhere over many years.  In almost every debate since I entered this House we have mentioned the potential, which I do not question, for our food industry to capture markets. It will now be up to us to deliver because intervention &mdash; the cushion for the food industry for the past 20 years &mdash; will recede into the background and the market will make the decisions.  It is a very selective and demanding market place.</P>
      <P>A very aggressive, national and positive response is needed to cope with the challenges being presented to us.</P>
      <P>It is obvious, and has been for some time, that we could no longer tolerate a situation where increasing quantities of food added to mountains which were building in intervention stores throughout the Community.  That was not sustainable and had to be changed. Irrespective of one's perspective on the nature of the reform, it was inconceivable that that situation could continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the reform package on the numbers leaving the land is open to question.  I am not sure that the trend which has existed for many years, prior to our entry and subsequent to our entry into the European Community, will be discontinued.  I am not optimistic that one of the objectives of the reform package, which is to keep people in rural areas, <Col N="85" /> living on their farms, will be sustained.  I have doubt about that.  I am not sure that trend can be reversed.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.  I hope a stop can be put to that flight from the land which in recent years has been of the order of 11 people a day.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers who complimented the Minister and particularly, his staff on the package which has emerged from Brussels.  It is radically different from that originally put forward by Commissioner MacSharry.  That needs to be said because there appears to be some confusion about that: the package is totally different.  Its objectives are the same as the original presented by the Commissioner, but its detail is very different. Instead of the big reductions in national incomes we heard about, most independent observers say we can expect a benefit of about £70 million from the package.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>If we look back to the consternation created outside Dromoland Castle when Commissioner MacSharry announced a 35 per cent reduction in prices across the board, we realize this package is far from that original proposal.  This package represents a very significant political victory for Commissioner MacSharry.  At the outset, many people would have said his chances of seeing this package through were minimal.  Irrespective of whether one welcomes the package or decries it, the significance of his political victory within the Commission is great.  From that point of view, his tenacity is to be admired.  I hope that when we advance to GATT he will be able to restrain his colleague, Commissioner Andriessen as well as he has managed to have his objectives carried through.</P>
    <P>The first objective of the reform package is to reduce surpluses.  That objective is likely to be achieved because it puts restraints on the amount of land that can be devoted to a particular enterprise and the amount of produce that can be produced on farms.  It could be contended that the food mountains are not significant, because if one looked at what might be required in terms of a strategic reserve of food within the Community, <Col N="86" /> we have 60 days supply, or perhaps a little more.  That is not much of a cushion to have behind us in the event of a natural catastrophe.  It must also be said that the morality of having so much food in intervention stores, while large parts of the world are starving, is questionable. Maybe the Community has not given a great deal of thought to that idea.  Perhaps what is happening in Rio de Janeiro will awaken world consciousness to some of these matters.</P>
    <P>The other policy objective must be to protect farm incomes and to a significant degree that has been achieved.  Whether the production of farm incomes is consistent with keeping people on the land is another question, but compared to the original proposals farm incomes have been protected.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the national benefits that will follow from beef and suckler premia.  I do not dispute that there will be advantages, but they will merely compensate for income lost through price reductions.  From that point of view the position of a farmer's income is fairly neutral.</P>
    <P>As a cereal producer I worked out the consequences for me as a farmer and discovered that my income will be reduced.  If I were the national average farmer producing the national average yield in the typical field in a region, in 1995-96 my situation would be exactly the same as it is today.  However, if I were producing yields well above the national average, the fact that the compensation is based on average yields means that I would lose out, whereas people at the bottom end of the scale would gain.  I will deal later with how we can devise a system whereby, as far as possible, producers will be treated equally.  It may not be possible to treat all producers equally; nevertheless, we must endeavour to do so.</P>
    <P>The third objective of the Common Agricultural Policy reform is to make production more market-led and I believe that will be achieved.  Intervention is increasingly becoming closed off as a market of first choice.  Produce will be forced on to an open market <Col N="87" /> where the consumer will make the choice.  From that point of view this objective has been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The fourth objective of the policy is to ensure that the consumer will benefit and I agree with some of what Senator Upton said in that regard.  It is questionable whether the consumer will benefit to any significant degree down the line.  Cheaper food prices should benefit the consumer but history teaches us that as food prices decrease the price of labour, energy and all the other inputs associated with producing an added value product increases, so the net benefit is reduced.</P>
    <P>On a basic food commodity such as bread I would expect the consumer to benefit.  One of the difficulties in the past was that consumers abroad benefited from our export policy but the improvements in the package have alleviated some of my concerns about the original package.</P>
    <P>There is a change in direction from supporting the product unit price to giving direct income support to farmers and that is welcome.  We know that in supporting the unit price a great deal of the money which was intended to end up in farmers' pockets ended up in other people's pockets; the beef processors, the middle men and others reaped the benefits rather than the primary producer.  I welcome the fact that direct payments to farmers will be improved instead of using money to fill intervention stores and give benefits to people who should not receive them from the system.</P>
    <P>It is also important to distinguish between the effect of the package on the farming sector and its effect on the food industry.  They are two separate elements and considerable time has been spent during the debate dealing with the effect of the package on the farming community. I would not contest those effects but there are different effects for the food industry.  The package will make life in the food industry more difficult, competitive and market-led.  We will have to face up to the realities of this competitive marketplace which will be ruled by consumer choice.  That is the big issue which <Col N="88" /> the Government and the country will have to address over the next few years as the effects of the package sink in.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties about giving premia to livestock farmers is that there is a tendency on the part of the farmer receiving the premium to go to the livestock market and discount the premium by putting it into the market.  The national benefit will remain if extra money comes from outside, but the distribution of the national benefit then becomes highly questionable.  Again, some of the people who are the primary target for the benefit may not be the beneficiaries.  The benefits may go to cattle tanglers or other producers in the chain.  That is a reality and we have to put up with it.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns in regard to the package is the competitiveness of our grass-based production.  Much of the compensation to the livestock sector is predicated on reducing cereal prices by 29 per cent and transferring that benefit to those who are feeding grain to livestock. That puts us at a disadvantage because we feed far lower quantities of grain to livestock than our European competitors.  At the beginning of the debate on Common Agricultural Policy reform, Pat O'Neill, the general Manager of Avonmore, made the point that if prices were to decline in the cereal sector of the order of 30 per cent the benefit to the French milk producer would be approximately twice that to Irish milk producers.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall the era of barley beef when the livestock at that time was produced in the east of England in huge industrial type feed lots because that was where the cheap grain was.  There must be some concerns on the part of Irish agriculture that that type of situation could develop again, that we could find ourselves in a position where intensive livestock production is based where the grain is produced, in the Paris Basin, the East Anglia and in other parts of continental Europe.  However, there are offsetting factors in that regard which have not been mentioned and they are to do with our green image, the fact that we <Col N="89" /> have a production which is environmentally friendly which is based on grass production and which, if it is marketed properly, should be able to enjoy a price premium.  However, that is a bigger question and is one we are going to have to address over the next few years.  The competitive position of grass-based production in other countries continues to be a worry particularly, as was mentioned earlier, the subsidisation of maize silage to French intensive livestock producers. However, there are offsetting factors.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for us are well known.  There is a market on our doorstep in the Europe of 350 million people. After January 1993 goods and services will be able to move freely within that market and that presents us with the opportunity side of the reform package equation.  It is unquestionable that the opportunities are there.  If we looked at Ireland as Ireland plc. and set ourselves the objective of penetrating a market of 350 million people, we would surely regard it as a minimum achievement to be able to get 1 per cent of that market. If we were to secure an additional 1 per cent of that consumer market, the benefits to this country would be incalculable.</P>
    <P>We spoke earlier about the Maastricht Treaty and Denmark's position.  Denmark is one of the more prosperous countries in the European Community and was founded on the basis of producing for a large European market.  Denmark is a model in that respect.  That is the direction to which we will have to look. I do not think it is the Government's responsibility to sell the produce of the farms of Ireland.  We did that once with the wheat hoard when we sold produce to the Government and then it was up to the Government to dispose of it.  That is not the case in this instance, but the Government must assist those who are prepared to go out and sell their produce on the competitive market and in the new competitive environment which is thrust upon us.</P>
    <P>There will be a demand within that market for natural foods, foods we can represent as being of the highest quality. <Col N="90" /> We have the capacity to do that, but the people who use products like angel dust must be told in no uncertain terms about the damage their greed is doing to their farming colleagues.  They must know that in this competitive environment there are people who will use every opportunity to undermine the image of Irish produce &mdash; that is being done calculatedly in the British tabloid press and elsewhere &mdash; there are people who want their share of the market and are prepared to use any means at their disposal to undermine the competitiveness of Irish produce.  The challenge is to be competitive, and how we can be competitive.</P>
    <P>I want to speak on the second part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform agenda &mdash; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  As we move on to that agenda we are in a position to argue consistently that what we have done in terms of Common Agricultural Policy reform makes it easier for us to reach an agreement within GATT.  The most critical aspect of the GATT talks from an Irish point of view is to have the income support measures and the compensation put into the so called green box; that cannot be underestimated as an objective because under the GATT rules it has been accepted that income support will fit into GATT.  In other words, when they are calculating these things called aggregate measures of support &mdash; which measure what one country gives to its industry compared to another &mdash; provided they do not distort the market, they can be left to one side.  This will be a critical factor from an Irish and European point of view.  If the compensation is to be permanent &mdash; and that has been a repeated call from the farming organisations; they have reservations about the permanency of the compensation &mdash; the only way to achieve that is to ensure that it is left to one side when GATT is calculating how we support our agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the question of national distortions and how countries even within a Community which is about to embark upon an open, free, even market, can use domestic support measures to give disproportionate advantages <Col N="91" /> to its own agricultural industries; the VAT refund is a classic example of that, in Germany and Italy there are VAT refunds of the order of 11 and 12 per cent, many times more than farmers are paying in VAT.  Our Government must at every opportunity highlight these national distortions that are preventing us from competing on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>We will have to become less dependent on intervention, which in one respect, will be very useful to us.  It has generated within us as an agricultural society a dependency mentality, that all we have to do is to produce and then put the produce into intervention.  The fact that we will not have that outlet any longer will be a positive help in focusing our minds on what we will have to do to secure the necessary markets to sell our produce.  I am not criticising people for using intervention in the past.</P>
    <P>If the dairy industry, the co-operatives, the beef barons and the processors had intervention as their most profitable market, they used it.  They are dictated by commercial considerations, just like anybody else.  That led us to the point where reform was required.  It is the responsibility of Government to assist the drive on overseas markets.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the recommendations in the Culliton report which I hope will be advanced so that food industry can develop.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister came home with this reform package the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association have been consistently telling us how terrible it is for dairy farmers.  I understand there are difficulties for farmers as a result of this package but we have to get over this dog in the manager attitude and this knee jerk reaction.  I have not heard anybody at any stage offer an alternative to the reform package in its broad terms.  There were arguments about detail and I would have subscribed to those arguments but nobody at any stage said that agricultural reform should not take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, I appreciate your protection.  In general terms, there were differences of emphasis but everybody agreed something had to be done.  Something has been done which is far less painful than what was originally proposed.  Now we have this consistent attack on the reform package without proposing alternatives.  The point that needs to be made is that it is now in place and we must live with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will we do now to ensure that Irish farmers continue to live on the land of Ireland and sell their food on the overseas markets?  Common Agricultural Policy reform and Maastricht have nothing to do with one another.  Any farmer who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package must not use that as an excuse on 18 June to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty.  The Common Agricultural Policy was instituted long before the Maastricht Treaty.  There is one reference to the Common Agricultural Policy in Article 3 (e) of the Treaty: &ldquo;a common policy in the sphere of agriculture and fisheries;&rdquo;.  Title XIV &mdash; Economic and Social Cohesion &mdash; Articles 130a and 130b of the Treaty speaks about reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions, including rural areas.  That is the only reference to the Common Agricultural Policy in the Maastricht Treaty.  As I said, anybody who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package must not use that as an excuse to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 18 June.  They are two totally separate issues and they should not be confused but there is confusion in some farming circles about that matter. On that score we can argue that if the Community's objectives under the Treaty about cohesion are to be consistent, <Col N="93" /> it must look to supporting agriculture within the Structural Funds through other means, through the LEADER Programme and through the type of initiative of which the Minister is aware in his own constituency.  These are the vehicles which must be advanced in terms of bringing that cohesion under Maastricht to fruition.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle dealt in detail with the individual enterprises and there is no need to go into that in any detail but I want to talk about the cereals regime and how the average reference yield will be arrived at.  There is a suggestion that there will be an average yield for winter cereals and for spring cereals.  If the distortions about which I spoke earlier in respect of the high and low yielding farmers are to be eliminated so that each group does not gain at the expense of the other, then each crop must have a reference yield.  In other words there is a reference yield for winter wheat, spring wheat, winter barley, spring barley, and so on.  I strongly recommend that in working out the detail of the package over the coming months the Minister and his colleagues try as far as possible to eliminate those distortions by the measure I have advocated.</P>
    <P>The matter of reference yield will be crucial in terms of the compensation which will be available to cereal growers. A multiplier will be used to work out the compensation; there is the reference yield and there are the standard payments which will vary yearly over the next three years.  It is crucial that the reference yield will be of a significant size to give compensation to average producers and to cereal producers in general and this must be sorted out quickly.  If I am going to make decisions as a cereal grower about what crops I grow next autumn I will have to make decisions in July or August of this year.  Therefore, there is an urgency about working out the detail of those figures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the quotas will be the property of the producers rather than the landowners.  It is right that people who have invested in livestock <Col N="94" /> and developed their farms should be allowed to operate efficiently.</P>
    <P>What can we do to advance the industry in the context of the reform?  Certain measures can be taken at domestic level to bring us to the point where we can exploit the markets about which we have spoken.  The obvious one is tuberculosis in livestock which must be tackled.  We can argue on another occasion when discussing payments for livestock on the TB scheme as to how that should be dealt with.  Animal health and mastitis must be given priority.  As Senator Upton stated, we cannot over emphasise the need for proper research and development to back up the industry, particularly as the marketplace will now dictate the choice.  No commercial enterprise or large food company would go to the market with their produce without adequate research and development.  There is a lack of commitment to research and development in the agriculture and farming sectors here. It has been eroded over the years and it is now on its knees.  My plea to the Minister is to rectify that situation because it is the only base on which we can build for the future.  We need the expertise which will allow us to develop our products and allow farmers to avail of the technology they will need in their fight for survival over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In response to the Common Agricultural Policy reform package it is fundamental that we have adequate research and development.  We have talked about our image and the fact that our food industry will benefit from our green environmentally friendly agricultural sector.  I believe it can; there is a growing market in Europe and elsewhere for products at that nature.  Those who indulge in illegal practices must be sorted out because such practices have nothing to do with advancing our market share.</P>
    <P>If we were to go beyond that point we would then get to the stage of having some kind of quality assurance.  A quality assurance scheme operates for our liv-stock trade, but I would go beyond the point where the factories are the arbiters of quality.  An independent body should be set up to establish quality parameters <Col N="95" /> which would put the stamp of approval on Irish beef, butter and so on, stating that we stand over this product which will sell on any market, that we are confident it is the right quality product for the market.</P>
    <P>We should then consider codes of good practice for environmentally friendly products &mdash; not that most of our production is not environmentally friendly; it is &mdash; within which most commercial farmers can operate and the food industry survive and which establishes nationally the quality of our produce.  I recommend to the Minister that a national development board for the food industry be established.  There was a reference to this in the Culliton report and it should be seriously considered.  I also recommend the establishment of a council for rural development.  This is an area close to the Minister's heart.  It is unquestionable that under the Structural Funds more money will be devoted to that area, therefore, there should be a formalised system to regulate that side of the business.</P>
    <P>There should be a national development plan and the establishment of a national development board as advocated in the Culliton report, to give direction to the industry.  There should be properly funded research and advisory backup at production and processing level and there must be adequate State investment in research and development if producers' incomes and competitiveness in the industry are to be maintained.  The food industry have a responsibility to make their own contribution to establishing Ireland's reputation for reliable, high quality produce on international markets and their standard must be as high as those they demand from the suppliers to the industry.</P>
    <P>I share the general disquiet about the duration and cost of inquiries into the food industry, but that does not mean they are not necessary.  They are necessary; that money would be well spent if it were to contribute to establishing the authenticity of the quality of the produce <Col N="96" /> we export.  Some people in our society advocate a sort of conspiracy of silence on inquiries of this nature and the use of material like angel dust.</P>
    <P>They believe we should not talk in public about illegal growth promoters or the use of illegal substances as it is damaging our industry.  It is quite the reverse. To establish the quality of our produce, it is necessary to highlight these practices and to root them out.  The codes of practice for production and processing could be used to reinforce the reputation of our food industry both domestically and on our export markets.</P>
    <P>In respect of organic products, a certification system would add to the market strength of our green image.  I realise organic growers follow a procedure for establishing the veracity of produce but that could be built on.  One of the difficulties with organic farming &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is aware of this &mdash; is that in the three to four year period required to transfer from being a conventional farmer to an organic farmer, it is extremely difficult to maintain income because the volume of production drops but the price does not increase to compensate. A system should be devised to allow people to transfer from orthodox commercial production to organic production without incurring a financial penalty. Scandinavia operates such a system; therefore there is no reason it could not be done here and it would not be very costly.</P>
    <P>In February 1991 the Progressive Democrats issued a discussion document on Common Agricultural Policy reform.  We started talking about reform as far back as 1991 and my main concern at that time was that commercial farmers would be so disadvantaged they would give up and go back to low levels of production. I am happy to say that the fears I had in that respect have been greatly allayed by the final package from Brussels.  In the case of cereal growers, one of the huge disadvantages they would have had was a 230 tonne ceiling on cereal production and obviously any reasonably commercial cereal grower would be at a <Col N="97" /> major disadvantage.  I very much welcome the fact that the ceiling has been removed and that the livestock headages have been adjusted upwards, so that at least the commercial producers, who will be the basis of the dairy and beef industry will be able to operate successfully.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Urban Renewal Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reply to some of the specific points I will make. I know that the procedure is that the Minister has a script.  This makes it rather difficult sometimes when one is speaking in the knowledge that what Minister often say is pre-written before they have heard what is going to be said.  Therefore, I ask him to reply specifically to some of the points which I will make.</P>
      <P>In moving this Adjournment motion, I am well aware of the fact, having been in touch with the Department, that the urban renewal scheme will cease in May 1993.  Thus, there is a particular urgency about this proposal, because obviously it would have to be executed before that date.  County Wicklow is particularly neglected in this area of urban renewal.  It has been deprived while, at its expense, Dublin has benefited.  I do not know, if I was making a political point, whether I could say that County Wicklow has suffered because it has no Minister in the area and as a result, this scheme has not been extended to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people throughout the country, not just in County Wicklow, or in Bray or in Wicklow town, often ask why Dublin has benefited so enormously from the tax incentives which are available under the urban renewal scheme.  I have a clear memory of the Temple Bar scheme <Col N="98" /> and the tax concessions made when that scheme was launched last year.  While there may be great virtue in that scheme, it certainly staggered those who heard it because of the extent of the concessions and the incentives given to an area which is not particularly deprived, and certainly was not deprived or neglected to the same extent that some areas of Wicklow town and Bray in County Wicklow have been neglected.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Department could provide me with figures on the cost benefit of an urban renewal scheme and the cost to the Exchequer.  Many of the reasons given by the Department for not extending this scheme to certain areas is because it would cost the Exchequer too much money.  It is very difficult to calculate because to some extent you are calculating a negative but presumably their decisions are based on economic considerations. I would be very grateful if I could have a figure on what this costs in certain areas and what the Exchequer believes it will benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>Bray, County Wicklow, is a town which is in dire need of a commercial lift.  It has suffered more than any of the Dublin areas in recent times for many reasons which I will go into very briefly. Businesses in the town have been closing; shops have been closing; unemployment is continuing to rise, it is now above the 4,000 level and is continually above the national average.  The Minister may well say that Bray has already been granted certain urban renewal concessions. Indeed, the Maltings down to the bridge, the Town Hall and the International Leisure Bowl have all benefited.  They have all been given this concession already but it is a drop in the ocean in comparison with what Bray needs.</P>
    <P>Bray needs a commercial lift.  At the moment it is a very depressed town.  Day after day one hears tales of closures not only of businesses but of shops and of rising unemployment.  I do not believe that is merely due to the introduction of the by-pass in recent months which may, indeed, have adversely affected business for the past few months.  There is a far more fundamental problem in that Bray <Col N="99" /> has been badly planned and good planning is necessary if it is to develop as a prosperous suburb.  The town needs a kick-start.  It badly needs a boost to employment prospects.  It badly needs more industry.  It badly needs the urban renewal scheme which would obviously provide the sort of injection that Bray needs at this moment.  What has already been granted is minor.  While we are grateful for it we need a good deal more if the town is to benefit in the way it should.</P>
    <P>I would like to come to Wicklow town because this town does not benefit at all from the urban renewal scheme.  Wicklow town has a chronic unemployment problem.  It is ideally suited for the urban renewal scheme.  It has a large number of very small industries in little pockets. Rather than being dependent on one large industry as are some Irish towns, it has many small industries in little pockets and that would make it ideal for designing certain areas for industry and giving tax concessions.</P>
    <P>Wicklow town is geographically placed in a situation where the South Quay would also be ideal for designation for the urban renewal scheme.  Again, Wicklow town has applied for such designation in the past with a very comprehensive presentation to the Department but it was not accepted.  The South Quay would be ideal because it has access to the port and it has the infrastructure to support it.  Wicklow town also has a large and disproportionate number of derelict sites.  It is very difficult to know how many, but it is as many as 70 at the moment, which are ideally suited for this action and scheme.  This is one of the reasons the scheme was introduced, that derelict sites could be utilised.  It was disappointing to the urban council in Wicklow town that in the past when they made an application it was turned down. They felt, as I feel, that Wicklow town because of its geography and its layout, and because of the way it is planned, would be absolutely ideal for this scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with Wicklow town is that it has huge potential for <Col N="100" /> developing industry.  It has a growing population which is, unfortunately, not matched by an increase in business in the town.  It has a huge commuter population but while that population lives there it comes to Dublin to do its spending.  As a result, many of those who live there do not spend money which would benefit the town.  I am suggesting to the Minister that if we developed industry by giving this injection to Bray and Wicklow the wealth earned in Wicklow, instead of being spent elsewhere, would be channelled into Wicklow town.  The spin-off effect for both towns would be enormous in the area of unemployment and shopping and consumer spending.  Instead of being neglected, deprived towns, which they are, while Dublin is benefiting, they would be vibrant, living and prosperous areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for the opportunity to respond here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Many of us have witnessed physical decay and economic and social decline in parts of our inner cities and towns. Peripheral locations have, in the past, attracted both businesses and people away from the inner core areas leaving behind derelict sites, run-down and unused buildings and a disappearing community.  This, in turn, reinforces the perception that such areas have become bad risk areas for private investment.</P>
      <P>It was to redress such decline that the urban renewal scheme was introduced. Through a generous package of taxation incentives and rates relief for new and reconstruction works in areas designated for urban renewal, the State is providing the incentives for development.</P>
      <P>Briefly these incentives are on the commercial side capital allowance on new or reconstructed commercial buildings; double rent allowance for traders; and rates relief on new or improved buildings. The incentives on the residential side are owner-occupier residential allowance on new or refurbished dwellings; and section 23 relief on provision of new or refurbished private rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was introduced in 1986 <Col N="101" /> and was initially limited to areas in our five main cities.  Building on the success of the scheme, areas were designated in nine provincial centres in 1988.  It was in 1990 that Bray along with seven other centres was designated for urban renewal.</P>
    <P>The local authorities play an important pivotal role in co-ordinating and promoting urban renewal in their areas. Learning from the success and experience of other local authorities, Bray Urban District Council was able to identify, in the context of its developments plans, those areas most suitable for renewal.  When the Government designated an area of 12 acres in the town made up of three separate lots, Bray Urban District Council was quick to respond.</P>
    <P>I visited Bray just over two weeks ago to see at first hand what has been achieved under the urban renewal scheme.  I must say that I was extremely impressed with what I saw.  The urban council is justifiably proud of the superb reconstruction work carried out on the council chambers and offices on the Town Hall site.  It is marvellous to see such sensitive and caring treatment given to important historic buildings.  The overall project on this site will include a restaurant, shops and a new office development. A new bowling alley and leisure complex now stands on the site of the former International Hotel.  Total investment on both these projects is estimated at £4.7 million.  On the larger area, known locally as the Maltings site, plans are well advanced for a mixed development which will include offices, workshops and the restoration of some of the old mill buildings for use as a restaurant/public house.</P>
    <P>In selecting these areas for urban renewal designation, attention was paid to the need for urban renewal and the potential for redevelopment.  In addition to the construction jobs and full-time jobs created, these developments have operated as a catalyst for other developments outside the designated areas.</P>
    <P>The key to the success of the urban renewal scheme is in partnership &mdash; partnership <Col N="102" /> between the public and private sectors.  The Government, through the incentives offered, provides the economic climate for investment.  The local authorities co-ordinate and promote the scheme in their areas.  Last but by no means least, the private sector provide the investment necessary for the development of our urban centres.</P>
    <P>It is not just the developers who gain from urban renewal.  The transformation of run-down and derelict areas in which people wish to live, work or spend their leisure time surely benefits all.</P>
    <P>The incentives offered under the scheme are generous and involve substantial loss of revenue to the State.  I am sure that it would be possible to identify additional areas in Bray or areas in Wicklow town that could benefit from the incentives available under the urban renewal scheme.  Indeed, since coming to office I have become aware of the case made for designation by a large number of towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>However, even if budgetary constraints could be overlooked, it was never the intention of the scheme for designation to become the norm &mdash; rather the reverse is true.  Small concentrated areas show more clearly the visible achievements of the scheme and demonstrate to potential developers and investors the advantages and attractiveness of development of our inner cities and towns.</P>
    <P>If the scheme were to be over-extended the effects of the incentives would become dissipated with the result that we would not achieve any worthwhile urban renewal in areas most in need.  It is because the scheme is so limited in its application, not only in terms of the number of towns designated but also in terms of the size of designated areas within selected towns, that Bray has been so successful in attracting development.</P>
    <P>Evidence of the success of the scheme is in the level of development activity and investment generated in these areas previously considered devoid of development potential.  Since the scheme was first introduced, projects with an estimated value of £393 million have been either <Col N="103" /> already completed or are currently in progress with a further £328 million in planning.</P>
    <P>It is at those projects still at the planning stage in the existing designated areas the scheme is primarily directed at this stage &mdash; to get them off the drawing board and into bricks and mortar.  It was with this in mind that this year's Finance Act provided for a final one year extension to the existing time limit of 31 May 1993 for projects under way on that date.  I firmly believe that designation of any additional areas at this stage would reduce the impact of the scheme in the areas already targeted.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I would not consider it appropriate to extend the urban renweal schemes to additional areas at this time.  However, I assure the Senator that I will, of course, consider any submission regarding additional areas in Bray or in Wicklow in any future review of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I did not quite understand his last sentence but I would like to ask him a question.  Do I understand that because the scheme achieved wonderful work in Bray &mdash; which it has done &mdash; because small concentrated areas were very suitable for this scheme, he would consider sympathetically any further applications made from Bray and Wicklow between now and May 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I made it very clear that there are no plans at present to extend the designated areas. The priority for the Government is to ensure that the projects that are still at planning stage are completed as quickly as possible, to avail of the incentive scheme before 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, and thank him for taking the motion this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> At the Irish Management Institute Conference in Killarney last April, the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, announced that the Government had plans to develop the Shannon Estuary as the top port in Europe.  The Taoiseach described it as the finest deep water harbour in Europe with a capacity to take ships of up to 300,000 tonnes.  He said he hoped it would take over from Rotterdam, which was now over-crowded. I ask the Minister to clarify for the House and, indeed, for the mid-west region, details of the Government's proposals on this.</P>
    <P>Under the plan the Taoiseach said it is envisaged that ships from North and South America would import heavy raw material into the Shannon area for use by industry in this country and for redistribution throughout the Continent.  In April the plan was advanced to a stage where the Taoiseach stated that contact had been made with interested parties in Canada, Mexico and other countries in North and South America.  I would like the Minister to outline the outcome of these discussions and the present stage of the development of the project itself.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that this is not the first time such a proposal was made for the mid-west area and for the Shannon Estuary.  A private developer applied to Limerick County Council for planning permission in 1988 for a similar project but due to difficulties which arose, this was refused at the time. I now welcome the proposals of the Government to develop such a port on the estuary, and would welcome details from the Minister regarding this.  How far advanced are the plans?  What have been the results of any feasibility studies which I am sure the Government have completed?  Will the proposals be submitted to the EC for Structural Funding in the period 1993-97 for the development of the project?</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to outline the environmental impact of the proposals. This is very important in the light of previous experience in the area, when planning permission was sought for the similar development previously mentioned. <Col N="105" /> A key issue that will arise, of course, will be the sitting of the project itself &mdash; the sitting of the proposed port. The obvious approach is that the development will be an extension of the highly successful port of Foynes.  I urge the Minister to enter immediately into discussions with Foynes Harbour Trustees.  There is a wealth of experience and a track record of success in harbour development available to the Minister at Foynes.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks the Minister for the Marine received an extensive submission from Foynes outlining the trustees development plan for the period 1992-99.  The plan, which is costed at £19.6 million, includes provision for additional berthage at a cost of £8 million; capital dredging costing £6.5 million; land acquisition and filling of new land costing £1.8 million; new roadways, £1.2 million; infrastructural development of land at a cost of £1.5 million; and warehousing at a cost of £600,000.  The Minister is aware that Foynes is the fastest growing port in the country.  Trade through the port has increased from 41,000 tonnes in 1963 to 1,215,000 tonnes in the year ended 31 March 1992.  Likewise, the number of trading vessels has increased for the same period from 32 to 320 and net registered tonnage of vessels has increased from 22,850 to 725,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Over the past 15 years Foynes Harbour Trustees have expended in the region of £9 million improving facilities.  Foynes has a clear track record of successful development and port management.  The Minister of the Marine should use this fact when implementing new proposals for the development of a trans-shipment port on the Shannon Estuary.  In fact, I believe he should include his proposals &mdash; which I hope he will outline and which were referred to by the Taoiseach &mdash; as part of the Foynes Port complex development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for his comments and the welcome he has given to the study being done on the area.  He mentioned particularly Foynes and I am reasonably <Col N="106" /> familiar with it.  As the Senator may remember, I was there on 2 January.  We were involved in shipping meat to Russia at that stage.  I must say everybody concerned was very flexible and efficient and provided a very good service.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Estuary is already making a valuable contribution to the national and regional economy.  With existing capability for vessels up to 200,000 deadweight tonnes, total maritime traffic in 1991 through existing port facilities was 7.5 million tonnes consisting of exports of alumina, meat, timber and horticultural products and imports of coal, bauxite, petroleum products, fertilizers and animal feeds.  Since 1965, some £2,000 million has been invested in port related industry in the estuary and the range of port facilities includes marine terminals located at Moneypoint, Tarbert Island, Foynes Island, Aughinish, Dernish Island, together with Limerick city docks, Foynes Harbour and Kilrush Harbour.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Estuary with its sheltered deep water is a prime natural resource in the mid-west of Ireland which can provide a skilled labour pool, has enormous infrastructural benefits for industry location and through its electricity generating plants can readily provide for the energy needs of potential major industry.</P>
      <P>The estuary which extends 100 kilometres from Limerick city to the sea can cater for vessels up to 200,000 deadweight tonnes.  Future development plans provide for reception of 400,000 deadweight tonnes bulk carriers.</P>
      <P>My Department are currently examining the feasibility of establishing an economically strategic trading bridgehead in the Shannon Estuary to boost maritime traffic and create jobs.  Such a facility would be geared to service trade with the European Community, the American Continent and major third country trading blocs.</P>
      <P>A key element of the examination is the viability of a trans-shipment facility or terminal to facilitate transfer of cargo from one ship to another in the Shannon Estuary as an intermediate port en route to final destinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> The examination involves consultation with the Taoiseach's Department, other Government Departments and the relevant State agencies.  My Department will also have regard to the views of Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees in formulating development policies.  Initially, the examination will involve a comprehensive assessment of existing facilities in the estuary and potential interests and markets for trans-shipped goods by mode and destination.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suitability or otherwise of Foynes as a location for a trans-shipment terminal, I feel it would be premature at this stage to come to any definitive conclusions pending my Department's completion of their examination.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently assessing proposals from Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees for funding post 1993 following the completion of the current 1989-93 operational programme on peripherality.  These are the proposals to which the Senator referred in connection with Foynes.  I asked the harbour authorities to come forward with their proposals so that they could be considered in the context of the next programme.</P>
    <P>A number of major projects have been submitted to my Department by both authorities in the estuary for consideration for EC funding.  These include an £8 million new deep water facility for Foynes as well as a £6.5 million dredging <Col N="108" /> project and a range of infrastructual projects. Limerick Harbour Commissioners have submitted proposals for an investment in excess of £30 million for trans-shipment facilities at Moneypoint to boost the utilisation rate for ship discharge facilities, a £20 million plus development of a deep water site at Ballylongford and a project involving dredging of the navigational channel in the estuary to cater for vessels up to 400,000 deadweight tonnes.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from this list of development projects geared towards post-1993 EC funding, there is a correlation with the Taoiseach's trans-shipment proposals. All of these projects will require careful and detailed examination.  They reflect a willingness and commitment on the part of Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees to development and to the maximisation of all resources available to further develop the deep water facilities in the estuary for the benefit of the western seaboard and the economy in general.</P>
