      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Keeffe that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to request the health boards to be more enterprise conscious and to introduce an element of self-financing to their affairs.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the coal ban to Bray town and its environs.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline her plans for the retention of the Shannon stop-over.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ó Cuív of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of Health to make resources available to the Western Health Board to enable them to provide geriatric care in homes that are nearer to the families of the patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to hold an inquiry into the serious mishap aboard the Brittany Ferries ship on route from Cork to Roscoff on Sunday, 22 March, to ensure that such a situation does not arise on any ferry operating from Irish ports in future.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Haughey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to report on the measures being taken to tackle the recent problem of oil pollution on the west coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Honan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transism, Transport and Communications to allow for a debate on the Shannon stopover.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for transport and Tourism to protect employment in the Inchicore overhaul works.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Keeffe, Ross, Jackman, Ó Cuív, Raftery, Haughey and Honan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator O'Keeffe's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Ross, Jackman, Ó Cuív, Raftery, Haughey and Honan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Costello as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>May I welcome back the Leader of the Fine Gael Group here.  We are very pleased to see him back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> The Social Welfare Bill will be taken next week, on 2 and 3 April.  Today's business is: Item No. 2, Statements on the cost of motor insurance, which will be taken until 5 p.m.; from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. we will take Item No. 3, the motion on the Appropriation Act; There will be a sos from 6 to 6.30 p.m.; and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take Item No. 48, Private Members Business, in the names of the Fianna Fáil group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Leader of the House, Senator Wright, for his warm welcome back, which I very much appreciate.  I am sure it is not because he gets a slightly easier time from me than from Senator Doyle.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to raise two points.  First, I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to Item No. 49 on the Order Paper in the names of Senator Cosgrave and myself.  You may remember that when the interim report on the libel laws and defamation was published about a year ago I put down a motion and was asked to wait until the final report came through.  The report is here.  It is a matter of great public interest and concern and I would ask that the Leader of the House make time available over the next few weeks so that this House would have the opportunity to debate this very fine report from the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, on the question of the Supreme Court decision, we were given indications some weeks ago that we would have a chance to discuss that subject and I understand why we have had to wait until now.  It is very clear that Government policy has not yet been formed on this and that there is a need for proper consultation.  There is no more appropriate way for consultation to take place than that the views of the Members of this House be canvassed on the matter, and all of us here have views and we want to be constructive.  I think that at this stage, it would be in the public interest to have this discussion now on the consequences of that Supreme Court decision.  It would help the public debate <Col N="1716" /> because, no matter what happens, unless there is consultation before the decisions are taken, people can say afterwards that whatever happened was foisted on then. I seriously ask the Leader of the House to consider, perhaps next week, putting a day aside for a debate on that Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised with the Leader of the House last week the need to have presented to us an outline of the legislation which he intended initiating in this House, and he gave me an indication at that time that he was working on it.  I would like to get an update on that; I would particularly like to know when he intends bringing in this legislation or what the story is at the moment?  It is important that people have the opportunity to prepare themselves for that kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>I also raised last week the question of the reform of the operation of this House and reminded the Leader of his commitment the day he took office to introduce reforms before the end of this month.  There is a Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting this afternoon and I would like to get an indication that he intends bringing forward a very positive proposal at that meeting.</P>
      <P>I would like also to raise a technical issue.  There is a motion down for debate at 6.30 p.m. this evening in the names of the Fianna Fáil group which defies all understanding.  I do not know who put it together where it came from.  I was waiting for the wording to follow and then I saw on the front that it was the wording. Could somebody explain to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a speech; it is purely functional to the Order of Business. As I understand it &mdash; and I am seeking confirmation of this &mdash; the motion we are debating at 6.30 p.m. is that this House debate the energy policy. When this motion is passed next week, when will we debate the energy policy? <Col N="1717" /> Whoever put those words of this motion together, which are total nonsense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have made your point, Senator O'Toole, and I want you to please conclude as there are other items&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In case you think there is too much merriment on this side of the House, a Chathaoirligh this is only slightly worse than last week when Fine Gael asked us at the end of a six hour debate not to debate something we had just spent six hours debating; now we have had it from both sides.</P>
      <P>I would like to make two further points.  And I would say to both sides of the House that I notice a very dangerous development in the debating of national issues &mdash; and I am making only a passing reference to them &mdash; such as UMP, the Shannon stopover and various other issues in the west.  There is a very dangerous urban-rural divide coming through in discussions in this House and in other places which is just playing into the hands of those trying to divide public opinion in this country.  Problems of the west should be as much concern to the people in the east and <i>vice versa</i> and I would just like to make that plea in regard to any discussisons we might have.</P>
      <P>The final point is this.  Last week Senator Jackman asked on the Order of Business that we discuss educational matters and we all supported the need for that.  We also pointed out that either the present Minister or the previous Minister for Education had yet to grace this House with their presence.  Very often when I am discussing education I refer to the problems of class size.  I would like today to ask the Members of the House to look at the crowded Gallery behind me and realise that that is just one class in a primary school in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate in this House on the implications of the Supreme Court judgment.  May I ask the Leader if the Government have any idea what they are going to do in relation to this debate and if it will be <Col N="1718" /> necessary to bring Deputy Haughey back to tell them what they should do?</P>
      <P>In relation to the oil slick in the west of Ireland, could we have a debate on that matter.  I understand that some country councils in the west are being left to their own devices to solve this problem.  That is true, I understand as far as finance is concerned.</P>
      <P>Finally, I believe that, at this stage, no Order of Business would be complete without a request for a debate on banking. May I renew my calls for a debate on banking?  I am beginning to be at the receiving end of correspondence from bankers.  I would not want them wasting paper and their valuable time writing to me about these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Senator would continue to call it the O'Keeffe initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal again to the Leader of the House to set aside time for a full debate on the air transport services, with particular reference to the Shannon stop-over. I would also ask for time to be set aside to discuss the Culliton report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make three points.  First, I would like to ask the Leader of the House about Item No. 3 on the Order Paper, the Appropriation Act.  He said we are resuming on Item No. 3 between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. but the unofficial notice circulated by the Whips said &ldquo;to conclude&rdquo;.  I have valiantly queued up over a number of weeks and have not been able to get in.  I would hope that the debate would continue.  It may be a little tedious, but there are points some of us would like to have the opportunity to make.  I take it that that is only a provisional notice from the Whips and that if everybody has not been included in the debate, it will be continued for just another week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second may I support Senator O'Toole's point &mdash; I do not think it is entirely a frivolous point &mdash; that grammatically the Fianna Fáil motion as it stands clearly precludes discussion of <Col N="1719" /> substantial issues involved, and envisages a subsequent debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, and I would not, of course, challenge their right.  I assume that, in order to avoid a nonsense, the discretion of the Chair will come into operation and a proper discussion on this issue, even though not apparently grammatically envisaged, will ensue.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, could the Leader of the House give us a progress report on moves to establish a foreign affairs committee of both Houses to the Oireachtas.  I feel the sooner this is established the better because it would obviate the necessity that some of us feel to raise matters dealing with foreign policy on the Order of Business.  Would the Leader give us some concrete information as to progress towards the establishment of the foreign affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>As you are aware, I asked for a debate on the Britanny Ferries issue.  I am disappointed, given the gravity of the situation, that we are not having that debate today.  Seventy students from my college and two members of staff, one of whom was a climatologist, Dr. Tyrrell, were on that boat.  Their reports and the report of the captain of the boat are in total conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have a debate or a speech on it now, as the Senator can understand and appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point how serious the matter is.  Could I ask the Leader of the House to have a debate on it?  If we cannot have the debate on the Adjournment tomorrow, then we should at least have a debate on the safety of ferry transport.  The comments of both the captain of the ship and of the Department of the Marine are again in conflict, with the captain saying they got permission to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1720" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we would not have a debate at this point.  I would like to facilitate the Senator, because in fairness, you are making a speech on what is an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a debate under Standing Order No. 29?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for you to decide, but not on the Order of Business.  Any other query to the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the query: that we must have a serious debate on this matter.  As an island nation we are very dependent on the efficiency and safety of our ferries and recent events do not help to increase our confidence in these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader when the Taoiseach is coming into the House?  Does he have any further information as to the date?  We are all waiting with bated breath for his arrival.</P>
      <P>Second, in relation to the recent tragic deaths in prison and the other attempted death, as a result of which a woman from the women's prison in Mountjoy is seriously ill in the Mater Hospital, may I again ask the Leader of the House if he would approach the Minister for Justice to come into this House and give us his views on what prison reform he envisages to prevent this type of incident happening again?</P>
      <P>I would support Senator Norris's call for clarification in regard to when the foreign affairs committee will be established. We badly need it in view of what we see at present, when the Government seem to be touting around Europe the wording for an amendment to the Protocol which the Oireachtas has not seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making a speech, Senator Costello.  I am sure the Leader has taken on board your request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Every other country in Europe will be asked to express its views on the matter.  In that context too could <Col N="1721" /> we have some indication when we are to have the White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty?  Time is getting very short for a comprehensive debate on this extremely important issue.</P>
      <P>In relation to Northern Ireland, could we get some information when the debate is going to take place?  I think it would be ideal to have the debate on Northern Ireland now while they are in this limbo &mdash; before the British election and a new government is in place there.  In that situation we should be able to put on the record and express our views on what should happen there.  Even though the Green Paper on education should have been before us over a year ago, once again it is being postponed.  Could we get some definite information this time, through the Leader of the House, from the Minister for Education as to when we are going to have this Green Paper, because all sorts of developments in education are being precluded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making a speech.  A question, please, for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader of the House to give us an idea when we will have this Green Paper.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I refer the Leader of the House to Motion No. 45 on the Order Paper which deals with the Nicky Kelly case?  Once again we have all sorts of rumours and titbits of information. Again, would the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to come clean on the issue and give us a definite statement on how that matter is progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader of the House to provide time for a debate on the development of natural gas here and the consequences of half the country being deprived of having it now or at any time in the future.  This is urgent because An Bord Gáis have signed a contract providing for a national gas connection with the rest of Europe.  While half the country will have an assured, stable energy supply, coming from as far afield as Siberia, half of Ireland, including the <Col N="1722" /> area you live in, a Chathaoirligh, will never have natural gas, and you and I and others representing that part of Ireland will be at a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making a speech, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the best at using the divide line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying as hard as I can.  I would ask again that the Leader of the House would provide time, totally independent of the discussion that will take place on energy policy generally.  I think this is of fundamental and vital importance to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on the Shannon stop-over in view of the statement by Aer Rianta yesterday at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies that not one extra tourist would come to Ireland as a result of the change and that, in fact, a hub would commence immediately in Shannon if the uncertainty was taken out of the situation.</P>
      <P>I also support the request for a discussion on the prison situation.  Last week I asked for this and since then there has been another suicide and an attempted suicide.</P>
      <P>Finally, last week I asked for a debate on the report of the Law Reform Commission on the civil law on defamation.  I also support that request today as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House have a debate on the recent oil pollution along the Kerry shores, the clearing up of which was at enormous cost to the local authority.  I feel very strongly that we should have a debate on this to see who the perpetrators are and to bring them to justice.  If people think they can wash out their tanks at sea and pollute our coastline, they have another guess coming.  Our beaches in Kerry are <Col N="1723" /> ruined.  I am sure if it happened in other countries there would be a similar outcry.</P>
      <P>I also support the Senators who wanted a debate on the Shannon stopover.  It is now appropriate to have a debate on this very important issue becaue the livelihood of the people in my side of the country will be at stake.  I would like to remind people that the west of Ireland does not finish at Galway, it goes all the way down to south-west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is getting a bit tedious at this stage, but has the Leader any information on the Government's response to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights on the Norris case?  It is three and a half years since the decision was handed down, and so far we have heard nothing other than a promise last December 12 months from the then Minister for Justice, who was since fired. I hope there is no connection between the two happenings.  I also support my colleagues' request for a debate on the Shannon stopover.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support my colleagues in requesting, not just a debate on the Shannon stopover but, as I said frequently in this House, a debate on the whole issue of regional policy?  I would love us to be able to work out a regional policy that worked because then we might be able to tell Europe what we mean by regional policy.  The problem is we do not know what we want from Europe because we cannot make one work here.  I would love to have a serious debate on regional policy.</P>

      <P>I again would like to support my colleagues in asking the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to come into this House and have a debate on air transport.  In case Senator D. Kiely thinks Kerry is the only coastline that was polluted by oil, Clare too was polluted by oil.  We have an excellent engineer and he has it cleaned up, I hope, by now.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not need any lessons or lectures from Senator O'Toole.</P>

    <P>In regard to the interpretation of the section of the recent Companies Bill that covered examinership, has the Leader of the House any information from the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding a change in that legislation in view of the fact that it has been proved to be inadequate to cover the payments arising from the recent problems in UMP?  I consider this to be a very important matter.  If, in future, an examiner is appointed to a company, then obviously the credibility of people who provide services <Col N="1725" /> to that company will be called into question.  Has the Leader of the House had any indication from the Department, the Government or the Minister about a change in that law so that the examiner will have a proper structure to pay people who provide services or products during the period of examinership?</P>

      <P>I share Senator Dan Kiely's concern in relation to the recent oil pollution on the west coast of Ireland. Yesterday there was a very serious radiation leak from a nuclear power station at St. Petersburg in Russia.  I would like an assurance from the Leader of the House that the Minister for Energy will deal with this issue tonight and assure the people that every effort is being made to ensure there is adequate monitoring of radiation levels in this country.  I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that the full facts of that radiation leak will be established and that measures will be taken through the EC to ensure that no further serious radiation leaks take place which could affect the entire European population.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in looking for a debate on air transport, particularly the status of Shannon. In relation to Senator O'Toole's comment, the divisiveness is not being created by the people who wish to retain the stop-over or those who wish to abandon it.  It is created by Aer Lingus stating in stark headlines that the stop-over is contributing to a job loss of 1,200.  These statements are made day in and day out and it is time to clear up Aer Lingus's financial problems for which the stop-over at Shannon is being blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the debate on education, according to today's newspaper, we will not have the Green Paper for some time.  It is very important that we have a debate on this subject soon regardless of when we will get the Green Paper, particularly in the light of a report issued the other day regarding the role of the inspectorate at second level.  Only once in my teaching career was I visited by <Col N="1726" /> an inspector.  I hope these issues will be clarified.  Will we ever see the Green Paper?  As I said last week, I would like to see a Minister for Education in this House.  There is the danger that we might have two or three changes of Minister for Education by the time this Green Paper arrives.</P>

      <P>I refer to the call made by Senator Raftery for a debate on the ferries which operate on our seas.  I sympathise with what he said but it would be far more prudent for us to await the results of the investigation currently being carried out by the Minister for the Marine and to keep in mind that the Minister said that under the Merchant Shipping Act he can invoke regulations <Col N="1727" /> that will place very stringent conditions on the operation of ferries in this country.</P>
      <P>As regards the Culliton report, is it the Leader's intention to have a debate on this report which deals with job creation and the education system? When does he intend to have this debate?</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a very important issue I raised two weeks ago and which was raised by Senator Finneran, that is, the role of the examiner.  The examiner is appointed by the High Court; he is acting for and on behalf of the High Court and it was the intention that those supplying services and goods would be paid in full. It now appears that the Act is deficient. Did the Leader receive any answers from the Minister for Industry and Commerce relating to the updating of the present Act?</P>
      <P>I again raise an issue I brought up last week &mdash; the proliferation of drugs and the Leader omitted to respond.  The proliferation of drugs is a very serious matter, especially as a recent report suggests that there is a major increase in the amount of drugs available in this country and in the number of people using them. It is pertinent that a debate be allowed in this House so that we could ask what more we can do to apprehend the dealers in death, as I term them, who are alive and well in this country.</P>

      <P>I would also like to raise a matter that has not been raised recently, and that is health.  I have had reports of experiences which suggest that we need a full debate on health policies.

    <P>What has happened to the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill?  There is a difficulty with this on the ground, and it is causing practical problems in that winter calving cannot be switched to spring calving by the stroke of a civil servant's pen. The delay of a few months has meant a loss of at least a year on the ground in regulating the situation when one takes the gestation period of the cow into <Col N="1729" /> account.  We should look at what is involved and get that Bill moving very quickly, because seriously, major practical problems are being caused by the delay in this House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> Senator Manning mentioned the report of the Law Reform Commission on Defamation.  I am sure we will have that debate after Easter.  Over the last week or two I outlined an extensive programme of business for the next couple of weeks.  We will have a debate on the Supreme Court decision before Easter. The Protocol was agreed by 11 other countries and it is out of courtesy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in Europe endeavouring to secure agreement on an amendment to that Protocol.  We will debate the decision of the Supreme Court before Easter.  I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party mentioned the consensus there has been so far on this issue.  In the interest of the debate this consensus is needed and I hope it will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned future legislation to be iniatiated in this House. I know of one Bill and hope that soon I will be able to mention at least two or three Bills that will be initiated in the House.  I will inform the House of that in the next few days.  I have already dealt with the matter of reform.  My understanding is that the matter has been dealt with and that we will have agreement today.</P>
    <P>As regards the wording of the Private Members' motion, I am surprised by Senators who say they are amazed at what goes down on the Order Paper.  I welcome the possibility of a debate in air transport.  Senators Foley, Honan and others mentioned that we should have, and there definitely is need for, such a debate.  I suggest that, after the Easter recess, we should bring in the Minister to discuss all aspects of air transport and not just the issue of direct flights.  There is a need for an overall review of air transport problems post-1992.  I give an assurance that we will arrange the wording of the appropriate motion.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Norris that we will have enough time today to deal with the Appropriation Act.  As I said, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is out of the country but as soon as he returns I hope to have details of his intentions to set up the committee on foreign affairs.  I would <Col N="1731" /> welcome a debate on the safety of sea ferries but we should await the outcome of the recent case.  Many Members have views on the safety of sea ferries and other related issues, and we could deal with this after Easter.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's announcement in the Dáil yesterday that the White Paper on Maastricht will be ready soon.  As soon as it is available, we will avail of an opportunity to debate it. As regards the Nicky Kelly affair, as of today I am assured by the Minister that he has not yet received a report from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned natural gas.  That issue would affect many areas and we could accomodate a debate on that subject.  Oil pollution affects many coastlines and it may be that this House would have suggestions and ideas on how best it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As regards the role of the examiner under the Companies Act, I will contact the Minister in question to find out if he has had a chance to review the position and role of examiners given recent affairs in various companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey mentioned the radiation leak at St. Petersburg.  If the Minister is here tonight, he may take the opportunity to give the details he mentioned yesterday in the Dáil and outline what measures he intends to take.</P>
    <P>As regards the Green Paper on education, the Taoiseach made the point that two former Ministers made an input into it.  There is another Minister in the Department now and he is being given time to make an input.  I hope the Green Paper will be published soon.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report will be debated on 9 April.  It is one of the most important issues we will have a chance to debate and if we need two or three days to debate it, I would welcome that because most Members will have something to say on it.  Senator O'Keeffe mentioned having two debates on industrial jobs and education. I do not think there is need to do that.  If we provide enough time everybody will have an opportunity to contribute because not only does the report <Col N="1732" /> cover jobs and education, but it takes in regional policy as well.</P>
    <P>The availability of drugs was also mentioned. I heard with great concern yesterday and again today, a report on RTE about the availability of drugs in all our cities.  At present many drugs are being brought into our cities via the south coast. I am sure we will find a way to debate that issue.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have the technicalities in the Milk (Regulations of Supply) (No. 2) Bill ironed out before Easter.  I have already given a commitment that there will definitely be a debate on the broadcasting legislation after Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  In the time left to me I would like to deal with motorcycle insurance. This area has been highlighted in recent times and it has been pointed out that there is now only one company in Ireland dealing in motorcycle insurance.  They have 95 per cent of the market, practically a monopoly.</P>
      <P>Some people find that the insurance premimum for motorcycles is three to four times the value of the vehicle.  In fact, very little comprehensive insurance is taken out on motor cycles because the cost is too prohibitative, and it is unavailable for motorcycles in excess of 250cc. Often there is a debate on whether motorcycles should be banned, but I would not agree with that because they provide inexpensive transport for people who cannot afford cars or other types of transport.  A motorcycle is a valuable mode of transport but it is also a lethal and deadly machine which should be treated with care and respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, many young people do not treat the motorcycle as such.  People, especially young people, seem to change when they get on a motorcycle.  A psychological barrier can be broken in very quiet and inoffensive people in that they feel a sense of power when they travel at speed <Col N="1733" /> and take risks on the road that, in their senses, they would not dream of.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies and the State should promote greater road safety awareness for motorcyclists.  The Irish Bikers Action Group in conjunction with Dublin Country Council have set up an excellent training course.  The test at the end of this course is far in advance of the requirement for a full driving licence &mdash; if that if the right word &mdash; for a motorcycle. No cognisance is taken by the insurance companies or anybody else of the fact that people have taken that course.  The insurance companies should consider reducing premiums for people who have taken courses on safety in driving and on safety aspects of motorcycling. I was surprised to learn that there is no no claims bonus for motorcyclists, so regardless of one's record, one does not get any credit for accident free motorcycling.</P>
    <P>I would like to return briefly to the issue of the power of the motorcycle. In the past 15 years, there has been an evolution in the design of motorcycles and motorcycle engines.  Fifteen years ago a 250cc motorcycle could travel at maximum speeds of 55 to 60 miles per hour.  I understand that today a motorcycle with a similar engine can travel between 100 and 110 miles per hour.  It is mindboggling to think that a motorcycle can travel at that speed.  Something should be done to reduce the speed of these machines, bearing in mind the condition of our roads.  Regardless of the condition of our roads, given the level of protection motorcyclists have, they should not be in a position to travel at such dangerous speeds.</P>
    <P>I believe that the whole area of motorcycle insurance should be looked at seriously, as should a programme for improved road safety and awareness of road safety.  There should be a concentration on doing courses to ensure that people are adequately equipped if they are driving such lethal machines as motorcycles.  I understand that up to 80 per cent of motorcyclists under 25 years of age only hold a provisional licence and <Col N="1734" /> there is no evalution of the skills of somebody using such lethal machines.</P>
    <P>What I am saying to the Minister is that we should look at the safety and control aspects with regard to people who buy a motorcycle and who without any training, use these lethal machines, bearing in mind the type of machine it is and, as I said earlier, the effect that going on a motorcycle seems to have on young people.  It gives them a sense of power, that they are on a high with this machine.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider first, the area of motorcycle insurance and its prohibitive cost, second, the provision of comprehensive insurance for people who have taken approved driving courses and third, the necessity to ensure that people complete such courses and operate under a provisional licence for a limited period only.  Insurance companies should consider reducing the cost of insurance by a certain percentage for those who have taken recognised courses and introducing a no claims bonus for those insured on motorcycles.</P>

I would not disparage this House or any of its Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, congratulate her on her new portfolio and wish her luck and success with it.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the costs of motor insurance as a mother with a young family who may be trying to get insurance for themselves on their parent's cars or on their own cars and of the problems they face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two categories of person in this country I feel extremely sorry for when it comes to motor insurance.  These are young people between the ages of 18 and 25 and older retired people between the ages of 65 or 66 and 80 who are placed <Col N="1735" /> in an invidious position when they reach 65 and premium costs seem to shoot up with accompanying tests and regulations.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Neville that some form of system should be introduced where a person would receive credits for their driving ability.  People who go to the trouble of attending a school of motoring and who pass their driving test should be entitled to a fair crack of the whip when it comes to insurance.  My own son and daughters are named drivers on my insurance policy.  The cheapest insurance premium my 23 year old son can get costs £700 or £800, although he has been driving for a number of years with a full licence; we have tried every insurance company in the country.  He is now talking about taking out his own insurance despite this because without it he will not receive any credits when he reaches the age of 25.  One might be better off financially to take out insurance at 21 to avail of the credits available at age 25.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must be looked at is court awards.  Some years ago everybody blamed the jury system for high awards.  When that system was done away with, the function was awarded to the judge.  The legal profession seems to cash in on accident cases by imposing extra costs on people when they look for engineers to map out roads, etc.  Barristers and junior barristers have to be paid also and 85 to 90 per cent of these cases are settled out of court.  It takes years before a settlement is reached in court.</P>
    <P>In most European countries certain criteria are laid down for certain injuries.  I am not talking about major injuries, such as serious back injuries or loss of a limb but for whiplash injuries, the loss of a small finger or similar minor injuries.  In most European countries a certain sum of money is deemed appropriate compensation for such injuries.  As Members of this House, a certain number of insurance guidelines are written into our policies for the loss of an eye, or whatever, so that we know to some extent what we are entitled to in the event of an accident.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to expect or ask young <Col N="1736" /> people earning £100 or £120 a week in their first job, to fork out £30 or £40 a week for car insurance.  I am thinking especially of people in rural areas who need car or motorcycle transport to get to and from their workplace.  People living in cities can avail of a good bus or train service but young people in the country living 20 miles from their workplace need a car or a motorcycle to get to work.  Some credit system will have to be worked out in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to full and provisional driving licences, I agree that a higher premium should apply to those with provisional licences but a lower premium should be imposed when that person passes his or her test.</P>
    <P>Permitted levels of alcohol for drivers will be reduced again in the near future under European law; insurance companies should take this into account also. I congratulate the Garda on the job they did last Christmas and the Christmas before in enforcing this law.  I would like to see more uninsured drivers brought to justice &mdash; it is estimated that 7, 8 or 9 per cent of drivers are uninsured &mdash; that may help to reduce the cost of insurance premia.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that something like 33 non-life insurance companies are now authorised to issue motor insurance in Ireland.  One would think that would lead to competition for business but when one goes looking for insurance, that element is not there.  When one looks for car or motorcycle insurance one is asked to take out house insurance to make one's business worth while to the company.  I welcome the law which comes into effect at the end of November which will permit other European insurance companies operating within the EC to compete for insurance business here; this may create much needed competition.</P>
    <P>Irish people must examine their own practices; insurance claims and compensation seem to be on the tip of everybody's tongue at the moment.  An insurance claim is like winning the lotto; if one is involved in an insurance claim the tendency is to exaggerate the damage for maximum gain until the court case is <Col N="1737" /> over when one can claim to have been cured, miraculously.  Such people have a lot to answer for.  When driving through Irish towns and villages a number of people walk out deliberately in front of a car.  Those people put drivers at risk but maintain that it is up to drivers to stop and let them pass.  In larger towns where footpaths are provided many pedestrians walk on the roads making it hazardous for drivers.</P>
    <P>Drivers deserve consideration and credit for their skills.  I have driven in many countries.  I lived in America for a number of years where one drivers on the left hand side of the road and I found that most people in other countries are conscious of the dangers when crossing roads and adhered to the rules of the road, but Irish people seem to have the reverse attitude towards drivers.</P>
    <P>I hope something can be done for younger drivers.  It is unjust that a young person of 21 or 22 years of age should be expected to pay £1,000 or £1,500 for motor insurance.  They may be thinking of buying a house but by the time they pay for motor insurance they cannot afford it. Some credits will have to be built in for them so that they are placed in a different category until they are 25 years of age. Most young people between 21 and 23 years are excellent drivers and a credit to our country.  There may be some young people who mess around, but all young people should not be tarred with the same brush.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>For once, women have received some recognition for their care, courtesy and concern as drivers.  Generally speaking, one hears the comment, women drivers again, but in this instance it is nice to hear that women receive a percentage discount on motor insurance premia which is about the only concession women have in these days of so called equality.  That does not necessarily mean that I would not fight the case of male drivers, particularly young male drivers who have enormous problems obtaining insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several speakers have claimed that young people are frequently involved in <Col N="1738" /> expensive compensation cases but one should not tar everybody with the same brush.  I have received representations from many young men of 21 or 22 who cannot get insurance that would enable them to take up jobs.  This is an obvious problem in rural areas where jobs are scarce.  People may have to travel 25 or 30 miles to work and as there is no public transport young people in rural areas are badly affected.  In Limerick it is almost impossible to get even one insurance company to take on a young person, and if they do they charge prohibitive sums of £2,000 or £3,000 even in poor family circumstances where there may be no hope of parental financial support.  What is to become of these people?  Those are the people I represent today.</P>
    <P>There are many ways out of this impasse.  Insurance companies say they have no problem with young female drivers. Any young girl of 20 or 21 will be welcomed with open arms by an insurance company; the young male will not.  This raises the question of liability. What sort of assessment procedures do insurance companies apply to assess the risk of young drivers?  The situation could be redressed if insurance companies set up a panel of testers to assess young people's driving skills.  It could be argued that young people have passed their driving test but I recommend that insurance companies set up their own panel of testers of driving skill and experience so that they could say &ldquo;I stand over this young person.  He&rdquo;, and it is not a she in this case, &ldquo;to our minds will be able to drive within the confines of our premiums.&rdquo; This measure would create jobs and be self-financing because no young person would mind paying up to £50 to an insurance panel of assessors to be enabled to obtain reasonably priced insurance.</P>
    <P>We know that irrational young daredevil drivers exist who cause serious accidents, but the majority of young male drivers do not.  It has been suggested that all young male drivers are utterly irresponsible but I would like to know how insurance firms decide that young <Col N="1739" /> male drivers are an unacceptable insurance risk.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years, Fine Gael have taken this matter on board and aim to evolve a new starter policy viable for insurance companies and more importantly, fair to young drivers who must under law be insured.  As a result of the insurance prohibition on young male drivers, uninsured driving is a significant problem.  Young people do not think of the possible consequences of driving uninsured so we must take responsibility for the temptation we place before them.</P>
    <P>When our insurance costs are compared to those in other EC countries we are not compared on an equal basis; we have the highest percentage of under 25s in the EC.  A new starter policy could be priced at around £750 and young people who need their cars for work would be prepared to cough up that amount.  This solution would ensure better driving skills which would be tested by the statutory driving test and by the insurance company assessor.</P>
    <P>The roads block grant was released to local authorities this week; we will be debating it in Limerick County Council on Friday.  We place great emphasis on the safety of our national routeways, but I would like statistics on where the greater number of routeway accidents occur because a number of them still occur on national routeway black spots which should be eliminated given the money we are receiving from Europe.  Close to Limerick, there is a black spot at the Lisnagry level crossing for which funding was sanctioned this year but the money has not come.  A board stretch of road at Lisnagry narrows suddenly into what I could only call a boreen on the national routeway.  We have had numerous accidents there; visibility is nil and CIE are not taking responsibility for financing. Limerick County Council took the responsibility because of the number of accidents but we have not received the expected allocation for this problem area in our roads grant.  I do not want to be a prophet of doom but this black spot on <Col N="1740" /> the N7 has been discussed over and over again.  There have been deputations and protests, yet it remains.  I travel that road twice and three times a week and only I know the dangers I would be afraid of where I might end up.  Numerous trucks have ended up in farmers' fields after driving through huge concrete barriers erected at that spot.  Safer roads must become not just a pious aspiration but a reality.</P>
    <P>We need stricter traffic law enforcement, tighter cost controls on claims and a better deal from insurance companies. Competition from foreign insurance companies within an integrated Europe will oblige our insurance companies to take stock of the situation.</P>
    <P>Implementation of a starter driver policy would improve the business environment for insurance companies.  We do not expect insurance companies to take the rap totally; we say let us work with you to ensure lower costs.  We will do our share but you must do yours.  This is a <i>quid pro quo</i> which the Government should, and Fine Gael would, require from insurance companies to undertake this starter driver policy.  Under it premium quotes would initially be for third party cover only at a cost of £750.  The insured person would have to have a clean licence and not to have been found in breach of the restricted driving requirements.  Genuine, honest young people who need cars to survive will come forward with clean licences.  Many of the young people I am concerned about are applying for insurance for the first time, many of them having passed their driving test and geared towards being responsible. We are given the impression continually that they are irresponsible, but they are not so, in the main.</P>
    <P>Under this starter policy claimants for more than personal injuries would be liable for the first £500 or 10 per cent, whichever is the lesser and the normal no claims bonus would not apply for the first three years.  This is a constructive positive proposal which does not refuse cover but insists on a three year phase without benefit of a no claims bonus.  This proposal would appeal to the positive spirit of <Col N="1741" /> young drivers.  It is essential that insurance companies take a share of the starter driver pool.  Motorcyclists protested on the streets a few weeks ago.  If all companies take a percentage of young drivers no company will be left with an excessive number of high claims and I hope there will not be high claims. Thirdly, starter drivers who make a claim would face an escalation of their premium cost related to the cost of the claim.</P>

      <P>We are lax about enforcing traffic laws.  One does not see cars parked on double yellow lines in any other EC country; they are removed instantly.  We need step up the vigilance with which our traffic laws are enforced. On-the-spot fines should be introduced for failure to display &ldquo;L&rdquo; plates.  Failure to wear seat belts should be punished but I think that law is widely observed now. There should be penalties for using a <Col N="1742" /> phone while driving.  Vehicles driven in certain parts of the country leave a lot to be desired, especially at night; often one does not know whether a motorcycle or a car is approaching because the car may have only one light working.  We do not want to turn Ireland into a police state but lives are being lost on the road through negligence.</P>
      <P>There must be plenty of scope for mechanics to set up fairly lucrative competitive businesses to look after faulty cars.  One does not have to go to the big dealers whether Renault, Peugeot or whoever.  It is an area with employment potential and many young people are being apprenticed to car mechanics.  They may not have the start-up money to open their own businesses but they could eliminate some of these faulty vehicles.</P>
      <P>Uninsured drivers should have their cars impounded automatically.  A number of changes would need to be implemented to control cost of claims.  A quantum of damages should be introduced to control the cost of settling different claims and a claims commission should be established with the active involvement of the insured parties to deal with insurance claims without recourse to the courts and the attended legal costs. I am advised that instead of two senior barristers as formerly, a judge and one senior barrister now preside over claims cases and still costs have not decreased. What has happened since the change from the jury system?  Costs do not seem to be coming down as we were told they would.  A through investigation of all claims would be required to eliminate spurious and fraudulent claims.  When one goes to have a damaged vehicle repaired one is asked if it is an insurance claim.  If one says it is being paid for by the individual one is treated more sympathetically.  There is a blanket cover charge for insurance claims and money is being creamed off in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask for a better deal from insurance companies.  There is a need for greater transparency in the way in which insurance companies do business.  We must ensure competition from European insurers; competition is the life of trade. <Col N="1743" /> Fine Gael propose to require publication of more information by the insurance companies allowing insurance claims to be identified and the reason for different loading illustrated.  It is important that there should be openness in regard to claim costs.</P>
    <P>On receipt of a driving licence an insurance assessor would check that one was not a liability.  Before a provisional driving licence holder takes to the roads a minimum number of off the road lessons should be mandatory.</P>
    <P>Those holding a provisional licence, and for the first two years after obtaining a full licence, should display restricted or &ldquo;R&rdquo; plates, an important provision because regardless of how one does in a test the experience of driving ensures that two or three years later one has learned to be a better and more courteous driver. Courtesy is lacking in the first year or two when one concentrates on practising one's driving skills.  The first few years of driving form part of the learning process and &ldquo;R&rdquo; plates are appropriate for that time for young people who want to act responsibly.  They should display the &ldquo;R&rdquo; plate and not exceed 50 miles per hour. Bravado breaks out at night, coming home from discos, offering girls a lift and revving up on a good stretch of road; invariably this is where accidents occur. A 50 miles per hour limit would appeal to the better instincts of young people. We need also to observe zero alcohol levels while driving which we know is quite a problem for all drivers and I should not single out young drivers; we are also talking about middle age and older drivers who take chances with alcohol levels.</P>
    <P>Young drivers should be strongly encouraged to obtain advanced driving skills for which they would get a discount on their insurance premium.  This is done in Britain.  I heard an Englishman, now resident in Ireland, talking about this on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  I do not think he saw many drivers in Ireland who would qualify as &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;.  He was appalled at drivers in this country particularly as regards their understanding of the power <Col N="1744" /> of their vehicles and pointed out their potential to be better drivers if they did the advanced course.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a very important point in relation to job creation which we should be pushing at all times.  With a backlog of 50,000 to 60,000 on the waiting list for driving tests, surely it would be in the Government's interest to employ more driver testers.  Jobs would be created immediately because many people would be qualified to be driver testers.  Applicants have to wait months for a test and, as a result, are paying more for insurance.</P>
    <P>We should not prohibit our young people from driving because of a few madcaps.  We should have more specific information as to which groups are causing the problem.  We should address the issue of unemployment of young people who cannot drive to work.  We should consider a self-financing scheme under which insurers would assess young people, charging perhaps £50 for that test.  We should have more driver testers to cut down on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>The cost of motor insurance has been a matter of grave concern to everybody over the years and although much has been said about it, little has been done to bring down costs. The insurance companies say they have to increase the premiums because the compensation granted by the courts to people involved in accidents is too high and the number of claims are also too high.  They suggest that the claims level in Ireland is much higher than in any other European country and their charges reflect what they have to pay out in claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most insurance companies are involved in many different aspects of insurance but they always seem to refer to the losses on motor insurance.  They do not mention that, overall, they take in a great deal of money for other types of insurance.  If you are in business you cannot isolate one area and say that, because you are losing money there you must increase the price.  When these companies make huge profits on life <Col N="1745" /> insurance or on general insurance, they do not reduce the premiums.  We have to look at the overall picture and at the profits these insurance companies make each year.  Since policy holders pay in advance the insurance companies have the use of their money, and the percentage of people who make claims is very small.  In general even though they might seem to be incurring a direct loss on the money taken in on premiums as against the amount paid out on claims, they do not take into account the money they have on deposit for many months or in certain cases many years.  Like the supermarkets they get paid for their goods but they do not have to pay until much later.  This means they get credit from their suppliers and they have the use of the customers money for a long time.  As a result their margins can be very low as they take advantage of the investment markets.  The insurance companies claim that they are losing money on motor insurance does not stand up. One has to take into account their investment policy and the amount of money they take from other low risk category insurances.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of comment here about the cost of insurance for young people which, in Ireland, is exorbitant.  It is disgraceful, but there are a number of reasons for this.  It has been suggested that a higher percentage of accidents is caused by younger drivers, but I have not seen statistics to support that suggestion.  There are a number of reasons younger people may be involved in accidents.  One has to take into account that the first car a young driver buys is not likely to be a top of the range model with good brakes and headlights, and all that makes up a safe vehicle.  Younger drivers tend to look for a second-hand car, in many cases what would be considered a banger.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in Ireland, there is no way one can judge whether it is a banger because we do not have an MOT for cars.  We do have DOE testing for motor vehicles over 30 cwt. and the fact that people have to get their DOE certificate every year ensures that heavy duty <Col N="1746" /> vehicles and small commercial vehicles are safer to drive than motor cars.  Unless we introduce DOE testing for cars, we will have a large number of claims from younger drivers because in many cases their cars are not safe enough to drive at speed; indeed, in some cases, they re not safe to drive at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned the fact that at night you would not know whether the vehicle coming towards you was a motorbike or a car.  Cars with only one headlamp are known as &ldquo;one eyed Jacks&rdquo;.  If there is no dipped headlamp, and if it is on the inside, you do not know if the vehicle is a car or a motorbike.  The vehicle with the one headlamp might not be involved in the accident but the vehicle travelling in the opposite direction may be when the driver suddenly finds himself confronted with this &ldquo;one-eyed Jack&rdquo; and panics.  He may hit somebody on the side of the road or another vehicle because his attention has been distracted. If a person driving a car with one headlamp is not prepared to pay a few pounds for a headlamp bulb, one can imagine what the rest of the car must be like, particularly his tyres.</P>
    <P>I want to take issue with Senator Jackman. She said the first question you are asked when you go to a garage after a crash is &ldquo;Is this an insurance claim?&rdquo; She seems to be suggesting that if it is an insurance claim the garage will add to the cost of the repairs.  There is a very simple reason for asking if it is an insurance claim.  Generally, the cost of repairing a vehicle after an accident is very high compared to the cost of a normal service or the replacement of a set of tyres.  By asking if the car is covered by insurance the garage proprietor finds out if he will be paid.  If a garage carries out the repairs without asking they may be confronted by somebody who cannot afford to pay for the damages.  An assessor has to see that car if it is covered by insurance.  He will dictate what has to be repaired.  The insurance companies are the people responsible in this case.</P>
    <P>For younger drivers and, indeed, for all drivers, it is essential that we bring in a DOE test &mdash; we have been threatening <Col N="1747" /> to do so for many years.  It has worked for commercial vehicles because there is no doubt that they are roadworthy.  The drivers might not be safe but the vehicles have passed the tests.  It is essential to ensure that vehicles are safe and have all the safety elements built into them in terms of tyres, lights, etc.</P>
    <P>It is true that younger drivers do not have the skill to take cars on the road and are likely to be involved in accidents because of a lack of experience.  Driving is a bit like rearing a child.  You do not know how things will develop but you learn by experience.  You learn to be a parent by experience but you can be taught to drive even before you get a licence if you attend a proper driving school.  Unfortunately, the driving test is normally carried out under reasonable conditions.  I have never heard of anyone taking a driving test when there was ice on the road or at night in the the rain. Driver testing takes place between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.; driving between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. is totally different.  Why is there no element of night driving in driver testing? Why are driving tests taken during daylight? It makes no sense, because with the best will in the world, somebody like myself, who need glasses for driving, can see much better during the day than at night.  There should be changes made in this area.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies play no part in the National Safety Council who do a great deal of good work in terms of safety for drivers, motorists, and other road users.  The insurance companies should be more involved with the National Safety Council and in setting up special driver schools which will not just teach a person how to pass the Department of the Environment test.  There is not a driving school in the country that does not know the route of the driving test.</P>

      <P>They go over the routes. In big and small towns there are about <Col N="1748" /> three routes the driver testers will use and the driving schools will obviously use those routes for their lessons.  The route will include a hill, a roundabout and a place to do a reverse turn.  People learn to drive on the same avenues and on the same hills.  It is a crazy system of examination.  This is another reason people are not skilled when they get on the road and have problems.</P>
      <P>Uninsured drivers should be taken off the road automatically.  There should be no such thing as a fine.  They should be taken off the road and have their vehicles impounded.  There is a precedent for this where a commercial vehicle is concerned. Under EC regulations when a driver reaches the mileage allowed on his tachograph he is not supposed to drive any further; if his vehicle is overloaded, he is not allowed to take that vehicle beyond the point where it is being weighed, if his tyres do not meet regulation standards he is taken off the road.  Unfortunately, that does not happen here but if a driver from Ireland goes across the water and his vehicle does not reach the required standard in any respect, it is impounded until the tachograph or tyres are repaired or the load is taken off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International drivers from Ireland have found themselves in Liverpool for three or four days or their vehicles were impounded on the Continent.  The biggest danger we have here in terms of commercial vehicles are the drivers who come from Northern Ireland and try to get back in a hurry.  They will pass you on the Naas Road doing 85 to 90 miles per hour, even on a wet night.  They do not even have mud-flaps on the back wheels and they create serious problems. What happens if they are stopped for speeding?  They are let off.  They go back to Northern Ireland and do not return for the court hearings.  If their vehicles are overloaded they are allowed back North; if their tachograph is not in order they are allowed go to the North to get it repaired but if a driver from Ireland goes to Great Britain and his vehicle does not fulfil the standard laid down in the regulations it is impounded.  Vehicles should be impounded if the drivers are uninsured, irrespective of the excuse, as <Col N="1749" /> happens when a vehicle is found to contain agricultural diesel.  Why should it not be impounded for the much more serious offence of uninsured driving?</P>
    <P>We must introduce a law to ban all drinking while driving.  There is no point suggesting that you can reduce the amount of alcohol a driver consumes.  If there was a complete ban people could not drive and the accident rate would be cut dramatically.  Drivers who drink should not drive.  There is no point saying people can take one point, two points, three pints or even half a pint.  Each person's metabolism is different so there is no point talking about limits.  A total ban on drinking and driving would have a more adverse effect on people in rural areas than on people in urban areas where there are taxis available 24 hours a day. In terms of drinking and driving, young people today are much more mature than many older people.</P>
    <P>One of the higher costs in insurance costs is for medical evidence.  One of the reasons for this is that very highly paid surgeons and medical people are asked to go to court and sit there day after day and at the end of the day, perhaps 60 per cent of the cases will be fixed out of court. Even if the matter is settled in court after a number of days, the doctors will not necessarily be called to give evidence.  A great deal of money could be saved if affidavits were taken from these medical experts.  Not alone would you save the cost in insurance terms but these people would be able to get on with their jobs.</P>
    <P>Some orthopaedic surgeons who work for health boards spend more time in court than they do treating the people in the health board areas.  At health board or county council meetings complaints are made that hip operations are not taking place or that orthopaedic procedures are not being carried out.  Often they cannot be done because the orthopaedic surgeon has been summoned to give evidence in a whiplash claim; on occasions the surgeon is not called to give medical evidence.  Why then should the surgeon be obliged to attend court?  If we accept that the surgeon will be truthful we should accept an affidavit.  That is as <Col N="1750" /> good as going to court and swearing on the Bible and it would save money.</P>
    <P>As regards compensation, there should be a set figure for the loss of a finger, two fingers and so on.  The compensation should relate to the type of accident.  The loss in earnings should also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Garda are doing a great job trying to contain the number of accidents.  We should have an extended corps to deal with traffic.  Such a corps would help to reduce the number of accidents and this would lead to a reduction in the number of insurance claims thereby bringing down the cost of insurance cover.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter we are discussing is very important.  We all know there is no possibility of getting cheap motor insurance here, even for experienced drivers.  For young drivers it is an absolute nightmare. Insurance companies are obviously concerned about the increase in the cost of insurance.  It has been going up annually. Seldom a year passes without an increase being announced.  The situation here has been extremely negative in terms of the cost of motor insurance in recent years. As a result the Irish Insurance Federation commissioned the Coopers and Lybrand report which was presented last month. The purpose of that report was to show, in an independent fashion, that the high cost of insurance was not disproportionate in terms of the claims, that the high premiums were justified by the high claims.  Its findings were alarming. It showed that personal accidents here were two-and-a-half times greater than in the United Kingdom and that they <Col N="1751" /> were four times more expensive.  Fatal accidents were two-and-a-half times more likely in Ireland compared to the United Kingdom and serious accidents which were not fatal were one-and-a-quarter times more likely.  Accident comprehensive claims were at a ratio of 3:1 between Ireland the Great Britain.  Non-comprehensive claims were at an incredible ratio of 5:1.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the cost of repairs were one third greater in Ireland than in Great Britain.  Those are absolutely damning statistics in terms of the number of claims, the degree of seriousness and their cost.</P>
    <P>The companies then looked at the losses they had incurred.  They stated that in terms of the premia obtained there was a loss factor in Ireland between 1987 and 1990 of 31.7 per cent.  In the United Kingdom which had a much lower rate of minor and serious accidents it was 19.2 per cent.  The old chestnut, that motor insurance in Ireland and in the United Kingdom is a loss making operation, is not true.</P>
    <P>The last statistic I would mention from the Irish Insurance Federation report is the survey of complaints to the Companies' Offices.  Last year, 56 per cent of requests for information complained about the cost and non-availability of insurance.</P>
    <P>There appears to be conclusive proof that Ireland is a serious risk country in terms of motor travel and motor accidents. There is a greater concentration of motor vehicles in Britain and earnings in Britain are higher but we are suffering disproportionately for some reason.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to motorbike insurance is absolutely appalling.  It appears that motorbike insurance is dominated by one company, Norwich Union, who seem to be operating what is equivalent to a restrictive practice.  For example, it is impossible to get a pillion passenger insured.  Should a pillion passenger be allowed on a motorbike if it is not possible to get insurance cover?  It is impossible for motorcyclists to get a no claims bonus.  A motorcyclist who has <Col N="1752" /> had a licence for a number of years and a good record cannot get any benefit. That is a restrictive practice.  There is no reduction for full motorcycle driving licence holders either as should be the case.  As a result, about 80 per cent of motorcyclists have only provisional licences.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that since the 1978 legislation made helmets mandatory, minor accidents and serious accidents have increased.  In 1979, of the number of people killed in Ireland in Road accidents, 9.2 per cent were motorcyclists and in 1988 this figure increased to 11.4 per cent.  In 1987 it was 15.2 per cent, a very high figure, and that despite the fact that helmets were made mandatory in 1978.  Since 1978 there has been an increase every year in the number of motorcycle fatalities, despite making the wearing of helmets mandatory.  The number of motor bikes on the roads have decreased in the last quarter of the century, from approximately 50,000 to 24,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>And still the number of accidents has increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The accident rate increases all the time.  In 1979 there were 30,866 motorcycles, and in 1989 the figure was 24,492 a drop of over 20 per cent.  Yet the number of accidents has increased as has the number of fatalities. We have introduced safety measures so clearly there must be other factors that are bringing about these serious accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect was the question of using headlights during daylight hours. While that is mandatory in other countries, a survey carried out in Trinity College showed there was a greater likelihood of accidents occurring during the day.  In fact, the survey showed that using headlights during the day, there was 50 per cent greater risk of being involved in an accident with another vehicle.  Now, virtually 100 per cent of motorcyclists use headlights during day time, although it increases the likelihood of accidents.  These are very serious matters <Col N="1753" /> that need to be taken into consideration. We must ask why has the situation deteriorated, despite the fact that we have put in place safety measures and the number of motorcycles on the road has declined.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the solution is not to be found in the behaviour of the motorcyclists but in external factors.  We have not carried out a survey to find out the reasons and until we have closely examined the situation, we will not come up with a solution to this conundrum of increased fatalities despite the increase in safety standards.</P>
    <P>The problems to be solved are many in terms of the number of claims: why are the numbers so great, why are they so expensive and what can be done to reduce them?  There is a lot to be said about the quality of driving and, as Senator Lanigan said, very often driving tests take place under ideal conditions, on an approved stretch of road and during the day.  There is no test at night or when there is ice on the road.</P>
    <P>I am not sure people know the rules of the road.  It is easy to learn what is required for the test, and that is the end of it.  There does not seem to be a thorough awareness of the rules of the road; certainly there is not a thorough application of them.  As regards enforcement of the law in relation to the rules of the road, we have the same attitude to that as we have to the consumption of alcohol &mdash; a nod and a wink.  We turn a blind eye to it.  We do not have enough enforcement officers at the critical time, particularly at nighttime when people are going to and leaving pubs.</P>
    <P>The quality of our roads is another major factor.  In the last local election there were &ldquo;pot hole&rdquo; candidates in certain parts of the country; they were not cranks but were actually elected.  This did not happen by chance but because we have very poor roads.  Obviously that leads to accidents as well.</P>
    <P>In terms of criminal behaviour, joyriding is a major factor in our cities.  It gives rise to many accidents and a number of fatalities.  These joyriders can seriously damage property, and they steal and burn <Col N="1754" /> cars.  That is another factor we have to look at.</P>
    <P>As regards claims, the level of awards for pain and suffering, for that rather elusive factor the bad back, the whiplash, the accident that brings about a medical condition that is very difficult to put one's finger on, must be looked at.</P>
    <P>It was claimed that if we abolished the jury system all our problems would be solved because juries were over-generous and did not understand the cost of the award they made.  That was unfounded and everybody knows it because juries only operate on the recommendation and advice of the judge.  They seldom vary from his advice.  Now that we no longer have juries, in the cases, the cost of awards is just as expensive.</P>
    <P>The late settlement of claims is a major problem.  It can take a considerable period before a claim is settled.  The whole paraphernalia of a court and a judicial system is put in place and professional people come to court either voluntarily or they are compelled to come. That in itself requires quite a considerable outlay in terms of medical and legal professional fees.  We must do much more to settle such cases much earlier.</P>
    <P>There is one major solution I would offer, and that is education.  It would not only be possible but most desirable that second level education would cover the rules of the road and driving testing so that everybody going through the second level educational system would be carefully imbued with an awareness of the rules of the road, the danger of accidents and have training in driving.  It can be done in the classroom.  One does not have to go to an expensive driving school.  It could be done with the existing resources that are part and parcel of civics education, which we are in the process of revamping under the National Council for Curriculum for Examination and Assessment.  Everybody leaving school would have a good grilling in the rules of the road and would also have an opportunity of doing the driving test.  It would all be done in an environment of care and understanding.  I would regard that as a most important development.  The <Col N="1755" /> Government and insurance companies must come together and look at this issue. It is impossible to get proper comprehensive insurance cover at a reasonable price.  If that could be done in the schools the young driver would no longer be a learner but an accomplished driver. That person would have been tested rigorously and examined on their knowledge of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>Early settlement is probably the second best way of ensuring that insurance costs are reduced.  Most of the high cost of insurance arises from legal fees.  It is not the amounts of awards.  One will find that the award is seldom greater than the cost of legal fees and they should be addressed.  We should speed up the legal process and move towards redressing the damage caused rather than trying to ascertain in a comfrontational fashion who is most to blame because that is what soaks up all the costs.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more education on driving skills and a streamlined procedure for dealing with accidents to eliminate major legal costs.  That would go a long way towards improving our situation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and congratulate him on his well deserved promotion.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution to this very interesting debate on motor insurance costs.  I will conclude at 4.50 p.m. to allow Senator Manning to contribute. The cost of motor insurance in Ireland has been increasing for many years.  It is now so serious that it has gone beyond all comprehension.  Premiums have soared for everyone reaching massive levels for those aspiring young drivers fortunate enough to be able to get cover.</P>
      <P>I had occasion recently to negotiate insurance for my daughter who is working 25 miles away from home and must use a car.  I tried a number of brokers and the quotes were from £1,783 down to £710 which I thought was absolutely scandalous.  Eventually I negotiated for £710.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> It is a terrible burden on any young driver and that does not apply only to my daughter but to many young people who are working away from home and must provide their own transport.  They are forced into purchasing a car and it is a big expense for them.</P>
    <P>Premiums for young drivers are outrageous given that every one of them under 30 years of age are regarded as a high risk.  One can be forgiven for saying that if this continues insurance companies will only be interested in giving car insurance to a very small group here, those they deem to be no risk who would give the profits the insurance companies are looking for.  We were promised that the abolition of juries would see a corresponding reduction in the price of insurance.  What happened was quite the reverse.  In 1989-90 we had a price increase in insurance costs of 25 per cent. Drastic action must be taken and we must get to the root cause of these costs in the motor insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Motorists have only been able to look with envy at the situation in Britain where cover is so much cheaper.  Irish insurers claim that the blame does not lie with them.  They admit premiums are very expensive but maintain they are forced to charge them and apply such restrictive entry costs for first time drivers because of the high level of claims and court awards in personal injury cases.  They point to increasing underwriting losses which topped the £130 million mark in 1990 in answer to charges of profiteering at the expense of consumers.  I note that there is good news in that the industry does not expect premiums to go up during this year.  Underwriting losses fell sharply in 1991, possibly halving, to about £65 million.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a report by Coopers and Lybrand, which was commissioned by the Irish Insurance Federation, supported the claim of the industry but called for an action plan to address the main factors leading to the huge gap in claim costs with the UK.  As regards the value and frequency of personal injury claims its findings show that despite premium differentials with the UK of an average of 48 <Col N="1757" /> per cent higher for comprehensive cover and 133 per cent higher for non-comprehensive or third party insurance, underwriting losses in Ireland have been much higher.  The report states that while Irish people make fewer claims than their UK counterparts, it is the personal injury content of these claims that pushes up the cost of them in Ireland.  Personal injury claims are two-and-a-half times more likely to arise in the Republic of Ireland than in Britain &mdash; a statistic which suggests that the Irish motorist is more reckless than those in the UK.  Two-and-a-half times more people die on the roads in the Republic of Ireland each year than in Britain.  I agree with Senator Costello's remarks with regard to car repair costs and I do not wish to repeat what he said.</P>
    <P>The move away from jury awards three years ago has not brought the cost of premiums down.  However, a leading member of the insurance federation said recently that the awards were not getting larger and this was encouraging.  It offers some hope that competition and the drive for the market share might make driving less expensive.</P>
    <P>The Garda campaign against drink driving over the Christmas period was a success.  Many young people in Kerry, especially in Tralee, rather than driving through urban areas to discos, socials and so on, tend to take taxies.  They seem to have established this as a practice.  The Garda campaign should continue all year.</P>
    <P>The instances of uninsured driving is massive.  This is partly due to the fact that premiums are excessive for young people.  The law, I understand, states that for a first offence of no insurance there is an endorsement on a licence and for a second offence a six month ban is imposed.  The law should be altered to ensure that uninsured drivers are banned from driving and fined in the first instance and a jail term for a further offence.  We must also keep in mind that the insurance fund must meet the cost of damage caused by uninsured drivers.  This again adds to premium costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote some statistics that have come to hand.  Accidents are <Col N="1758" /> more numerous on main roads than on county roads.  Most accidents occur with new cars and very few learner drivers have accidents.  I also understand that the majority of accidents, possibly 70 per cent, take place between 11.30 p.m. and 2 a.m.  We were told some years ago that testing would help reduce insurance costs but, in fact, the opposite occurred.  I understand that Government action is under way to bring motor insurance costs into line with those in Northern Ireland and Britain by curbing large court personal injury awards.  I look forward to this change assisting many young drivers obtain substantial reductions in the cost of insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address one specific issue on which I have an interest, an issue which was brought very dramatically into the headlines yesterday through the award of the first structured settlement on this island in Belfast.  I should like to quote the following from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 March:</P>
      <P>In the first structured settlement in the North, Jane Kearney who is confined to a wheelchair, will get an immediate payment of £90,000 and £13,694 every year for the rest of her life, rising annually by 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judge yesterday said it seemed a better way of handling such cases because they provided an annual income which is index linked.  The award will cover a <Col N="1759" /> minimum period of 20 years.  The solicitor who handled the matter said that:</P>
    <P>Structured settlements take away a lot of financial worries of the victim in that the system is designed to ensure that compensation will be received over a period of time.</P>
    <P>The question of structured settlements has been around for a number of years. To my knowledge, it first came to prominence in 1982, in the O'Donoghue report on the cost of motor insurance. The committee examining the question put forward a proposal for what they called periodic payments.  I will explain the concept in a moment.  Since then, the idea has been explored by the Department, the Law Society and the insurance industry and all have come out fairly strongly in favour of it.  The Incorporated Law Society of Ireland gazette, dated October 1989 stated:</P>
    <P>When a plaintiff receives a lump sum of compensation it may well be the single largest amount of money he or she has ever received.  For somebody who is not used to dealing with money there is a danger it will be spent foolishly rather than invested wisely.  This is borne out by figures in England and the United States which indicate that, even in the case of very substantial awards, half of the successful claimants will have spent the compensation within three years of receiving it and the vast majority will have done so within five years.</P>
    <P>A further problem is that if the person is very seriously injured, he is unlikely to get advantage or pleasure from a large lump sum and it may well cause jealousy and resentment between him and his loved ones.  It may put him in a position where he has to buy their affection by giving them presents and so forth.  Unless the lump sum is very skilfully invested, inflation will erode it and may cause real hardship.</P>
    <P>We have seen in this country where very <Col N="1760" /> large sums of money were awarded to people as a result of accidents.  Obviously the money was rightly determined by the court but it was not invested wisely and within a short number of years once again the person became a charge on the public purse.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of structured settlements which involve a once off payment and then payment on an annual basis are designed to ensure that the person who has been so injured has a guaranteed steady income for life, determined by the courts as to what is appropriate to meet their requirement and which also, of course, is index linked.  As I understand it, this idea is commonly accepted in the US, Canada, Britain and, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, about 60 further cases are now in the pipeline in Northern Ireland where structured settlements may be applied.  This practice is widely accepted.  The insurance companies themselves will buy an annuity which will allow for the payment of the structured settlement.</P>
    <P>As I understand it the idea of periodic payments received approval in the O'Donoghue report in 1982, and since then, the Law Society have come out very strongly in favour of it.  The insurance industry have also examined the concept and are strongly in favour of its introduction here.  From conversations I have had with individual judges who specialise in or who frequently handle cases of this kind, they are favourable to the idea. Last year an interdepartmental committee which included a number of Departments, and was chaired by the Department of Industry and Commerce, looked at ways of reducing the cost of motor insurance and examined this idea. It is my understanding, although the report has not been published, that they are very favourable towards it.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the matter went into the maw of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, that endless bottomless hole into which good ideas go and from which they never appear again.  It appears that there is a problem although not a huge one, as to how this money would be taxed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> Clearly this award should not be taxed. If a person gets the full lump sum it is not taxed, but the Revenue Commissioners are not very keen to allow what they would regard as income to be untaxed. But it is not income, and that I gather, is where the problem lies.</P>
    <P>Other countries &mdash; Britain, Canada and the US &mdash; have faced up to this problem and have overcome it.  We had a precedent here, which has not been followed, in the Baby Dunne v. Holles Street Hospital, where the annual amount, if it were to be taxed, would be pointless.  The nub of the issue is should the annuity be taxed.  I believe strongly it should not be.  If it is then the attraction of prudent investment and the guaranteed annual income for the injured party disappears.</P>
    <P>This matter could be resolved either in the current Finance Bill, which will be published in Easter week, or simply by the Revenue Commissioners agreeing to change the regulations.  As I understand it, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance see no great urgency in this matter.  I think it is a matter of urgency.  It could be a factor in reducing the cost of motor insurance.  In the interests of people who have been very seriously injured in motor accidents, this possibility should be there for them. They should have the possibility of either having the money paid to them annually, guaranteed for life and index-linked with their immediate needs taken care of rather than the immediate once off lump sum payment which may not be adequate for their needs and which may well be dissipated, leaving them a charge on the public purse.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister when reporting back to his Department to put pressure on the Department of Finance to see what they are going to do.  I hope the Minister will see his way to bringing this country into line with Northern Ireland and other countries where structured settlements are the norm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate being facilitated. There has been an ongoing debate on the structure of motor insurance and the enormous difficulties both from the insurance companies' point of view and from the users' point of view in getting adequate coverage.  In many areas, such as County Wexford, lobby groups have been established and have been very effective in recent years in bringing the plight of those who wish to have reasonable insurance cover to the fore and to the Minister's attention.  I commend the Wexford motor insurance action group for their hard work over the last couple of years, particularly their secretary, Áine O'Grady and their PRO, John Doyle, who have held a regular series of meetings in all districts in my constituency and have very effectively lobbied Oireachtas Members of all persuasions.  That such a group should be necessary and have such an enormous following at public meetings makes a statement in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with the excellent contributions that have been made on all sides of the House and the detailing of the difficulties with the accident rate, our claims rate, the level of compensation, uninsured drivers, bad roads, poor car stock and the cost of spare parts, the standard of driving and drink driving &mdash; many factors that combine to make an extremely difficult situation impossible. We recently had an excellent report compiled by Coopers and Lybrand on behalf of the Irish Insurance Federation which ultimately concluded that the rate of premiums in this country were not excessive given the large number of factors that <Col N="1763" /> made life very difficult for the insurance companies.  That does not make good reading for the many people who want car insurance and motorcycle insurance which is proving even more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Coopers and Lybrand report justifies this finding by saying that in this country personal injury claims are two and a half times more likely in the Republic than in the UK, non-comprehensive claims are five times more expensive, comprehensive claims are three times more expensive and personal injury claims are four times more expensive in Ireland than in the UK and damage claims twice as expensive here as in the UK.  They say the fatal accident rate here is 2.5 times the UK rate and the serious injuries rate 1.25 times higher.  The report pointed out that spare parts prices here are 33 per cent higher than in the UK and car repair times much longer. Those factors combine to lead Coopers and Lybrand to conclude that the rate of premiums here is not excessive and that reflects the payments made on the higher rate of claims here.  It is over now to the Minister, and the interdepartmental group set up some time ago to bring sense and rationality to a most difficult area affecting private lives, business and employment.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland where public transport is virtually non-existent a car or a motorbike is not a luxury when used for getting to and from work.  Many a person has lost a job or has been unable to take up employment for lack of transport arising in most cases from the lack of insurance cover for cars and bikes.</P>
    <P>How will the next EC directive on non-life insurance be handled here?  Will we have the insurance Ombudsman recommended by various interested parties in the discussion on the EC non-life directive or the third life directive?  This directive will have important implications for the insurance industry here as it provides for free movement in relation to sales of insurance.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter as we need a clear understanding of implications for <Col N="1764" /> the industry and for the insured person of changes that will come in post 1 January 1993 or when the Single Market is in operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the problem of motorbike users.  At the moment the Norwich Union Insurance Company are virtually the only insurance company who will cover motorbikes.  It has been said to me that they have a monopoly of his business.  I am sure the Norwich Union Company do not want a monopoly, they would probably be happy to shed their responsibility in this area but they remain the only insurance company covering motorbike users.  They have dominated the market for many years and now propose to replace their rider policy with a specified bike policy with a 20 per cent increase in premiums. The rider policy is essential to motorcyclists and has been offered automatically to all applicants by the Norwich Union Company for many years.  Its removal will not have any effect on accidents or claims but is being seen as an excuse for the insurer to increase the take from premiums their specified bike policies are more expensive.  The Norwich Union Company claim to be losing money on motorbike insurance and I will not debate that claim given the findings of the Coopers and Lybrand report.  Many people, particularly motorcyclists find the claims unbelievable as they pay premiums that are five to six times higher than those currently set in the UK.  In the UK comprehensive theft and other cover options are readily available to bike users.  I ask the Minister to bring this matter to his Senior Minister's and his Department's attention immediately and to indicate what assistance either his Minister or the interdepartmental group can give to motorcyclists.  Young people in particular use motorbikes to get to and from work particularly in rural Ireland where they do not have the option of public transport.</P>
    <P>The taxation of claims and award payments was covered by Senator Manning and a response on that point would be welcome as I believe it is one of the recommendations of the interdepartmental <Col N="1765" /> group.  What action will be taken now on the findings of the interdepartmental group?  Are the Government in a position to respond to the Insurance Industry Federation's report by Coopers and Lybrand and to the interesting and difficult findings detailed in it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Wexford Motor Insurance Action Group.  In a rural constituency private transport is essential to enable people to get to and from work and for private and leisure activities.  If the rate of premiums continues to drive both car policy holders and motorbike policy holders out of business rural Ireland will be affected more seriously than cities and larger towns.  We have all talked about this issue for far too long with little evidence of action.  I await ministerial response.  The interdepartmental group, from what we hear, are coming up with some rather interesting findings; perhaps they should restore the motor insurance advisory group; if I give it its correct title &mdash; that went out of existence some time ago.  Perhaps the insurance Ombudsman, if he or she becomes a reality, will help in this area.  Above all it is now Government responsibility to resolve an issue causing difficulty for old and young alike, which is causing job losses as well as restricting peoples' enjoyment of their leisure time.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Appropriation Bill is one of the most fundamental debates held in the Seanad every year; in it we address the overall financing of the State.  Members can express their views, look back over the previous year, assess value for money <Col N="1766" /> in relation to all Departments and, in general, have a look at Government performance during that year.  I am very pleased with the performance of the Government in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>When addressing the Appropriation Bill one must have regard to Government strategy going back to 1987.  The Fianna Fáil Government, a minority Government at the time of taking office that year, brought about financial rectitude. Their strategy was aimed at reducing the national debt, fostering economic confidence and minimising inflation.  That Government achieved all those objectives and the present Government are continuing in the same vein.  The Government then and the Government of today are trying to rectify public finances in the hope that Ireland will be able to generate greater economic activity.  Trade Unions and other social partners have co-operated with Government in trying to bring this about and must be complimented for that.  Trade unions, farmers and the business sector have all been pragmatic, moderate and understanding in their demands and conscious of the nation's difficulties.</P>
      <P>Great strides have been made in the tourist industry over the past years. There has been enormous progress over the last four or five years in providing modern accommodation and restaurant facilities which are a credit to everybody involved.  I congratulate Bord Fáilte and the regional tourist boards for their great work.  I commend family run hotels and guesthouses because their season is particularly short.</P>
      <P>Agriculture, our main industry, is vital to our economy.  The Common Agricultural Policy has served the European Community well over the past 20 years. We have a continuous supply of the best food in the world at competitive prices. Ten million people are employed on the land of Europe.  The Americans are now demanding that Europe remove subsidies, but the removal of them would drive millions of farmers off the land and would create major social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of what Americans say, their agriculture is highly subsidised.  According <Col N="1767" /> to the OECD report the United States spent $21,000 per farmer in 1988 compared with $10,000 per farmer for the European Communities.  Americans pay their farmers more than double what their European counterparts receive.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made to see export markets to the Middle East opened for our cattle and beef trade.  If these efforts are successful it will ease the current situation in the cattle trade.  In this respect I compliment the Government, the farming organisations and agencies who have tried hard to have this market re-opened. I also compliment our EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, for the good work he is doing, making sure that we have a greater percentage of intervention which is a great help to our farmers.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the economy we think of figures on the live register of unemployed increasing constantly which gives cause for concern.  That is a trend in other countries too.  I read last week that unemployment figures in Britain have risen for the 23rd month.  This problem confronts not only Ireland but other European countries as well.  I know unemployment figures are high but are they genuinely so?  How many people on the live register draw unemployment benefit and work also?  In my own area I have seen a chap signing on at the Garda barracks and being picked up by another employee shortly afterwards to do some work.  This is most unfair.  I read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> some time ago of a clamp down on people engaged in dole moonlighting and offenders should be penalised.</P>
    <P>An article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on Wednesday, 14 March, outlined the case of a woman with a sick husband.  In order to supplement the family income from social welfare the husband undertook some work.  A neighbour reported him and he was harassed by the social welfare officer.  It is only right that anyone trying to defraud the nation should be questioned. The real culprit is an employer who employs people while on the dole. They are penalising the Government in two ways if they employ people drawing <Col N="1768" /> dole as they do not pay PRSI or other taxes that should be payed from employees.  These people should be tracked down and heavier penalties imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello in his contribution last week spoke about the emphasis on unemployment and also mentioned the jobs forum.  I cannot see why the Opposition parties did not agree to participate in the jobs forum suggested by the Taoiseach and the Government.  On 19 November in Dáil Éireann, the Labour Party moved a motion in Private Members' Time to set up an Oireachtas Joint social and economic committee.  Deputy Ruairí Quinn who proposed the motion said:</P>
    <P>This motion calls for the establishment of a social and economic committee. No one doubts that the country is facing economic and social problems on an enormous scale.  As recently as last week two publications coming from diverse quarters served to underline our serious economic and social problems....</P>
    <P>The motion proposes to establish on a statutory basis an Oireachtas social and economic affairs committee.  It would draw its membership from both Houses of the Oireachtas and would have its own independent staff with adequate resources to enable it to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>That is what this Government propose in the establishment of the new jobs forum. I cannot understand why the Opposition parties have changed their minds since last November as their proposal then is the same as the Government's present one.  Deputy Quinn continued:</P>
    <P>The committee would become the eyes and ears of the Oireachtas in responding to the economic and social problems which confront our people. ... The committee would provide a forum for dialogue and discussion between representatives of social partners who have now been virtually institutionalised.</P>
    <P>In the same debate Deputy Noonan of Fine Gael stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> I would like to talk about the situation in relation to jobs because this motion envisages that the proposed committee would discuss employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan was in favour and Fine Gael were in favour of the Oireachtas Joint Committee set up at the time to examine job creation.  What was right then should be right now.  Is it for political expediency or opportunism that they now oppose this important committee the Taoiseach and Government are anxious to set up to examine unemployment and jobs?  It would be wrong if, for political reasons, this committee on unemployment was placed in jeopardy.  I appeal to them to give this committee an opportunity to work.  It would be a similar committee to the one they suggested in their proposal in the Dáil last November.</P>
    <P>The Government have an enormous task facing them and we have seen some unexpected problems arise in the last two weeks.  I know the Government have the will and capacity to tackle these problems. I hope the year ahead will be successful and fruitful and that we will see a big dent in the frightening unemployment figures that are the cancer in our society. That is all the more reason that Opposition parties should agree to the Government proposal to set up an Oireachtas Joint Committee on jobs and unemployment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will spare no effort to resolve that serious social problem; it tears the heart out of families to see their young people emigrating.  We know this recession is hitting not just Ireland but other countries in Europe and America.  In other countries where once Irish people were almost guaranteed jobs, they now find it hard to get jobs.  I wish the Government every success and hope that for all our sakes they will make every effort to tackle the serious problems facing us.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Kenneally on his appointment as Minister and welcome him to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations <Col N="1770" /> to the Minister and in welcoming him to this House.  If there are any long lulls in my speech he will be able to do what I do in similar circumstances, that is, study the extraordinarily beautiful ceiling we have in the Seanad Chamber. I am sure, without being partisan, he will agree with me that this is a finer place in which to debate, architecturally speaking, than the House to which he belongs.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points I would like to raise in this series of statements on the allocations.  The first one arises from my position as an academic.  I have been advised by some of my academic colleagues of a small matter which the Minister might like to review, dealing with the taxation of visiting academics. The effect of the existing provisions runs contrary to the Government's clear intentions to support and encourage the exchange of academic personnel between different European countries and between this country and North America.</P>
      <P>I refer to the existence of double taxation agreements between this country and the United States and with Australia, and I presume with other countries, too. These agreements with the USA and Australia provide that if an academic comes to teach in an Irish institution he or she does not come within the domestic tax net here if the academic post does not exceed one year.  These agreements were made in the days before pay-related social insurance deductions applied to people of this income bracket.  Consequently the exemption that was entered into by the Government on foot of this double taxation arrangement did not include any reference to pay-related social insurance.  I believe this was an oversight and I ask the Minister to examine this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this oversight a visiting professor receives a salary without deduction of tax but is obliged to pay 7.5 per cent PRSI and the host university has to pay 12.5 per cent share as the employer's responsibility.  That constitutes a tax of 20 per cent on visiting academics that has crept in surreptitiously. It is clearly wrong and a <Col N="1771" /> violation of certain kinds of natural justice that a visiting academic should have to contribute to a scheme from which he or she will never obtain any benefit. Universities have to contribute to the cost of having visiting staff, especially if they have to bear the employee PRSI proportion also which I imagine they would often do.  In other words, universities accidentally and not by any malign intention of the Government have to pay an extra 20 per cent for carrying out a Government objective of encouraging relationships between different academic institutions.</P>
    <P>This outcome is counter to the exemption spirit of double taxation agreements and was not intended when they were made.  It suggests that the Minister might look favourably at this very small adjustment; the loss to the Exchequer would not be huge but its resolution would encourage the exchange of ideas and I ask the Minister to consider abolishing this unintended taxation measure in the interests of Irish universities.</P>
    <P>I refer to another parallel matter fairly sensitively because I am one of the people involved.  There are proposals in the social welfare element of the budget to exclude from any benefit persons earning over £25,000 a year.  This is unjust because people should not be taxed in order to provide benefits from which the payees are excluded entirely.  People with an income of over £25,000 should be taxed and should pay pay-related social insurance; I am happy that out of the tax contributions of people like myself earning more than £25,000 from combined incomes, additional people who cannot pay for themselves are afforded proper health and social insurance schemes.  That is absolutely just.</P>
    <P>I do not mind how many people I bring with me, but it is slightly galling to find oneself excluded from the few remaining marginal benefits such as dental and optical treatment.  I ask if this may be looked at.  I do not say this in a penny-pinching way but as a matter of justice. It would not worry me if my PRSI contribution was increased; I believe in <Col N="1772" /> paying my fair share but I think I should also be allowed to benefit from these provisions which I help fund.</P>
    <P>The main burden of what I want to say is about a larger subject.  It is not about our domestic situation except in so far as it relates to the psychology of the Irish people but refers to Overseas Development Aid and the regrettable continuing series of aid cutbacks implemented by every Government since the mid-1980s, in clear contradiction of statements by Government leaders.  I have before me a statement which I think was made in September 1990, to a world conference on children by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  He said:</P>
    <P>The developed countries have a special responsibility in bringing about an international political and economic environment that is just, secure and humane.  Such an environment is required to advance the well being of all the world's children.  However, for the developing countries, especially the least developed ones, it is vital to support their development efforts.  The success of these efforts which must be supported by the developed world offers the best chance of improving the situation on the hundreds of millions of children who even today live in poverty and destitution.</P>
    <P>Those were fine words and I am sure they were genuinely meant by Deputy Haughey, but instead of an increase for aid in the budget as Deputy Haughey suggested would be a kind of moral imperative only 18 months ago, we find not an increase or even maintenance of the previous level but a further reduction. I quote from the Irish National Committee of UNICEF with whom I have been in correspondence: &ldquo;The proposed allocation to UNICEF from the Government is £240,000 for this year compared with £420,000 in 1991.&rdquo;  This suggests that the Government's pledge of support for the declaration and plan of action in respect of developing countries has not lasted very long; there is a direct contradiction between political statements by leaders of Government on the one <Col N="1773" /> hand and allocations of moneys by the Government for Overseas Development Aid, and support to UNICEF and so on. This is a great shame.</P>
    <P>Ireland, officially, has the image of a parsimonious, pennypinching, Scrooge-like figure in Europe.  We have the worst <i>per capita</i> foreign aid record in Europe expressed as a percentage of GNP which is shameful when we remember that personal contribution of aid by Irish people are among the most generous in the world.  The psychic trauma of the Great Famine of the 1840s left its mark on the psychology of Irish people; we understand with a kind of racial memory the sufferings of famine and deprivation, and consequently Irish people have been outstandingly generous in their contributions to Oxfam, Trócaire, UNICEF and so on.  At the time of the Band Aid charity concert, the Irish people gave three times <i>per capita</i> more than people in the United Kingdom where the concert took place.  That generosity of the Irish people is being cynically capitalised upon by Government who absorb the ever increasing amounts contributed voluntarily by the Irish people in order to cushion themselves as they consistently reduce the target figures for overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a very well written and thought-provoking article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 18 March 1992, by Fintan O'Toole who has, as I am sure the Minister will recollect, consistently spoken on the subject of the cutbacks in overseas development aid over a number of years.  He illustrates very well, clearly and succinctly, the source of the concern of people like myself.  He points out that overseas development aid has been falling consistently in recent years in breach of our international obligations and undertakings. In fact we have been moving away from our target.  The target is 0.7 per cent.  Ireland has been in a state of consistent decline for the past eight or ten years.  That is extremely regrettable.</P>
    <P>Over the period of the last accounting year, the Department of Foreign Affairs accidentally failed to spend somewhere <Col N="1774" /> between £600,000 and £1 million of allocated money.  That sum is then assumed back into the budget and is lost forever. This could be written off as being the result of projects not coming in on time or of administrative detail but in 1990 the amount that came in under this heading was only £60,000.  We are now dealing with at least ten times that amount.  I have to say that that really looks like a cheeseparing exercise.  It looks deliberate.</P>
    <P>In briefing document after briefing document from the various agencies with which I have been in contact they refer to an overall concern that a foreign affairs committee should be established.  I very much welcome the fact that the Government appear, at least, to give a solid commitment that there will be a foreign affairs committee.  A number of the concerns people like myself have will be covered by this foreign affairs committee. However, in the past few months, not only have we not had the development of a foreign affairs committee, we have had the extinction of an important small committee, the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation which was abolished a few months ago.  The excuse given is a directly budgetary one; they wanted to save £84,000.  The Government gave an indication they were going to institute an informal committee in this area.  Where is it?  May I say in parenthesis that, despite the fact that the committee has been extinguished, I understand the Exchequer is still paying the rent on the office.  I wonder if this is a very good saving.  I think such issues should be highlighted.  We got rid of an important committee and said we were going to establish an informal committee, which is rather insulting given the scale of the problem we are addressing here, and we have not done so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actual figures, may I point out &mdash; I am sure the Minister and his advisers are aware of the fact &mdash; that in 1986 the overseas development aid was 0.28 per cent of GNP.  Our target was 0.7 per cent.  It has declined since then and even including all the money raised by Trocaire, Oxfam and the other agencies, <Col N="1775" /> our total aid contribution is now 0.25 per cent of GNP.  The clear conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the Government are relying on the cushioning effect of the generosity of the Irish people in order to skimp on the budget. The figure that was originally produced by the Government in the 1992 Estimates is bad enough but I understand this is further reduced by £200,000, from £43.109 million to £42.904 million in the budget provisions of 29 January.  All the reductions are in the multilateral sector.</P>
    <P>The EC Development Fund &mdash; the Lomé allocation &mdash; actually fell from £7.4 million to £7.25 million and the Food Aid Convention fell from £600,000 to £550,000.  Again, this is clear evidence of an unnecessarily parsimonious attitude that shames this country abroad.  I have received a bewildering number of documents from UNICEF, Oxfam and Trocaire. Oxfam would like to see some real movement, at the earliest opportunity, towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent.  Every Government, including this one, have given a commitment to this.  The Programme for Government, negotiated between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, includes the deliberate stage by stage movement towards this figure of 0.7 per cent whereas what we have had is a movement away from it.</P>
    <P>Oxfam are also seeking a commitment on the part of the Minister to matching emergency aid provisions for Africa in 1992 with the levels committed in 1991 and ensuring that the EC makes a similar matching commitment.  They say there is an immediate need to make further provision to the United Nations SEPHA &mdash; the Special Emergency Programme for the Horn of Africa &mdash; appeal for £621 million for the period February-July.  I do not have the figures before me but I understand that to date the UN have received only £400 million in response to that appeal, that is just two-thirds of the budget for a situation which is of extreme importance.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that 40,000 children are dying per day.  One <Col N="1776" /> quarter of a million children are dying per week from simple food-related problems, in other words starving to death or dying from simple primary infections that could easily be cured with the application of appropriate pharmaceutical remedies which are available in the EC.</P>
    <P>One figure in the Estimates for official overseas development assistance worries me.  The amount for the United Nations relief and development agencies is down from £1 million in 1991 to £800,000.  That is most regrettable.  Disaster relief is down from £1,800,000 to £1 million.  Do the Government anticipate smaller occurrences or disasters in the coming year?  What is the thinking behind this cutback?  The figures released by the Government represent cutbacks amounting to 12 per cent, if expressed in terms of GNP.</P>
    <P>Four simple recommendations have come in from Oxfam.  First, that the European Community should match its 1991 commitment of an extra £140 million ECU, 400,000 tonnes of food aid, by establishing a similar 1992 plan for Africa.  Second, Ireland should match its 1991 commitments to Africa with a similar amount for 1992.  Third, the United Nations should take action at the highest level to help end conflicts in Sudan and Somalia and protect displaced communities in conflict situations.  Obviously, it is not just an economic situation.  The hardship, deprivation, starvation and misery of many people is complicated by complex economic factors which render the provision of assistance to them problematic and expensive.  Finally, it is recommended that Ireland, through the EC, take action with UNCED and GATT and within the United Nations to ensure the long term needs of Africa are met.</P>
    <P>Even as far back as 1989 we were at the bottom of the European table and we still are.  I can wave a graph round, if it is permitted by the rules of the House, but it will not register in the Official Report.  This graph is very dramatic. Norway is at the top of the list followed by Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, <Col N="1777" /> United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria and, last, Ireland.  In terms of <i>per capita</i> percentage of GNP we are bottom of the table and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>Organisations like Campaign-Aid, for example, have pointed out the kind of discrepancies I have mentioned.  In a press statement issued on 29 January this year they said the Minister's, Deputy B. Ahern, first budget was clearly in breach of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats' Programme for Government regarding Third World aid, as the £2.6 million reduction in official development assistance from last year's £45.5 million allocation was inconsistent with the commitment given in the Programme for Government which states that the Government will undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's official development assistance for 1992 to 1994 so as to achieve a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of that period.  In other words, we are getting political promises that it is going to increase and in fact it decreases.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of a situation where I went over a certain barrier in the university and I received exactly the same wage cheque.  I protested to the accountant and he said it was only due to the generosity of the university that I did not receive a negative increment in my pay cheque because by going into a new tax band my pay should have dropped by a small amount.  They had rounded it up to the same amount as before.  I wrote back and said, &ldquo;I know nothing, I am glad to say, of the vulgar science of mathematics but I understand English; there is no such animal as a negative increment, what you are talking about is excrement and you can have it back&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are talking here, in a sense, about negative increments.  Whatever argument may be raised with regard to mathematics there is no such animal either morally or grammatically speaking as a negative increment.  I am sure the Minister understands the point I am making. I urge him to consider this question of overseas development aid very seriously. Every major organisation produced briefing documents protesting at the attitude <Col N="1778" /> and actions of the Government.  I do not believe the actions of the Government, which may be seen as necessary in budgetary terms, represent the wishes of the Fianna Fáil representatives in this House or of the very large majority of Irish people.</P>
    <P>I would like to look very briefly at the question of inner city redevelopment, particularly with regard to housing.  I had some small involvement a number of years ago in persuading the then Minister for Finance to include some small provisions for tax relief for listed buildings within the designated areas.  There were problems involved.  One was that in order to trigger any tax incentive the cubic capacity of the rooms provided by any redevelopment had to be beneath a certain mathematical computation.  I was able to point out that this required the savaging of the beautiful proportions of 18th century rooms and would take us back into a tenement situation.  The Department of Finance were very nervous that we might create a kind of haemorrhage and many restrictions were put in.  The buildings had to be list one buildings, had to be approved by the Department, had to be in the designated area between the two canals and so on.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to request an official in his Department to write to me giving me information about the takeup of this scheme with which I am sure the Department officials will be familiar.  My information is that there has been virtually no takeup.  Perhaps one person has applied. One of the reasons is that there are no proper forms.  I wonder how seriously the Department are taking this matter for which provision was made by three and a half pages of amendments in the budget which were eventually introduced by the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
    <P>Valuable as this opening was it does not really attack or address the situation properly.  What is needed in order to encourage people to do such rehabilitative work and to live in the inner areas of our principal cities is direct cash injections. If people on middle incomes are to be induced to reconstruct the fabric of a <Col N="1779" /> historic building, tax incentives are not of much use to them.  They are of some small use but in order to do something major like repair a roof a conservation grant system is necessary.  Every country in Europe that has successfully done this has introduced such a provision.  I have restored my own house.  I declared my interest in the matter in that people earning more than £25,000 have to pay PRSI and do not benefit.  I have no personal axe to grind here because I have completed my work.  It will not benefit me except as a citizen of one of the major cities.  With a small pilot scheme for direct cash injections we could transform the city in the interests of everybody, not just myself.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Temple Bar area, I was rather amused to see the Government propose retaining the use of a building there as a brothel.  I hope it will not be seen as being too lighthearted of me to say so but long before most of the people who are now hopping on the Temple Bar bandwagon had even heard of the place, I took a lease on a building there in 1978.  There was not one solitary active thing in that area in 1978 except a pub and a barber's shop.  At the extreme fringes of Temple Bar there was the Project Theatre of which I was also a director. In 1978 I took the lease of No. 10 Fownes Street and we created a Gay Community centre, the Hirschfeld Centre.  Into that came a very large number of people.  We ran discotheques for the green movement, the environmental movement, those interested in Wood Quay, in women's issues and so on.  We had a throughput of 1,500 people each week.  That is where the energy to lift that whole area came from.  There is no question of doubt about that.  People who came in spotted the opportunity, started small business and so on.  We released the energy to restore that area.</P>
    <P>I have to say also <i>Pace</i> the Government-sponsored brothel, if one is looking for a Latin quarter, a Bohemian atmosphere or a left bank quality, I do not think one would get it from many of the other establishments; it was the <Col N="1780" /> Hirschfeld Centre that produced that atmosphere in the area.  Yet, what do we see?  Three times I have on the Adjournment asked for money to support the redevelopment of the centre which was destroyed by fire.  Three times it has been cavalierly tossed into the bin, despite Government support.  I would like to put the Minister on notice of one thing.  I know the way European Structural Fund money works and I know the attitude in Brussels.  They make it virtually mandatory to deal positively with people who come from marginalised and disadvantaged groups.  I could, if I were a nasty mean minded person and a dog in the manger, telephone Brussels in the morning and say the Temple Bar area is a wonderful project but who started it?  I could send the history of the project and the debates which show where the Hirschfeld Centre was starved of cash for redevelopment, despite the fact that it saved the State a lot of money by its highly successful crusade against the spread of the Aids infection.  However, the Minister, I hope, will accept my word that I am far too nice a person, far too altruistic, and I wold not spike my own city or my own country by taking such action.  I would like him to look at this situation and see if our needs, as the people who instigated the Temple Bar renewal, could not be accommodated in some way.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise, briefly, the question of Irish Shipping.  Will there ever be provision to make some gesture of decency towards the employees of the former Irish Shipping Company who were literally thrown out on the streets' some of them having given 40 years service in the interests of this nation.  I would like the Minister kindly to give some indication on this.  I am attempting to widen an opportunity that was given me when I raised this matter in relation to another Bill &mdash; The Merchant Shipping Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Woods, took up the point I made and said he was, at that time, instructing civil servants in his Department to investigate the possibility of making some proper allocation for the former employees of Irish Shipping.  I <Col N="1781" /> know this is a concern shared on all sides of the House; I see my friend Senator McGowan nodding.  Everybody in this House feels strongly &mdash; and there was a Fianna Fáil commitment on this &mdash; that these people should have their pension rights honoured at the end of the day.  I would be most grateful if the Minister could at some stage address this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new role as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>We are facing great challenges, the most serious being the massive numbers out of work.  For this reason tremendous efforts must be made to tackle this very serious situation.  The Government, with the co-operation of all parties must make every effort to safeguard existing jobs and to create new jobs.  For this reason I hope the present discussions taking place between the parties with regard to the new jobs forum will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent budget the Government have undertaken a series of special initiatives to confront the problems of escalating unemployment.  In the provision of new employment substantial funds will be provided by the EC for a new employment subsidy scheme; the new in-company training scheme and the unemployment subsidy scheme.  A subsidy of £54 per week for 12 months will be provided for 15,000 additional employees who have been on the unemployment register for at least two months.  The in-company job training scheme will also provide training on the employers' premises <Col N="1782" /> for up to 10,000 people who have been on the unemployment register for at least two months.  This is a very important development and will perhaps become a permanent feature of Irish training systems in the future.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure on these two schemes is estimated to come to approximately £70 million in the years 1992-93. Of this, the European Social Fund will contribute up to £60 million with the remainder coming from Irish employers and the Exchequer.  These schemes will certainly help to improve our unemployment situation and other schemes will also be put in place by public agencies. Hopefully some impact will be made on the unemployment figure during 1992 and 1993.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland we have a major problem due to the number of farmers leaving the land because of the serious drop in their incomes over recent years.  Many of these farmers move into the urban areas in the hope of getting employment.  This situation came to the fore in the figures released in the census of population which highlighted the serious imbalance between many rural and urban areas.  The population in the west has shown a major drop while the population on the east coast has increased.  That trend will continue unless serious efforts are made to curb it in the west.  In recent times the bishops held many meetings, mostly in the west.  They were all very well attended and have highlighted the situation, but the one common denominator coming through from all these meetings was that people are desperate to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>A very influential group in Dublin are lobbying for direct transatlantic flights into Dublin at the expense of Shannon Airport.  If this were allowed to happen it would mean a loss of up to 2,000 jobs at Shannon.  This cannot be allowed to happen as leading travel agents have already indicated that up to 80 per cent of the holidaymakers coming to the country wish to come in at Shannon.  Tourism is important to our economy, especially in the mid-west area which has 3,240 grade A bed nights as against approximately <Col N="1783" /> 970 grade A beds in Dublin city and county.  I am confident that Shannon Airport will not be downgraded in view of the tremendous development that has taken place there over the years, especially with regard to creating worthwhile jobs and massive development where tourism is concerned.</P>
    <P>Agri-tourism was introduced, designed and planned to assist farmers.  A farmer has all the facilities for a farm holiday-maker. He has land where visitors and children can ramble and see his stock, but accommodation may be a problem. For this reason, special grants should be made to farmers to upgrade their accommodation. If farmers are to do well in tourism they must bring their accommodation up to a certain standard and provide up-to-date facilities.  The farmer who wants to diversify will not get a grant to upgrade his house unless he spends 60 per cent on activities such as pitch and putt.  This is wrong.  He should be allowed 40 per cent for his plant, which includes his house and land.  If this were possible many farmers would immediately accept the challenge and, in so doing, would further assist the tremendous growth of tourism, with its excellent potential for job creation.</P>

      <P>I would thank the Leader of the House who has agreed to adjourn the debate until next week.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the funding of the health services, the mid-west situation which Senator Foley mentioned, the position with regard to local ports rather than commercial ports, and their funding under the programme on peripherality, and other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health services, especially hospital services, provided in the mid-west region are the worst in the country.  This has been recognised by Comhairle na nOspidéal which completed a report commissioned in 1989 by the Mid-Western Health Board to review the consultant manpower requirements for the mid-west region as a whole in light of the large number of consultant retirements and <Col N="1784" /> vacancies.  A committee of seven comhairle members carried out a wide ranging review of the services in the mid-west and an in depth and very comprehensive study of the hospital services was completed in Limerick and in other mid-west areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann debate the National Energy Policy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Energy to the House.  This is an important debate in so far as it is opportune that energy and energy policy should be debated and possibly changed to suit the nineties and thereafter.</P>
      <P>This morning on the Order of Business some Senators indicated that they were confused by the motion.  It is a broad and complex motion and during the debate people will identify areas where they consider change and further developments should take place.  I am not versed in all areas of energy and I presume the same applies to other Senators, but we all have our own views on certain aspects of energy policy.</P>
      <P>Electricity, on which I intend to concentrate, is generated from imported coal and natural resources such as water, gas and peat.  Peat production appears to be under the greatest threat and that is regrettable because there is still a great future for the peat industry here.  It can either survive or go under but if it is to survive and be viable this will have serious consequences for employment and development in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years more than 2,000 jobs were shed in Bord na Móna to keep the company commercially viable and to keep their head above water.  Semi-State bodies should be expected to operate on a viable basis but <Col N="1785" /> we must look at Bord na Móna in a different light.  Bord na Móna were originally set up to develop our bogs and their importance became apparent in the seventies when there was a substantial increase in oil prices.  At that time Bord na Móna were asked to expand and develop their outlets, but they did not do so voluntarily.  Governments and Ministers prompted, pushed and cajoled them and as a result of their expansion operations they are now in debt to the tune of approximately £200 million.  We are now telling them they must solve all their own problems and not ask the Government for money.  They have been told to live within their means and to survive on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>As I already outlined, the only avenue open to Bord na Móna was rationalisation and that meant job losses and the consequences of that rationalisation have been serious for rural Ireland, particularly the midlands which will be decimated if Bord na Móna continue to implement their rationalisation policy.</P>
    <P>I am asking for a review of that policy. The Government should examine ways Bord na Móna can develop rather than merely survive on an economic basis.  The potential of Bord na Móna should be considered and Government involvement in the finances of the company should not be excluded.  The IDA might be better off creating employment opportunities in Bord na Móna rather than trying to attract foreign companies here. If the most recent Bord na Móna proposal to shed a further 600 jobs in the midlands is accepted I fear for peat production and the families in that area.  A total of 2,000 people have lost their jobs in the past four years and another 600 are to go now.  Of course, Bord na Móna will be in a sound financial position in a number of years but many jobs will have been lost.  They will be able to balance their books in the year 2000 because they will have a staff of 200 compared with 4,000 when the company was established.</P>
    <P>I worry when I hear of people being <Col N="1786" /> slapped on the back for doing a good job in semi-State bodies.  The chairman of Bord Telecom was praised for the way he turned round the finances of the company, but what about the human side? We must consider the 2,500 or 3,000 jobs that were lost achieving this.  In my view, Bord na Móna should get Government assistance in the form of equity, subsidies from the IDA, share capital, or elsewhere. The company should not be allowed to close especially in view of the employment consequences of such closure for the midland region.</P>
    <P>In my area of south Roscommon and east Galway £30 million was spent over the past number of years on development and now we are informed by Bord na Móna that they want to close the gate on that development with a loss of jobs for the remaining 32 employees.  Surely that is not in the best interests of the area. This should not be allowed when a company &mdash; particularly a semi-State company like Bord na Móna &mdash; acquire 15,000 acres of bog and receive the support of the people in the community.</P>
    <P>Sixty full-time jobs in Gowla Farm, a subsidiary of the Sugar Company, were lost, the people were made redundant, land was handed over to Bord na Móna on the basis that they would create three or four times as many jobs; and 600 acres of forest, some of it ten or 12 years old, were bulldozed into the bog to accommodate Bord na Móna.  Now, ten years later, 60 jobs are lost, Bord na Móna want to walk away from 15,000 acres of prime peat land, 600 acres of forest and the £30 million spent on development because they must balance their books.</P>
    <P>That cannot be in the interests of this country.  Should Bord na Móna continue to be involved in our energy policy?  Can we exclude Bord na Móna from life of the midlands when we are trying to attract foreign companies to set up here, when we are forming committees and forums to create jobs and, at the same time, we are allowing one of our finest semi-State <Col N="1787" /> bodies to sink or swim at the expense of the people in the midlands.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with that.  Bord na Móna should not pull out of Ballyforan at the expense of 32 jobs, for two reasons: first, the massive investment in the area to date and the promises and commitments made to the people there, and, second, because of the recommendations of the report on the whole Derrynafadda area.  To &ldquo;close the gate&rdquo; while those recommendations are being considered does not make sense.  Bord na Móna say they will not harvest peat in Ballyforan because it costs £3 a tonne extra to transport it by road to Shannonbridge or Lanesborough.  I believed them for some time but recently I discovered they are transporting more peat by road from other areas and that they have bought new lorries for that purpose.  Why is it economic to transport peat by lorry in one county and uneconomic to do so in another?  I understand the difference in the journeys is approximately two miles.</P>
    <P>Of course, I could be cynical and say Bord na Móna set up in Ballyforan, made a number of promises, got the bog, had the forestries destroyed and when they had it all legally in their name walked away and closed the gate.  That is what a colonial power would do and if that is the case it is dispicable.  I would not be that cynical but that is what is being said.</P>
    <P>The task force report recommended that the Ballyforan factory be allowed harvest their 50,000 or 60,000 tonnes of peat this year and transport it to Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.  That is not asking too much as far as the people of east Galway and south Roscommon are concerned.  In fact, it is the least that could be done for those people who gave such commitment to a semi-State body and to the Government, who supported the project at that time.</P>
    <P>When Bord na Móna commenced operations there in the mid-seventies a power station was proposed but that was killed off in 1976.  A briquette factory was <Col N="1788" /> closed in 1983 and this time they have gone for the jugular.  The people of that community, who sold their land for as little as £20 per acre should not be treated in this way.  If Bord na Móna are not prepared to continue operating for the next 12 months, while the recommendations of the task force are being considered, the Minister should consider the payment of a subsidy for transporting 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of peat from the Derrynafadda group of bogs to Shannonbridge.  In this way the jobs of the 32 qualified men who range in age from 26 to 38 years, would be maintained. We cannot afford to lose people with those skills.  If the IDA were to set up a similar project elsewhere it would cost between £5 million and £10 million and we would clap ourselves on the back for creating employment.  We should use the opportunity to develop that industry.</P>
    <P>We have not investigated fully the potential of harvesting and burning peat to generate electricity.  This has not been discussed at European level.  At present, £100 million is being spent on a gas line from this country to mainland Britain. How much money has been given to Bord na Móna over the years and what debate has taken place in the European Parliament, the Commission or in the Council of Ministers regarding Bord na Móna? What moneys have come to the country to support native industries, such as peat harvesting by Bord na Móna?  The RECHAR programme was introduced to deal with the declining coal industry in England and Germany.  Up to 6,000 people were employed in the peat industry here and 2,000 employees have been laid off over the past four years.  A European programme should be introduced to deal with the peat industry here.</P>
    <P>Are we using our peat to the best advantage?  Is the burning of peat for generating electricity useful and economic? I understand approximately 55 per cent of the heat from the burning of peat for generating electricity goes into the <Col N="1789" /> atmosphere or the river beside the power station.  That is an extraordinary waste of heat.  In other countries they use this heat for ancillary industries.  We should, through the European Commission, set up a pilot project to examine this new process of combined power and heat. In some countries horticulture producers use this heat.  Power stations also supply heating to industrial estates, domestic dwellings and fish farms but we have not fully investigated those possibilities here. I understand some feeble attempt was made in Lanesborough regarding that but it is not in use now; gas is being used at that station.  We have not investigated or experimented with that process to the extent they have elsewhere, particularly in Europe and Canada.</P>
    <P>The peat harvesting operations of Bord na Móna should not be discontinued.  It is time for a change in attitude and policy regarding Bord na Móna.  If we continue our present policies in relation to peat harvesting Bord na Móna will be a figment of the imagination in a few years' time. Bord na Móna should be given Government support in the form of equity and the IDA should be involved in developing this industry.  Bord na Móna are not being used to their full potential at present.  They have worked with their hands behind their back in so far as they have been at the beck and call of the Government over the years, but now they are allowed to row their own boat and sink or swim.  I understand they are considering closing a major briquette factory in the midlands.  I am not sure of the number of jobs involved, but it is a further nail in the coffin of the workforce of Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna inform me that they cannot maintain existing employment because they have to meet interest repayments of approximately £21 million a year on a debt of approximately £189 million.  I understand that last year <Col N="1790" /> they made a small profit.  If Bord na Móna did not have to meet that interest payment, imagine the development and the opportunities there would be in Bord na Móna today rather than slowing down and killing off operations.  If the Government intend to invest in employment, they should invest in something we know something about, something that has a proven track record.  Not all the things that Bord na Móna did were correct but they did not do them off their own bat; they were asked, and sometimes told, what to do.</P>
      <P>The peat industry and Bord na Móna should be looked at again, particularly in the context of providing employment. Otherwise by the year 2000 there will only be a few hundred jobs in Bord na Móna.  That would be a terrible mistake, given that that natural resource is there in abundance.  Why not tap that resource now?  Why cannot Bord na Móna, in co-operation with private industry, produce their own electricity and set it into the national grid?  The simple answer is their debt is too high and they cannot get involved in further development.  The ESB is a monopoly and that is not good for the country.  Here we have an opportunity, through Bord na Móna, to open up different avenues in the areas of energy and job creation.</P>
      <P>The task force's comprehensive report on Ballyforan could apply to many other areas.  Top technical knowledge was used to produce that report.  People with national and European experience in energy matters put their names to that report and those recommendations; people do not lightly put their professional reputation on the line.  One of the participants, Dr. Paul Monaghan, of UCG, produced an independent report on combined heat and power, and showed how it has been successful in Europe and in Canada, and how it could be successful in this country.  It identifies Ballyforan and Derrynafadda as an area that could be used on a pilot basis, with European funding, for a combined heat and power plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> I ask that the Derrynafadda bogs continue in operation for 12 months and that the harvesting of peat continue during 1992, giving a breathing space to the task force and to the different agencies who will see if the recommendations in the report of the State and semi-State organisations can be implemented.  If Bord na Móna are not prepared to do that, I call on the Government to provide a transport subsidy for the peat to be taken from the Derrynafadda group to Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.  Bord na Móna should not be allowed to continue as they are.  The Government should become involved as Bord na Móna have the potential to create employment and provide electricity and energy.  Bord na Móna is a fine company.  They should not be left to sink or swim.  We should row in behind them; we have a duty to do so. We were involved with them when it was politically, economically and commercially suitable.  If we help, Bord na Móna and forest development will be enhanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker in relation to Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>It does not seem very long ago when the movies with Elvis Presley and the gas guzzlers were the sort of films we would see in cinemas, and even today we see their return.  In these few years there has been a total change in our attitude to energy.  Those were the days of the great gas guzzlers, the cars that would travel three or four miles per gallon, when oil cost as little as $1 a barrel.  That scene has changed and we have come to realise our dependence on energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thought of a power crisis or an electricity strike today is awesome.  We are very dependent on our cars, electricity and other readily available energy sources.  Not too long ago there were queues at petrol stations.  There was the famous incident in the Unites States <Col N="1792" /> when one car driver shot another dead because he had gone ahead of him in a queue.  It is only when these sources of energy are taken from us that we suddenly realise how very dependent we are on them.</P>
    <P>One of our great achievements at a very early stage was the Shannon hydroelectric scheme.  It remains a magnificent achievement even though for many years in some ways it clouded our thinking on energy.  We imagined we had more energy available to us than was the case. It played a great role in Irish life in decades gone by and played a great role during the war.  At that time Bord na Móna were essential to us.  For a few years after the war one could see the remains of turf dumps up in the Phoenix Park which were the main source of heating for houses in the city.  For a while, trains endeavoured to use peat.  It was not very efficient but it meant that between the Shannon scheme and Bord na Móna we had some degree of self-sufficiency in energy and that was a very proud record.  We should not forget Bord na Móna or the men who worked for the company in years gone by.</P>
    <P>In the sixties there was a total transformation of Irish society from an industrial and commercial point of view, the Lemass years and later.  From being an agriculturally based country we became an industrial country.  What we did not, perhaps, notice was that in the process we had far outstripped our sufficiency of energy supplied from hydro-electricity. It was only when the oil crisis hit us in the seventies that industry, Government and others suddenly became aware that we were 65 per cent dependent on oil.  In many ways it is the effects of that oil crisis on industry, the circulation of what were called petro-dollars and the resultant financial excesses of the eighties that today the Government, and other Governments, are facing up to and paying the price of that extraordinary transformation in energy and financial costs which occurred in the early seventies. <Col N="1793" /> It is 20 years later that we are really beginning to come to terms with it. It is a pretty painful process.</P>
    <P>In the seventies and eighties the great cry was energy conservation.  There was a huge change.  Our energy needs now in oil are probably down to about 40 per cent or 43 per cent.  The gas guzzling cars have long since gone.  In industry the efficient use of energy has improved enormously.  One of the great difficulties in the countries of eastern Europe have now is that their industry is so heavily dependent on energy that it is virtually uncompetitive with western European industry.  In turn, we will have problems in that in an endeavour to get hard currency they will push very hard to sell agricultural produce in the west and that will effect us in the next five to ten years.</P>
    <P>We also hoped in the seventies that we would discover large quantities of oil and gas.  The North Sea successes encouraged us, as did some early successes of our own.  Unfortunately, between technical disappointments and financial terms which were over-optimistic for our situation &mdash; we had not reached the Norwegian stage of development &mdash; oil and gas exploration off our coast has been appallingly disappointing.  We have one economic gas field and one subsidiary field to it.  We have one small oil field which is on the margins of commerciality, depending on the recoverability of the oil there and the technology, together with the oil price.  It will be a very close run thing.  The Minister has taken very courageous steps to try to encourage the oil industry to start spending dollars again on exploration in Irish waters.  The only way we will find oil is by sinking wells.</P>
    <P>We have many forms of energy.  We talked about hydro-electricity.  We still import coal &mdash; it is used at the Moneypoint power station &mdash; and heavy fuel oil. It is very hard to distinguish between the various forms of energy because to a very considerable extent they are interchangeable. We have concentrated on hydro-electricity, on coal, turf, as mentioned <Col N="1794" /> by another Senator, and oil.  We have turned our face against nuclear power and will probably be able to maintain this position.  Certainly recent happenings in the Soviet Union &mdash; albeit with very inefficient and dangerous installations &mdash; seem to confirm us in that view.</P>
    <P>Other countries argue on efficiency and environmental grounds that nuclear power is the way to proceed.  Sweden, which one certainly would not accuse of being environmentally backward, is one of those which does so.  Fortunately we will be able to avoid the necessity for nuclear power but one has to say that our usage of energy is still extraordinarily low.  We are the second lowest in the European Community.  Luxembourg, in terms of millions of oil equivalent tonnes per annum, is below us but has almost 30 per cent of our energy usage.</P>
    <P>We must have a careful balance and make the most efficient use of energy. When one thinks in terms of development one is a little concerned at our relatively low levels of usage.  One very major factor is the price of energy here which at one stage was relatively high. Now we are in line with the rest of Europe.  In fact, we are about 10 per cent below the European average, a major feature for certain plants.  I know of one industry &mdash; I am associated with it &mdash; where one of the crucial points on whether it is economic is the price of energy.  The fact that we have got the cost of energy down within the European average level, and even slightly below, will be a major factor in industrial progress here.  The ESB are to be congratulated on that and on the work they have done.</P>
    <P>While mentioning the Electricity Supply Board, I wish to refer to two other matters.  One is the linkage of Lough Erne and the River Shannon.  It may seem strange that the ESB are involved in this project but that was the case from an early stage.  The contract work of the Electricity Supply Board abroad is another successful project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> In almost any country in the Middle East there are Irish technologists from the ESB involved in either the development, maintenance or other aspects of electricity energy supply programmes.  It is a great tribute to the ability and expertise of those concerned and to the enterprise of the ESB.</P>
    <P>An Bord Gáis have developed rapidly. People are now complaining because gas is not readily available to them.  Gas is an excellent from of energy, environmentally it is probably the most satisfactory. The Minister recently signed a contract and if we have a gas inter-connector with Europe, gas should be relatively readily available.  That is significant.</P>
    <P>I would not rely too much on gas from Siberia.  From what I have heard of the Russian gas industry, the situation is critical. What we saw with nuclear power at Chernobyl is reflected in gas pipelines which are positively dangerous with poor maintenance.  They were initially constructed from poor materials and are now in an extremely serious condition.  There are huge gas and oil fields in Russia and the main reason for the decline in gas and oil output is simply a lack of technical expertise and equipment.  Some horrific tragedies have occurred there.  For example, one gas pipeline exploded when a train was passing and approximately 200 people were killed.  These tragedies have not received as much publicity as the Chernobyl incident, but they are important.</P>
    <P>Gas has an excellent relationship with the environment.  It does not emit carbon dioxide or sulphur dioxide as do other substances.  Our national energy policy would seem to be one of providing supplies at economic prices from a variety of sources resulting in an economically and environmentally satisfactory situation. That is very important to our national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity <Col N="1796" /> to speak on this motion.  I expected the proposer and seconder of the motion to outline what the national energy policy is but unfortunately, I am still at a loss. I thought the Minister would have informed us of his thinking on this issue.</P>
      <P>Energy is an under-rated feature of life but it accounts for upwards of 20 per cent of GNP.  In the absence of a policy being laid down and enunciated tonight, I will put a few questions to the Minister which I am confident he will address in his reply. I had an opportunity over the weekend to think about this issue and feel we should have a national energy policy.  I have never heard of one.  However, we have a National Energy Board.  The ESB is an important player in this area; Bord na Móna has already been mentioned as has An Bord Gáis.  The Nuclear Energy Board is an energy monitoring board, but I am sure they do an excellent job. Looking at the projections in the ESB, they do not envisage that nuclear energy will play a significant role here at any time in the future.  We also have the National Petroleum Corporation.  I looked them up in the telephone book to ask what their policy was, but I could not find them.</P>
      <P>It occurred to me that over the years Bills dealing with some of those semi-State organisations have passed through the Oireachtas but it is very difficult to get information from them.  When I inquired from some of them what their policy was for the next decade they referred me to their annual reports.  Annual reports give an outline of the work achieved over the year but they do not set down clear and precise policies.</P>
      <P>I compliment the ESB who two years ago produced a very clear document, &ldquo;Connecting with the Future&rdquo;, outlining their strategies for the remainder of this century.  I hope they will be able to meet all their targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been interested in alternative sources of energy since 1974 when the ESB announced their proposal to decommission five peat powered stations in <Col N="1797" /> the midlands.  This policy has resulted in the loss of almost 1,500 skilled jobs over the last four or five years, especially in Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, Kildare and other counties as well.  I campaigned through the mid-seventies for alternative sources of energy.  At that time an experiment was carried out by An Foras Talúntais with the co-operation of the ESB and Bord na Móna.  I do not know what our national energy policy is and what concerted effort or co-ordination exists between all these players in the energy field, nor do I know what interaction exists between the Nuclear Energy Board, An Bord Gáis, Bord na Móna, the National Petroleum Corporation and the National Energy Board.  However, perhaps the Minister would tell me what policy decisions are being taken by his Department?  Is there an interdepartmental committee monitoring the work, policies and projections of these very important semi-State organisations and agencies?  For instance, have the Department of Agriculture and Food any interest or input, or even an embryonic policy on energy crops or on non-food crops in an era where, without exception, every food crop is overproduced or restricted with shrinking profit margins for the producer?</P>
    <P>Last month the commissioner with special responsibility for taxation, Mrs. Schrivener, announced the adoption of a proposal for a directive which aims at a substantial reduction in the rates of excise duty on fuels from agricultural sources or bio-fuels.  Mrs. Schrivener said the aim of this tax incentive is to develop a very promising branch of agri-industrial production. It will be a decisive factor in the future of agriculture and for the Community's policies on energy and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The aim of the directive is to bring about a Community-wide reduction in excise duty on bio-fuels when they come into commercial use.  It lays down that from 1 January 1993 excise duty on each member state may not exceed 10 per cent <Col N="1798" /> of the rate in that same member state for the fuel being replaced &mdash; that is, petrol or diesel.  This amounts to a compulsory reduction by 90 per cent or more in the excise duties on bio-fuels in each member state.</P>
    <P>The measure concerns all fuels from agricultural sources, regardless of their origin or the nature of the agricultural product from which they derive.  These bio-fuels have two main uses, replacing either petrol or diesel fuel.  In petrol the fuel is ethanol which is alcohol obtained by fermentation of sugarbeet, cereals, potatoes or artichokes.  It may be mixed with petrol or used alone.  One of the most significant outlets for bioethanol is ETBE &mdash; ethyl-teriary-butyl-ether, a feature of which is that it raises the octane rating of motor fuels.  The market for such additives is growing with the market for lead free petrol.</P>
    <P>Vegetable oils can be used to fuel diesel engines.  The use of pure vegetable oil &mdash; rape, sunflower and so on &mdash; requires a special motor while derivatives like diester &mdash; obtained from reaction with an alochol &mdash; can be used directly without any special adaptation of the engine.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this subject of vegetable oils I should declare a personal interest in new engine technology which has led to my studying the entire process in an effort to introduce that technology which may be of immense benefit to this country.  On the prospects regarding energy, environment and farm policy, bio-fuels are a new non-food outlet for farm production.  This is in line with one aspect of the reform of the common agricultural policy which provides for growing non-food crops on lands, subject to compulsory set-aside.  I ask the Minister if there is any interdepartmental committee which includes the Minister for Agricultural and Food his own Department, and the Department of the Environment all of whom must have a considerable interest in this new development.</P>
    <P>The processing of agricultural products <Col N="1799" /> which because of transport costs will require distilleries to be set up near the growing areas provides good prospects for jobs and activities in the countryside. In addition the emergence of a biofuel production capacity may help in improving the EC's security of supply.  The energy balance of biofuels is positive, that is to say, the total energy consumed in the production, processing and distribution cycle is less than the energy value of the fuel obtained.  These new potential outlets could lead to biofuels accounting eventually for about 5 per cent of the motor fuel market.  That is the view of the Commissioner for Taxation. Biofuels also release less CO² &mdash; greenhouse gas &mdash; and a little less SO² &mdash; acid rain &mdash; which is a major advantage from the environment point of view.</P>
    <P>May I refer to the Elsbett technology with which I am familiar which is truly a multifuel engine with the capacity to burn any of the ordinary fossil fuels, any of the vegetable fuels either in the raw or refined state, ethanol or methanol.  In a direct comparison with the production costs of ethanol or methanol that raw vegetable oil is 110 per cent more efficient than ethanol and 176 per cent more efficient than methanol.  New technology offers agriculture considerable benefits.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute, last year, carried out some interesting studies on the production of rape seed oil for energy.  Production of rape seed in the Community has expanded over the past number of years and this year I understand that about 6,000 hectares has been sown here.  Unfortunately all that produce has to exported to the UK for crushing and processing.  Between 1981 and 1983 Teagasc &mdash; the agricultural and food development authority &mdash; researched the feasibility of rape seed oil as an engine fuel.  Two major problems were highlighted at that time, a technical problem with conventional diesel engines and the lack of economic viability compared with mineral fuels.  Economic <Col N="1800" /> reviews in subsequent years reinforced that conclusion.  In recent years several significant developments have taken place which have rekindled interest in rape seed oil as a fuel.  These are the development engines which can burn unrefined rape seed oil; the development of the esterification process to allow rape seed oil to be burned in most conventional diesel engines as diester; increasing concern about atmospheric pollution &mdash; the urban traffic problem and the more widespread concern about atmospheric CO² levels; the uncertainty about mineral fuel supplies renewed a couple of years ago by the circumstances of the Gulf War and over-production of crops for food use with a consequent increased interest in non-food uses of traditional and novel crops.</P>
    <P>Tallow, the animal fats by-product, over a quarter of a million tonnes of which is produced by the beef industry or was produced by the beef industry when that industry flowered here, also has potential as an engine fuel.  Present production is sold in an uncertain world market and the year before last I think producers were lucky to get the price of its transport out of the country.  Cold pressed and esterified rape seed oils are now under test as fuels in a number of EC countries particularly France and Germany.  Rape seed oil can compete with diesel fuel provided that the EC crushing subsidy is available.</P>
    <P>I would like to summarise briefly the results of the Teagasc studies of last year; these figures were compiled last autumn. The composite base price of transport diesel which retails at 52.1p per litre is 10.62p per litre.  The wholesale price &mdash; bulk delivery to a farm &mdash; of agricultural and transport diesel is 17.65p and 35.35p per litre, excluding VAT, respectively. The cost of extracted filtered rape seed when revenue from the byproduct, rape seed cake is added &mdash; the price of rape seed is £300 per tonne &mdash; varies from 51.7p to 59.1p per litre, depending on the percentage of oil extraction.  Assuming a <Col N="1801" /> crushing subsidy of £190 per tonne and the seed price at £300 per tonne the cost of rape seed oil is 17.3p to 19.5p per litre. At a seed price of £275 per tonne the cost is reduced to 10.4p and to 13.9p per litre. Assuming availability of £80 per acre set aside payment, the cost of rape at 80 per cent extraction and £300 per tonne is 47.3p per litre.  This reduces to 30.5p and 23.7p when the seed price is reduced to £275 and £250 per tonne respectively. The composite price of diesel at 10.6p per litre is about the same as extracted filtered rape seed oil when the following criteria apply: rape seed prices £275 per tonne, crushing subsidy at £19 per tonne, oil extraction cost, 10 pence per litre and a by product value of the oil seed cake at £125 per tonne.</P>
    <P>That is a brief outline of a feasibility study that has tremendous potential for the agricultural sector here as well as for transport costs.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion and debate on the National Energy Policy.  I also welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the way he handled our energy crisis during the Gulf War, alleviating people's fears that fuel would not be available for homes or industries; things were difficult over those few months.  I commend him for his assurances that there were adequate supplies for all industries in this country.</P>
      <P>The first oil crisis hit this country back in the seventies.  I was glad to see the shift then by the ESB from their total dependence on oil fired stations to natural gas and the Moneypoint coal power station was also constructed.  In the future, I would like to see a policy document on the direction being taken by the ESB, Bord na Móna, An Bord Gáis and other energy bodies.  I would also like to see a continuation of rural power stations which need to be examined in depth by the National Energy Board to ensure that problems that may arise in this area will be anticipated to guarantee the future of power stations in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1802" /> It is easy for experts to say that for efficiency or other reasons it would be better to close down five, six or seven power stations, amalgamate them into one, cut everything down to size and discontinue hundreds of jobs which could not be replaced.  Those people would have to join dole queues and receive all the benefits that accompany dole, such as medical cards etc.  The Government of the day might find that it would be more cost effective to keep people employed in the smaller power stations rather than made unemployed.</P>
    <P>Another thing that needs to be looked at in depth is the advent of industrialists into the country and together with the cost of fuel or power to them.  Industrialists should be given the opportunity to build their own power station to run an industry if they think the cost of the power available was too high.  This may be necessary to attract industrialist into certain regions.  This possibility was mentioned some years ago when Alcan was being constructed; there was talk at that time about erecting one power station to provide all the energy for that plant.  A number of discussions took place then.  If an industry of that size and nature wanted to erect their own power station they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>We should be conducting more exploration for oil and gas off our shores to see if we can become self-sufficient in the future.  We have already brought gas on shore and we have some oil out there; as Senator Conroy said earlier, I would like more exploration being done by multinationals to see if we can get a major oil find.  That would be of benefit to us now and in the future.</P>
    <P>With all the scares about nuclear power, I do not envisage the Minister allowing nuclear stations to be built in this country in the foreseeable future.  In the seventies all one heard were proposals to erect nuclear stations all over the east and west coasts of Ireland; there was tremendous demand for energy then and nobody felt it could be provided <Col N="1803" /> other than by nuclear sources I compliment everyone involved in that situation, especially the ESB.</P>
    <P>The ESB have a nice balance now between oil, gas and coal sources of energy.  I am also led to believe that there is a steady growth at the rate of 6 per cent annually in the consumption of power.  I was glad to hear recently that the ESB intended to bring back units one and two of the Tarbert oil powered station; that will bring some badly needed extra jobs into our region which we lost when the units were closed down as Moneypoint came on stream.  I would hate to think from talks that went on recently that there is a doubt about reopening unit one; the ESB have given a commitment and I would like to see them honouring it.</P>
    <P>I would not welcome the privatisation of power stations.  Greater efficiency might be the objective but privatisation would inflict a desperate blow on rural economies.  Major industries coming into this country with large energy requirements may be encouraged to provide their own energy.</P>
    <P>In the recent past the ESB said they to go one way with power yet seem to have changed their minds along the line.  They will have to come clean in future about their intentions.</P>
    <P>There has been talk recently about Board na Móna and the inefficiency of peat powered stations, but one would have to consider what peat did for this country during World War I and World War II.  We have a natural resource there which we should nuture and if we can create jobs from it all the better.  If the power coming from peat driven power stations is a little more expensive, at least it is our own fuel which we are generating from our own natural resources; it is then going back into our economy creating badly needed jobs.  The Minister should keep that in mind when arguments are made for greater efficiency.  We might all be walking around looking in the win-down <Col N="1804" /> of efficiency with no jobs.  At the end of the day jobs on the ground will be crucial.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach le roinnt plé a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí fuinnimh.  Is í mo chéad cheist ná an bhfuil plosaí náisiúnta fuinnimh ag Éireann chun fuinneamh a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt?  Ag léamh an Cuilliton report dom le deánaí, feachaint cén chaoi a bhfuilimid ag dul ó thaobh tionsclaíochta de, chuir sé iontas orm go mbeadh i gceist, aon tionscal atá le bunú, go mbunófaí é laistigh de 15 de bhailte móra sa taobh seo tíre.  Tá sé ráite sa tuarascáil, os rud é gur tír an-bheag í seo, go mbíonn daoine in ann taisteal go héasca idir na bailte seo.  Tá mise a cheapadh gurb é an fáth go bhfuil an rún seo faoinár mbráid anocht ná go dteastaíonn ón Seanadóir Finneran a impí ar an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh go luath agus go sciobtha le teacht i gcabhair ar Ros Comáin agus Bhéal Átha na Feorainne agus ar na portaigh atá timpeall ansin.  Más ea, tugaim lántacaíocht dó mar tá mé meabhrach gur chaith sé cuid mhaith ama ann.  Molaim é gur éirigh leis é a dhéanamh mar ní fhéadfá rud is fearr a dhéanamh sa Teach seo ná drochstaid an iarthair a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Ach, le dul siar go dtí an tuarascáil, más rud é go bhfuil Culliton agus na daoine a bhí ag tabhairt cúnaimh dó den tuairim sin faoin tionsclaíocht, ní fheadar a mbeadh an tAire sásta freisin, os rud é go bhfuil an tír chomh beag sin, agus de réir loighic an Culliton report, Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais, Bord na Móna agus an Bord Gáis a chur le chéile in aon chomhlacht mór amháin.  Dá ndéanfadh sé amhlaidh b'fhéidir nach mbeadh an trioblóid sa tír chomh dona sin agus atá sé agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh seans níos fearr againn in iarthar na hÉireann dá mbeadh a leithéid ann.  Sílim go bhfuil an polasaí atá á leanúint faoi láthair ag an Stát maidir le forbairt fhuinnimh agus táirgeadh ábhar fuinnimh, ag déanamh go leor dochair don iarthar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> Rinne go leor daoine trácht ar an chogadh deireanach agus is cuimhin liom na céadta fear ag obair i mBaile an Gharraí i dTiobraid Arann, ag saothrú antraicít agus guail den tríú grád.  Cúpla míle síos an bóthar uaidh bhí an Baile Beag, an áit ina ndearnadh an fhorbairt ba mhó agus obair iontach tháirgeadh móna ar siúl ag Bord na Móna.  Nárbh iontach an rud é an dá acmhainn nádúrtha sin bheith taobh le chéile, ach anois tá Baile an Gharraí dúnta agus laghdú ar fhorbairt na bportach a shíneann suas go Ros Comáin.  Bhí Arigna ann agus é ag táirgeadh mar a bhí á dhéanamh i dTiobraid Árann blianta ó shin.  Tá deireadh leis sin anois.  Sin polasaí Bhord Soláthair an Leictreachais atá faoi cheannasaíocht an Aire Fuinnimh, Tá sé sin dúnta mar, deirtear, nach raibh na hearraí á dtairgeadh ar phraghas eacnamúil, nach raibh an tír seo in ann é a airgeadú.  Má tá sé sin fíor faoi Arigna agus faoi Bhaile an Gharraí, cén fáth gur féidir linn rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin mbeostoc ó thaobh intervention agus chuile shórt eile agus praghas ard Eorpach á fháil, rud a mbaineann na feíirmeoirí móra leas as ó thaobh oibre agus airgid de.</P>
    <P>Is cuid den pholasaí é sin, ach is oth liom go bhfuil polasaí Bhord na Móna imithe ar stire agus, dá bhrí sin, táimid ag caint faoi iompórtáil ola agus ghuail &mdash; breathnaigí ar Moneypoint &mdash; agus faoi dhíothú na bportach, an acmhainn fhuinnimh is mó dá bhfuil sa tír, an acmhainn a choinnigh ag imeacht sinn le linn agus tar éis dhá chogadh.  Tá a fhios agam go ndéarfaidh daoine, ná bí ag caint seafóide faoi na portaigh: bhí an ré sin ann ach tá sé thart anois.  Ach níl sé thart.  Má táimíd ag caint faoin iarthar i gcomhthéacs forbartha, ní dhearnadh aon fhorbairt ar phortaigh an iarthair, agus áirím portaigh i Ros Comáin agus i mBéal Átha Feorainne ina measc siúd.</P>
    <P>Bhí Béal Átha Feorainne le forbairt, caitheadh na milliúin phunt ar an bhforbairt sin ach anois tá cinneadh eile déanta ag an Rialtas, gan dul ar aghaidh leis.  Níl sé eacnamúil, tá ganntanas airgid ag cur <Col N="1806" /> as do Bhord na Móna, agus tá ráite leo go gcaithfidh siad bheith ar a gconlán féin, nó éirí as.  Is trua go deo liomsa go bhfuil an casadh sin tagtha ar fhorbairt fhuinnimh na tíre, agus ar an ngné is dúchasaí d'eacnamaíocht na tíre, saothrú na bportach.  Tá na mílte agus na céadta míle acra de phortaigh fós san iarthar ach nach truamhéaleach an rud é an casadh nua sa scéal go ndeirtear linn anois nach fiú, nach féidir agus nach bhfuil sé eacnamúil an fhorbairt sin a dhéanamh.  Tuigeann an tAire go maith an rud atá á rá agam.  Sin é a cheantar féin.  Bhí stáisiún ginte leictreachais, i gceartlár na Gaeltachta i gConamara gar do Rosmuc ach ní raibh sé eacnamúil.  Cuireadh ann é ar dhá bhonn: le haghaidh leictreachas a chur ar fáil ach, níos tábhachtaí fós, chun go dtabharfaí deis do mhuintir an cheantair sin airgead breise a thuilleamh.  Anois tá deireadh leis sin, ar nós go leor eile timpeall na tíre, agus céard atá againn ina áit?  Tá an dífhostaíocht imithe ó smacht, le beagnach 300,000 duine as obair.  Táimid ag cur scéimeanna eile ar bun ar a dtugtar social employment schemes, scéimeanna atá go forleathan agus a bhfuil de chuspóir acu an dífhostaíocht a laghdú.  B'fhearr go mór dá gcoinneofaí na stáisiúin bheaga agus daoine bheith ag obair iontu mar, ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta de, nuair a chuirtear airgeadú agus airgead ón SES i gcomparáid le hairgead dífhostaíochta &mdash; agus tá móin i gceist sa stáisiún ginte &mdash; is beag an difríocht atá eatarthu.</P>
    <P>Is é an trua é go bhfuil an casadh seo sa scéal ann agus tá mé ag tabhairt iomlán tacaíochta don Seanadóir Finneran, go gcoinneofaí an portach sin i mBéal Atha Feorainne ar ais nó ar éigean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards all over the country are over spent by approximately £100 million.  Given the stringent constraints on them can the Government pick up the tab or, would it be appropriate to look within the system itself, at the resources, expertise and manpower in hospitals, to see if there is any way we could introduce an element of self-financing, rationalisation or cost effectiveness to the health board system?</P>
      <P>I realise that I could be accused of looking for privatisation of the service, but that is the furthest thought from my mind.  The time has come, however, when we must address the administration of health board hospitals to see how they can become enterprise conscious and, by doing so, introduce an element of self-financing into their operations.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of the Southern Health Board since last June.  Faced with deficits of £3.7 million in the Southern Health Board budget we are all looking for a way out of the dilemma.  I called recently for a feasibility study into ways of generating additional finance for the health board.  As a result of that call and the publicity it generated, it was made known to me through various sources that in a major hospital within the health board service work was being carried out in laboratories of this hospital for a private operation and that no moneys were accruing to the health board from this.  I understand that the money generated could be as much as £100,000 per year.  I asked for an investigation into the matter and this investigation is currently under way.  A report is to be made available at the next meeting of the Southern Health Board.  This raises questions as to the level of control that exists in hospitals, and particularly in the laboratories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, I received further information relating to a major hospital in <Col N="1808" /> Dublin where it was said laboratory work was being carried out and that the private work, the VHI work was being dealt with separately from public authority work and that such information was being transmitted by modum to a private office from which bills were being sent out to patients.  I understand that the level of this work could range from £3 million to £6 million per year.  That is a significant sum of money.  This raises the question: are the board of this hospital aware that a private company exists within the hospital itself to handle information on private patients, to transfer that information to a private clinic from whence invoices are sent directly to patients?  Do the Department of Health know that equipment and staff are used for private investigations?  Is a reasonable sum being paid back into the system?  These questions deserve answers.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to carry out a major investigation into the operation of laboratories in hospitals throughout the country.  The Minister can imagine the morale of those who are working within the system.  They are highly qualified and highly efficient, and it is their perception that the equipment, resources and personnel of the hospitals are being used, with no pay back to the hospital itself.  If this practice exists, then it makes the whole operation highly questionable: who authorised the carrying out of this private work and why is adequate recompense not being made?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that if a private investigation was carried out into all these operations significant sums of money would be made available to health boards all over the country.  I would ask the Minister to introduce a system of control which would ensure that a reasonable return is made to each health board and hospital for resources, personnel and equipment being used.  Putting it at its lowest in this major hospital in Dublin, if we say the figure is £3 million surely it is fair to suggest that for the personnel, equipment and expertise being used, £1 million should be paid back into the resources of that hospital.  Think what that sum could do in terms of the operation <Col N="1809" /> and resources of that hospital.  I encourage hospital boards and health boards to engage in outside work, but I also encourage them to ensure that a profitable return is made to the board as a result.</P>
    <P>I would like to contrast what is happening in hospitals with what is happening in third level education.  The Government encouraged the third level sector to introduce an element to self-financing. I can give two examples from the Cork area with which I am familiar. University College Cork generates £7.5 million per annum by way of contract work; the Regional College in Cork generates £1.5 million.  These are very significant sums of money which can be ploughed back into the system ensuring additional resources in each of these establishments.  We should arrive at a situation in health boards where if staff, are involved in extra duties, they would be given additional payments and a fair and equitable return would be made on the use of health board resources.</P>
    <P>Extra specialist services are an extremely important and expensive item and every effort should be made to have them fully utilized rather than having them duplicated throughout the public sector.  It has been suggested that some of the equipment used in the diagnosis of unusual or special diseases could be adapted for environmental monitoring of pollution levels, for example, and for useful commercial services.  In UCC, at the moment, work could be farmed out from health boards all over this country, and with proper interaction between the health services and the local authorities, we could save significant resources.  Many successful private companies are involved in mediscans, cholesterol level testing, prognosis and drug screening. Who would be in a better position than the health boards to interact with industry? Prognosis could be carried out on a contract basis negotiated between the health boards and the groups.</P>
    <P>In Cork we have companies like Irish <Col N="1810" /> Steel and a major concentration of the pharmaceutical industry.  The health board should negotiate with these companies with a view to setting up services such as advice on healthy living, prognosis and checking for any after effects of treatment.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must aim at ensuring that only those who need specialist services are referred to hospitals.  It is alleged that many people are referred to hospitals at present who do not require these services and they are clogging up the system unnecessarily and being extremely expensive.  GPs have been accused in the past of not carrying out proper diagnosis in their surgeries and causing a cluster of people arriving at outpatient clinics.  The GPs for their part say there is not proper computerisation in the laboratories in the health service and that as a result, it is impossible for them to make an instant diagnosis resulting in further referrals. By addressing this issue the Minister may bring about major savings to health boards and may, in fact, clear the logjam that is at present part and parcel of the health board system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to Senator O'Keeffe's contribution and I am glad of the opportunity to comment on the very interesting topic he has raised.  Senator O'Keeffe will no doubt accept that the core business of our health boards is to help maintain the health of our people and provide a high quality of care to those who fall ill.</P>
      <P>Consistent with achieving this demanding task, our health service should operate in the most efficient, effective and economic manner and I am glad to say the service has responded very positively to the Department's initiatives in this area in recent years, at a time when the whole health system has been under great pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a system which is spending about £1.75 billion on capital and non-capital <Col N="1811" /> services this year there will always be room for efficiencies and opportunities for value for money initiatives.  My Department have been actively following through with their agencies on a whole series of initiatives to get the most value out of every point spent in the health services.  All areas of expenditure, pay, non-pay and income have been and are being thoroughly assessed to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources and that services can be maintained at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>Enterprise is a word which is synonymous with professionalism and enthusiasm and an ability to make the maximum use of resources and opportunities. I am happy that the staff of the health services both medical and non-medical, have clearly demonstrated their enterprise in developing and keeping abreast of new techniques in patient care. Much valuable research is currently being conducted throughout our health services which will benefit patients in the future and provide for more efficient and effective delivery of our services.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident that a spirit of enterprise linked to quality of service is very much alive throughout the health system.  I see it as part of my role and the role of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell to acknowledge, support and encourage that approach provided it is focused on benefiting the patient.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the enterprise shown in absorbing and using new technology and in pursuing research and I would like to turn to a third area of enterprise, the pursuit of value for money.  By value for money I mean essentially three things: efficiency &mdash; doing things right; effectiveness &mdash; doing the right things; and economy &mdash; doing things for low cost.</P>
    <P>One area which provides a good example where good work is being done is in the field of purchasing.  The health boards are now combining to use their muscle in the area of purchasing; that <Col N="1812" /> is certainly doing things right.  They are developing information necessary for purchasing which will provide them with market information which will be comparable to the information available to the supply side.  I consider that to be the right approach.  The boards will buy collectively and negotiate collectively to ensure that they purchase at the lowest cost.</P>
    <P>A further example of enterprise which is of benefit to patients throughout the health services is in the whole area of workshops for the handicapped.  In every board area, as well as providing therapeutic service for handicapped people, workshops are now selling their manufactured products and also selling other services.  This goes further than income generation as it helps provide employment and training opportunities for disabled people, for example using computers to process data which was previously contracted out to a commercial computer bureau.</P>
    <P>One focus of the value for money programme this year will be the whole area of income generation.  It is true to say that in recent times many developments carried out by health boards or other agencies have had a self-financing element from income generated by other aspects of the boards' services.  There are many areas where health boards can and are indeed maximising their self-financing potential.  Examples of this are: commercial services for patients, for example, room telephones, cable TV and so on; commercial restaurant and coffee bars in major hospitals; shopping facilities in hospitals and the sale of diagnostic services, for example X-ray and laboratory, to private health care concerns.</P>
    <P>The Department are examining at present the opportunities, generally, for value for money in the laboratory services in major hospitals.  This is a good thing.  In regard to the issue raised by Senator O'Keeffe, my Department have made inquiries of the Southern Health Board about the matter.  The question of <Col N="1813" /> the working arrangements between the Shandon Drug Clinic and the Cork Regional Hospital was raised at a meeting of the Southern Health Board on 2 March 1992.  A report has been requested for the next board meeting which I understand will take place on 6 April 1992. That is the report referred to by Senator O'Keeffe.  I understand the report is being prepared.  The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, will be anxious to receive a copy of the report.  I have no doubt he will consider its implications.</P>
    <P>In the past two years my Department have promoted a vigorous programme of estate management throughout the health services.  It is I believe most important that all the assets employed by agencies are fully utilised.  A first step in this is to clearly identify, record and assess by means of modern asset registers those assets which agencies own and those which are considered surplus to requirements.</P>
    <P>This concept of estate management, aimed at ensuring effective use of resources, is being promoted actively by my Department throughout the health boards and there has been a very positive and encouraging response by the boards. Since the middle of 1988, sales of properties have realised nearly £5 million and this money has been utilised to develop and rationalise savings, particularly those for the mentally handicapped and the psychiatrically ill.</P>
    <P>Another example of enterprise by agencies is to be found in the area of energy management where efficiencies and investment have led to savings which were far in excess of the cost of the investments.</P>
    <P>While I am very happy to report on many of these measures I would like to assure the House that I will continue to expand and enhance these initiatives and encourage them wherever possible.  A key element I will be addressing in the coming months is the question of incentives for boards and their staff in their efforts to achieve better value for money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> We all support that objective.  I will also be addressing the current cash flow problem which is inhibiting our ability to maximise value for money in the purchase of goods and services.</P>
    <P>I believe I have said sufficient to convince this House that there is a culture now in the health services which is value conscious and increasingly enterprising. The service is committed to getting every pound of value it can from the available resources but without reducing the level of care and treatment available to patients.  Indeed, given that resources will continue to be limited within the overall context of tight Government control on public expenditure, it will be essential that all possible opportunities for additional income and savings be pursued and implemented.  Only by such means can our high standards of health care be maintained for the good of patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am glad the Minister of State came to this House.  I was pleased to hear him say that a number of incentives are being introduced for the staff looking for better value within the health services.  I welcome the initiatives relative to self-financing which the Minister outlined.  I am also very conscious that the Minister and the Minister of State want to see an efficient and streamlined health service. That was my reason for bringing this issue before the House.  It is my wish too that we would have an effective but also an enterprising health system.  Like the Minister I would like to see the health services maximise the opportunities for additional income.  I believe &mdash; I know the Minister agrees to a certain extent &mdash; there are opportunities to increase health boards income.  There are individuals and groups making significant sums of money out of the health board system but ploughing nothing back into it.  That warrants investigation.  It is important for the health services.  There could be significant savings.  One hospital generates <Col N="1815" /> between £3 million and £6 million.  If the facilities, manpower and expertise of a hospital were paid for surely the hospital would benefit.  If this happened in all hospitals a great amount of money could be saved.  I urge the Minister to investigate my suggestions and ensure a proper <Col N="1816" /> return to the health services for the money spent.</P>
