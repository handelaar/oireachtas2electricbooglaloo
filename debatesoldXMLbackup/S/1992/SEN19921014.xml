      <P>I have notice from Senator Keogh that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to confirm his commitment and that of the Government to the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour and in particular its ferry services.</P>
      <P>I received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that proper procedures, in accord with international human rights and natural justice, are put in place so that those seeking asylum in Ireland are humanely treated and their case fairly considered.</P>
      <P>I received notice from Senator Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to give approval for the contract for a new reservoir and water tower at Castletroy, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that people <Col N="98" /> employed on a part-time basis, on one, two or three days per week, receive a reasonable level of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Keogh, Costello, Kennedy and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senators Keogh's and Costello's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Kennedy and Neville may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I have notice of a two minute statement from Senator Neville under Standing Order 29A.  It will be taken at the conclusion of the motion on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House, I would like to make the following point. Last Thursday was our first sitting day after the summer recess and I allowed considerable latitude.  I would like to think that we are now well back to business and that only matters directly related to the Order of Business and motions already on the Order Paper should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is as follows: Item No. 1 from now until 6 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. motion 47.  I wish to say that, in consultation with various Opposition spokespersons, it is agreed that tomorrow's debate will be statements on the economy.  It will be broadened.</P>

      <P>I have no objection at all to having debates on major issues as we are having today and tomorrow.  In <Col N="99" /> fact, it is one of the things we asked for, so I have no complaint on that score.  I wish to ask the Leader of the House if he can give us some indication as to what legislation is proposed during this session and, if there is a dearth of Government legislation, there are some excellent home-grown products on the Order Paper.  I suggest, for example, the Suicide Bill proposed by Senator Neville, which all sides agreed was a major worthwhile reform and which we were told was being deferred because the Government had their own proposals.  If that Bill could be taken next week, if there is no Government legislation, I would be grateful or there are other Bills on the Order Paper in the names of other Members.  Perhaps we could have a &ldquo;home grown week&rdquo; next week if the Government do not have anything to put before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that we get a programme of legislation.  I think that has been raised with the Leader already and he is aware of the views of all sides of the House on the matter.  I raised last week the question of a debate on the Green Paper on Education and I am disappointed to note we are now playing second fiddle to the other House on that matter.  I realise the Leader has his own views on it, but it is important to put a marker down on that point.  It was raised in the first place in this House months back, not just by myself but by many others, including Senator Jackman and it is important that we have a full debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to indicate to us that when the debate does take place &mdash; and I assume it will be next week &mdash; it will be along the same lines as has been planned without precedent for the other House, where there is to be a full, open discussion and debate, with questions being taken by the Minister.  Seeing that it has been raised here in the first place and in view of the fact that this forum is the place where it can be most comprehensively discussed, I appeal to the Leader to ensure that we have the opportunity of putting questions to the <Col N="100" /> Minister in the course of an interactive debate, as has been planned for the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader let us know when we can expect the debate on the report of the Ombudsman to be resumed?  I welcome his decision to broaden the debate tomorrow to include the whole economy.  I do so because of the concerns which many of us have in relation to interest rates, and indeed in relation to the problem of houses being repossessed and people having difficulty coping with their mortgages?</P>
      <P>Finally, what is the situation in relation to the review of the changes in procedure which took place in the last session, when we can expect that review and what is the likely outcome in relation to further changes and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader of the House assure us that, arising from tomorrow's debate on the economy, specific proposals will be looked at by the Government and that a report will be made to this House on what is being done about them?  Why I question slightly the value of statements as such is that I fear tomorrow's debate will just be a discussion without any specific detailed submissions being made or a detailed programme of action outlined by a Minister. I would want an assurance from the Leader that something will happen arising from tomorrow's debate, some definite proposals in terms of job creation.  I am still not clear that will be the case and perhaps the Leader could assure us on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the debate on the Green Paper be commenced in this House as soon as possible and that it be given the time requested by several Members when speaking on the Colleges Bill.  This is a national issue at the moment and sufficient time should be given for the debate on the Green Paper to allow all of us to state our worries and concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to keep in constant communication with the Minister for Foreign <Col N="101" /> Affairs to invite him to come to the Seanad, as he has publicly stated he would willingly do, to give us first-hand information about the situation in Somalia, which he has visited on two occasions.  I appreciate he is in the North today and could not be with us.</P>
    <P>I also ask that there will not be a time limit put by a Minister on the debate on the Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the views of Senators O'Toole and Honan in relation to the format of the debate on the Green Paper.  We were to the forefront in getting the Green Paper to Senators and TDs.  Already throughout the country the conferences in relation to the Green Paper are well under way and we are late now.  I hope there will not be a time limit and that we will get this opportunity of allowing the contributions of the many people in this House involved in education to have a fair hearing from the Minister in relation to queries that will be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the tenor in which the business is starting in this session.  There was a debate in the Dáil last week on the economy and we are going to have a debate this week in the Seanad on the economy.  There is a debate on the Green Paper this week in the Dáil and we are going to have a debate on it in the Seanad next week.  In other words, we are playing second fiddle to the Dáil on the major issues.  At that stage all the steam has gone out of the debate and interest in the subject has waned.  It is high time that we in the Seanad took the initiative on major debates in some areas.  I suggest that perhaps the Leader of the House would arrange that a major issue, such as the White Paper on Divorce, be introduced in this House rather than having it come to us from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support what Senator' Manning has said in relation to some of the Private Members' Bills on the Order Paper.  The Leader of the House might consider the possibility of dealing with some of those Bills.  All of the groups have Private <Col N="102" /> Members Bills they would like to see discussed.  They have been on the Order Paper for months, if not years, and they could be usefully incorporated into the business of the House in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be less concerned than Senator Costello about playing second fiddle because in the nature of things major topics are going to be discussed in both Houses.  What is important is that when we come to discuss the Green Paper that we bring to it, as I am sure we will, our own distinctive approach.  I would like to support the plea of Senator Honan and other Senators that when the Green Paper is before this House the most important thing is that we get adequate time to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some information about the progress of the foreign affairs committee.  I realise the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been extremely busy.  However, I think it would be useful if we could be given some kind of time scale, because there has been a very clear and firm commitment given in this House that such a committee would be established, and would include Members of this House.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to agree with Senator Manning and Senator Costello on Bills other than Government Bills being introduced in this House.  Senator Costello made reference to Bills having been on the Order Paper for some months.  For example, there is Item No. 10 &mdash; the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill &mdash; which is dated 1989, three years ago.  All sides of the House appreciate this is an appropriate Bill.  In fact the former Taoiseach referred in the Dáil over a year ago to the necessity of introducing such legislation.  May I ask specifically on this issue if the Leader of the House will make a statement to the House indicating whether there is a consciously formulated Government policy to inhibit the introduction of legislation from any source other than Government. I think it is important that we know this is policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In practical terms it is an important issue, a Chathaoirligh.  I do not really think I am making a speech; I am just making a point.  It is over 30 years since a Bill was introduced from anywhere other than the Government side. I think that damages the democratic process of this House.</P>
      <P>My final request would be for another statement from the Leader, if he would be so kind, in response to a matter on the Supplementary Order Paper to which I referred last week.  I refer to the response of the Government to the judgement I secured in the European Court of Human Rights.  The reason I asked for this statement to be on the record of this House is that I understand that last week and also yesterday in the other House the Taoiseach made it clear that this was not a priority.  It would be of assistance to me in seeking a debate if the Leader of the House would clearly place on the record of this House what is the Government's attitude in this important matter so that this House could then discuss the Government's response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to legislation, I mentioned last week that most of the legislation that is in the other House at the moment was first dealt with here. That is one of the problems we have. There are three Bills in the Dáil at the moment that this House initiated and I do not hear any complaints from our colleagues in the other House.  In fact, if anyone cared to listen to what was said in the other House, it was very complimentary of the way the Bills were dealt with here, in particular the Electoral Bill, which was debated in the Dáil all day yesterday and last week.  Many of the speakers mentioned the contributions made in this House and gave extracts from the speeches of various Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, for Senator Costello to suggest we are playing second fiddle is a poor reflection on all the contributions made here.  Equally, when the Green Paper on Education comes to this House, <Col N="104" /> it would be a poor reflection on the Senator's own ability if he felt he was playing second fiddle to the debate that takes place this week in the other House. I would have thought that the Senator, along with other of his colleagues who are very much involved in education, would have plenty to say and contribute.</P>
    <P>After the Order of Business I will speak with the Whips and leaders of the groups in regard to how we will approach that debate.  I hope that next Thursday we will have a full day debate in the House with the Minister.  Unfortunately, the Minister has Questions in the Dáil that day.  I want to see how that can be overcome, but I hope we can deal with the Green Paper next Thursday.</P>
    <P>In regard to other legislation, the three Bills on the referenda will be here in two weeks time; that will probably be 28 October and 29 October.  The Roads Bill and the Land Commission Bill will be before us in the immediate future.  In regard to the report of the Ombudsman, whenever the Whips decide to bring that back we will deal with it.  With regard to the Seanad changes Senator Upton mentioned, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are dealing with these on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly mentioned that he hopes the Minister will take note tomorrow of his contribution on the economy. I am quite certain that over the years every Minister who has come into the House and listened to Senator O'Reilly has taken note of his contributions and has acted on it.  I am sure Ministers Cowen and Ahern tomorrow will be very pleased to hear his views and suggestions on the economy and job creation.</P>
    <P>In regard to Foreign Affairs, as I mentioned, it is unfortunate for us at the moment that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, is extremely busy.  He is very keen to come to the House to give an account of his recent visit and to finalise the formation of a foreign affairs committee. Finally, I hope to have in the coming days a full list of legislation for the rest of the session.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was talking about the situation in Somalia.  Something which has disturbed me and, I am sure, many other people was the attitude taken in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week by one of the writers who tried to rubbish the visit of President Robinson to Somalia.  His report did not diminish the role played by the President and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but rather it adversely affected the way many people felt towards him.  It should be said that the visits to Somalia by President Robinson and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, were extremely useful in making more people around the world concerned about what is happening in that area.  To suggest that the visit was of no consequence and that it diminished the role of the Presidency was an insult to the Irish people and to everybody who has a caring attitude towards the people of Somalia.  We should recognise that that visit was of extreme importance, even if Mr. Dunphy does not feel it was.  Mr. Dunphy should visit areas of the world where there are more important items to be discussed than perhaps he is capable of discussing. He should go and see the situation for himself and then write from the perspective of being there rather than talking in terms of what he called the minor role that can be played by the President of Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was speaking last week I mentioned the fact that throughout the world there are many areas where problems such as famine and deprivation have been addressed by the European Community <Col N="106" /> over the past number of years &mdash; for example, Ethiopia, Sudan and Afghanistan. Not alone do we have to address the problem of famine occurring from natural causes, but we have to address ourselves also to a resolution of the horrific civil wars that are going on in many of these countries.  We cannot suggest that these problems can be resolved in the countries themselves.  There has to be a major international intervention, and the major international intervention I would like to see would be that the arms salesmen of the world would be prevented from selling to these areas.</P>
    <P>In many of these countries, where there is deprivation and horrific poverty and death, it is caused by people in the western world who, because of the lowering of tension as a result of the ending of the Cold War, have armaments to sell and they are selling them to these countries.  We see that on the west coast of America nearly 250,000 people will lose there jobs in the armaments industry because of the ending of the Cold War. We see the former states of the USSR with arms to sell, and they can be sold openly in any place.  There was much said yesterday about some man in England who went off and bought a Russian Mig fighter in Poland.  If a private individual can go off and buy a Russian Mig fighter, you can well imagine what an arms dealer can do with money to spend and with customers readily available in the poorer countries of the Third World.</P>
    <P>The European Community is going to have to take a very strong line in any international negotiations that take place on disarmament, because there is no point in disarming the warlords unless we disarm the people who are selling the arms in the first place.  They are in Europe, in America and in the former territories of the CIS, and Britain, France and Germany and not without considerable blame in this area also.  We see in the Gulf area, where we had an horrific short war not so long ago, that the United States have now sold some 76 F-15 airplanes to Saudi Arabia at a cost of $35 billion.  The main reason the Saudis say they are buying these aircraft is because <Col N="107" /> of the fact that Iran has now bought quite a number of submarines from the former USSR.</P>
    <P>Consider the implications of $35 billion to be spent for the 76 F-15 planes.  The Saudis have said that the future of Saudi Arabia is in their two new cities of Yanbu and Jubail.  The total involvement by Saudi Arabia in the development of these industrial cities has been in the region of $20 billion to $22 billion, Europe and America have put in the rest, and it comes to exactly the same amount as the Saudis are putting into buying these F-15 planes.  Basically, what they are doing is paying back the United States for the help that they got in &ldquo;Desert Storm&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for developing these points, but I think we should at least address current matters which are to some extent outside the ambit of the various reports. Since the break-up of the eastern bloc we have had the horrific example of violence in Yugoslavia.  It seems as if this ethnic cleansing will continue and that no effort will be made by the international community to get involved in, as they say, the internal politics of the area.  Unfortunately, it is not entirely internal politics. When the break-up of Yugoslavia occurred, some countries decided they wanted to go it alone again and the EC recognised these countries.  Therefore, it is definitely a matter of concern for the EC that we should be involved in trying to stop the rape of what was Yugoslavia. It is estimated that up to 300,000 people could die in that area because of the winter conditions and the lack of food and of shelter.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have to address in a more competent manner the problem of refugees.  We have taken in over 200 people from Bosnia and they are living in reasonable conditions in north County Dublin.  The problem with this is that this might give people the idea that a refugee camp over there is the same as a refugee camp in Ireland.  The difference between the conditions of those 200 refugees lodged in Ireland and the conditions of <Col N="108" /> refugees in other camps abroad has to be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>I was one of a group who visited a refugee camp where over 10,000 people were living in tent conditions in the desert near Aden looked after by the French relief group, Medicins sans Frontiéres. Their living conditions could not be compared with the conditions of refugees in Ireland.  Pictures of refugees enjoying themselves in Ireland does not mean that refugees around the world live in similar conditions.  Refugees live in tented areas and under horrific conditions in many areas of the world and it is up to Ireland and the EC to ensure that their conditions are improved.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about Ireland's ODA contribution.  We must increase the present amount.  I realise that even though we have not reached the United Nations recommended level of ODA spending, through the EC we have increased our input into overseas development agencies.  It may be necessary to revise the tax system to allow for a specific amount of money to be given to overseas development agencies.  There is no other way to do it; unfortunately, nowadays, nothing is given for nothing. Irish people are very generous and within the confines of our budgetary situation we should consider the provision of a very small percentage of our tax revenue for the alleviation of poverty and to deal with crises outside Ireland.  Some people will say we should address our own major problems and forget those of other countries. No nation can live in isolation today.  We need the outside world just as much as it needs us.</P>
    <P>I agree that Ireland has huge problems today.  We speak about warlords in places like Ethiopia, Somalia and the Sudan but we have warlords here in Ireland also and indeed all over Europe.  The warlords we encounter are those of the commercial world who use currency for their own ends without any thought of consequent damage to the national infrastructure and to the personal lives of thousands.  They are the worst type of warlord.  Currency speculators such as those of the past month have to be defeated; they are of <Col N="109" /> no use for the development of business or the enhancement of nations.  They should be condemned wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years I have been a critic of the Central Bank and in particular of its Governor, Mr. Maurice Doyle, believing that the Bank has not contributed to our industrial development. Its excessive conservatism has held interest rates at unsustainably high levels for too long.  However, in the current crisis both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank have acted extremely well.  They have protected our currency and, consequently, current and future jobs.</P>
    <P>International banking circles in Europe praised the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank for moves taken to protect our currency during the opening weeks of this massive rapacious attack. Present interest rates may be blamed on the actions of those rapacious speculators.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have moved in to help those struggling hard to protect jobs in a difficult economic environment. The past number of years has witnessed a massive worldwide recession.  Ireland, in terms of its exports, GDP and GNP has done exceptionally well on foot of Government policies.  We need jobs and they will follow if current Government policies on job creation can be followed through.  We also need financial help.  At present the companies that will be helped most financially under the official scheme are those coming under pressure because of the growing strength of foreign currencies, and in particular of the pound. In the main they are exporting companies but I hope the Government do not forget the horrific high interest rate problems encountered by small service industries and by agriculture.</P>
    <P>I agree with assisting export companies in the present currency situation but many export companies received substantial EC or State grants when setting up and may also avail of a very low tax rate of 35 per cent on their exports compared to the normal business taxation rates applying to other smaller firms who contribute indirectly to our exports success. <Col N="110" /> The EC can help here.  Meetings have taken place recently where it was suggested that under EC rules assistance to industry would breach free trade regulations.</P>
    <P>The major problem associated with these six monthly EC statements is that they contain statements and records of meetings where unemployment has been one of the core issues on every case. Unemployment has grown over the past number of years throughout Europe and EC policies have not been able to reverse the trend.  Efforts have been made in many areas of the Community to devise short term measures to alleviate problems associated with unemployment but unfortunately 90 per cent of these measures have had no long term benefit. Many courses have been set up but they have not led to sustainable jobs.  The Government must monitor every EC effort to ensure that money spent on courses, whether through FÁS or otherwise, is productively allocated, leading to sustainable jobs and improving the status of the participants.</P>
    <P>We must foster employment-related skills.  There is no point in putting people through a six month or 12 month course if it is not going to lead to the prospect of a job afterwards.  Highly skilled, highly educated people should not be entered on short term courses that do not enhance skills or increase the probability of finding work.</P>
    <P>In the past number of months we have witnessed the great debate on Maastricht. Irish people have followed tradition by indicating that they believe our future lies in a stronger Europe.  Situated on the periphery we need a strong Europe in which there will be less paperwork and fewer problems in trading with mainland partners, our largest market. In the past, paper work has accounted for up to 10 per cent of the cost of exporting and anything that brings these costs down is worth fighting for.  Maastricht offers a guarantee in this respect.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Danish &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, I heard the editor of the premier Danish business magazine being interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week when he <Col N="111" /> said that nobody in Denmark can say why the Danes voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;; a hundred Danish people would give a hundred different reasons.  It is important for us to find out why they voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; but it is more important that they find out for themselves.</P>
    <P>Britain has itself to blame for its recent difficulties.  It is strange to hear Mr. John Major suggest that Maastricht is the be-all and end-all of things when Britain has pulled out of the ERM and by doing so has created more difficulties for itself in the long term, and for us in the short term.</P>
    <P>Britain is a divided country which still considers itself a colonial power and believes it should be the premier runner in Europe, not realising that its economy is in decline as is evident by the substantial rise in forced redundancies over the past number of weeks.  Britain's industry is outdated.  It has not kept up to date as we have and will suffer over the next number of years because of that.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has played a dominant role in the Irish economy until now and this trend will continue although difficulties are being experienced in every area of agriculture at present.  We must compliment Commissioner MacSharry on the huge amount of work he has done to protect agriculture.  As recently as this week's GATT talks he has fought to ensure that Irish people can live on the land, enjoy a reasonable quality of life and contribute to the economy.  Farming, like other industries, is going through a period of change which will present major problems for many people in the industry.</P>
    <P>The question of set-aside land must be looked at.  It is strange to think that half the world cannot feed itself while we are overproducing.  Surely we could grow useful crops and not crops whose surpluses accumulate into unwanted lakes or mountains.</P>
    <P>We must ask the banks at this stage to exercise care in their dealings with firms in this particularly bad time.  There is a feeling abroad that the banks are not playing their part in maintaining present <Col N="112" /> jobs levels.  Unfortunately, bank managers around the country have lost the power to manage their banks.  All they may do is pass messages from regional offices to their customers.  They are not in the business of managing banks anymore.</P>
    <P>Over the next few months we are going to see the end of Customs and Excise barriers and that will create certain problems. It has been stated that 1,000 jobs will be lost in the Customs and Excise clearance area over the next couple of years.  This is probably true and we must ensure that these employees are transferred to positions where they may protect our borders against international drug traders. There is no doubt that the international drug trade is growing, not least in Ireland.  A number of people have been caught and we must compliment the Garda and the customs officers on their vigilant efforts over the past number of years to half the huge quantity of drugs coming into this country.</P>
    <P>I hope that over the next few years we will discuss current developments in the EC and not deal with out-of-date reports, as we have in this House.  We have had an opportunity to talk about current matters but not to address the current topics raised in the reports.</P>
    <P>If we unite in Europe this country has a tremendous future.  Many people say there is no future for young people in Ireland or for the unemployed.  I am certain that if the Maastricht agreement is followed through in other European countries, in a very short time we will have a better Europe with good prospects for the present generation of Irish and for generations to come.</P>

      <P>If you were feeling in a severe mood you would probably rule out Senator Lanigan's statements as irrelevant just as you would rule out what I am going to say.  Strictly speaking we are supposed to be debating the developments in the European Communities &mdash; 32nd-38th reports, inclusive.  I have totally forgotten what those reports are and Senator Lanigan rightly did not confine himself to these reports; he gave <Col N="113" /> a free ranging speech which I hope to emulate.</P>
      <P>May I point out the absurdity of bringing into this House reports which belong, strictly speaking, to history when all that we say about them are, properly speaking, historical comments?  In practice, we ignore them and go on to talk about the present developments in the European Community.  This points up the futility of our Joint Committee on European Affairs of which I am a member, because, of necessity, its activities and discussions and our reflections on them when they come to this House are retrospective. We, unlike other countries, have no input as yet into our Government's policy making on European affairs.  I understand that one of the reasons the Danes took such a lively and constructive interest in Maastricht was the dominant position of their Parliamentary Committee in formulating European policy.  I know the UK House of Lords has an EC committee which makes an input into Government policy on Europe.  Engaging as we do in a purely retrospective exercise on long since past developments is totally irrelevant and that is why Senator Lanigan and I totally depart from the strict terms of reference here.  I hope our Foreign Affairs Committee and our European Committee, if they are to be one and the same, will demand a new brief for themselves in this respect so that we will feel at least that what we are discussing relates to the present and to the future rather than to the past.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan has a perfect right to make his comments on the column of a particular writer in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> with regard to the President's visit to Somalia but, in turn, that writer has every right to his own view and I would defend his right.  It is no harm perhaps to have a corrective voice to a universal chorus of adulation; I distrust universal adulation even where such a worthy person as our President is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I would uphold his right to be wrong.  We live in a free society and the voice of dissent is valuable even when it is wrong headed.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay overlong on Somalia but since Senator Lanigan brought it up and I was not able to contribute to last week's debate, might I say briefly that the real questions about Somalia have not been asked amid all the ballyhoo or have been asked by very few people.  One RTE reporter &mdash; Marian Finnucane &mdash; did a good programme in which she went straight to the heart of the issue last week.</P>
      <P>The facts are that Somalia is no longer a cold war strategic area and no longer of any interest to the one remaining superpower.  It has no oil and therefore it is neglected.  A corollary to that is that the Somalians, like so many Africans, have been driven into the kind of agricultural production which is not in their interest but which serves the interest of those to whom they are in debt and to whom they have to render that debt.  In some respects their position and the crops they are forced to cultivate from which they themselves cannot benefit is not unlike the situation of Irish pre-Famine tenant farmers, which is one of the reasons we feel a sense of empathy with them, not simply because they have a famine as we did but because their basic economic situation is the same.  They have been forced into a subsistence economy. This is so not only in Somalia but throughout Africa.  God only knows what horrors will loom up before us on our television screens in the forthcoming months from other parts of Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish public is generous to a fault and continues to dig deeper for all these various and sometimes competing charitable organisations.  One of the questions raised by the publicity given to our relief agencies in Somalia is to what extent they are in needless and, indeed, in counterproductive competition with one another. Many people in this country feel that <Col N="115" /> this famine is an act of God, that the Somalians are being scourged by famine just as we were and that we owe them this historical debt.  That is a good response but we do not reflect sufficiently on the fact that basically the Somalians starve because we are well off, and by &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the First World.  The first world consumes an indecently extravagant proportion of limited world resources which means that the Africans have to suffer.  The President touched on this fact in her analysis and went as far as the constitutional constraints of her office permitted, but as inhabitants of the First World, and of the European Community in particular, we have, or will not come to terms with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to war lords and the ubiquity of the gun culture in Somalia, a scandal for which some of our European partners are responsible.  I have asked myself over the time we have been members of the European Community participating in its various councils, including the Council of Ministers, in the Commission, in the European Parliament and various other fora, to what extent have our Government said to the Germans, the French and the British to knock it off, that we do not want them supplying arms to Third World nations or engaged in this obscene arms trade. Have we ever said that?  We boast about having an influence on common European policy &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; but we have no influence whatsoever in this direction.  As Senator Lanigan rightly said, the commercial war lords in the arms racket ply their trade absolutely unchecked in this regard.  It casts strong doubts on the influence we have in Europe when we cannot exert any influence apparently to curtail the disgustingly obscene arms trade, the results of which are so shamefully evident in Somalia.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I welcome President Robinson's visit and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrew's prompt initiative in this matter is that it seemed that when they went to New York to make their report to the Secretary General, for the first time in a long time <Col N="116" /> our President and Minister for Foreign Affairs were saying that Ireland as a nation has a distinctive view on the tragedy in Somalia.  It is not the view of most of our European partners who have a very different history from our history. In short, what we saw last week was an assertion of something like an independent Irish foreign policy and a return to the best days, if you like, of this country's foreign policy in the early 1960s. I believe that is the President's policy except, of course, she is restrained from expressing it constitutionally.</P>
    <P>Our foreign policy interests are not identical with those of France, Germany or Britain.  These large powers in the Community pursue their own national interest.  For them a common foreign policy is something on the margins.  I said it before in the debate on the Maastricht Treaty that the French and the British have made it perfectly clear that for them the important thing in foreign policy is their own national self-interest.  The French have said this quite nakedly: where the national self-interest of France is concerned, France will pursue her own policy.</P>
    <P>The idea of a common foreign policy in which states subordinate their national self-interest to some kind of European ideal is utter nonsense.  It was one of the pieces of nonsense we were supposed to swallow during the Maastricht debate. We should take a leaf out of John Major's book, and Norman Tebbit's book.  Quite unashamedly at Brighton they said that for them the important thing was their national self-interest and as a public representative as far as I am concerned the only important thing is the national self-interest of this country.  We are getting a second chance to back off from that entirely illusory policy of a common foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Equally illusory, of course, is the idea of a common monetary and economic policy and we have seen that in pieces in the past couple of weeks.  It is quite obvious that the Germans prefer their own national self-interest to any greater European common interest. They have no intention of supplying us <Col N="117" /> with £6 billion when they have to foot the bill of German unification.  The £6 billion is now becoming like what the old woman said to Robin Flower: &ldquo;Cá bhfuil an sneachta geal a bhí ann anuraidh&rdquo;, I am afraid the sneachta geal is evaporating at a great rate.  Remember, by the way, that the Germans pursued their own unilateral interest in the matter of Yugoslavia which we all, willy-nilly, had to follow.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons I think we should learn at this critical stage in the development of the European Community is that Maastrict was a mistake, that it is hopefully dying, that we go back to the drawing board and that we pursue our own national self-interest as a primary value and that in so doing we recover our self-respect which was so shamefully put up for grabs during the Maastrict referendum campaign.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reflect on the evolution of Europe for a number of reasons.  First, the Irish people will enjoy the type of unity within their own country and the type of free trade that has been achieved in Europe.  The benefits of that will be significant to many Irish people.  The previous speaker has gone out the door but he said we should take a leaf out of John Major's book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not do it intentionally. I made a mistake.  I thought the Senator had left.  Very few people in Ireland would support the Senator because I believe the British have not accepted that they have a problem and that is the real difficulty in Europe and in Ireland today.  There are people in Ireland who do not believe that Ireland will ever achieve equal status or standing in anything.  We have the John L's and the Conor Cruises.  I heard a commentator say at the time Fianna Fáil had a leadership crisis, &ldquo;You can appoint <Col N="118" /> Albert or John or Mary but the country is bankrupt&rdquo;.  There are people who use such extravagant language and I would question whether such people have a real commitment to the future of Ireland. That is as far as I will go on that because I want to be positive.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome the opportunity to say that it will mean a tremendous amount for this country to stand on its own two feet in the European Community. We will have free trade and will be able to benefit from that.  We must start by getting the youth of our country to believe in themselves and to believe that we have as good and better for our young educated people as exist anywhere. For too many generations we have convinced our young people that they would be better off anywhere rather than at home.  We used our national media to project the glamorous life one could have in Australia, Canada or Britain.  Today we are picking up the tabs and seeing the tragedy of families returning home on every boat.  They are broke and have no home or job.  This makes our situation much more difficult here.  I ask those learned people to be more positive and helpful to the youth of this country and point out to them that there is a great future here for them.  We do not need to use a film where mothers are crying at Knock Airport waving goodbye to their children.  It would imply that Knock Airport, on which £14 million was spent, was a disaster and contributed to emigration from the west.  I say to those people, the John Ls and the Conor Cruises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> We have the ability to develop our tourism and fishing industries and the resources necessary to provide jobs for our young people.  The cries of those who continually condemn this country as having nothing to offer to our youth are becoming distant.  Such people are not being heeded.  Ireland has had to overcome its own critics and that has been the biggest problem we have had to overcome, going back to the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we will have free traffic in goods and services on this island.  I believe it will make a major contribution towards the removal of the Border.  At least the psychological border will go if we can trade freely with our own kin across the Border.  That would be a tremendous advantage.  I believe it would also help to prove to those who are involved in the paramilitary campaign the futility of their efforts because this country will be united in trade and the elected representatives will be united and at one.</P>
    <P>I do not praise the Mr. Major nor do I criticise him.  I sympathise with the British people because they have a real problem.  The Sinn Féin attitude in the past was burn everything British other than their coal.  Many Irish people have set up homes and businesses in England and there is no rancour or bad relations between us and the British, other than their occupation of the North of Ireland. Everyone knows the British would leave tomorrow if they could.  One would not need to be a university graduate to know that the British are trying to extricate themselves from the situation they created in Northern Ireland which costs them millions of pounds they cannot afford.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not the British are the poor relations in Europe today. Who would have dreamed sterling would not hold its value against the French franc or the mark?  The British annually commemorate winning the war and hammering the poor Germans into the ground, but anyone who looks at the German economy today must recognise <Col N="120" /> that they are the dominant people in Europe.  Last week the Minister said the peaceful unification of Germany was significant. I support those sentiments.  I had an opportunity to listen to eminent people saying how they helped the East Germans.  They did not do it by pumping in millions of pounds but by sending in 2,000 of their best people who took over and built up a very successful industrial base in East Germany.  The world recognises that the German nation will be the number one economic force in the world, let alone Europe.  I think it is great for a small country like ours to have its currency tied to the German currency.</P>
    <P>It saddens me that our currency is no longer on a par with sterling even though for years people crossing the Border to shop had to take what the traders offered for the punt.  It is very hard for those traders north of the Border to accept that the punt is stronger than the pound sterling.  Today if you were driving through Derry, Strabane or Newry different people would give different rates of exchange.  Some would offer £1.10 or £1.05 while others give parity.  Some traders north of the Border are charging on the punt against the pound sterling.  I look forward to a monetary union which will include Britain because that will only help trade.</P>
    <P>We have much to gain from being in Europe and we have a major contribution to make.  Our industrial development has only begun.  We have only started to develop our tourism industry which has vast potential.  My county is undeveloped. I was pleased to be at a conference on Monday evening when it was announced that a new £15 million hotel would be built in Port Salon, County Donegal.  Donegal did not develop as quickly as Shannon, Limerick or other centres but we are developing and providing jobs.  Our young people coming out of third level colleges must believe they have a future in Ireland and their first thought should be what can I do for myself and my country?  I deplore turning on the television or the radio and listening to the Gaybos, Pat Kennys, Mike Murphys or whoever, continually use <Col N="121" /> that subsidised station to paint a false picture which has led many of our youth to leave Ireland to face a disastrous future.  This morning I listened to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  He was interviewing a person who was complaining that he could get a cheaper trip to America with an airline other than Aer Lingus but the had to fly to London by Aer Lingus.  He continually points out the disadvantages and how difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Recently when the British broke with the ERM, the chairman of the chamber of commerce in Newry appeared on two evening television programmes pointed out that people from the South were driving to Newry to shop.  Anyone would realise that it was good business for the chairman of the traders in Newry to say on the &ldquo;Six O'Clock News&rdquo; that he had a rush of business from Dublin.  He took advantage of the fact that our television programme producers were telling the people to go North and shop for Christmas.  Then they interviewed ladies who said what great value they got and how profitable it was to shop in the North.  This propaganda is continually broadcast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an obligation, as do others in this House, to say we do not accept such propaganda.  It is misleading the people. Yet, that false propaganda is continually projected on our screens by a station which is subsidised by the Irish taxpayers. This station is misleading our young people and encouraging them to go abroad and it is misleading our people by telling them to shop outside the State.  It contributes nothing to the nation.  If I were to write to the people in charge I would be snubbed; they would not listen to me.  They would tell me I was a fool <Col N="122" /> and did not know what I was talking about but I have a platform here and I am using it to tell these people they are doing no service to the nation.  Some of them are earning salaries in excess of £100,000 a year; two or three members of a family have jobs in this closed shop. The best qualification one can have to get a job in RTÉ is to be a friend of somebody who is inside the camp.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I respect the Chair totally.  I am trying &mdash; perhaps I am not doing a great job &mdash; to point out that this little country has many advantages.  We must give our young people a basic education and provide as much resources as we can for second and third level education and for training. They must believe in their own country and not follow bad advice to go abroad. Many return from abroad broke before they see the opportunities at home.  That is the point I am trying to make and I hope I have been sucessful to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards employment one can criticise and say that this and previous Governments have failed to resolve the problem but the day of the family farm employing three or four people is no longer with us.  Small families in rural Ireland have a problem today, first, in educating five or six members of their family and then finding employment for <Col N="123" /> them.  I support Senator Lanigan when he complimented Commissioner MacSharry on the tremendous fight he put up in Europe to have agriculture reorganised to the extent where 80 per cent of the benefit no longer goes to 20 per cent of the farmers in Ireland.  We all recognise that Commissioner MacSharry did a great job for Europe and for Ireland.  I hope that the MacSharry plan is successful and that he will succeed in having a much wider spread of the benefits.</P>
    <P>Consider our fishing industry.  We need more than restricted quotas.  Whether it is milk, fish or whatever, we must receive the maximum benefit and not just for a few people, whether it is the Kerry Co-operative or whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect to the tremendous success of those co-operatives, they were actually taking the cream of the benefit from Europe and they have the capacity to fight very hard and say it is this way or not at all; we will hold on.  These giants became so big that they were quoted on the Stock Exchange and they invested in America.  It is far from the day when the poor little fellow on the side of the hill put £5 on the table and started a co-operative but thanks to the vision of Commissioner MacSharry, he fought for the small holders.  I think he did a great job and we will never have a Commissioner who will do such a service to this State.  People might not like him because he has a political background they do not accept but I think he did a fantastic job for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a Border county and it pleases me that this country has developed its social welfare system to the point where an old age pensioner in the south is now better off than an old age pensioner in the North.  Right across the board, nurses, teachers, the Army and the Garda are much better off than their counterparts in the North.  An unemployed single person here was getting £54 before the last increase but in the North he would get £62 for two weeks.  It is a <Col N="124" /> great achievement for a country that has no oil and has limited resources to have a high status in Europe and to be able to give a fair measure of support for the underprivileged and the unemployed at home.  In addition, our currency is stronger than sterling.  It is a tremendous achievement for those who have been involved in Government in organising our future in Europe.  It gives me a sense of pride, more so when I live in a Border county.  Today there are people with gloomy faces who wonder when will sterling stop falling.  I would find it very difficult to take a leaf out of John Major's book at this stage.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have the support of Europe in developing our fishing, tourism and timber industries and that the youth of this country will have an opportunity to make a major contribution in Europe.  The Government are aware of that.  They behaved sensibly in the last currency crisis.  They stood fast and did not let the speculators win.  I compliment the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Ministers for their forthright steadfastness in guiding the ship in Europe.  I think there is a great future for this country.  We must start off by believing in ourselves and encouraging the youth of the country to believe there is a future for them and be good Europeans.</P>

The advice I would give to these people is that if radio shows, television programmes or indeed newspapers articles irritate them, in the name of goodness stop reading them, turn off the radio programme or plug into one of those music stations where a person is bound to get some music to their taste and where they will be able to relax and be happy.

      <P>There are seven EC reports to be discussed this afternoon.  From the tone of the speeches so far it would appear that they were not read to a very great degree.  Indeed, I must be honest and say that I have not read them either and there are a number of reasons for that.  First, these reports are exceptionally turgid.  They are written in very dull, tiresome, Eurospeak.  One would need to be in the best of form, have plenty of time on one's hands and little else to do in order to work one's way through all those reports.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy alluded to the fact that the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities was ineffective in generating any impetus in to the way we formulate policy in relation to the European Community and I share his frustration.</P>
      <P>I also share the frustration which is widely felt in this House because we do not as yet, have a foreign affairs committee.  This appears to be getting the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; treatment.  We have debated the matter and many requests for the formation of this committee but, to date, nothing concrete appears to be happening.</P>

    <P>It is very difficult for people in Irish politics to make an effective and meaningful contribution to the debate in Europe.  The nature of Irish politics militates strongly against that.  That, coupled with the manner we get information from Europe and the way it is made available from the EC militates greatly against the ordinary people, and even against the average politician, coming to grips with <Col N="126" /> what is involved.  It is a great reflection on the EC and the people who run Europe &mdash; the European Civil Service &mdash; that it was necessary for one of the British newspapers, <i>The Independent on Sunday,</i> to produce a lay person's guide to the Maastricht Treaty.  It is a pity that had to happen.  If people across Europe are to be involved in decision making and are to understand what the issues are, a greater effort must be made to improve the way these matters are communicated to the general public.</P>
    <P>A relatively small number of people in this country understand what is involved in developments in Europe &mdash; academics, business people, journalists, some people in the Civil Service and, I suppose, a variety of other people &mdash; but the average person does not understand what is happening in Europe.  I must confess to having great difficulty in grasping what is involved.  Things change rapidly, there is an enormous amount of information and it is very difficult to come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years or so there have been considerable benefits for this country from the EC.  For that reason I see the present developments in Europe as very worrying.  The EC is now at a crossroads and is experiencing a crisis. That crisis was triggered off initially because of the knock-on effects from the reunification of Germany.</P>
    <P>Europe is now gripped in a currency crisis which has very serious implications. That crisis may have been triggered by the result of the Danish referendum. One must accept, however, that the underlying facilitating forces and influences must have already existed for the Danish result to give rise to that problem. The narrow majority in favour of Maastricht in France added to that instability. The continuing difficulties which the Tory Party in Britain is experiencing and the disarray in which that party now finds itself, also greatly contribute to that instability. Indeed, the behaviour of some of the Euro-sceptics in the British Tory Party reminds one of General De Gaulle's attitude to Britain when he prevented that country from joining the <Col N="127" /> European Community.  One cannot help feel that some of these people were never fully committed Europeans; they have remained very sceptical and have many reservations about Europe.</P>
    <P>A clear message of commitment to the European ideal should be given at the Birmingham Summit.  It is important that something should be done to facilitate controlling and limiting the mounting tensions which are now to be seen, in particular in Germany.  It is important that the message from the Summit would help to end or alleviate the currency crisis.</P>
    <P>Talk of a two-tier Europe is not helpful. It is something this country should do everything in its power to resist and set aside.  In particular, talk of some federal minded European States within the European Community setting up a high speed Europe while the rest would be left in second place would be highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>There should be a full examination of the fall out from the French and the Danish referenda.  There is a great need for the European Commission and the European institutions to become more open and more user friendly.  They need to become more comprehensible to the ordinary people.  From our point of view, it is very important that the notion of subsidiarity be developed and expanded so that those countries which can, should be allowed do their own thing within the framework of broader European policies.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about recent suggestions that the powers of the Commission should be curbed.  It is very undesirable that the big states should be allowed to have a greater role and that the functions and role of the Commission should be diminished.  We have to recognise that the big states pay the bill and provide the finances to keep Europe functioning, but most of the progressive proposals which have helped this country initiated from the Commission.  One gets the impression there is a constant tension, a constant struggle, between the Commission, which is seeking to broaden facilities and <Col N="128" /> improve the welfare of states such as Ireland, and governments of the larger economies which, understandably, may be reluctant to provide the money for that development.  As things now stand, it would be undesirable from this country's point of view for the powers of the Commission to be restricted.  What will happen in the long term is a different matter.  That is in the future; but there are many other implications to be considered in relation to how Europe develops, and so on.  In the short term, in the present crisis and given the difficultues which exist in the developed economies, it is undesirable that that should happen.</P>
    <P>I would be in favour of an enlarged European Community, at least in principle. That is where Europe should go and where the welfare of Europe ultimately lies.  However, we need to look at that under two broad headings.  There is the question of the EFTA countries which, broadly speaking, are well off; these would be the rich countries with successful thriving economies.  If they come into the EC in all probability this country will benefit.  However, if the Eastern European countries, poorer countries which have enormous difficulties, come into Europe, it will put further pressures on the budget and so on.  Having said that, I am not suggesting that these countries should not be allowed into Europe.  The way forward for us in Europe is through the integration of these countries.  However, it is important that the manner in which they are integrated should be thought out very carefully.</P>
    <P>We should consider the measures which will be needed to integrate these countries fully into the EC and how we should best approach that problem.  I would not like to think it would be done in a willy-nilly manner, as with the reunification of Germany.  Everybody in Germany appeared to think it was a great idea at the time but subsequently, very difficult knock-on problems arose.  That country is now finding it quite hard to deal with those problems.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the Single Market <Col N="129" /> and the developments that will take place on 1 January 1993 give rise to a number of items of concern, one of which is the increased risk of the introduction of rabies into this country.  That is a very serious problem to which very little attention has been given so far.  I would like to see a far greater degree of public awareness of the risks and of public understanding of how those risks should be limited.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the attitude of the United Kingdom to non-European nationals who live in the EC. That raises very difficult and important questions in relation to our dealings with Britain and how people from this country will have free access to Britain, which matter needs to be looked at carefully.  I believe the deadline of January 1 1993 for the ratification of the Maastricht agreement will not now be reached but it will not be the end of the world if that happens.  We had a similar situation before when it was necessary to hold a referendum in this country in relation to the Single European Act.  However, the longer the ratification is postponed, the more difficulties it raises for this country: for instance, the longer it will be before the Cohesion Fund will come into force. It is important that we get the Cohesion Fund in operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand that Denmark has set out its main problems and concerns in a White Paper.  The concerns centre on defence considerations and they would be shared by very many people in this country.  They also relate to currency issues and to the level of social services. In relation to the level of social services, I would also find myself, to a large extent, in agreement with the Danish position. I would also agree with some of their concerns about defence.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that it will not be possible to renegotiate Maastricht.  If we attempt to do so we will open an enormous can of worms and the whole agreement will become unstuck.  At the time of the debate on Maastricht I was in no doubt that we should ratify it.  I am glad we did so and I have seen no reason to change my mind subsequently despite <Col N="130" /> what has happened in the intervening period.  I still hold the same view and believe the long term interest of this country lies in staying in Europe and along with the lines broadly indicated in the Maastricht Agreement.  That is not to say I approve of everything in the document, but our best interests are served by going down the road which Maastricht proposes in general.  Every effort should be made to get the Danes off the hook and to facilitate them, as far as possible, within the constraint of this country not being able to renegotiate the Treaty, and accepting that the Treaty cannot be renegotiated.</P>
    <P>In any debate on Europe we go back to the ideals which were behind the founding of the European movement way back when the founding fathers had the capacity and the wisdom to get it up and moving.  Those ideals are still worthwhile. I have no doubt about that.  The basic overwhelming drive in those times was the prevention of war in Europe and I do not think anybody would quarrel with that.  With the turbulence which is now beginning to manifest itself in Europe those ideals are as worthwhile and as good as ever.  We should be as anxious to promote them now as when the people started off after the last Great War.  This is something which should never be lost sight of.  When one sees incipient fascism, neo-fascism and all that sort of thing raising its ugly, disgusting, horrible, cruel head in Europe, I for one would be very much on the side of the people who set up those institutions to try and put an end to that kind of behaviour and to starve it off.  We have to recognise that the forces which allowed fascism to develop are still there and they will again express themselves unless appropriate means are taken to prevent them gaining root and developing.</P>
    <P>There is no purpose, either in turning our back on the fact that Europe has brought this country a great deal of prosperity. We have not exploited all the opportunities it has given us but, nonetheless, great opportunities exist for us. In many ways the EC allowed this country to get on its feet to take it place among <Col N="131" /> the bigger states and have a voice at the top table.  That is desirable.  It is also desirable that this country should have that opportunity to make its contribution and I very much regret that we have not made a bigger effort to develop our notion of the way Europe should be going.  I would encourage anybody who has any capacity or any influence in those matters to try to do that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the reports and I welcome the debate.  It is a pity the reports are not written in a style of language which would be easier to understand and more accessible to the average person.  The quality of presentation of documentation which comes into this country from Europe, is truly appalling.  It is written in single space type.  All 72,000 pages of it are written in the same way with lines drawn under points of interest.  It is terrible stuff. Anyone in the lecturing or communication business would know that.  If I went on like that to the students I would be eaten alive and I would imagine if Professor Conroy went on like that with his students he would be thrown out. There would be riots.  I think the Europeans have a major lesson to learn in the very elementary aspects of communication, without even getting sophisticated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Upton made one of the most valid points in relation to the Community, namely, the lack of communication between the Community and ourselves, the appalling gobbledygook we receive.  As a result, many people feel it is totally removed from them.  We have difficulties at times ourselves.  What does an MEP do, in political terms?  They are separated from us, they have no real relationship with us.  That is one of the reasons quite a few Irish people, despite the enormous benefits we have received from membership of the Community, voted against the Treaty.  Quite a substantial number of people did this and others wondered what was the reason.  There were also many petty things.  I fail to see the benefit <Col N="132" /> of the purple rather sickly looking passports with which we are now issued compared wiht our traditional green passports of which we were very proud.</P>
      <P>As Commissioner MacSharry has rightly said, the Maastricht Treaty was not about national identity, it was not about personal moral issues, it was not about conscription.  Yet, people have a sense of interference with their personal identity.  People are still Irish, are still German, are still French, are still Italian, British, whatever it may be.  That should be recognised by the bureaucracy in Brussels.</P>
      <P>However, that is not to say that the Community has not been of enormous benefit to this country.  An article in the June edition of <i>Business and Finance</i> stated for example: &ldquo;Last year we contributed £348 million to the EC coffers and got £2,198 million in return.&rdquo;  That is an enormous relative return.  If we were trying to find that sort of money from taxpayers, from VAT or otherwise it would be an appalling imposition.  At times we fail to realise the transformation of the economy of this country which has occurred thanks to EC membership.  For us, what has been happening over the past few months has been quite a tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most dangerous features of what is happening at the moment, is the suggestion which seems to be emanating from the UK, that the role of the Commissioners should be diminished.  If this happened the bigger countries with larger populations and economies, who already have a dominant role as was seen only too clearly in the present European situation, would have an even greater role.  One of the Commissioners' functions and duties is to act for all of the European Community. A Commissioner comes from a specific given country but acts on behalf of all member states.  On many occasions they have shown clearly that they are acting in the interests of the Community as a whole and not of any one member. Their acting in the interests of the Community as a whole is of enormous importance to smaller countries, such as ourselves.  I am very glad the Taoiseach has issued a very strong statement on the <Col N="133" /> suggestion by the United Kingdom that, at the forthcoming European Summit, there should be some sort of bargain over the powers and rights of the Commissioners. Any such change would be detrimental to this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Maastricht Treaty we approved it with a strong majority; the French approved it by a small minority. It is very clear from public opinion polls that in the United Kingdom there will be a majority against it.  The same could happen in Germany.  The legal situation is that some accommodation must be found to deal with the Danish vote against the Community.</P>
    <P>The information I have from Copenhagen is that the majority of the Members of the Danish Parliament say there must be renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty.  This is a rather horrific prospect. I sincerely hope that, in discussions between the EC leaders on Friday, the <i>modus operandi</i> can be organised with Mr. Schluter of Denmark and his colleagues where, without a renegotiation, sufficient consideration may be given to the Danish concerns.  Some Irish people had similar concerns and voted against the Maastricht Treaty.  In Denmark there was a feeling of being overwhelmed by bureaucratic regulations, of being beside a major country, Germany, and a sense of a loss of their own identity.  It is easy to say, as certain Danes have said, that one gets 100 different explanations for the vote but the trend of those explanations has tended to follow one of those three lines.  They felt able to reject the Treaty and, despite all that has happened, Denmark is in a very strong economic position.  In regard to the recent suggestions about a two-tier monetary system, Denmark is one of the few countries which would fulfil all the criteria for the upper tier.</P>
    <P>We have not even begun to adapt to the implications of the financial situation. It is a tribute to our economic progress over the past few years, to the enormously improved financial situation in which we find ourselves, that we have a short breathing space to adapt.  Eight, nine or ten years ago the recent turmoil in <Col N="134" /> the markets, would probably have been devastating for this economy.  That is not to underestimate the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>For industry the present interest rates are virtually unsustainable.  The Government have moved very rapidly, efficiently and effectively to deal with the problems of exporters.  Clearly, that can, and must, be only a very short term solution.  One manufacturer said in an interview recently that exporters will use the funds to broaden their markets.  It is excellent that they should do so because it means that never again will they be totally dependent on the United Kingdom market.</P>
    <P>It will be extremely difficult for us to be competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United Kingdom if our punt remains above sterling but not impossible.  One of the great successes of the German economy has been that they have combined a strong economy with a very effective export and industrial system, perhaps one of the best in the world.  This proves it can be done but let us not underestimate the enormous difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>We have been very successful in the export area.  Ireland is one of the few countries, which has a surplus <i>vis-á-vis</i> exports to Germany; Denmark is another.  There are a host of other problems beneath the surface and which will erupt unless the monetary situation is cleared up.</P>
    <P>Let us look at a problem which is affecting other countries.  What will happen to the very vital motor manufacturing industry throughout western Europe?  Will the French and the Germans allow the Japanese to manufacture Nissan cars in the United Kingdom and sell them at a very low price into their markets?  I do not think they will do that for very long.  Many of the problems we are seeing in microcosm can be seen on a large scale between France, Germany and the United Kingdom and they will have to be solved.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that a Government, which accepted the ERM, and based their entire strategy on it, and argued up to a few weeks ago that it was absolutely vital, <Col N="135" /> gave a long list of reasons for devaluation and for leaving the EMS, should talk about how much better it is to be out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  There is a contradiction here.</P>
    <P>It is easy to blame the money speculators, although it is appalling that people should have been making vast sums of money by speculating on the variations in the currency levels.  Nonetheless, allied with that is the reality that a currency cannot be kept above its true value for very long and as a matter of prudence, our industries and anyone dealing in exports, including our exporters, quite rightly found themselves in a situation where they had to buy sterling or sell sterling to maintain industrial and other exports to the United Kingdom.  It is not a simple matter of blaming the currency speculators or the gnomes of Zurich, who were blamed 15 years ago.  There is a lot more to it than that.  We have a crucial path to follow over the next few months and I hope and I believe we can maintain our currency.</P>
    <P>We will need to have a very clear, rational and organised policy in relation to the currency situation.  We must be aware of the fact that in the conversations, leaks and rumours emanating from Central Europe one gets the strong impression that our colleagues from Germany in the Bundesbank have a very clear role to play, namely, to prevent inflation in Germany, which they are achieving successfully.  Perhaps the main reason for the currency problems which exist at present is that on one occasion they allowed themselves to be contradicted politically when the German Government, against the advice of the Bundesbank insisted on equal exchange parity between the Deutsche Mark, which had a real value, and the Ost Mark, which was a virtually valueless currency. Many of the problems which we are experiencing today stem from a decision taken very much at a distance from us. That decision has done enormous damage to the German financial position and in turn, is reflected in some of the events with which we have been trying to <Col N="136" /> cope in the past few weeks.  These might seem domestic matters to some but they are very important to individuals who are trying to meet mortgage repayments. Many of these events, which may seem somewhat distant, can have either an immediate or a long term impact on us. A great deal of talk is now emanating from Germany about the retention of the Deutsche Mark; most Germans are in favour of retaining it.  They are not in favour of the ECU replacing it.  Discussions are taking place with a view to introducing a currency which would include the German Deutsche Mark, the French franc, and Austrian and Swiss currencies and possibly the Benelux and Danish currencies in a central European currency.  If we are determined to stay within the EMS it is important to ensure that our currency &mdash; which, to a large extent, fulfils the necessary criteria &mdash; continues to maintain a relationship with the Deutsche Mark.  We should not allow ourselves, even by accident, to be relegated to the second division because if we are it is unlikely we will ever re-enter the first division.  Unfortunately, because of our geographical position and the fact that we are one of the poorer members of the European Community &mdash; for many years we were the poorest member &mdash; there is a tendency among many Germans in financial circles to disregard the Irish punt.  They still have a tendency to think of the United Kingdom and Ireland as the British Isles, as one.  I would much prefer to see the ERM continue.  I should like to see a monetary union of all 12 states but if a choice has to be made we must make sure that we have our foot in the door for any European central currency.</P>
    <P>It is a long way from that to countries like Somalia.  One of the most recent worthwhile visits and actions by an Irish Minister was the visit by the Minister, Deputy Andrews to Somalia to bring events there to world attention.  That has been greatly augmented by the visit of our President to Somalia which was very worthwhile.  Somalia does not have any oil reserves and is not of any strategic importance.  It is easy to forget about it, <Col N="137" /> to look for a moment at the horrible pictures on television and then turn away and get on with one's daily life.  As one or two speakers have already suggested, it is a dreadful condemnation of the European Community that, on the one hand, we pay farmers not to farm land and, at the same time, we see on television people starving to death.  All sorts of bureaucratic and industrial reasons and reasons in regard to trade and currency can be put forward but at the end of the day in one part of the world there is a food surplus while in another part people are starving to death.  It should not be beyond the will or capacity of the European Community to do something in that respect.</P>
    <P>I will turn for a moment to the Common Agricultural Policy which has recently been greatly reformed.  The Common Agricultural Policy was not introduced as a result of a charitable notion or because somebody thought it would be a good idea that Irish farmers should receive substantial payments from the European Community.  It was introduced for totally selfish reasons, to ensure that the major countries of western Europe would have sufficient agricultural produce to feed their populations.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that the European Community sprang from the post-war situation and the Coal and Steel Community; Germany and France worked together in that regard.  The same applied to the Common Agricultural Policy.  It did not come down from the clouds like a stork, it was introduced for political reasons.  At that time it was the accepted wisdom of bureaucrats, population experts, agronomists and all sorts of people that the world could not feed itself, the population was increasing and the way to deal with this problem within the EC was to ensure appropriate support for the farming community so that enough food could be produced to feed western Europe.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Brien is aware, if farmers are encouraged and a worthwhile market exists they can produce the necessary food.  In countries such as Ireland, <Col N="138" /> France and Germany the soil and climate are a tremendous asset and efficient farmers could grow huge surpluses of food if they were encouraged to do so.  We have done that and have found as a result that there are food surpluses, posing huge economic and financial difficulties. Instead of paying farmers not to produce food, instead of imposing milk quotas while children dying in Somalia because they cannot get milk, I would have thought with modern communications, transport facilities and organisation, our priority should be to find ways and means of transferring food surpluses from western Europe &mdash; to areas where people are starving to death.  I do not subscribe to the belief that if food is sent to those countries the people there would be discouraged from growing it themselves. That is another excuse for not doing something which should be done.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and President Robinson visited Somalia and at least made it a point of discussion.  Some of us were a little upset because it received very little media attention in our neighbouring island.  In my view, that illustrates the fact that many people in power &mdash; I mean power in the widest sense, media power as well as political power &mdash; are not really interested in whether people are starving in Somalia; they would prefer to avoid the problem.</P>
    <P>If Somalia like Kuwait had oil, no doubt an enormous effort would have been made to help; likewise if Bosnia had oil and was of crucial strategic importance, I wonder whether we would stand idly by while ethnic cleansing takes place. What a horrible new phrase?  Many of us remember the photographs of the refugees, the deported populations from various parts of Europe and the photographs of the concentration camps.  They have not got as far as mass gassing of the Bosnian people, but they have come close to it.  The number of dead already has run into six figures.  That is a lot of people to die, yet it is not one of our main priorities.  It would be nice to think that we might be more concerned when the problem involves human lives and <Col N="139" /> human suffering rather than simply the strategic control of the price of oil.</P>
    <P>As Europeans, we should be in favour of enlargement of the European Community but I am concerned at the sort of impetus which seems to be developing whereby that enlargement would be concentrated on countries such as Austria, Switzerland and, perhaps, Sweden and Finland.  The focus of the European Community appears to be moving towards enlargement.  One would not mind if that movement is simply to encompass Central and Eastern Europeans. However, we should not allow a two-tier Europe to develop made up of a central Europe in which the very wealthy countries of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Benelux and perhaps, France and Denmark join together and then a second tier of countries, such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Norway, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Ireland.  Something is beginning to happen in relation to the enlargement of the European Community which does not bode well for this country.  I am glad to note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, is putting some emphasis on the Visegrad countries and on the nature and manner in which the Community should be enlarged.</P>
    <P>The GATT negotiations are crucial to our farmers.  Tomorrow we will be looking at the economic situation and particularly the economic deflation which is occuring worldwide.  It is difficult to see an end to it, but it is crucial that some accommodation be reached between the European Community and the United States in regard to GATT.  This may not solve our problems; it probably will solve very few problems, but if there is no agreement, the economic deflation and recessionary cycle into which we are slipping will be aggravated I hope it will be possible to reach agreement, but we do not want to be used as a peripheral pawn in which Irish agriculture can be sacrificed at the altar of reaching an agreement which would satisfy the needs of the more industrialised areas of Europe.</P>
    <P>The reports on the developments in the <Col N="140" /> European Community are out of date. They deal with many areas, such as work of the Community and our relationship with the Community.  Those reports cover a number of headings including the Community budget &mdash; which is very important to this country &mdash; external relations and trade and development co-operation about which we have been talking. I would like to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Andrews and others who did great work in that regard.  The reports also cover customs policy, the free movement of persons and services, the Common Agricultural Policy industrial policy and a tourist policy.  There is a vast amount of work going on in the Community which affects us.  I should like to see European Community issues debated at least once in every session because what happens in the EC can have a great serious effect on us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on these reports.  I should like to deal with an issue raised by other Senators, namely, the responsibility of Ireland and the European Community to the people of Somalia.  At a meeting of the European Parliament Jacques Delors, President of the Commission, spoke about the various activities within the Community.  When referring to EC foreign policy he stated:</P>
      <P>Our commitment to our neighbours to the East and South should not, however, distract us from our responsibilities in Africa, South America and Asia.  This remains a central plank of our external policy.  There can be no question of us relaxing our efforts at a time when debt and the growing threat of instability call for a strong political presence and sustained, if not increased, economic and financial support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, the Community must be in a position to cope with emergencies anywhere in the world, aiding and alleviating human distress in the wake of conflicts, natural disasters and epidemics. Action must be swift &mdash; swifter than in the past &mdash; effective and tailored <Col N="141" /> to requirements.  The Community's responsibilities leave no room for political foot-dragging or bureaucratic red tape.  This is why the Commission has taken the initiative of setting up a European Humanitarian Aid Office.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, retrospectively, to read these comments of the President of the Commission.  This is fine flowing rhetoric, beautiful sentiments, but abysmally out of touch with recent events in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.  There is still scope for massive improvement in the Community's response to such problems. The President of the Commission said, and I repeat: &ldquo;The Community's responsibilities leave no room for political foot-dragging or bureaucratic red tape&rdquo;.  There has been nothing but political foot-dragging or bureaucratic red tape in regard to those countries.</P>
    <P>I, too, applaud the recent visit to Somalia of our President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Upton's comments about the formal status of these debates and the fact that the House discussed developments in the European Community only twice a year.  This is the 20th year of our membership of the European Community.  If one wanted a duller summary of the work of the European Community one would need to delve very deeply in the Library.  The 39th report is identical to the 20th one which, in turn, was identical to the 5th. There is no sparkle, they are as dull as dishwater.  Perhaps the fault lies with the masters in the Commission in Brussels, but something should be done about these dreadful reports to which we are supposed to address ourselves.  They are most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton spoke about the fact that we still do not have a foreign policy committee.  We have an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC.  Indeed, I was a member of the first committee when I was elected to the Dáil in 1973.  The committee is satisfactory in so far as its brief goes, which is a kind of retrospective reflective type of role to examine legislation which <Col N="142" /> has already been enacted within the Community.  However, it is not forward looking or multidimensional and positive initiatives cannot be taken by it.  Consequently, there is a crying need for a foreign policy committee or, alternatively, for a European Community committee that could examine the contemporaneous and future scene, independent or retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the political foot-dragging, it is regrettable that it is two years since we first talked about a foreign policy committee and the then Taoiseach gave a commitment, in principle, to the establishment of such a committee.  However, we still do not know what is happening in that regard.  We do not know when the committee will be formed or what form it will take.</P>
    <P>The Community is going through an extraordinarily difficult period at present, probably its most difficult since its foundation.  Many negative comments are being made about the community, its past, its present and its future.  In the welter of criticism, it is important to be a little reflective and to look at the vision of the founding fathers of the Community, people such as Jean Monnet.  He saw the fundamental <i>raison d'être</i> of the Community not in the area of economics, of agriculture, of getting money for farmers, not in the technical area, but as a fundamental means of achieving diplomacy and peace initially in France and Germany, then in Europe and the world. That was the objective of the European Coal and Steel Community and subsequently the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The first World War ended in 1918 and the world, particularly Europe, was in such disarray and disorder that a second major conflagration occurred only 21 years later in 1939.  That was a short interval between those horrific events in Europe.  In the most negative sense of all, if the EC has achieved nothing else, it is a great credit to it that practically half a century has passed since we have had a war of the dimensions of that which took place in 1945.  I do not think one <Col N="143" /> could pay bigger tribute to the Community.</P>
    <P>Recent events relating to Maastricht have been unfortunate.  Our heart is obviously in the right place having regard to the result of our referendum in that regard.  The Danish result was a little unfortunate and in my view threw Europe off the issue to an extent.  Denmark is a small country and they voted against Maastricht by a tiny majority.  A number of subjective issues were at stake in the referendum in Denmark which had no relevance whatever to Maastricht or to the European Community.  Yet, what was decided by the tiny majority who voted against Maastricht in Denmark has had profound effects.  There was a great fear in the southern part of Denmark &mdash; which shares a land border with Germany &mdash; of German dominance and aggression and, for no other reason than that fear of dominance, many Danes voted against Maastricht.  In a sense they voted against dominance by Germany in their own internal affairs.  Of course, that was irrelevant to Maastricht.  The only two countries in Europe who were required under their constitutions to hold a referendum in relation to Maastricht were Denmark and ourselves.  Our country's result was very stable.</P>
    <P>The French referendum was close to being a catastrophe and, in my own view, President Mitterrand's behaviour in calling, for a referendum in France made him more of a pygmy than a statesman. At the time the decision was made in France to hold a referendum in relation to Maastricht, which was not required under the French constitution, the pro-Maastricht forces were leading the day in public opinion by about 25 per cent.  With the polls running in that manner and public opinion massively behind Europe there was no necessity whatever, other than the simple ratification in the National Assembly in Paris to hold a referendum.  Again, to be subjective, the result of the French Referendum was not based on the needs of Europe but on personal aggrandisement.  Debates took place in which strange elements like Le <Col N="144" /> Pen and the Communists were in agreement. There was a very reasonable distrust of European bureaucracy by many people and while anti-German feeling was a huge factor in the Danish vote, the crucial issue in France was the unpopularity of the President.  Many people voted against Mitterrand rather than against Maastricht.  The French result was a success because there were huge negative reactions prior to that poll. People were negative about the French President and about European bureaucracy. They were also conscious of the Danish rejection of Maastricht.  Despite all that, on the day the vote was carried.</P>
    <P>That, of course, was followed by what we have seen in the United Kingdom.  It is regrettable they are having such problems at present in monetary and political areas in regard to Europe.  I do not glory in it for one minute because it is not healthy for this country.  It would be much healthier for us if there was unity in Britain and Ireland in relation to European Community events, an equilibrium between the two countries and parity in our currencies.  There is huge discomfort in Britain at present following the devaluation of its currency.  It is a great compliment to the Irish punt that we have been able to retain our relationship with the German Mark and other European currencies in such circumstances.  At the same time, it is hugely negative for this country to have to trade with an imbalance of about 10 per cent in comparison with the previous position with a neighbouring island which still takes about 40 per cent of our entire exports.  It is a very unhealthy situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the views held by Britain in respect of Europe, I can see why their judgment might be clouded because of historical events in this century to which I have referred.  However, if I were an Englishman, while I might not love Germany, while I might not like the extent of Germany's success in Europe today, or the strength of the Deutsche Mark or the strength of Germany worldwide, if I were thinking rationally about things my conclusion would be that it would be very much in <Col N="145" /> Britain's interest to be a good member of the European club and to continue to encourage the Germans to be the good Europeans they are.  I would be encouraging federalism in Germany rather than nationalism.  I would be encouraging the Germans to put their talents and aspirations in Europe because the logical conclusion of the Thatcherite approach to the European issue would be the disintegration of the European Community and the rising again of the nation state. If I were an Englishman I would have much greater fears about a rising German nation state than I would have with the very favourable behaviour of Germany in recent years, being the good Europeans they are within the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the Community that, despite all the negatives that are going around, the Austrians, the Finns and the Swedes &mdash; previously outside the Community and not wanting to have anything to do with it &mdash; are now lining up to come in, and even the Norwegians are making positive noises about the Community.</P>
    <P>Where our own country is concerned, I do not accept for one instant the argument that Irish sovereignty is diminished within the Community.  They talk about Irish culture, Irish language and Irish music and say we are losing our identity. There is no evidence that in the 20 years we have been in the Community there has been any diminution of Irish nationalism, Irish culture or Irish music.  Indeed, the integration is bringing us into dialogue with many other cultures in Brittany, Germany etc., which is probably more encouragement of our culture than had been the case.</P>
    <P>The linkage for our Ministers in Council of Ministers meetings, the opportunity for Members of our Parliament for the cross fertilisation of ideas with members of the communities of other countries in the vocational groups and Government Departments, is extremely healthy.  Irish sovereignty is strengthened rather than diminished by our being in the Community, because with an isolated Ireland outside the Community &mdash; three million <Col N="146" /> souls out in mid-Atlantic &mdash; sovereignty might be a reality but it would be a nominal joke.</P>
    <P>It is a heady experience for us within the European Community that, as a country of three million in a population of 360 million, we hold one place at the table among ten when the Prime Ministers meet.  The same applies to our Foreign Minister and Agriculture Minister. In that sense the level of participation within the Council of Ministers is out of all proportion to our population within the Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak briefly about the west of Ireland as it relates to the European Community.  The House will be aware that in recent months the bishops in the west have been extremely concerned about appalling problems &mdash; demographic problems, land problems, problems in farms and industry, and huge unemployment levels.  There are parts of Country Mayo where the unemployment level is 50 per cent, for example.  It is against that background that there has been a huge amount of public activity in the form of meetings organised by the bishops.  In turn, they have impressed the European Community sufficiently to have the EC fund a special study in relation to the west.</P>
    <P>Studies can be a bit of a joke.  We have reports since the State was founded about solving the problems in the west of Ireland.  You could consign most of them to a waste paper basket; you could rightly consign this one too.  It is like solving the problems in the North of Ireland.  If six people of goodwill went into a room and sat down for three or four hours, they would solve the problem.  There is a way to solve the problems in the west.  You could write a blueprint for a new harbour in Mayo and put a price tag of £30 million on it.  You could say you wanted a rail system with trains travelling from Dublin to Westport in less than three and three-quarter hours.  Twenty-five years ago I was on a train from Tokyo to Kyoto, the distance from Dublin to Westport and back and it took three hours and ten minutes to make that journey, yet today it takes seven and a half hours to make <Col N="147" /> the same journey.  If we want to bring the west of Ireland into the real world we must build up the infrastructure, but there is a price tag on that of a couple of hundred million pounds.  If you put the money into the kitty, as sure as day follows night you will put the show on the road in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The merit I see in the study being undertaken by the European Community about the west of Ireland is that it will point up that it is a marvellous part of the country.  It is a great place to live.  It would be a great place to work if there were jobs.  Jobs can be provided there, but at a price.  I would like to see the European Community study highlight something we know already: that the part of this island west of the Shannon &mdash; and for the Minister's benefit we will take Clare into that, and possibly Longford &mdash; is distinctly and uniquely different to any other part of Ireland.  That point has been missed completely by successive Governments in recent years.</P>
    <P>My single greatest disappointment with our membership of the European Community is not, strangely, with what has been happening in Europe &mdash; we have had ups and downs in our European policies &mdash; but that every Government since 1973 have taken up the European Regional Development Fund and insisted on dispensing that fund nationwide. There is as much of this money going to Dublin, Meath and Kildare <i>pro rata</i> as there is to the poorest parts of west Clare or west Donegal.  That is wrong.  We argue in Brussels that we are on the periphery, we argue with the béal bocht &mdash; the poor mouth &mdash; and we want to get money out of the European Community, yet, when Dublin gets the European Fund, the same generosity is not shown in the context of the periphery of its own country.</P>
    <P>If this study highlights nothing else, I hope it highlights the problems, the history, the present and a positive future, but the corollary of that will be funding on a massive scale.  I would like to see an Irish Government &mdash; and I do not care which Irish Government it is &mdash; designating <Col N="148" /> the west as a special region within the country and indicating to Brussels that it would welcome the designation of that region for special funding, and within Ireland that region would be accountable to a Cabinet Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate this afternoon could easily have been taken with the economy on the debate tomorrow.  That became clear from the speeches we have heard.  There are a few points I would like to make in support of my colleague, Senator Staunton.  There is deep concern about these reports, which are now out of date and of no benefit to us.  I would ask the Minister, Deputy Daly, who is not always given due credit, to take this concern on board.  He will be remembered forever if he brings us closer to Europe, even if it is only through reports.</P>
      <P>We have been in the EC for years.  I will only barely touch on this, but I want to put it on record.  I had hoped that, sharing a strong European sense with elected people in the Northern part of this country, we would see ourselves as one unit and one nation and forever do away with the horrible divide that continues to be between us.  Europe was the one chance I saw years ago, and I still have not given up hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have to start looking at change and hope.  The headlines in the media every day are pessimistic about everything that is happening here.  Some of us should talk more about hope, even if it means more change, and this can only be done in the whole European context. Everything is dictated to us by regulation or by direct legislation affecting us as Europeans.  I have to be careful now because of the new friendship of some of my colleagues in my own party and other parties, in case what I am going to say is taken the wrong way but it is a pity that England has gone down this anti-Europe road.  It would have been much better for this nation if Prime Minister John Major had stayed on course and followed the line he took when he was elected Prime Minister of England; he was a strong European and he was as committed to Europe as everybody else, but for party <Col N="149" /> reasons he seems to have lost his nerve and he seems to be pulling back from that strong stand of being a committed European.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say to me or to my colleagues here this afternoon that we are less Irish or less nationalist in our thinking because we are committed Europeans. I had to clarify these points in my own mind when we were dealing with the Maastricht issue: were we being swallowed up as a nation by Europe?  Would we have our own identity if we went down that road?  Having listened to some of the speeches made by our friends in different parties in England and coming back here and looking at our own situation, I have no trouble in deciding that we stay with Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like also to pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and to my former colleague, and now President of Ireland, President Mary Robinson, for the trip they made recently to Somalia and to refer also to the trip the Minister made on his own. While paying tribute to those two people this afternoon, it would be wrong of me not to put on record &mdash; and even if the Minister of State, Deputy Daly represented another constituency I would do so &mdash; that he probably has done more travelling to some of the afflicted countries in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs than anybody else.</P>
    <P>We all serve in local government, so this sector is very relevant.  I welcome the money from Europe going into roads like the Bunratty bypass and the extraordinary expensive sewerage and water schemes that have been put in place. However, I plead here today &mdash; and I would ask it to be taken from here &mdash; that money be given for country roads. There are roads other than the big highways and they are every bit as important for the promotion of industry and tourism and for the creation of jobs and prosperity. I would ask the Minister to ensure that money would be provided every year for those roads as well.  There is a need here for a strong regional policy and I ask the Minister, Deputy Daly, to bring <Col N="150" /> this suggestion to Government.  I will stand over this.  I will probably be rapped on the knuckles, but I think they are afraid to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton spoke about the West of Ireland.  We should speak not only about the West, but about the rest of Ireland.  This brings us back to what is involved if the status of Shannon Airport is changed.  I want to put this on record. I am sick of saying it, despite this glib comment by people elected, and not elected, that there she is again only watching the votes, only minding one or two constituencies.  I have spoken here at length on leaving in place structures outside Dublin that have been successful and that are needed to maintain employment. I will keep on saying it.  I do not give a damn who takes a poor view of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the legislation that is being put in place in a European context to support women's issues and to deal with discrimination against women in the workplace, on boards and so on.  This is not a road I go down too often, because I am a strong believer in staying with the lads; but the interesting thing is that past and present Governments &mdash; and probably the same will apply to Governments in the future &mdash; did not put some of the legislation in place until they had to do it, until they were directed by Europe to do so.  We should ensure the continued decentralisation of some EC institutions in Ireland and not have them all in one street.  There is the rest of Ireland to be looked after, but I suppose Europe has helped us to some extent in that direction also.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the social fund.  In the past there was excellent social funding for special schools and workshops for mentally handicapped people.  Some of that funding has either dried up or is not in place any more.  Because of my special interest in this area, I want to put on record that that should be corrected.  I welcome warmly the European decision to clear the Mullaghmore project in north Clare.  I could not understand certain politians, representing constituencies far from the Mullaghmore project, going public when it was eventually cleared and <Col N="151" /> saying that they were doing another check on it.  I suggest that those politicians, whether they be MEPs, TDs or Senators, stay on their own stamping ground and we will look after Mullaghmore and see that north Clare is in order.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at a former Cathaoirleach interrupting.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank all the elected people in Clare for supporting it.  Of course, all it will do is put jobs in place. I thought that is what the whole exercise was about.</P>
      <P>This brings me back to morrow's debate.  We could have taken the two discussions together.  I want to pay tribute to Commissioner MacSharry for the job he has done in Europe, but I would appeal to him in his last few months not to give way to the Americans.  I watched a programme last night with a little sense of worry that he might go down that road at this late stage, having held such a firm stance all through these negotiations.  I would like to wish him well.  When his contribution to Irish public life has been written about, we will see that he played a greater role in Irish public life than we even knew about.  He was a credit to this nation.  He did his job well.  This programme I watched dealt with the policy of set-aside in farming.  The effect of setting aside 15 per cent of land worried me deeply.  That contradicts a lot of what former Ministers and Governments thought Irish farming was all about. However, I will not go down that road.  I will just make that comment because I feel strongly about it, having read about it and watched this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards changes in the future, I welcome them.  Even though things do not seem to be great at the moment when we see the extraordinary unemployment figure, the only way to put jobs in place is to think and act positively and not to adopt this approach of &ldquo;We cannot do this or we cannot do that&rdquo;.  I remember <Col N="152" /> years ago asking my late husband to do something.  He was then a serving Member and I was not.  He said: &ldquo;Tras, that cannot be done.&rdquo; I remember turning to him and saying: &ldquo;Derry, in my language there is no such word as &lsquo;cannot&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have a lot to do.  There is great hope and great interest in the young people coming after us.  We should talk more positively about this great nation of ours.  This is where I agree with Senator McGowan this evening.  I would appeal to RTE and the media to be more positive about what Ireland has to offer our people and not to be always looking at what is wrong here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I think it is important to put on the record of the House that the business before the House this afternoon is to discuss activities in the European Community from the period starting on 1 January 1988.  That is unfortunate, because during a period when there has been so much change in Europe, so much discussion in Europe and so many political proposals, this House did not have an opportunity of having an input and passing on a message to our own Ministers who, I am confident, do an excellent job out there.  It is not in accordance with the original 1972 Act, which said that the Houses would have an opportunity of discussing the six monthly activities of the Community.  I hope the Minister of State will not allow the same thing to happen again.  Surely the Members of this House have an input that possibly could be helpful to the various Departments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has asked over the past five years for this debate. It is a nonsense that the democratic voice of this country is excluded from having any input into the momentous changes that have taken place in Europe.  We must be very conscious of the fact that those changes adversely affect the lives of every person in this country.  It is not good enough for a Minister to stand up, as one did last weekend, and say that farming incomes have gone up this year by 10 per cent when every bank you go into has a queue of farmers waiting to be interviewed.  I doubt if the bank manager is inquiring about where they are going to invest their additional 10 per cent.  We have a responsibility to have an input into the policies of our Government Ministers in Europe.  If we are in a democracy, surely there has to be some way of dealing with that.  I repeat it is a nonsense that we cannot have, as the 1972 Act states, six monthly debates on the activities of the Community.</P>
      <P>That being said, I would like to put a few questions to the Minister.  We have had the debates on the Maastricht Treaty, we have had the referendum and the people have voted in favour of the concept of economic and monetary union.  I have had the opportunity of travelling fairly extensively in East Germany and Poland during the autumn.  The £6 billion the people voted for in the Maastricht Treaty referendum is something that may very well come, but I would like to know where is it going to come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I was in Berlin was in 1987 and the changes that had taken place there since 1990 are very evident.  Consider the cost to the Federal Republic this year of building up the infrastructures in what was East Germany.  The Federal Government had to spend on new policies for renewal, for unification, for the infrastructural development of East Germany, for new policies on social welfare, for changes in education and even on compensation for the properties that were confiscated by the Communists since 1945.  The cost of that to the German taxpayer exceeds the entire budget of the European Community.  In <Col N="154" /> addition to that, the Federal Republic seems to be by far the most significant contributor to the EC budget.</P>
    <P>The German nation has a huge task before it which no other European country would be capable of taking on.  It is evident to me that the German people cannot continue to pay more and, therefore, there has to be a levelling off of funds from the EC unless other countries like Denmark, Britain and France are prepared to contribute a greater share towards EC funding to realise the aims and promises of the Maastricht Treaty. Our expectations must take a more realistic turn.</P>
    <P>The German nation is catering for over 50,000 asylum seekers each month.  We accepted less than 200 people from eastern Europe this year and there was much trouble before we acquired facilities for these people for which I compliment the Government.  I was told by a German Minister recently that in September 54,000 asylum seekers there sought housing, social welfare, education facilities, health services, etc.  That is an extraordinary budgetary aspect with which the rest of the European Community is not burdened.</P>
    <P>The EC as a whole must be prepared to look seriously at the problem of refugees and at the entire problem of eastern Europe.  In this country at present the focus of public attention is on Somalia.  I tried every second week without exception from the time we came back in February to ask for a debate on the famine situation in Africa, including Somalia. We did not get it but I am glad the voluntary agencies, the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are involved in the matter and have made a very significant contribution.  I compliment President Robinson, for taking upon herself the onerous trip to Somalia to focus attention on the plight of the starving people.</P>
    <P>I submit that we should also look at the 2,500,000 homeless people in the former Czechoslovakia where the weather is harsher than in Africa, where they have a different type of civilisation but find themselves in a serious plight.  On the <Col N="155" /> back page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> today there is a picture of a man who froze to death on a street in Moscow, illustrating the grave hardships millions of people in eastern Europe will suffer this year because of the failure of Government policies in that region over the past few decades.  Since the collapse of the communist system the person on the bottom ring of the ladder has been put in an impossible position.  In the short term our charity must be more widely dispersed.</P>
    <P>Last year I said in a speech here that the focus on Africa should be combined with attention to the needy in Europe. Aid in the short term should go towards people who have neither food, shelter nor clothing for the coming harsh winter in Europe.  I am conscious of the difficulty of getting Governments or the EC to move quickly and I am also conscious of the fairly generous aid contributions that the EC has given to practically all affected regions in Europe.  Perhaps the Minister might remind the House and the public of the huge amounts of money going in that direction.</P>
    <P>Sadly, it has not been possible to stop the fighting in those countries or to get people to negotiate together.  People who have second thoughts about Maastricht and European Union or the European ideal in general should be subsidised to enable them to visit any east European country to see the effect of 45 or 47 years of political stagnation and communist rule on the infrastructure and on people's lives.  In town after town as one drives through east Germany one sees houses bombed in the early 1940s which have neither been demolished nor renovated.</P>
    <P>Much may be said in favour of the communist system but under the public housing programme, a housing block for over 50,000 residents was built, a potential nightmare for a guy canvassing for an election.  The quality of life in a housing block with 50,000 people &mdash; there are 51,000 or 52,000 people in my county &mdash; is questionable and to have them all in one block a couple of hundred yards long sounds like a nightmare.  The apartments measured 400 sq ft. with two and three <Col N="156" /> families in each apartment.  People in that situation need to be helped.  This will necessitate sacrifices on our part and will slow down the evolution of Europe considerably.</P>
    <P>Over the past month we have had hassle from moneychangers, who also gave trouble in Our Lord's time when he was obliged to eject them from the Temple.  They have been at it again because they do not want to see monetary union going through.  There would be more for them to get their snouts into if they could pull that one off.  The kind of difficulties these money hasslers have introduced and the uncertainty, fear and hardship that has befallen people who have lost their jobs or have been put on short time has not been adequately or accurately calculated.  The Governments of the member states of the EC should take the strongest possible steps to prevent a recurrence of that situation.  It is not going to be an easy problem to tackle.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government handled the debate on the Maastricht agreement incompetently.  It was badly sold, and were it not for the way the Taoiseach gilded the lily by promising £6 billion in aid and development, it would not have gone through.  Nevertheless, having regard to evident hardship whether in Africa or in eastern Europe, Irish people should be encouraged to appreciate their luck and to build up the infrastructures here as best we can.</P>
    <P>I notice in the rebuilding of East Germany that the Government there are spending ten times more on rail infrastructures then on the road network, a statistic that surprised me.  The reason is that they say they can move people more economically by rail, with less delay and congestion.  I know that CIE or Irish Rail are anxious to ensure an investment of £30 of £40 million in the upgrading and the improvement of the rail services between Dublin and the West, especially.</P>
    <P>I am told that the cost of the bypass to Portlaoise is estimated at £37 million for seven or eight miles of bypass.  I am told by CIE that £30 million would bring the rail link between Dublin and Sligo up <Col N="157" /> to European standard.  That would be money well spent.  The rail infrastructures from Dublin across to the West of Ireland should be improved, with new links added on perhaps.  I hope that the Government will look in an expansive mood on my friends, Shannon Airport Development.  I cannot understand why a semi-State organisation wishing to save money can think of no other way but by slashing hundreds and thousands of jobs, an extraordinary way of making savings.</P>
    <P>I hope with our new economic outlook that we will look positively at the entire country.  Since the new Leader programme and EC support are helping to promote farm holidays and tourism, we should aim to provide the best possible transport infrastructure, not only to the West of Ireland but to the midlands and other underdeveloped areas as well.  If we are going to spend multiples of £30 million bypassing successive provincial towns, It would be a good idea to install a few fast rail links across the country at the expense of one or two of those towns. Naas was the first town to be bypassed and the towns were much opposed to it initially.  Eventually it went through, but in the last few years the same bottleneck has returned, but within the next 12 months the bypass of the Waterford/ Kilkenny road will come into operation affording them some peace again.  There has been a huge increase in road traffic and were it not for the input from the European Development Fund all of our road network would be the same as the roads in Cavan.</P>
    <P>People who say we get no benefits from the EC cannot be looking at the quality of our roads when they are driving around the country.  An amount of money has been wisely spent on upgrading the infrastructures giving numerous relief from heavy traffic so that people there do their shopping and business without battling through passing traffic.</P>
    <P>Every Government have significant problems in trying to establish an order of priorities.  This week the Birmingham summit takes off, one which we should watch with considerable interest here.  It <Col N="158" /> is difficult to know whether the current Presidency of the Community, the United Kingdom, will make strenuous proposals to bring the Community and Europe out of the current monetary depression.  Unless somebody makes a proposal it is going to be difficult to do that.</P>
    <P>On top of that we have the problem with the Uruguay Round in the GATT negotiations.  The Sky television debates of the presidential election in America last night would not inspire anyone with confidence.  No matter what we say about Europe, even if one were listening to two or three different languages, there would certainly be a better performance from any single country of the Twelve than what went out on public television from America last night or early this morning.</P>

      <P>That first performance left much to be desired.  We should look positively at the system evolving here in Europe.  Our contribution as a small insignificant nation is one of being honest broker.  Our input has always been good. Our Ministers have taken the European role seriously, which we can be proud of. When one sees people performing as the Americans do it should give us hope that we will do well when we are pitted against them in negotiations.</P>
      <P>I hope that our Ministers will work extremely hard to ensure that the conclusion of the GATT negotiations will not mean yet more reductions in Irish farm incomes.  It is important that as an economy we accept the democratic views of Europe and maximise on policy changes. We must produce whatever is required and ensure that we get our share of the market.  We are fit to do that.</P>

    <P>I am opposed to the concept of a two-speed Europe.  That concept has not emerged over the past couple of months but has been there for the past 20 years.  It was even proposed by Mansholt himself back in 1972 or 1973 and we need to be eternally vigilant to make sure that does not happen again.  If it did we might find <Col N="159" /> ourselves side-tracked and perhaps forgotten about.  I ask the Minister when replying to this debate to reassure the House that the Government will oppose the concept of a two-tier Europe vigorously and defend the <i>status quo.</i>  The Maastricht Treaty seems inimical to the growth of a two-tier Europe but powerful factions within the Community have consistently tried to bring about a two-tier situation.</P>
    <P>This year has been dedicated to health and safety at work and under the aegis of the EC, many programmes have been launched to enhance living and working conditions throughout the European Community.  Next year I understand that the theme of improved housing for the aged and disabled will be adopted.  In preparation for that our Department of the Environment might highlight the figures of our most recent census which indicated that the number of retired people in this country at the end of the present decade will have increased by almost 80 per cent over the last 20 years of the century, a frightening figure considering that Government agencies are not providing services, geriatric beds or adequate special housing facilities.</P>
    <P>As the concept of the extended family is fast dying in this country there is going to be a problem with caring and housing aged and retired people in the next six or eight years.  We should be providing for that eventuality and next year the Department and the Government have a glorious opportunity to make plans, and to highlight the dangers inherent in the situation.</P>
    <P>I noticed recently a proposal from the Commission to introduce yet another transport tax.  I would like the Minister to explain this to the House because hauliers are already at a disadvantage with two seas to traverse to move our produce to the heart of Europe.  Transport costs and road tax are more expensive here than in Europe and now we are going to be hit with a further tax that would place our exporters at a considerable disadvantage. I would like to hear from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and <Col N="160" /> Communications if our industry and hauliers are going to be exempt from this tax.  It is often forgotten that transport represents 17 per cent or 18 per cent of our GNP and is an important industry although a fragmented one.  Protection for transport is necessary to enable us to compete with other European countries.</P>
    <P>Regarding cohesion and development policy and new policies associated with the Leader programme we have not had sufficient explanation and an opportunity in the Oireachtas of debating the opportunities we are told exist to avail of significant grants in the private and public sectors.  Announcements have been made with the new development programmes under Minister Hyland and Minister Noel Treacy and yet it is difficult to get an explanation or the parameters of these new programmes.  I wonder if the Minister during this debate would explain to the House, and to the country what exactly is involved, what can we expect and in what way we can utilise the new procedures to assist the development of rural areas.  I heard the Minister announce that agricultural incomes have increased by 10 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding European proposals and new initiatives, we would need to cut in on the benefits the first day they are announced and not wait for several years until the funding has evaporated or has been spent in Spain, Italy, Portugal or somewhere else.  When new systems come on stream our public service is slow to get members of the public involved and I would like to know if that was dealt with at length at the agricultural conference of the Fianna Fáil Party held in the Killeshan Hotel in Portlaoise last weekend.  Information should be available to everyone so that all can avail of the opportunities that present themselves. <Col N="161" /> The Minister could touch on that in his reply to this debate next week.</P>
    <P>On 1 January next changes in customs policy come into force and there has been much unease among people working in that area who are facing job losses.  It would be useful if the Minister would indicate whether the Government propose to redeploy these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann requests the Government to consider the setting up of a Press Council.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the possibility of setting up a Press Council in Ireland to deal with matters which from time to time come to the notice of the public and to have complaints adjudicated on by a special committee.  I call for the setting up of a Press Complaints Commission to adjudicate on the standards and ethics of the Irish media and to allow persons who feel aggrieved by press coverage to have their views aired through an impartial and independent forum.  I call for such a move, which would not only help to maintain high standards within the Irish media but would act as a protection for journalists and editors who are conscious of their obligation to inform the public on matters of major interest without compromising the ethics of these professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Journalists and editors are under increasing pressure from their superiors and their employers to repeatedly produce exclusive stories and new angles to major issues of the day, often at any cost.  As ethics and standards go out the window in the race to increase sales for the various papers for which they are writing, the inevitable victims, the casualties of this media chase, very often find that they have no machinery for correcting <Col N="162" /> errors or redressing the balance other than to go to court.  We all know that for the average person in the street, going to court is an extremely costly way of having these inaccuracies corrected. Quite often, banner headlines appear in relation to a report, which is taken by the general public as a statement of fact.  But we all know from experience that when we ask for a correction it very often appears somewhere in the newspaper as a apology weeks later when the event is no longer a worthy news item.</P>
    <P>It has often been painfully clear to those who work in the media that the present laws in Ireland concerning defamation and other issues relevant to the print and broadcast media are in serious and urgent need of change.  In opening this discussion, I compliment the editors and the journalism profession in general in Ireland since the foundation of the state for their magnificent and fair covering of events of every nature, whether political, sporting or any other kind. They have been a leading Press in the world, to say the least of it.  I want to be the first on my feet this evening to congratulate those people on the high standards they have maintained in Ireland over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Possibly the first newspaper I read was the <i>Westmeath Examiner.</i>  The provincial press in particular have been extremely fair and accurate in their reportage over the years of all events and have been very conscious of family values and the balance which is needed in reporting both sides of any event or problem.</P>
    <P>We see what is happening in the print media in the UK, in America and what is now fashionable right across Europe. We see the low standard of television programmes &mdash; people can receive 22 stations in most parts of Ireland and six stations in the other parts of Ireland &mdash; whether it is brutal violence or sex.  We see violence and sex in the controversial books which are coming out for Christmas.  It is because of all these things that we bring this discussion to the House this evening and ask Members to express their views on these matters.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of national television <Col N="163" /> in 1961 there has been an increase in violence, because people get ideas from the violent scenes on television. Television can be used in a most magnificent way.  It has uplifted our people in many ways.  There are, for instance, various educational programmes.  So there is a plus side to it as well.  There are always two sides to every case and to every problem.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the Broadcasting Complaints Committee in RTE is controlled and appointed by the Government. It deals with all matters relating to broadcasting in RTE.  I would ask the Minister when it is proposed to include local radio under this committee.  If someone thinks they have a grievance they can take their complaint almost immediately to the Broadcasting Complaints Committee at RTE and have it acted on very speedily indeed.  It may be that the print media would set up their own Press Council to monitor the inaccuracies that can and have occurred such as overstating facts totally out of all proportion to the actual situation.</P>
    <P>Recently a High Court case ended very abruptly after three days when the case could not be sustained.  But a few months previously one of the parties, who did not even know a complaint was being made against them, read about it in an Irish Sunday paper while in London.  If the journalist concerned had checked out the facts on both sides he would have found out very quickly that there was not a shred of factual information in his article.</P>
    <P>I could cite countless examples of inaccuracies in the media today.  Our journalits and editors maintain the highest standards.  It is from that point of view and in an effort to be helpful that we propose to have this discussion on the print media.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  As Senator Cassidy said, this is a motion to view the possibilities of setting up a Press Council.  I was at a conference recently <Col N="164" /> in Northern Ireland at which the media came in for a lot of flak.  Those of us in public life do not mind the media taking us to task.  They have every right to scrutinise us and judge as on our performance. Where someone in business, politics or in the clergy, but particularly in politics and business, in some way violates the law, in following up the person involved, which they are entitled to do, the media should have some consideration for the person's wife and family.  It is wrong for photographers, for example, to photograph someone pulling a blind and closing it again.  This is an invasion of the privacy of innocent people just because their father, brother or someone belonging to them does something wrong.</P>
      <P>If we do not set up a Press Council perhaps we could consider the appointment of an ombudsman.  We welcomed the appointment of an ombudsman in relation to insurance companies.  I remember a case in the Donegal area where a very hard-working public official was abused by the media.  He has to take early retirement and he lost a lot.  A colleague of his was abused in the same way by the media but he took them to the High Court and he got something like £100,000 in compensation.  A poor person who does not have the money to challenge the media cannot do anything. Admittedly the media, by and large, do a good job but there are times when they do wrong.  It is only the wealthy who can afford to take them to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often we see cases where somebody is accused of something and before the court case comes up, there is an article in the newspaper not mentioning names but giving enough information so that everyone in the locality knows exactly who they are talking about, yet when the court case comes up these people are often completely exonerated. In such cases, there should be a complaints procedure.  I know the media have a PR officer and they advertise it in all the newspapers.  I looked at the correction's in yesterday evening's newspaper.  The person's name and telephone number, etc. is given first and under that they have <Col N="165" /> the correction which means that unless one reads it all one would not see the correction.  Very often the original story is blown up on the front page but one has to look for an apology or correction.</P>
    <P>The media sets itself up as the watchdog and that is right.  We do not quibble with that but who watches the watchdog? Are they to be lords and masters with no one to check them other than when people take legal action against them? Many cannot afford to do that.  I believe from speaking to a number of those in the media that they would welcome the setting up of a Press Council.  There is a watchdog in every other profession &mdash; solicitors, accountants, auctioneers, etc. Daniel O'Connell said &ldquo;The pen is mightier than the sword&rdquo;.  When something is written in a newspaper, even though it is corrected afterwards, the original article is what is read and remembered.</P>
    <P>The media are an important part of society.  Thank God, they have not dropped their standards to the level of those in England but in this materialistic age when there is so much pressure on journalists to print questionable material in order to keep sales up, and with so many papers going to the wall, standards could drop to those levels.</P>
    <P>Another area where I felt very hurt was in relation to a bad accident in Sligo Hospital.  There was a shooting tragedy there and photographers were up on the hill at the back of the hospital with telescopic lens.  The curtains had to remain pulled because they were trying to photograph people in their hospital beds. Where does all this end?  Is it fair or just either to the medical profession or the nurses who were attending the patient to photograph them in this way?  I also think that photographing people, very often relatives, grieving in a graveyard is wrong.  They should have some protection and the media should not highlight people in their private lives who may find themselves entangled in a situation not of their making.  It is for those reasons that I believe we should have a mechanism along the lines of an ombudsman or a Press Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> People in all walks of life are worried about litigation because they do not know where or when they will have to appear before the courts.  There should be some means of settling problems besides having to go to court.  Admittedly there may only be an occasional case but that person who is victimised and injured should have some form of redress other than going to court.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the media do quite a good job, we can all instance cases where we know injustices were done and where items appeared in newspapers that were not entirely correct.  They were corrected afterwards and apologies were made in the newspaper but there should be a more positive way of correcting such errors.  It is with that in mind that I believe should set up a Press Council or ombudsman.  It is wealthy people who take the media to court.  I have given an example of one very honourable official who was wrongfully pushed out of this job by the media but he just did not have the money to take them to court.  His colleague had the means and received about £100,000.  In cases like that we should have some redress.  I do not think the media should be annoyed about it.  It could act as a safeguard for the media and complaints could be dealt with quietly and everyone would feel they were getting justice and fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Fianna Fáil Senators for putting down this motion.  It is worthwhile that we have a discussion this evening on an issue like this.  In a funny way, it is strange that, given the interaction between the Press and politics, we do not discuss the relationship more often and more openly; maybe then some of the misunderstandings might disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must declare an interest: the first gainful employment, apart from delivering messages, from which I ever made money was as a reporter for the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> at the age of 13 when the local Bagenalstown correspondent went away for his two weeks holiday and I was in charge of Bagenalstown notes at ten shillings a week.  The reporter was not a man <Col N="167" /> of great energy.  He told me my main work would be weddings and funerals.  I did not have to go to either he said, I would gather information around the place but, he said, for a funeral, the formula that never failed was when describing the funeral to say that the extent of the cortége which accompanied the remains of the deceased from St. Andrew's Church to the local graveyard was ample evidence of the esteem with which the deceased was held by all classes and creeds in the locality.  He said with that you could not go wrong and I did not during my short tenure.</P>
    <P>Newspapers are part of our lives. Senators want to establish a Press Council; there are very serious problems which affect both newspapers and politicians.  I hope this is the beginning of a discussion about these problems because we have talked at each other and about each other rather than to each other.  I am not sure that a Press Council is necessarily the answer.  I would like to see what it would do spelled out in greater detail.  What powers would it have?  There are questions of intrusiveness and invasion of privacy which both Senators have highlighted; these are causes of concern not just to the public and politicians but to a great number of people in the media itself.</P>
    <P>There is something obscene about people in a moment of tragedy being doorstepped and asked for a reaction, being crowded at funerals, etc., by a section of the media.  Maybe that happens because it is part of the terrible competitiveness within the media but that is something the media and the public would like to have considered.</P>
    <P>Recently the National Newspapers of Ireland made a submission to the Minister for Communications on the problems within the newspaper industry.  I have no doubt that there are serious problems of survival within the newspaper industry at present.  A number of newspapers may not survive, may not be here in two or three years time, unless serious changes in policy are made.  I found this document, a copy of which I think all <Col N="168" /> Members received, very reasonable.  I would have very little difficulty with their comments on VAT on the price of newspapers and tax on newspapers.  I feel that the freedom of the Press and libel need to be tackled urgently as well as the question of unfair competition with RTÉ. These are areas where newspapers have a legitimate case to make.  Most Members would like to see the newspaper media getting a fair crack of the whip on these issues.</P>
    <P>A number of points come to my mind. Senators have spoken about the absence of proper redress for honest mistakes, careless reporting or even a little more. Going to court is like arming a traffic warden with nuclear weapons or a submachine gun &mdash; there is no connection between what one is trying to achieve and the steps one must take to achieve it.  People in public life often feel aggrieved.  I had reason recently to feel aggrieved, as had others, where the law was broken in the pursuit of a story and I am certain my constitutional rights to privacy were invaded.  When one wants redress one can go to court.  This takes a long time and one is seen to be chasing after money when all one wants is a forum where the facts can be established and there is redress if one is right, or it is established if one is wrong.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Farrell's idea of a press ombudsman is worth pursuing but the ombudsman would need to be independent, established by statute and must have some way of ensuring that his or her findings will be implemented.  This has not been thought through.  In other countries, newspapers have their own internal ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I would not deny that in recent years newspapers have made great efforts to ensure that if they make a genuine mistake it can be rectified fairly quickly.  I know from research that the newspapers have carried out that policy and the corrections and clarifications columns are read as much as any other part of the newspaper.  Most newspapers will want to remedy a mistake they have made.  I say &ldquo;most&rdquo; because most newspapers are responsible.  Unfortunately it is the newspapers <Col N="169" /> which engage in personal or political vendettas, which have their own hidden agenda, or which are not upfront, which bring the entire industry into disrepute and make it very difficult to find a mechanism which would apply to all in a fair way.</P>
    <P>Our libel laws are a mess.  We have on our desks the report of the Law Reform Commission.  This Government should try to implement, or at least have debated, the main findings of the Law Reform Commission on the laws of libel. We have all seen disproportionate and crazy amounts awarded in relatively inconsequential cases.  If there were a mechanism which would protect the Press as much as the public, where genuine, legitimate complaints could be disposed of in a way which would be satisfactory to both sides, with binding force, without costs, without people being accused of rushing after money, many of the present problems would disappear and the cloud which hangs over newspapers of possible libel action being taken would disappear.</P>
    <P>However, there are questions that newspapers must ask themselves.  When they produce a very good document &mdash; and they have done &mdash; why is there is so little support for them among politicians? There is no great head of steam I can detect among colleagues out of sympathy for the newspapers to implement the main part of this policy.  It is partly because the newspapers, ironically, whose job is communication are damn bad at getting their own point of view across.  They are not used to working with each other.  The name of their game is competition.  They have not succeeded in getting across a coherent set of objectives they would like to achieve and want done through law.  They are very bad at lobbying politicians and at educating the public on this issue.  However, that is their problem and we cannot resolve it for them.  Just throwing a document at us once every two or three years and then expecting us to rush in and support it is simply not enough.  They should be initiating a debate with politicians on the real issues.  Why they have not done it is <Col N="170" /> a question they must ask themselves and it is a problem they must face.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem is a point mentioned by the two Senators who have spoken.  We and the public would like the media to be more open about their own operations.  By and large newspapers do not explain the basis upon which policy is determined or the sort of values underlying policy.  The public are not always aware if a newspaper has a hidden agenda.  We do not know if they are upfront with their views.  Frequently, in all our minds, there can be suspicions about certain newspapers.  Senator Dardis and I would have a particular view on the bona fides and agenda of one Sunday newspaper &mdash; I will not name it. If newspapers could be more open about what they are at, at least the public and politicians would be able to judge them on the standards they expect from us. That is the important point to make. There is also the question of how they handle mistakes.  All of that needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The natural relationship between a politician and a journalist or the media should be one of tension; it should not be a cosy relationship.  Any politician who believes that the media, or a journalist, will do him a favour is a fool.  It is right that it should be so.  We both look at the same questions and the same problems, but we look at them from different perspectives. Long may that be the case, so long as we know that those who are asking us to be open, to declare our interests.  To be scrupulously fair in dealing with people's reputations and with issues, apply the same standard to themselves and that these same standards are seen to apply.  I believe we can ask for no more than that.  The objective of a debate on that basis will not be to fetter the Press.</P>
    <P>All of us thrive and live by the Press. We enjoy the Press.  A strong healthy competitive Press is the most essential part of any democratic process.  We all have a vested interest in seeing such a Press, in seeing that there is a fair play of ideas.  You and I and the person out on the soapbox on the street corner can <Col N="171" /> say what we think and there is a fair chance of our views being reported as they are expressed, not in some distorted way.  I would like to see the debate starting on that.</P>
    <P>Maybe I should mention the sort of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Senator had better sit down before he says what he has to say, for his own sake.</P>
      <P>I was struck recently by the lack of self-awareness and self-consciousness that one sometimes finds among media people.  There was a controversy in <i>The Irish Times</i> where one journalist attacked the National Union of Journalists for this, he was &mdash; maybe rightly, maybe wrongly; it is none of my business &mdash; roundly attacked by three other journalists in the same paper.  But in the same letter they said it was the job of the journalist to lambaste institutions, to hold them up to search and scrutiny three paragraphs down, they attacked their own colleague. They said you do not bite the hand that feeds you.  Surely there are double standards there.</P>
      <P>I would like journalists to face up to these things, because in some ways I am sick and tired of being lectured to by journalists.  I would like the playing field to be even.  I have outlined the sort of principles that should operate.  I would love to see a real debate beginning on this.  It is up to the media, because they are the people who want the changes, to initiate this debate.  I hope that tonight is a start.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should declare a vested interest in this debate. For more than 20 years I have been a practising journalist, albeit not in the forefront of controversy.

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the rape-seed, perish the thought.</P>
      <P>I would say, in defence of the Press, that I believe it is an essential element of a free society.  It is impossible for society to operate freely and openly within a democracy without the monitoring of a free Press.  We all know of very painful examples in history where the priority of regimes, in the promotion and establishment of their own narrow view of life, was to remove the element of balance which the Press contributes to society. We all know of cases in Nazi times, of how they abused the media and how the free Press was forced underground and eliminated.  More recent examples come to mind in South Africa, where there was a degree of regulation of the Press.  In that sense I am not in favour of regulating the activities of the Press in the way in which they impinge upon the workings of Government, of the Oireachtas and of this Legislature.</P>
      <P>As a group, we depend very heavily on the Press.  Without the Press we are nothing.  It could be very difficult for us to operate in such a vacuum.  The people who sit in these benches from day to day do a very good job.  They always represent our views fairly.  We might not always agree with the elements which they choose to report but I do not think we could complain about the general balance of what is reported.  If at times they can be critical or even mocking of the way we conduct ourselves, I would submit that that is our fault rather than theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would share the views expressed by Senator Farrell in relation to intrusions into purely private matters.  There has been a very sad decline in standards in recent years in that respect.  Perhaps it has been motivated by the commercial realities of trying to compete with the lurid British tabloid press.  It could be submitted that it is really the market place which decides and that these people are <Col N="173" /> doing more than catering for a particular section of the marketplace; but there have been totally unacceptable invasions of privacy, into matters which are entirely domestic concerns to the people involved and which are not of public interest.  It was always part of the ethics of the business that one would not intrude into grief and private matters.  One of the most objectionable aspects of this, as Senator Farrell has already mentioned, is close up photographs of mourners at funerals. I can recall a period when such pictures would not have been published in the national press.  It is not acceptable, even in the case of public figures, that mourners at funerals should be subjected to that sort of invasion of privacy, even if a telephoto lens has been used and the journalist was not actually poking a camera in the people's faces.  It is still not acceptable to publish such pictures.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with a good press and how it should behave itself.</P>
    <P>The question of balance arises in the press.  I have a friend who remarked to me that he thought one particular national newspaper was a very well balanced newspaper, much more so than any of the other newspapers.  The fact of the matter was that it more accurately reflected his views than any of the other papers did.  That is what he meant by balance.  In general terms the national media and our local Press get the balance right most of the time.  They must continue to have the right to investigate matters which are of public interest and which impinge on how we conduct ourselves as a democracy.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning has made reference to the reports of the Law Reform Commission and I have also looked at those relating to the crime of libel and the civil law of defamation.  I would agree that there are recommendations in those reports which merit fairly serious consideration and which should be examined in more detail.</P>
    <P>We depend on the media in this House; it is an essential part of a free democracy. On the margins of what is acceptable, we must ask if the type of conduct we have seen in the British tabloid press over <Col N="174" /> recent months is acceptable, even in the case of public figures?  My belief is that it is not.  I do not think it is correct for people to crawl through the undergrowth for hours with telephoto lenses which can show a pimple on somebody's face from 200 yards and to use such technology to gain a scope.  That technology is quite recent in its origin and it is now being abused just to get a story.  It has been suggested that there are lawyers who actually trawl the newspapers every day to try to find something that is, in their view, actionable.  I do not know to what degree that practice exists but it is the other side of the coin and in my view is not acceptable conduct.</P>
    <P>We have a responsible Press and in general they conduct themselves well. There are ethics in the business.  I can recall colleagues who were excellent examples of always behaving in an ethical fashion.  I can think of the late Michael Dillon as one, in particular, who was an example of how a journalist should always conduct himself, in a balanced, caring and open manner.</P>
    <P>We have had plenty of examples of a sanctimonious Press lecturing public representatives as to how they should behave themselves, but they are not so open when it comes to retaliation, when some of their own sanctimoniousness is thrown back in their face.</P>
    <P>A free and unfettered Press is central to our democracy and anything other than a free Press would make one concerned about the future of democracy. There is some need for regulation of the Press.  Whether or not that should be statutory, I do not know.  I would prefer to see a self-regulatory body established by the Press, which would investigate complaints in a transparent and open way.  I am not convinced that the Press Council should be statutory.  But should such a body be established on a voluntary and internal basis and should it fail to carry out its job as it should, in the view of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I would have no objection to a statutory role for the Oireachtas and statutory regulation of the Press.  That is a very dangerous area to get into, however.  It is a very <Col N="175" /> short step from there to actual censorship of the Press.  Censorship has been used, as we all know, by regimes for their own ends.  Censorship of the Press, in my view, is not acceptable, however undesirable some of the activities of the Press may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise, straight away, for the absence of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications from the debate here tonight as she is indisposed.  Let me say at the outset, that the Minister has no statutory responsibility whatsoever in relation to the Press and my speaking on this motion should not be seen as an expression of intent or aspiration to have such responsibility vested in the Minister. However, the debate is a timely discussion of the issues involved and I think should also take account of what is happening in the electronic media as well.</P>
      <P>As a starting point, it is worth attempting to put the place of the Irish print media, and particularly newspapers in Irish society into some sort of focus.  First, newspaper publication in this State has traditionally been a private enterprise activity, free from direct or indirect Government interference other than compliance with the law of the land.  The Irish are avid readers.  Over 90 per cent of the population read daily and Sunday newspapers.  The ratio of daily titles per head of population is far higher than in the UK.  Indeed, by UK standards, instead of having five national morning titles we probably should have no more than one.  The plurality of newspaper titles in Ireland is very healthy to democracy, and long may this continue to be the case.  Irish newspapers, national, provincial and local, have played a pivotal role in delivering information and analysis to our citizens and they can rightly claim their share of credit, together with our excellent broadcasting services, for the political sophistication of the Irish community in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However we live in an open society <Col N="176" /> and we are not confined to Irish media, either print or electronic, for education, information and entertainment.  Four UK terrestrial television services, an ever increasing number of satellite services, and many UK radio services are widely available.  This availability is continually being extended, as a conscious Government policy, through the development of cable and MMDS.  In the print media, UK newspapers account for about one in six daily newspapers sold here, while one in three Sunday newspapers sold here is from the UK.</P>
    <P>Against this background the need for and the effectiveness of a Press Council concerned only with standards in Irish newspapers &mdash; and that is all it could concern itself with &mdash; has to be coldly evaluated.  Also there is the need to look at the experience of the operation of such bodies elsewhere to see how effective they have been in maintaining and raising acceptable standards in the medium.  Our neighbours across the water have had considerable difficulty in securing acceptance by editors of Press Council findings and indeed the council's usefulness is being increasingly questioned.  There is a view that a statutory body could serve little useful purpose unless it has statutory powers to impose sanctions on offending editors.  Such an arrangement could have the highly undesirable effect of stifling good investigative journalism on which our democracy depends in part and it would be difficult if not impossible to apply those standards to imported newspapers.  I do not believe that a statutory body with heavy handed powers is what is required to day, indeed if anything is required.</P>
    <P>Reading newspapers occupies, for some, a considerable proportion of our early business day and for others a considerable proportion of leisure time.  The mass media provide us with a significant part of our picture of social reality.  In effect, the mass media can structure reality into user friendly and easily digestible chunks.  From their introduction until very recent times, with the advent of radio and television, newspapers were quickly and comprehensively available to <Col N="177" /> a mass readership.  Despite the power of the electronic media, newspapers remain invaluable contributors to the information arena and their production is now a technology driven, market-led industry.</P>
    <P>I read with great interest recently a report on 100 years of change in the newspaper industry and was amazed to discover that in 1880 it took three hours to handset one column of newspaper text. By 1900 it took 35 minutes to lineset the same column and as recently as the 1960s it would take 20 minutes.  Now it takes two minutes to set a full page.</P>
    <P>The competition within the industry from other newspapers and without from the electronic media has sharpened the focus of newspapers; and the greater immediacy of newspaper stories.  Indeed, a newspaper which now fails to carry a late breaking story is uncommon and we have come a long way from the blank spaces denoted &ldquo;late news&rdquo;.  In parallel with the improved immediacy brought about by new technologies, the print media has crucially retained its position as a important provider of opinion and interpretation of newsworthy developments.</P>
    <P>With modern newspaper technology and so much direct VDU input into papers, the onus on newspaper editors and proprietors to ensure that the pillars of impartiality, balance, respect for privacy, decency and aesthetic decorum are respected and maintained is greater than ever.  The increasing competitiveness within the newspaper industry and the race with radio and television understandably led to all-consuming market share tussles.  Competition is healthy but can be sometimes myopic in that hitherto respectable and respected standards are discarded &mdash; sometimes unknowingly &mdash; and lesser standards become the norm. Senators Farrell, Manning and Dardis referred to invasions of privacy etc., but that will always happen because there will always be over-zealous reporters or photographers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, by and large, the Press in Ireland has let the poisoned chalice of garbage-bin press pass it by. <Col N="178" /> The level of taste which some of its counterparts abroad have fallen to is quite appalling, with the gross intrusion into the private lives of public figures and their grand posturing over decaying social standards.  I am all for the freedom of the Press &mdash; a plurality of points of view is a central tenet of a modern pluralist society.  With freedom comes responsibility and with being a public institution, such as is the Press, follows an unequivocal responsibility to the public good.</P>
    <P>Why then, if the Irish print media have not sunk to the levels of the gutter press in other countries, do we need a Press Council?  Given that the industry has shown a commendable degree of responsibility in the face of severe temptation, I do not agree that the initiative in this regard should come from Government. The Government in any democracy should be at a very clear and unambiguous remove from the Press and that is something that Irish Government of all hues and creeds have been very conscious of.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a Press Council the initiative in this regard should come from the industry itself &mdash; a clear case of allowing a free industry demonstrate the maturity to set its own house in order if needs be.  Senator Cassidy referred to this.  Furthermore, the industry should consider if the initiative should come now and not be precipitated by absolute necessity.  The thought processes should be set in motion now, the groundwork completed and if necessary the relevant structures put in place.  Prevention is easy on the palate and the pocket and is always the best cure.</P>
    <P>Coming from the industry, the Press Council could of course be much more than a watchdog; it could be a shepherd guiding and focusing the industry.  There is no reason why its founding character could not focus on more than journalist and editorial standards.  It could also serve as an umbrella body for the whole industry whose policy &mdash; akin to Government policy in relation to domestic broadcasting services &mdash; is to ensure that domestic newspapers remain the mainstream choice of Irish readers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> Indeed the question of media concentration &mdash; that is the conglomeration of various print and electronic media under a single control &mdash; is an increasing phenomenon and is a matter which is rightly causing some concern at an internatinal level.  While it is accepted that concentrations can be beneficial to the development of the media, there may be a danger of negative consequences to freedom of information and pluralism of opinions and, where such concentrations span frontiers, to social diversity.  A voluntary Press Council could, if properly structured, be a valuable source of suggestions and opinions and a guarantor of the independence of the Press if at any stage it is considered necessary to regulate this area.</P>
    <P>In an international context, where we are inundated with broadcasting services in particular from other countries and cultures, no individual state can exercise effective control over the numerous external television signals entering its territory. The only effective way to deal with the matter has been through concerted international action in the form of international legal instruments.  The need for concerted international action has been recognised throughout Europe and has led to the preparation of the Council of Europe's convention on Transfrontier Television and the EC's Directive on Broadcasting Activities.  These instruments have two interdependent objectives: to promote the free flow of broadcasts across frontiers, and to ensure that, in return for allowing such free flow, certain standards in important aspects of broadcasting are met.  The provisions of these instruments deal with a variety of important topics including respect for human dignity and rights, pornography and violence, the protection of the moral and physical development of children and incitement to hatred.</P>
    <P>Of interest also in the EC Directive is the right of reply provision contained in Article 23 which provides that any natural or legal person, regardless of nationality, whose legitimate interests, in particular reputation and good name, <Col N="180" /> have been damaged by an assertion of incorrect facts in a television programme, must have a right to reply or equivalent remedies.  A Press Council could usefully consider basic standards which might be expected from transfrontier publications.</P>
    <P>Finally, no legal or voluntary system can guarantee that material which may be offensive to some people will not be carried on broadcast or print services. Ultimately, responsibility for what is watched or read in any home rests with the individual and parents have particular responsibilities in this regard.  TV sets have an off switch as well as a channel selection switch which should be used responsibly and newspapers or magazines may or may not be purchased.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this matter, my non-statutory responsibility for this question notwithstanding.  I think that there is a need to look very carefully at what might be achieved by the establishment of a Press Council and in particular to consider the merits of a voluntary effort in this area.  It would be unwise to rush in with Government intervention in an area that traditionally has been free of it and to impose structures that might damage the democratic role of the print media.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it would be remiss of me not to avail of this opportunity to commend the Irish media generally and the Press in particular on how, to date, they have in general risen above the temptation to pander to baser instincts and have stuck generally to the high journalistic and Press standards that are indicative of the strong and rich literary heritage of which we are all so proud. Journalists are the keepers of today's annals and must be ever cognisant of the fact that today's news is a bequest and heritage to tomorrow's generation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann requests the Government to consider the setting up a Press Council.&rdquo;  Being fair to the proposers of the motion, they are opening up a discussion on the question of regulation or how some better regulatory body might be set in place.  As the Minister has said, it may not necessarily be desirable for a statutory body to be set up under by legislation but, for possibly, a body could be set up by the industry itself.  Parts of the industry have gone some way in that direction in that, at times, at least in some of the papers, there is a person one can telephone with a query, correction, complaints or comments etc.</P>
      <P>I value the work of the Press and the fact that we have in this country a free media, as one who looks at all aspects of it, printed, audio and visual.  No doubt I will try as the Cathaoirleach says, to watch the visual one later on.</P>
      <P>In relation to the whole media in this country, like a lot of other things, there is room for improvement and for standards. Thankfully, as the Minister has said, we have not descended to the gutter of Fleet Street.  While fair comment is to be welcomed and the media have a certain role to play in relation to the reporting of sensitive issues, there must be balance and discretion, particularly where peoples' inner feelings are concerned and in tragedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media must look at themselves, ensure that they get the facts right and that they do not print matters which can do damage to individuals.  I am not just referring to politicians, politicians are probably more fair game than other individuals. There must still be a sense of fair play and balance and if they do get it wrong there should be a greater and a more prompt reaction and retraction. Any possible retraction should be in the <Col N="182" /> same manner as the original mistake. Often we see small corrections, five or six months or a year after the event.  At that stage the damage has possibly been done to an individual and to try and rectify it at that point is probably too little, too late.</P>
    <P>In some libel cases in this country, and probably more particularly across the water, the damages awarded were totally excessive and over the top.  Some juries lost the run of themselves and the newspapers felt quite sore.  There must be a balance in relation to this.  There should possibly be some self-regulating body coming from the media.  I am not sure if two bodies would be necessary to cover both the written word and the electronic media.</P>
    <P>I think one has to look at the particularly advantageous position of RTE. Obviously, the fact that they have a virtual monopoly in certain areas is causing difficulties to the printed word. We have seen recently that RTE have made mistakes.  In the last couple of days we have seen where a trial had to be aborted and RTE had to pay money. We also saw recently that they were in contempt in relation to some tribunal. One wonders have the RTE Authority gone dormant, or exactly who is responsible and who is watching over this.  At times RTE are very quick to criticise politicians and others, but when representatives of the same RTE come in here before a committee of the House they are most reticent in relation to saying what any one is paid and in particular whether some of them are paid six figure sums.  Politicians and others obviously have to be responsible for their actions and RTE have a certain role to play, but there has to be a balance.</P>
    <P>We have seen recently, in relation to the currency crisis and since, a sensationalising of aspects of it, possibly doing a certain amount of damage to the country.  The reality is that mortgage holders are now paying more than they did last month.  I am not saying RTE are responsible for all of these things, but certainly they have a case to answer.  In <Col N="183" /> some programmes dealing with serious issues nameless individuals are brought on as so-called expert witnesses and allowed to give opinions without necessarily ensuring that there is a sense of fair play and a sense of balance.</P>
    <P>Headlines are at times erratic and certainly to an extent can be damaging and misleading.  But we are very fortunate in this country that we have a free Press which, by and large, does a very reasonable job, but perhaps it is time for some improvements, improvements which would help the industry itself.  I am not one for in any way censoring any of their actions.  They have a job to do; let them go out there and do it &mdash; investigate, bring things to light which might otherwise not have come to light.  I think we are lucky to have some very good investigative journalists; but, in relation to this whole question, we have to look at how they perform.  There has to be a balance; there has to be fair play.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this debate is a start in relation to opening up a discussion of these matters.  I am not sure what is the best way.  Perhaps, as the Minister said, we should have some sort of a self-regulating body, as some industries have, where if there are complaints against them they are immediately investigated. The newspapers cannot have it both ways.  As I have said, some libel awards have been excessive, but on the other hand perhaps some corrections were either too little or too late, particularly where damage was done to the individual. I would hope therefore that we could use this debate as a launching pad to discuss this and other matters.  It is a very timely one and I thank the Fianna Fáil Members, and Senator Cassidy in particular, for introducing it.  It is a matter that interests us all.  We all want to see a well functioning Press and media in this country.  I hope that that is what will come out of this and that it will be for the betterment of all the media here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first time I have spoken on his presence, so it is <Col N="184" /> good to see him here.  I imagine he has probably forgotten the old days before he was a Minister.  He has been in office now for quite a long period and is well into the job.</P>
      <P>The debate is welcome and Senator Cassidy is to be thanked for taking the initiative and raising the subject.  It is easy to understand why the subject would be raised in the context of the British experience of the last year or so, where essentially the tabloid press in Britain seem totally to have lost the run of themselves. I suppose in one way it is a reflection on the British people, and indeed on the mentality of the British people, that they are prepared to go for what is essentially a comic about the Royal Family and all that kind of stuff.  What more is there to be said and what more can be said about the toings and froings of the Royal Family, beyond it being the ideal stuff to put everybody into some type of deep sleep?  But the reality in Britain appears to be that people continue to buy this stuff.  When there is some new and even more horrifying shock about whatever one or other of these people have done, the sales apparently increase.</P>
      <P>However, for a variety of reasons, I do not think there is any danger of that kind of thing happening in this country.  If you are interested in shock and horror and terrible stories about famous people in this country you would be far better off to take yourself into one of the public houses late at night where you will get lots of people sitting on high stools who are prepared to tell you truly horrible stories about the toings and froings of famous people &mdash; far better and for more sensational than you could ever hope to read in an Irish newspaper.  In that sense I imagine that most Irish people simply do not have a great deal to learn or we do not have a great deal to be worried about in the context of the Irish papers going down that road of sensationalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that in this country there is a certain degree of sympathy for anybody who is being pilloried by the Press.  There are some notable figures in this country who have been pilloried, or at least see themselves as having been pilloried by <Col N="185" /> the Press over the years.  In many ways the devil a bit of harm it seems to have done them anyway.  Certainly, the politicians that have been at the receiving end of this seem to have trundled on and on.  They have gone their merry way.  In many ways the worse the publicity they got going into an election, the bigger the vote they got.  In many ways Irish politics and Irish life are somewhat different to Britain in that regard.  A lot of the time most Irish people know the politician in question and have long since made up their mind about whether or not this man or woman is a good, honest and honourable person, or whether they are thoroughly evil rascals.  If they want to start running checks on it, most of the time they are not going to resort to reading newspapers; they will simply start asking around and they will get the two sides of the story.  In that sense, therefore, I do not think there is any particular need for worry.</P>
    <P>There will always be occasions when people will be badly treated.  Some of the time I think it can happen by accident.  It can happen also because of vendettas, disagreements and antagonisms which exist between people in public life and journalists, who of course have an obligation to be fair and objective.  Indeed, in the vast bulk of cases that is actually what happens, but you will get that small element who will take out their disagreements on people and perhaps treat them unfairly.  I think it is a relatively small problem.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the libel laws in this country can have very far reaching affects for newspapers who go over the mark and get it wrong.  Certainly, for small newspapers it is the end of the story &mdash; they simply go broke.  They will be forced into bankruptcy if they get involved in a libel case which goes badly against them. I understand there is quite a number of newspapers here close enough to the edge.  I refer to the smaller newspapers. Those papers are not in a position to take risks.  Whether that is a good or a bad thing, I simply do not know.  I think you could argue the case both ways.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Irish media in general <Col N="186" /> I do not think there is a particular problem. Certainly, you will get the occasional case where things are difficult and problematic and it is important that the whole topic should be raised at this time.  I suppose there is also the danger that, as Irish society becomes more urbanised and more impersonal, you are at increasing risk of this kind of thing happening.  But certainly in small communities, and indeed generally speaking, most people know the individuals in question.  Certainly, in relation to those who are in public life and about whom articles appear in newspapers, my experience is that you will get the story on the ground from people who know an awful lot more than you could ever hope to read in newspapers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole question of public service broadcasting and so on, that is a matter that is perhaps somewhat outside the scope of the debate.  But I want to say in relation to public service broadcasting that nobody has a monopoly of public service broadcasting in this country.  Certainly RTE provide their own share of public broadcasting, but I believe that quite a bit of the material that comes from them could not be classified as public service broadcasting.  I think it fits into the broad category of commercial broadcasting, which is providing entertainment and not any special public service.  There are, of course, the programmes which do fit into that category.</P>
    <P>One of the matters we might all begin to think about is: what exactly is public service broadcasting?  Where does this begin and where does it end?  Certainly, the local radio stations particularly in the country areas, provide quite a bit of very useful public service broadcasting.  This cannot be provided by a national station because a national station can never get down to the levels of detail which the local stations can.  The local radio stations in this country, broadly speaking, have been a great success in terms of the service they are providing for the public.  I understand that many of them are struggling to survive financially.  All I can say in relation to that is more is the pity.  But <Col N="187" /> I think that on very limited resources they provide a very good service by way of the public service broadcasting.  I do not of course, include the music which they play non-stop.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Press Council itself and so on, the United Kingdom experience would lead to the conclusion that perhaps it is not particularly effective.  Certainly, the Press Council in the United Kingdom does not seem to have any great impact on what happens over there.</P>
    <P>The final point I simply want to mention is in relation to the way the electronic media, particularly some elements in RTE, conduct their business.  They seem to me to have an overwhelming anxiety for confrontation.  I really find it hard to understand why the balance is pushed in the direction of confrontation to the extent it is.  In the case of the present debate, and which will be taking place morning, noon and night between now and 3 December, I would hope that the issues could be explained in some type of a calm manner rather than having them pelted around broadcasting studios, where in the green corner and the blue corner you have protagonists who address the whole business as if it were some type of boxing contest.  Indeed, there are lessons to be learned in relation to the American system, where we have these &ldquo;title fights&rdquo; between President Bush and Governor Clinton.  It is a series of three title fights run over 45 minutes of sparring time, where they spar at one another.  Indeed, their assistants have a kind of junior match.  It is almost like the All-Ireland final, where the minor match proceeds the senior match.  The whole thing is conducted in this spirit of confrontation.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute that there is a place for that type of stringent argument, but I am also of the view that it is not the whole story.  I sometimes wonder if the message which comes out of this is a message derived almost from the appearances of these people.  Certainly, there are fairly important questions to be answered.  People say that, as a principle of communication, what is important is <Col N="188" /> how you look rather than what you say. If that is the underlying principle, what justification can be put up for much of this type of confrontation when the best that will come out of it is some type of impression based on the appearance of the people rather than what they are actually saying?  If the purpose of these programmes is to enlighten and clarify issues, how can that be done by the appearance of a protagonist on one side or the other?  I think that in some cases the objective is basically to get audiences, because this business is very competitive. I suppose that is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that this has become as confrontational as it now is, this anxiety and bias towards confrontation.  I am not saying that it should not happen.  Certainly, in the case the Maastricht debate it seemed to me to be the same old story again &mdash; people shouting at one another, when I would have hoped that somebody might have been able to explain in fairly simple terms what exactly the pros and cons of those issues were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the establishment of a Press Council and agree with the Minister that it should be under the auspices of and supervised by the Press itself.  We require such a council to consider, adjudicate, conciliate and resolve complaints of unfair treatment and unwarranted infringement of privacy by the Press.  It will have an advantage for the Press itself in that it will have face validity in the area of complaints and innuendo which are often made against the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media has a reputation for high professional standards and has the respect of the public in Ireland and it is important, I believe, that this is maintained. There have been occasions however where it has been seriously damaged, and one has only to recall the Ben Dunne case as an example of this.  I believe such a Press Council should ensure that the Press maintains the highest professional standards, respects and defends recognised freedoms, including freedom of expression, the public right to know and the right of <Col N="189" /> the Press to operate without improper pressure from any source.</P>
    <P>It is important that a code of practice be supervised by such a Press Council. The code should cover the obligations on newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other areas of the media to be accurate, to publish corrections and apologies, which should be made without admission of liability for defamation, an area I want to touch on later.  The code should provide for a fair opportunity to reply to comments, to distinguish comment and conjecture from fact and to respect privacy. It should require journalists to avoid misrepresentation, intimidation and harrassment, as occasionally occurs, and to always identify themselves when making inquiries, whether it is through the telephone or otherwise, and to protect their sources of information.  Ninety-nine per cent of journalists will support such an approach.  I believe that there should also be a code to deal with Press intrusion into the areas of grief and shock especially and also in regard to interviewing and indeed photographing children or people in sensitive situations, after a sudden death or a tragedy or whatever.  I believe that such a code will protect journalism as a profession and should have the support of the profession for its establishment.</P>
    <P>I previously referred to the area of defamation.  I would now like to just briefly deal with this because I believe it is inhibiting the freedom of the Press.  I believe that the present law on defamation is archaic, out of date, and needs legislation to change it.  I refer to the Law Reform Commission report on this which was published earlier this year.  The balance between the need to preserve the individual's good name and reputation on the one hand and the right of free speech, especially in areas of public interest, on the other hand has moved too much in favour of the individual's situation.  I believe that the purpose of the law should be to provide a balance between the individual and the public's right to know, between these two competing forces.  It is a prerequisite in an open democracy that the public know <Col N="190" /> what is going on.  In recent years there has been a discernable shift away from the public's need to know what is happening towards the individual's rights which stymies the publication of information on important public issues.  A debate should take place on this area based on the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the changes that I think should be made.  I believe that judges should be in a position to determine the amount of damages to be awarded after a jury has indicated which category, nominal compensation or punitive.  The Supreme Court should have a right to assess the damages in the event of appeal and not a jury.  The defendants, the Press, should be in a position to make payments into a court without admission of liability.  At present, similar to any civil case, the payment of money by a media organ charged with defamation is an admission of liability and this should be changed.  If the Press publishes an apology this should not be construed as an admission of liability and should in fact be taken into account in any award of damages &mdash; that the Press moved quickly to correct the situation.  At present, if they do it, it is construed as an admission of liability. They should be allowed apologise without admitting liability and such an apology should be taken into account when assessing damages afterwards.</P>
    <P>A debate has developed around the issues of libel and slander and I believe the distinction should be abolished.  I believe also that there should be a provision for defamation of the dead, with a three year limit from the time of publication for an action by a close relative or personal representative of the deceased.  It is unfair on family, friends and others that the law of defamation does not apply where the person involved has died.  It can be very stressful for the family.  This should be changed.  There should be a three year period when a representative or member of the family could bring a case if a person who has recently died is defamed.</P>
    <P>A discussion should also take place <Col N="191" /> around the whole area of privilege.  Nowadays, because of modern technology, printers and distributors often never see the print coming from the newspapers, from the journalists and the editors, because it goes through a computer right into the paper.  Yet such people are still liable for anything that appears in the Press.  Printers and distributors should be immune from being enjoined in legal actions arising from alleged defamation.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to join with other Senators in thanking both Senator Cassidy and Senator Farrell for bringing this debate to the House.  It is very timely, but it does require deep thought and discussion.  If we are to seriously contemplate the possibility of establishing a body to adjudicate on grievances in relation to Press or media coverage in this country, we have an obligation to look at the question from all sides.  Like other speakers, I believe it is important to look at the history in Britain, where there was a Press Council with the high-minded ambition of having the Press play a role in regulating itself but which eventually was abandoned by those closest to it precisely because the watchdog was shown to have a bark but no real bite.  This was referred to by the Minister in his speech.</P>
      <P>It would be important also to have some input from the Press itself, from the owners and from those who present the public face of the media &mdash; the journalists, who have a very commendable ethical code of their own but again some problems in making sure that the code is applied in everyday working.  We cannot complain about how the Press reports something if we do not have free access to information, or when you have a press liaison or public relations machine that sees its job as diverting the focus of journalists' attention away from particular issues or providing the journalists with a different target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been mentioned by several Senators here tonight, there is the constant threat or shadow of litigation.  While we all want the Press and media to give <Col N="192" /> us a right of reply, sometimes that right of reply is too late in coming, when the issue is already lost and you are guilty, even though you are innocent several months later.  But we want this right of reply or the Press even to acknowledge when they get it wrong.  I quite understand that the media are slow to publish corrections when the legal advice may well be that by making a correction it may be an admission of liability and leave the publication wide open to litigation and heavy damages and costs.  That is a fact of life.  It has been mentioned by several Senators.</P>
    <P>Over the last few months we have seen the veil pulled back by some of our Government ordered inquiries.  We have also seen how the pressure of litigation, or even threat of litigation, has been applied to suppress the truth.  One instance is the long saga of the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site.  In that instance power and money were brought into play.  This showed how a journalist's story triggered off an apology written within the newspaper itself and how the original report was eventually fully vindicated, not by the newspaper but by a State inquiry.  I would question in that instance the newspaper's own checking efforts.  That is something that caused a sensation at the time and possibly is one of the reasons this was brought up.  It shows that but for the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site saga, which is continuing, perhaps that would not have been seen.  From a political viewpoint, we have also seen in recent months how reports which were dismissed as rumour and disinformation have turned out to be based on fact.  We have seen how some of our own colleagues have been fed disinformation or wrong information which subsequently went into speeches and statements.</P>
    <P>On an issue which is particularly sensitive in my own region, have we &mdash; and I ask myself have I?  &mdash; the moral courage to ask Aer Lingus how many free flights were provided to their friends in the media?  We may not ask those questions because we do not want to sour our own relationship with the Press.  Senator <Col N="193" /> Maurice Manning talked about the tension that should be there between the Press and politicians.  Questions need to be asked but you say if I raise that perhaps I will never get a line again.  However, it is important that they are raised.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where the newspapers here took a step forward by providing a complaints unit within each paper which makes corrections and clarifications each day, but at least in one case this appears to be total window dressing. We have a situation where one of our Sunday newspapers does not even deign to provide a letters to the editor section where the right of reply can be exercised. That is the <i>Sunday Business</i> Post.  We have a situation too where journalists have been locked in dispute with their own management over the ethical standards operating in a particular medium. It certainly reflects the double standards of this country when a newspaper which fights its own journalists and their code of conduct is also party to pontificating about ethics in business on either side of the Atlantic.  That certainly is hypocritical.</P>
    <P>There was reference to efforts by editors in this country to set up an organisation which would commit them to standards of behavour.  This happened almost 15 years ago and important people at the time were involved.  The will to do something about the way the Press operated was driven by the perception that the Press was leaving itself open to justifiable criticism.  The few, whose activities were largely generating the criticism, were also those who dissented from the idea of standard setting and sticking to those standards.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about as has been said by many Senators, is balance.  We need balance from our media, but we also need to be balanced in our judgments.  The question requires not only deep thought but the most thorough investigation.  It requires that we should be fair all round.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be unwise for the Government to intervene in an area that traditionally has been free and it is certainly not right to impose <Col N="194" /> structures that might damage something we hold dear &mdash; the democratic role of the media, and of the print media in particular.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who come in and spoke so positively in relation to this proposal.  I also thank the Minister.  This is my eighth year as Communications spokesperson for Fianna Fáil in Seanad Éireann.  I see dangers ahead from the British media coming to Ireland, particularly the tabloids as one Senator pointed out and it is because of that that I and Senator Farrell put this motion on the agenda this evening.</P>
      <P>However, I agree with the Minister when he said that the problem is at international levels.  The air waves know no boundaries nor do television signals.  This is not the case with the print media.  At some future date, the Minister might consider setting up an Oireachtas committee to examine, note and participate fully in proposed legislation at present at European Parliament level to retain and to allow for certain standards.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said in his speech, standards are important in broadcasting and the provisions of these instruments which deal with a variety of important topics is welcome.  These topics include respect for human dignity and rights and control of pornography and violence which are evident on our screens night after night. Pornography and violence present a bad example to our youth and contribute to world violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen what happened in California when people are unemployed; the devil finds work for idle hands.  Our broadcasting standards have set the tone across Europe and the world down through the years.  The Minister should seriously consider setting up a small Oireachtas committee to advise the Minister <Col N="195" /> of State and her officials and to frame a motion to put to the European Parliament to stop the broadcast of violence. Violent videos and violent TV soap operas may feature physical or sexual violence.  Such unacceptable practice does not augur well for our long term future as Europeans or for the world in general.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me time tonight.  I am delighted and heartened with the tremendous response received and hope that the print media will respond to this motion.  I look forward to hearing their views over the next couple of months.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Senators Cosgrave and Conroy.  I thank the Minister for coming along tonight to hear the Senators from Dún Laoghaire and I will be brief because I realise that people are interested in other things happening tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to have to ask the Minister to come here again tonight to give another commitment on Dún Laoghaire.  He generously gave one a short while ago when launching the report on Dún Laoghaire harbour.  At that time there was general delight among the councillors and public in Dún Laoghaire that at last we were going to see movement on the development of our harbour.  We were particularly pleased when the Minister reiterated the commitment given by the previous Minister, Deputy Wilson, in this House.  I would like to emphasise how important we consider the development of Dún Laoghaire port and in particular of the ferry services. Unfortunately rumours have been circulating &mdash; I am sorry to be the bearer of <Col N="196" /> rumours to the Minister &mdash; that suggest that there is less than commitment among other relevant people to the development of the port.  I am not saying that this is the fault of the Minister; we accept his previous statements in good faith.</P>
    <P>On a recent tour of the harbour facility in Dún Laoghaire it was brought home to us once again how bad facilities are for the Sealink Stena Line.  I commented to one of my colleagues as we were walking through that the whole area was like pictures we have seen of Ellis Island.  There is a grave need to develop that facility.</P>
    <P>The interim harbour board report gave exciting outlines of proposed development for the port which included the development of the ferry services.  It was brought home to us on our visit that if this does not happen Dún Laoghaire will die as a port and as a focus of employment for the borough area.  We are fearful that the strong lobby from Dublin port, which we know exists, will undermine the efforts that have been put into the preparation of a plan for the development of the port and particularly the harbour, reducing Dún Laoghaire to a focus for tourism and nothing else.  I know that my colleagues here feel as strongly as I do about the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  We are all united in our anxiety about the future of the harbour and in our desire to see the whole area developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for sharing time with me.  I want to make some brief points about rumours circulating in the borough that the Department of the Marine are going cold in relation to funds for Dún Laoghaire and particularly for overdue site investigation works.  May be at this time of year the Minister is not in a position to find hundreds or thousands or even millions of pounds, but the Christmas spirit may help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is needed to repair the connecting bridge at present.  There is also the ongoing question of the ferry services and the retention of Sealink, which is the preferred option.  We are all aware of the vigorous lobby from Dublin port, but to them I would say &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; and &ldquo;get <Col N="197" /> your own house in order&rdquo;.  Dublin port is not necessarily the ideal model of a port.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's office is nearer to Dublin port than to Dún Laoghaire, but in reality and injustice, both schemes may be entertained.  Current proposals for Dún Laoghaire are important for its economic future and for tourism.  I hope the Minister will undertake to make money available for site investigation works, to repair the connecting bridge, to enable Sealink to remain in Dún Laoghaire and to retain the ferry services. It is important that we receive this commitment from the Minister here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for sharing her brief time and thank Senator Cosgrave also.  I thank the Minister for coming here tonight and for coming to Dún Laoghaire and showing that he is aware of the importance to Dún Laoghaire of the ferry service, its life blood.  There may be arguments for a single ferry port in the Dublin Bay area but, if so, two points merit attention. There are many facilities in Dublin while Dún Laoghaire is primarily a ferry port. From a practical point of view users of Dún Laoghaire harbour have made it clear that they would prefer to continue using Dún Laoghaire.  All public representatives in Dún Laoghaire are united on this issue.  Senator Cosgrave is current Chairman of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Senator Keogh may be a future Chairman.  There is concern among all and we would welcome further confirmation of the Government's intentions towards the ferry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year I published the development plan for Dún Laoghaire harbour. This plan is a co-ordinated and balanced programme for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour which presents a strategy for the development of the harbour into the next century.  It promotes a vision of a high quality environment with a balanced development of its commercial and public services, marine-related <Col N="198" /> activities, recreation and tourism potential.  Senator Cosgrave was concerned that the Department of the Marine might go cold on this issue but I assure him that neither the Department nor myself intend to do so.  In fact I do not often go cold; I run hot most of the time.  I am aware of the rumours which have been circulating and I appreciate the points made by the Senators.</P>
      <P>The Government have approved in principle the main outline of this development plan, including its proposals for the development of the ferry terminal.  That is an official Government decision.  I know that only the outline has been approved but it is an important decision in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
      <P>The Government have also authorised the advancement of the plan to the next stage, another formal Government decision.  The next stage involves site investigation work, cost benefit analysis and other studies which are needed to justify the expenditure set out in the plan and to investigate the sources and costs of funds for the development.  It is a major plan as Senators will appreciate, dealing with a bad situation which Senator Keogh described.  There is much work to be done and heavy capital works to be undertaken.  I expect to be in a position to advertise for tenders to conduct these investigations within the next week and I hope that will reassure the Senators and others concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to the points made by Senator Cosgrave, the work on the connecting bridge is under way now and will become more obvious in the next few days.  It has been approved and we will see it in operation.  I have placed on record my unequivocal support for the retention of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire and the harbour development plan's proposals for upgrading the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board has emphasised the view that the development of facilities on the central sea corridor should, in the national interest, be based on a Dublin Bay approach.  They envisage the two ports concentrating on the traffic for which each is best suited.  In that context they <Col N="199" /> envisage that Dún Laoghaire will continue to provide a ferry port.</P>
    <P>The review group on commercial harbours and pilotage policy and legislation recommended that Dún Laoghaire Harbour should remain separate from Dublin port in order to promote competition. The location of investment for either passenger or freight facilities should be determined by commercial considerations. This recommendation is in line with the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board's advice in this respect.</P>
    <P>Work on the preparation of the Harbours Bill, 1992, is underway.  I will be following the review group's proposals in framing the new legislation and in making proposals on the future organisation of commercial seaports, including Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I intend to present these proposals to Government in the near future.  We have been working on these over the summer and have had a great deal of consultation already.  I expect to be in a position to come to Government with the proposals shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to commercial decisions by the Stena line, the company has indicated that they wish to stay in Dún Laoghaire. That will be a matter for them to decide. The steps I am taking are in harmony with the excellent plan prepared by the group.  I hope to be in a position reasonably soon to start making some progress on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Department and Minister for Justice need to ensure that proper procedures in accord with international human rights and natural justice are put in place so that those seeking asylum in Ireland are humanely treated and their cases fairly considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that existing procedures are totally inadequate to deal with those seeking asylum or refuge here from other countries.  It is ironic that daily on television we see evidence of concern and generosity towards Somalia and Bosnia where people are enduring famine, strife and persecution.  Help is forthcoming for people on their own soil but when <Col N="200" /> attempts are made to flee famine or persecution and seek refugee status on Irish soil we treat refugees with hostility and suspicion.  We are prepared to be humane and Christian as long as the problem remains abroad but God help them if they step on Irish soil.  Our humanity and Christianity then goes out the door.</P>
    <P>This motion is intended to ensure that the relatively small number of people who seek asylum in Ireland are given a fair and humane hearing and that they are not treated peremptorily.  Independent and impartial procedures are necessary. In Ireland at present refugee matters are usually dealt with by emigration officers at the point of entry.  These people have no special training or expertise in international refugee law nor knowledge of circumstances in the refugee's country of origin.  They have no obligation to inform a refugee of their entitlements, whether to legal advice or to contact the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Decisions are generally made by the Department of Justice on the basis of a flimsy and limited interview and investigation conducted by the emigration officers.  If there is a review of the application or an appeal it is done through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, not on the basis of direct information from the refugee but on a phone call to London, on the basis of notes or on a past interview.  It is not a full, thorough and comprehensive investigation; the necessary information is not made available.</P>
    <P>The 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relate to the status of refugees and defines it clearly:</P>
    <P>A refugee is a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.</P>
    <P>We must incorporate that understanding into our legislative process and follow it with procedures to ensure that the letter and the spirit of that Protocol and convention are implemented.  We need a <Col N="201" /> proper impartial independent body with the necessary professional people; expertise to collect all appropriate information concerning the country from which the person has come; to know the law relating to refugee status; to be in a position to contact and liaise with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and to be able to conduct a proper <i>prima facie</i> interview and, later, an in depth interview with the person seeking asylum.  The right to appeal must be clearly outlined with clear procedures for appeal and the person in question must be clearly informed of that right.</P>
    <P>The procedures should be properly observed, not by means of telephone or peremptory notes but in a formal written form.  At present people requesting asylum here are detained in prison cells and in Garda stations.  Garda stations in this city have cells specifically designated for the detention of aliens where they may spend considerable lengths of time. We know they have spent time in prisons such as Limerick, normally, Cork, occasionally and particularly Mountjoy for six, seven or eight months without either being released or having their case dealt with.  We must ensure that that situation comes to an end.</P>
    <P>To give an idea of the increasing numbers of people looking for asylum in this country, in 1986 the figure was 19, in 1992 the figure was 31, but in 1990 it was 62.  I am not sure of the reason for the variations here.  In 1986 four requests for asylum were recognised.  In 1991 one was granted, so we have a very low recognition rate principally because of the inadequate and peremptory nature of our investigative procedures.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the 1951 Convention and at the 1967 Protocol and to draft legislation in accordance with those provisions to clearly define the status of refugee; to establish a procedure which would incorporate an independent body with authority and expertise to examine each case; to faciliate liaision with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in London, and to include an appeals mechanism so that people fleeing persecution, imprisonment or possible execution abroad will not be received with hostility here or put <Col N="202" /> on the next plane or the next boat home. That is the effect of present procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Costello has rightly pointed out, Ireland is a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees.  Government policy on political asylum, and indeed the policy of previous Governments of whatever party, is and has been fully in accordance with our international obligations arising under these agreements.</P>
      <P>A procedural agreement giving effect to our commitments at the domestic level was negotiated in December 1985 with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  That agreement was negotiated by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i>, who was a member of a Government which included representatives of Senator Costello's party.  These arrangements continue to be operative and apply in all cases where an application for asylum is being examined.</P>
      <P>The 1985 arrangements provide a comprehensive and fair framework within which the examination of an application for political asylum takes place.  The provisions set out to ensure that the applicant is given every opportunity to present his case in an environment conducive to establishing the facts of the case.  The agreement allows as well for the participation of the office of the UN High Commission for Refugees in the consideration of each application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be useful, perhaps if I were to set out in some detail how the procedures actually work in practice.  Persons who request refugee status at Irish ports or at the Department of Justice are interviewed initially by an immigration officer.  Every facility is afforded applicants to allow them to make their case in as comfortable a surrounding as possible. The services of an interpreter are provided where necessary and the applicant may have a legal adviser present if he or she so wishes.  Each application is then forwarded to the London representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who is accredited to Ireland, as well as to the Department <Col N="203" /> of Foreign Affairs for their observations. When these views are obtained in due course, each case is submitted to the Minister for Justice personally for decision.  In the case of an applicant who wishes to travel to a third country the above procedures are also followed, in addition to consultation with the relevant embassy of the country to which the person wishes to travel.</P>
    <P>It should also be emphasised that even where an applicant for political asylum fails in his or her application they are not necessarily removed from the State. Some have been allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds while others have been permitted to remain pending their admission to a third country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing procedures are satisfactory and continue to provide an appropriate means of meeting our international commitments.  The policy of the Government towards refugees is to be as positive as possible in considering their status here and we take our responsibilities in this regard very seriously indeed.  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that the procedures followed in these matters were endorsed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees last year. One point I would also like to underline here and now is that no Minister for Justice has ever disagreed with the views of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees on whether an applicant for political asylum is or is not entitled to such status.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello stated that applicants for political asylum are put in jail while their applications are being considered. They are not.  There is no question of people who come to this country legitimately and who apply for refugee status being put in prison.  Those detained are people who come here illegally, are refused leave to land or are being returned home &mdash; even so, it is not true in all cases.  These people are in prison of their own free will and, in the words of a High Court Judge last year, can attain their <Col N="204" /> freedom any day they wish by simply leaving the country.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise the issue of means tested unemployment assistance as introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare last July.  Since the 29 July, where an applicant is in insurable employment for one, two or three days per week, those earnings are assessible for unemployment assistance.  This also applies where earnings are casual as in the case of casual dockers.  This has serious implications for people like dockers and firemen who have raised these issues with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The situation I am most concerned about and wish to raise here is the position of casual dockers at Foynes, County Limerick.  They find that without notice their unemployment assistance has been reduced dramatically, to different levels for different people.  They are assessed on the period April to August.  They received no prior warning that this was going to happen so they had no opportunity to budget in advance of its introduction. Their income has now been reduced to a totally unacceptable level. They are unable to survive and the MidWestern Health Board has had to intervene to guarantee their sustenance.  This is most unfair and I question the legality of considering earnings between April and August or September in calculating their means.  Why was it not based on last year's earning as in all other calculations? This has serious implications for the dockers because their highest earnings is from April to September.  The Minister should look seriously at what he is doing here.  He is punishing people who declare that they are working while on unemployment assistance and forcing them consequently into the black economy.</P>
