      <P>I have notice from Senator Upton that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify his recent statement in relation to his concern about the Government ability to maintain its present level of social welfare schemes and funding.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the water supply in County Dublin which requires another reservoir in view of present ongoing difficulties.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Upton as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Cosgrave as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>We have no difficulty with taking the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill as far as it will go this morning; if that means going into Committee Stage that is acceptable, at least to my group.</P>
      <P>In view of another outrageous libel award made in Dublin courts yesterday, where all that seemed to be involved was a genuine mistake on the part of the newspapers, could the Leader indicate what the Government's intentions are in relation to the recent Law Reform Commission report on libel and defamation? This has been around for quite some time.  We raised it before.  The Leader said that he would try to find what the Government's intentions were.</P>
      <P>Second, could I draw to the attention of the House a report in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning indicating grave disquiet among senior gardaí about the possibility of MI5 operating in this country?</P>

      <P>I will bring it to a conclusion simply by asking the Leader of the House if, in view of the fact it is inconceivable that one friendly country would have spies operating on the territory of another friendly country, he would ask the Minister for Justice to investigate these claims as a matter of urgency and to make a statement to either this House or the other House on the matter?</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Leader of the House could not have an outlined programme of legislation as he indicated he would have.  As regards Item <Col N="1819" /> No. 1 on the Order of Business, we do not object to it going through as quickly as possible subject, of course, to there not being any censorship or guillotine on the comments we would like to make on it.</P>

      <P>What is the situation in relation to the foreign affairs committee?  When are we going to see it?  Will it take on the dimensions of the old programme for draining the Shannon, which is still with us 50 years after it was initiated?</P>

      <P>I am not sanguine about accepting the proposal from the Leader of the House, as my colleagues from the Independent benches and Fine Gael have indicated, to taking all Stages of the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill today.  We have enunciated before that we have a basic objection &mdash; and a principled objection &mdash; to taking all Stages of any Bill in the same sitting.  It is improper to establish a principle of that nature which would mean that we could run through any legislation without having the opportunity of presenting the Second Stage argument and then reflecting on them and presenting whatever amendments are required.  I would be opposed to taking all Stages today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to advert to Item No. 18 on the Order Paper which relates to the Prison Reform Bill and again to ask the Leader of the House if he would bring to the attention of the Minister a visiting committee report on Mountjoy.  This visiting committee was specifically established by the Fianna Fáil Government, having got rid of the old visiting committee because it did not come up with the type of report they wanted and the previous Minister had delayed releasing that report.  Finally, he released it, but he also released the visiting committee and appointed a new visiting committee which came up with an even more hard <Col N="1820" /> hitting report on the conditions there. Would the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister the proposal for a Prison Reform Bill, and ask him to reconsider his decision in relation to this issue and take the responsibility, as it is his brief, to institute appropriate legislation in this area?</P>

      <P>I am sorry the incoming Minister for Justice is not here to answer many of the questions raised, but I will pass on to him many of the issues that have been raised here, such as the law reform in relation to libel or defamation and the recent report.  I will look at the up-to-date position on that, and will come back on it.  With regard to today's paper reports on M15, I will again seek the Minister's view on the up-to-date position on the validity of that.</P>
      <P>As regards Item No. 18 &mdash; Prison Reform Bill &mdash; the Minister said he intends to bring in reforms.  I am confident that the Foreign Affairs Committee will be in place sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole yesterday asked about the legislative programme we hope to deal with between now and the end of this session.  It is hoped that we will deal with the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill, the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, which we start today, the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill, the Roads Bill, the Housing Bill and Financial Transactions of Certain Companies and Other Bodies Bill.  That is the programme as of today. I have sought out one or two Ministers to see where they stand on legislation. <Col N="1821" /> As you can see we will have a very busy schedule over the coming weeks.  It is the intention that we will be sitting three days a week.</P>

    <Title>Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, 1992: Order for Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Bill entitled an Act to enable the Minister for Justice to appoint persons to be known as Assistant Censors to assist the Official Censor of Films in the performance of his functions and to amend the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1970, and the Video Recordings Act, 1989.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Justice to appoint persons to be known as assistant censors to assist the film censor in the performance of his duties and functions under the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1970, and the Video Recordings Act, 1989 &mdash; particularly the latter Act.</P>
      <P>Basically, the Video Recordings Act, 1989, aimed at three levels of control. First, it contains provison for the licensing of all video wholesalers and retailers. Second, it provides that the censor may, on grounds specified in the Act, prohibit the supply of video films which he considers unsuitable for viewing. Third, it provides for the classification of all video films in terms of their suitability of reviewing by different age groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first two levels of control mentioned &mdash; licensing and the censor's <Col N="1822" /> power to prohibit certain videos &mdash; are in operation.  However, the third level of control &mdash; classification of all video films &mdash; has yet to be brought into operation and this is where the present Bill becomes relevant.  The volume of work which will be involved in classifying all new videos and those already on the market could not be undertaken by the censor alone. He will need considerable assistance and hence the need for assistant censors.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the detail of the provisions of the present Bill I would like to remind the House, briefly, of the circumstances which made it necessary to enact the Video Recordings Act, 1989. In the mid-1980s video films were a comparatively new phenomenon.  They enjoyed an amazing growth in popularity during that decade.  This growth was evidenced by the fact that video recorders became commonplace in homes and by the proliferation in the number of outlets which supplied video films.</P>
    <P>There were thousands of video film titles available and the number was being added to at the rate of approximatley 1,000 new titles each year.  Most of these films were unobjectionable in their protrayal of adventure, comedy, romance, sport, education, etc.  There were some video films available, however, that were thoroughly objectionable. These films depicted extreme and graphic violence or uninhibited pornography. The extremely violent films contained many scenes of the most stomach turning and ghastly violence and attracted the name &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo;.  The pornographic video films portrayed sex in a totally objectionable manner.</P>
    <P>Films of this kind can have an adverse effect on the viewers and they can also result in crimes against other innocent people.  Apart from that, they tend to increase the general tolerance of what ought to be unacceptable.  If people frequently see extremely violent films, some of them will come to regard this type of violence as the norm.  The danger is that the more impressionble of them will initiate and imitate in real life what they see in the video world.</P>
    <P>As I have said already the pornographic <Col N="1823" /> films are totally objectionable in what they portray.  I understand that anybody who has not seen these films cannot imagine the depths of degradation to which they stoop.  Much of the material could only be described as degrading of human nature generally, but all of it is degrading and offensive as far as women are concerned.</P>
    <P>Until the passing of the Video Recording Act, 1989, we had two forms of censorship &mdash; censorship of publications and censorship of films &mdash; which had been in place practically since the foundation of the State.  Yet the new powerful medium, the video film, had no specific form of control.  Because of the availability of video films containing extreme and ghastly violence or uninhibited pornography, it was generally recognised that specific legislative provisions were required to control and regulate the supply and importation of video films. Hence the enactment of the Video Recordings Act, 1989.  The 1989 Act is, as I said, being brought into operation in stages by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>In April 1991, regulations were made which require retail and wholesale video dealers to be licensed with effect from 1 May 1991.  These licences are issued by the film censor and authorise the sale or letting on hire of video recordings at or from a particular premises.  A licence remains in force for a period of 12 months.  Between 1 May 1991 and 30 April 1992,1,534 retail and ten wholesale licences were issued.  The fees for licences are: retail: £100, and wholesale £4,000.</P>
    <P>In July 1991, a further order was made enabling the film censor to exercise his powers under the Act to prohibit the supply of video films which he considers to be unfit for viewing.  To date, the censor has issued prohibition orders in respect of 71 such video films.</P>
    <P>A further order and regulations will be required in the coming months to commence the remainder of the Act and enable the film censor to examine all new video films intended for supply and also to commence the systematic examination of all video films already on the market. <Col N="1824" /> The censor will examine the videos to determine whether they are suitable for viewing and, if suitable, will assign one of the following four classifications to them: (i) fit for viewing by persons generally; (ii) fit for viewing by persons generally but for a child under 12 years only in the company of a responsible adult; (iii) fit for viewing by persons aged 15 years or more; and (iv) fit for viewing by persons age 18 years or more.  However, because of the volume of work which will be involved it will be necessary, as I said, to first appoint a number of assistant censors to assist the censor.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bill, administrative and computer systems have to be put in place at the Film Censor's Office to cope with the certification process.  Extra staff will have to be recruited and trained on those systems.  It is estimated that the Censor's Office will be in a position by the autumn to commence certifying and classifying video films.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to quantify accurately the number of video films involved, information received from trade interests suggests that the task could not be performed by the Film Censor in addition to censoring cinema films.  The trade say they will be submitting in the region of 700 new video films each year to the censor for examination. This figure does not take account of those video films already on the market.  It is estimated that there could be as many as 12,000 to 15,000 video films already on the market which will also require examination.</P>
    <P>With that background in mind I would now like to address in broad terms the provisions of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>As I have said the main purpose of the Bill is to amend existing legislation to enable the Minister for Justice to appoint assisant censors to assist the film censor in the performance of his statutory duties and functions.  Section 2 of the Bill deals with this.  The Bill also provides for the rectification of anomalies in the existing legislation which relate to the fees to be prescribed for appeals to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board.  Sections 3,4 and <Col N="1825" /> 5 are the relevant sections of the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>In section 2 it is proposed to empower the Minister to appoint as many assistant censors as will be required to assist the film censor in the performance of his duties.  The assistant censors will be given the same statutory powers as the film censor to make decisions in relation to the certification and classification or prohibition of cinema and video films with the exception of the following powers which will be confined to the Film Censors: (i) the power under the Censorship of Films Act, 1970, to review a decision made over seven years previously in the case of a cinema film; (ii) the power under section 4 (3) of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, to give a higher classification, that is, one indicating suitability for younger viewers, in the case of a video film; (iii) the power under section 7 (3) of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, to revoke a prohibition order in respect of a video film; and (iv) the making of annual and other reports under section 29 of the Act of 1989 to the Minister for Justice on the censor's activities as to censorship of cinema or video films.</P>
    <P>Thought was given to whether a system could be devised whereby the assistant censors could operate in a subordinate role to the censor and where final decisions on classification could be left to him.  Such a system would have the advantage of guaranteeing uniformity in determining classifications.  However, given the sheer volume of work which is involved and the fact that the video producing companies will need speedy decisions on the classification of new videos, it would make such a system unworkable.  However, under the system proposed in the Bill, there are provisions aimed at ensuring a uniform approach to classification.</P>
    <P>First, it is proposed that the film censor, subject to any directions that may be given to him by the Minister for Justice, may determine which functions an assistant censor may perform and to what extent he or she may perform such functions.</P>
    <P>Second, there is provision that the <Col N="1826" /> assistant censors will perform the functions allotted to them under the general superintendence of the film censor and consult with him from time to time about the performance of these functions. These provisions will provide the film censor with the means to establish classification standards and maintain a consistency in their application.</P>
    <P>As to the appointment of persons to the position of assistant censor, there are a number of factors which will have to be taken into account in determining their conditions of employment.  For example, the video business is subject to peaks and valleys.  Some of the variations are seasonal while others are related to customer trends and demands.  Regardless of such variations, however, distributors of video films will demand a consistently speedy service from the Film Censor's Office in having their product examined, certified and classified in time to meet planned release dates into the market place.  In addition, experience elsewhere has shown that persons employed on the examination and classification of video films maintain consistently better standards of judgment if employed for short periods and given long breaks.</P>
    <P>Also, more assistant censors will be required during the first years of examination of video films until such time as the backlog of films already on the market have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the appointment of assistant censors on a full-time basis to examine video films would not be the best way to cope with these factors.  Other options would be to appoint assistant censors on a contract basis for a definite period of time or to appoint them on a part-time basis as the need arises, or a mixture of both systems.  I am having these matters examined at present, but it may not be possible to determine all the issues involved until the operation of classifying the videos gets under way.</P>
    <P>Assistant censors will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The annual cost involved will depend on the volume of new video films released each year and the rate at which those films already on the market can be examined. <Col N="1827" /> It is not possible, therefore, to state accurately what the level of cost is likely to be during the first or second year of operation. All costs involved in the operation of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, will be recovered by the charging of fees for services provided.  Accordingly, there will not be any net additional cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the other proposals in the Bill before the House which are intended to regularise the existing law covering the prescribing of fees for appeals in respect of cinema films and video films &mdash; sections 3, 4 and 5 refer.</P>
    <P>The effect of the relevant provisions of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, in relation to appeals in respect of cinema films is that a fee of not more than £5 may be prescribed in each case and, where that appeal is successful the fee should, be refunded.  In the case of appeals under the Video Recordings Act, 1989, in respect of video films, the requirement is that the appellant pay such fee as may be prescribed with no provision for repayment of that fee.</P>
    <P>If those provisions of the Acts of 1923 and 1989 are allowed to stand further anomalies will exist in that the fee for an appeal in the case of a video could reflect modern day values while the corresponding fee for a cinema film will be set at a limit of £5 and, while this fee may be refunded if the appeal is successful, such is not the case in an appeal involving a video.</P>
    <P>What I now propose in the Bill is to regularise the matter by leaving the amounts of the fee in respect of appeals in both cases to be fixed by regulation but to provide that the fees to be paid by the appellant in the case of either a video or a film should be repaid if the appeal is successful.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Bill in relation to the appointment of assistant censors are essential to the implementation of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, that is, the examination and classification or prohibition of all new video films intended for release and the systematic examination of all video films currently on the <Col N="1828" /> market.  I would hope, therefore, that I will have the support of this House for the measures proposed.  I look forward to an open and informative debate on the proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure Members of the House that I will give careful consideration to all views expressed in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the allocation of extra resources and the appointment of assistant censors to the Film Censor's Office.  Its objective is to deal with violence and pornography which degrades human life.  Our approach to censorship, however, should be put in context.  Many of us remember a time when there was an unhealthy approach to censorship.  Not alone did it deal with the banning of books and films but it also extended to people not being allowed to speak at meetings in universities because their political views offended the Establishment. They were regarded as being dangerous in some way.  By and large, our moves towards a much more liberal regime have been handled with great common sense and sensitivity over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people are capable of handling the freedom which the absence of a severe form of censorship implies.  We must be vigilant to see that censorship is not abused, that it is not interfering with our basic rights of freedom.  It is interesting to note that in 1990 the Film Censor's annual report showed that 314 films were presented to the censor, none was banned and three &mdash; less than I per cent &mdash; were cut; 138 films were issued with limited certificates &mdash; 22 films for under 12 year olds with an adult, 51 films for over 15 year olds, 21 films for over 16 year olds and 42 films for over 18 year olds; two films were allowed for limited viewing with cuts &mdash; one for over 15 year olds and one for over 18 year olds; three films were referred to the Appeals Board by the distributors and in all three, the decisions to make the cuts were upheld. In the case of limited certificates issued, <Col N="1829" /> three films were also appealed and one was issued with a revised certificate by the Appeals Board.  According to the Minister's statement since last July, 71 video films were banned and no film was banned in 1990 for a full year.  This shows how different the film industry is from the video industry in its approach to pornography and violence.</P>
    <P>The availability of films and videos featuring explicit scenes of sex and violence is outside the area I have just spoken about.  We must be extremely concerned at the way in which video nasties depict women in a degrading and dehumanising way.  They portray women frequently at the receiving end of the most brutal and sadistic treatment.  While we must be liberal and allow adults to view what they decide to view, we must also accept that living in a civilised society demands standards and taking certain stands.  We must remove the objectionable and revolting film and video material from circulation in order that its evil influence will be removed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, 1992, the purpose of which is to provide for the appointment of assistant censors to assist the official censor of films in the performance of his function in relation to the censorship of cinema films and video works.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that such legislation is necessary in our society.  It is very sad that there is such exploitation of young people and that there are available video nasties and pornographic and violent films which exploit women and show depraved sex and violence.  These are a very big money spinner and are a problem in western society generally.  The fact that we must have assistant censors highlights the rapid increase over the last number of years in the availability of video nasties which have created many massive social problems within our communities. The availability of such videos depicting unrestained violence, sexual abuse, mutilation and murder is of extreme public concern.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the amount of video equipment purchased.  As most outlets rent <Col N="1830" /> rather than sell video cassettes it is easy for young people to obtain and play video material.  It is difficult to control that. There are thousands of titles available and the number is being added to by about 1,000 per annum.  There is no problem with most of these but some of them are thoroughly objectionable.  The objectionable films and videos are totally uninhibited in their depiction of violence and they are also realistic.  This must have an effect on impressionable minds not only for young people but also those of more mature years.  It is accepted now that they can have an adverse effect on viewers and can result in crimes against innocent people.  They also tend to create a general tolerance of what should be unacceptable in society.</P>
    <P>If people continue to see violent videos they will regard the type of material shown as the norm.  This will lead to increased violence against people and it is our duty as a State to ensure that this does not happen.  Pornographic films are totally objectionable.  They are degrading to human nature generally, particularly to women.  We cannot ignore the fact that there is a heavy responsibility on parents where there are young teenagers or even younger than teenagers involved in viewing such material.  The work of the censor of films does not take away the onus on parents to be aware of what kind of videos their young people are watching.</P>
    <P>There are those who will say that censorship of films and videos is an unwarranted interference with people's freedom to watch what they like in their homes.  While we do not want to be over-restrictive as a society we must accept that there comes a point when the freedom of individuals must be controlled for the good of everybody.  There is a need to protect the public from the effects of witnessing scenes such as those portrayed in some of the video nasties available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The primary duty to protect children and young persons rests with the parents and/or guardians or adults having responsibility for young people.  It is not practical to expect the Censor's Office to deal with all our problems and the censor <Col N="1831" /> cannot be expected to take over the role of the parent and guardian every time a problem of this nature arises.  It is important, however, that the censor and his assistants help in any way they can the parents and guardians of children in their difficult task in today's world.</P>
    <P>There are many people who believe that there should be no State control and people should have complete freedom. Other people believe that standards should be imposed.  There is no doubt that many people involved in the video business are clear about the fact that they are in the business to make money and that it is up to people themselves to decide what standards they want.  Such a situation is very dangerous if it is not controlled.</P>
    <P>As a society we must decide for ourselves what standards we set.  Just because something is available in another country does not mean it should be available in Ireland.  In other countries where there is a lack of such controls the level of violence is out of control and society is totally breaking down.  There comes a time when the State must intervene because of the greed of some individuals who disregard their responsibility in order to make as much money as they can.</P>
    <P>Censorship creates the danger and the environment for the black market for video nasties and pornographic films.  We must do all in our power to prevent this situation arising.  In addition to the film and video problem, we have, of course, satellite television available in an ever increasing number of homes.  There is no point in having a film censor or a video censor who controls either the video or film business while, at the same time, films or videos which have been banned here are readily available on our television screens.  Some agreement should be sought with our European partners in order to decide how to tackle this problem.  It is important that the Minister looks seriously at the situation and reports back to us at the earliest possible opportunity as to whether there is a possibility of obtaining agreement with our <Col N="1832" /> European partners on this matter.  This is important before our laws become totally farcical in this area.</P>
    <P>The availability on our screens of videos or films showing obscenities or violence will bring our censorship laws into disrepute.  European controls are necessary and these controls will become more urgent after I January 1993 when the Single European Act comes into force.  The objective of this is to have free movement of people and goods throughout the European Community.  This will facilitate the importation of violent pornographic films and material.  This must not happen and I would ask the Minister to inform the House of the plans of the Government to control the situation.  It is important that we do so.</P>
    <P>The legitimate video industry employs about 2,000 people and has an annual turnover in excess of £30 million.  It is estimated that the illegal pirate trade has a turnover of approximately half this amount and does not pay VAT or PRSI to the Exchequer.  There is an urgent need to deal with the problem of piracy in the video industry.  Most violent and pornographic videos come from the illegal pirate trade.  We must control and eliminate the illegal pirate video trade and I would ask the Minister what his plans are for doing so.  People in the illegal piracy areas have no concern about standards; they are only interested in making money.  The outcome of their work must be controlled just as crime and violence against the person is controlled.</P>
    <P>In the overall context I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for introducing the Bill in this House.  Like the Bill before us today, the Video Recordings Bill, 1987, was initiated in the Seanad.  Despite being interrupted by a general election, it eventually passed through the Oireachtas to become the Video Recordings Act, 1989.  During its passage through both Houses it received a very thorough and detailed examination.  The debate was very constructive.  From the outset, the Minister made it clear that he was open <Col N="1833" /> and willing to consider amendments which would improve the legislation and I welcome the fact that the Minister who is here with us today has stated that he will listen very carefully to any suggestions or proposals made during this debate.</P>
      <P>There was a general welcome for the Video Recordings Bill from all parties and from all Members who contributed to the debate.  Everyone was agreed that legislation was vitally necessary to control and regulate the sale and the supply of video recordings.  In 1987 video outlets were springing up all over the place and video films could be purchased or hired in every town and village throughout the country, and almost every town and village had at least one video shop.  There was widespread concern at the wide availability of pornographic and violent videos, or video nasties as they came to be known.  Many Members of both Houses referred to the fact that parents, teachers and community leaders were extremely concerned at the kind of obscene material that was available without restriction to children and to young people.  Everyone agreed that the situation needed to be controlled and the Bill which was to become the Video Recordings Act, 1989, was regarded as very desirable and very necessary.</P>
      <P>Since it was passed, the Act is being brought into operation by degrees.  Even though it is being phased in, it would appear that it has already proved to be very effective legislation.  There are far fewer complaints now than there were about the availability of so called video nasties.  Indeed, the problem would appear to have been eliminated to a great extent and it would appear that many such video films which were in circulation at the time that the Bill was passed have been withdrawn.  If this is so, it is a very welcome development and consequence of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1989 Act provides that as a general rule video films which are available to the public have to be certified and classified by the official censor and that video outlets must be licensed.  A video film must be classified as being fit for viewing by <Col N="1834" /> persons generally, or being fit for viewing by persons generally but in the case of a child under 12 years of age only in the company of a responsible adult, or fit for viewing by persons aged 15 years or more or fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more.  Each video passed by the censor will have to be labelled to show the class to which it belongs.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for the making of prohibition orders in the case of those videos which the official censor considers to be unfit for viewing and there are four grounds on which a prohibition order may be made: first, if the video were likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection; second, if the video were likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere because of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation; third, if the video tended, by reason of the inclusion in it of obscene or indecent material, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it; and fourth, a prohibition order is issued if the video film depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty, including mutilation or torture towards humans or animals.  The censor then is obliged to keep a register of certified video works and a register of prohibited video works and severe penalties are provided in the Act for any person found guilty of supplying or distributing a video work in respect of which a prohibition order is in force.</P>
    <P>When the 1989 legislation was being debated, there was a general recognition that it would be some time before the situation would be reached when every video film available for sale, hire or supply would be certified and labelled. The Bill before us today is another step towards achieving that goal.  It was pointed out that there were thousands of video films already in circulation and it was estimated that approximately 1,000 new titles were coming on the market each year.  The Minister today outlined the current situation.  He pointed out that <Col N="1835" /> it is estimated that there are 12,000-15,000 video films already on the market which will have to be examined and approximately 1,000 new titles coming on the market each year.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that the legislation would have to be phased in and the three stages decided on were: first, that prohibition orders would be made in respect of some unacceptable video films which were already on the market and in circulation; second, a date would be fixed after which all new video films would have to receive a certificate from the censor and a date would be fixed after which all video outlets would have to be licensed; and third, the fixing of a date by which all video films in circulation would have to be labelled.</P>
    <P>It was obvious to everybody when that legislation was going through the Oireachtas that the official censor would not be able to deal with that volume of work on his own and that additional staff would be required.  This Bill provides mainly for the additional staff which will be required.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the appointment of assistant censors. These assistant censors will assist the official censor of films in the performance of his functions in the censorship of cinema films and video works. The only question I would ask is why is this legislation necessary?  In the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Video Recordings Bill in 1987 there was no indication that such legislation would be necessary.  The explanatory memorandum simply stated:</P>
    <P>Any additional personnel required under the Bill will be attached to the office of the Official Censor of Films and will be provided by way of redeployment from existing staffing resources.  It is estimated that four additional administrative and clerical staff will be required as well as three Assistant Censors or their equivalent employed on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>Then the explanatory memorandum went on to give an indication of the <Col N="1836" /> additional expenditure which would be required.  As I said, there was no indication that new legislation would be necessary for the appointment of the assistant censors and perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, might indicate why such legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>However, if the legislation is necessary, and I assume it is when it is before the House, I welcome it because it will expedite the situation we all want to see in place where every video film which is available for viewing will be labelled and that label will show the classification that has been given to that film by the censor. Some people have reservations about censorship.  I have none and I believe that in recent years particularly, censorship in the case of films and publications has worked well.  The Censorship of Films Act and the Censorship of Publications Act are legislation that this country would be much worse off without.  The argument is often advanced that censorship impinges on the freedom of the individual but I believe that the general good must take precedence at all times and that material which is likely to deprave or corrupt should be censored and should not be available generally.  Of its nature, censorship had to be subjective to some extent, but I welcome the statement in the Minister's speech that every effort will be made to ensure that the censorship will be applied in a consistent way.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an even number of male and female assistant censors appointed.  I know the Minister will be sympathetically disposed to accepting that suggestion because situations will arise when an assistant censor may feel that a second opinion would be helpful. If a particular video film were viewed by a male and female censor, you would get a very objective asssessment of that film.</P>
    <P>As Senator Neville pointed out, in the case of children the parents will always continue to be the best censors.  In this day and age parents have to very vigilant in relation to what their children see, read and hear and there is a great onus on them to monitor what their children view both on television and video and to <Col N="1837" /> advise and guide them on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.  Children and young people will be much more influenced by the advice and guidance they get from their parents than from other sources.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the fact that satellite television is widely available and that crime, violence, sex and murder are shown in many different programmes. There is no question but that what people view on television can influence their attitudes, values and conduct.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this legislation is passed, and when the Video Recordings Act is finally in operation, there will be very strict policing of video outlets.  As Senator Neville said, there will always be the law breakers, those who are engaged in video piracy and those who, because of the fast buck mentality will never be completely eliminated from society; there will always be those who will stock prohibited materials.  I hope that situation would be strictly policed and that no leniency would be shown towards individuals who flout the law.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill there is an obligation on the Official Censor to publish a list of banned videos.  I happened to see in yesterday's <i>Evening Press</i> a report on the front page of the censor having banned 17 more videos.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>Seventeen video films have been banned by Official Film Censor Sheamus Smith because in his opinion they would tend to &ldquo;deprave or corrupt&rdquo; people viewing them.</P>
    <P>The latest prohibition orders under the Video Recordings Act, 1989, follow a number of bans announced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The report then went on to give the titles of some of the 17 video films referred to in the report.  I wonder about the wisdom of allowing the titles of such films to be published so widely because that kind of publicity can generate a demand for these particular films and if there is a demand for anything there is always somebody willing and ready to supply that demand if the price is right.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1838" /> might have a look at this.  I know the censor will have to maintain a register of prohibited works, but how widely the titles listed in that register should be published is a matter that the Minister might have examined.  Perhaps there should be some restriction to the extent to which the titles should be publicised.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I know it will have a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues, Senator Neville and Senator Mullooly, will forgive me if I say that at times their tones reminded me of the mercifully faroff days when I had to suffer Redemptorists in my parish chapel in Macroom. Admittedly, their tone was only mildly Redemptorist &mdash; it was the nice Redemptorist who softened you up for the other man.  I do not doubt the sincerity of their high moral tone; I am not for a moment suggesting it is hypocritical, but for me it really struck a chill into my heart when I heard Senator Mullooly hoping that there would be strict policing involved.  I thought we had got away from a lot of that mentality, but it seems to me it has surfaced very much again this morning.</P>
      <P>Whatever reservations I have about the Bill &mdash; and I have a distinct lack of enthusiasm for any Bill which offers more and better censorship &mdash; nonetheless I accept that Seanad Éireann is the proper forum in which to introduce it.  I think it falls into the category of those legislative matters which are best dealt with by Seanad Éireann and receive a very good scrutiny in Seanad Éireann.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Bill has been initiated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another very appropriate context in which to place this Bill, another reason it is appropriate that it should be brought into Seanad Éireann. It was in this House in 1942 &mdash; and it is no harm to remind ourselves of this from time to time &mdash; that there took place a notorious debate on the Censorship of Publications Act which mainly centred around a recent publication of an utterly innocuous and quite charming book, the ruminations of a homespun <Col N="1839" /> philosopher, <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  Yet, that book was the subject of the most ponderous moralising in this House in which the majority of the Members, I regret to say, shared and in which the name of Sir John Keane must be quoted as an honourable exception.</P>
    <P>On that occasion &mdash; and Members may refresh themselves as to what was said then by looking at Vol. 27 of the Seanad Official Report of the debate, which commenced on 18 November 1942 &mdash; Sir John Keane read quotations from <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> into the record of the House. Incredibly from our point of view 50 years on, those quotations were censored by the Cathaoirleach, as far as I can see, because when the report appeared at the next day's sitting when the debate was resumed the report simply read &ldquo;At this point Sir John Keane quoted from the book&rdquo; and that was it.  Seanad Éireann was able to exercise its own censorship on that occasion; and indeed that it no credit to this House.  It is salutary to remind ourselves that this House was guilty of one of the most fatuous examples of censorship in the long and dreary history of that institution.</P>
    <P>For those who have not read the <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> let me assure them that it was a most innocuous and charming book; yet it was described as containing the vilest obscenity.  The great fear of people like Professor William McGuinness was that if the excerpts were allowed stand in the Official Report the people of Ireland would be totally corrupted by references to the activities of farmyard animals described in the most innocuous way.  It is no wonder then that Sir John Keane suggested to the House it was part of what he called &ldquo;Literary Gestapo&rdquo;, which I think is a very good phrase to coin for that particular establishment at that time.  As it was, the Official Report while not even containing the offending excerpts from the censored book, was a best seller.  It was about the only time in the history of this House that its Official Report was widely purchased by the curious public outside.  That is a <Col N="1840" /> context into which we should put today's debate as well.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts about the wisdom of any legislation which shores up the existing system.  The Bill shows an unfortunate sense of timing, coming before us as it does within the octave of a latter-day piece of fatuous State activity, because whenever censorship is concerned the State makes as ass of itself.  With respect to my two previous colleagues, this is the main criticism I would make of their contributions.  They assume that somehow it is proper for the State to act as a censor of morals.  The State has been notoriously hamfisted in doing so over the years and there is proof in plenty of that when you read the unbelievable list of distinguished figures banned by our Censorship Board in times gone by.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill shows an unfortunate sense of timing, coming as it does in the octave of the banning of <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper, demonstrating once again what folly it is for the State to posture as the guardian of our morals.  What hypocrisies it causes, what confusion if causes. Fortunately, the days of the Seanad debate on <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> are long behind us.</P>
    <P>However &mdash; and here I must differ very much from Senator Mullooly who on the whole accepts censorship as a good thing; I regard censorship as at best a necessary evil in particular cases &mdash; but there is in our society, and it is reflected in the speeches previously made, a lingering paternalism displayed by the Church and State, the mentality that certain people know best.  It is never quite explained, by the way, why the official censor and the new assistant censors to be appointed under this legislation know best.  Why do they know better than me about what to censor and what not to censor?  What special dispensation have they to discern what can be injurious to the public morality and public order?  Who appoints them?  Who safeguards them in their decisions?  As the old maxim goes, <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i> and it is very true in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I deplore that mentality of lingering paternalism that we are all children to <Col N="1841" /> be protected by wiser and more inspired leaders in Church and State.  I suggest that our history has been deplorable in showing up the inadequacies of that mentality, because people have to make their own decisions.  I agree that minors have to have decisions made for them and that it would be foolish to question the central role of the parents in this matter, as indeed Senator Neville and Senator Mullooly mentioned, but where grown people are concerned, I suggest that it is backwardness and reaction in every sense to try to stop them making their own moral decisions.  That applies to everything &mdash; to reading books, looking at videos, deciding whether to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in referenda, etc.  We have been kept far too long in that state of childhood.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, as far as censorship is concerned the heaviest of the repressive machinery is gone, but the mentality lingers on.  I have to say that, regrettably, in addition to the old paternalism there is some evidence of a new maternalism, some evidence that in a section of the feminist movement there is a tendency towards a bizarre alliance between new feminists and old paternalists, between the professional Catholic moralisers and a rather prim type of feminist who wants the old puritanism imposed for new feminist reasons.</P>
    <P>I take the point, of course, that there is a kind of pornography which is degrading to women; indeed, one might say that most pornography is degrading to women.  However, the answer to that problem is not through censorship but through the mature moral decisions of people to discourage that market.  I do not accept that you need censorship and that it is good in any situation to revert to the old censorship.  I hope that to the extent that feminists have lent themselves to the old paternalistic purposes they will cease to do so and that they too will recognise that the prohibition of pornography is in the end a matter of personal responsibility.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Minister's speech, it is based of course on the Video Recordings Act, 1989.  The legislation is there and as <Col N="1842" /> long as the legislation is there it is only sensible, I suppose, to try to make it work.  I was not in the Chamber for that debate, I do not recall taking part in it but I am beginning to wonder if that Act is already out of date.  Is the business of trying to stop pornographic videos by censorship really an attempt to turn back the tide?</P>
    <P>Incidentally, there was no reference in the Minister's speech or in the Bill to the qualifications which these new censors must have.  I would like to know what kind of people will occupy part time positions? Is there a provision, for example, that women should be appointed in at least equal numbers to men?  I would fully support that view because I think women have a greater sense, less prudery, a greater maturity, a greater earthiness, if you like, combined with commonsense when it comes to matters of this kind.  I would like to know who these people are, what are the job specifications, and in his reply I hope the Minister will give us an indication of that.</P>
    <P>When I read about thousands of videos having to be censored I find it very depressing &mdash; all that drudgery to achieve what end; because it seems to me, as I said, that it goes against the tide in the satellite age.  Senator Neville referred to the availability of porn, in various degrees of softness or hardness, on television. There is one channel available in Cork which is, I understand, extremely popular on Saturday nights.  It is a German satellite which carries pornography &mdash; soft pom as it is called &mdash; from about 10 p.m. to 2 o'clock in the morning.</P>

      <P>Is it good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss these matters with Senator Mooney in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to believe that Senator Neville is serious when he says that the answer to this problem of satellite pornography is to do something about it in Europe.  I agree it is serious, but does Senator Neville think our European partners are going to gravely and sagely nod their heads and say &ldquo;Of course <Col N="1843" /> you Irish are morally superior.  We are post-Christian degenerates in Europe. We are very sorry, we will mend our ways and we too will introduce censorship all round?&rdquo; That is the implication of what the Senator is suggesting, and of course it is totally absurd.  What makes it even more absurd is that, in addition to the non-stopability of satellite television, from 1 January 1993 we are to have the virtual disappearance of customs officers. Apart from what is coming through the satellite and the dish and so on, what is the point in censoring videos when people will be able to walk in with them, as they are now, because, for the most part, customs scrutiny has become nominal in recent years and, as I understand it, from I January 1993 will disappear totally.</P>
    <P>If we try to decide ourselves that we can establish a pornography free zone in Ireland, we really are compounding the old self-delusion that this is an island of saints.  We do it all the time of course, the whole nonsense about saying it is all right if 5,000 women have abortions in England so long as they do not have them here, so long as they do not pollute our soil.  We have exactly the same mentality here; it applies all round.  It applied long ago to the riots in the Abbey, when people found the mention of shifts in Synge's play <i>The Playboy</i> and the presence of a prostitute in Sean O'Casey's <i>The Plough and the Stars</i> totally unacceptable because it was in Ireland; but in an English music hall, of course, it would be quite all right.</P>
    <P>We are the victims of this self-delusion of superiority.  We really should grow up if we are thinking we can convert our European partners to our point of view. Censorship is contrary to the spirit of the European Community.  Just as protection is in the economic sphere, so also the idea of trying to stop free traffic in goods, including films of various kinds, is totally contrary to the spirit of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I would also question whether the availability of pornography &mdash; I am not so sure about films which depict extreme <Col N="1844" /> and repellant violence &mdash; does really corrupt public morals.  The State should not be concerned about this; the State should be concerned about whether pornography corrupts public order &mdash; and that is a different matter &mdash; whether it contributes to more social mayhem, violence, murder, rape, etc.  That is certainly the State's business, but what is the evidence? I have not done any great research on this, but a top off the head reflection is this.  Denmark and Holland, two of our degenerate, pagan, immoral European partners, have widespread pornography available, yet they are, as far as I can judge, the most ordered of societies.  Conversely, despite the attempt we make here to erect all kinds of shields around ourselves in this island, our level of behaviour in terms of rape and violence is no better than anybody else's because human nature, irrespective of outside stimuli, is a constant phenomenon in its behaviour.  So I doubt very much that you can talk about society breaking down where these things are available.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the black market and pirate videos and so on. Surely the black market is a direct consequence of censorship?  There is no need for a black market where the law does not prohibit films of this nature.</P>
    <P>I have no enthusiasm for this Bill.  I do not know that any useful purpose will be served by a number of people working behind closed doors with thousands of dreary and inferior films.  Who is going to be better off that way?  Incidentially, I think one of the rather fatuous activities is classifying the videos for home consumption. Are we seriously expecting parents to tell their children they will have to leave the room because the film is for people over 18 or over 15.  The idea of applying that kind of standard to a domestic atmosphere boggles the mind. I wonder what criterion will the censors apply to the different categories.  They might follow the rather facetious rule which, I understand, was observed in Hollywood at one stage.  In the films for general viewing, the hero gets the girl; <Col N="1845" /> over 15, the villain gets the girl; and over 18 everybody gets the girl.</P>

      <P>I will not go into other variations, Senator Norris, but I find it hard to believe that this kind of categorisation can be effectively introduced to the domestic sitting room.  I have no enthusiasm for this Bill.  I will not challenge a division on it, but I do think that people could be better employed.</P>

      <P>As usual with my friend and colleague, Senator Murphy, his elucidation and defence of sometimes the indefensible is breathtaking and most impressive.  I say &ldquo;the indefensible&rdquo; because, despite everything Senator Murphy said &mdash; and I single him out mainly because I think he would reflect a view in this country and in Europe generally that there should be no barriers at all, that censorship is inherently unstable and indefensible &mdash; I would pose the questions: what is the alternative? Are we to have a society in which there is no moral order, where there is no code of behaviour, where there is no acceptable or unacceptable level of behaviour? My personal view is that I am against censorship in principle but I am very much for protection of the innocent.  I believe that where the State intervenes with legislation of this type, even in places like Denmark and Holland, there is a genuine desire to ensure that, while you have a liberal, open society, you also protect those whose minds are being formed and who are obviously strongly influenced by the visual image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old cliché in the newspaper business that one picture is worth a thousand words, that the impact of a photograph or of a visual image has an immediacy about it which the written word does not.  Perhaps I could briefly refer to a film I saw in this city last evening &mdash;&ldquo;Basic Instinct&rdquo;.  It stars one of Hollywood's leading actors, Michael Douglas. I am a great cinemagoer, and I know <Col N="1846" /> that the Minister of State present is also a great fan of the cinema, but despite the fact that this extremely well put together production is visually very impressive &mdash; it has a panoramic sweep of the San Francisco Bay area &mdash; this movie is nothing more than unadulterated pornography.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite right, it indicates market forces.  It shows what happens &mdash; I know I am going down a dangerous road here &mdash; when there is untramelled access and when people identify something as pornography.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris will be delighted to hear this but I have no difficulty with what adults do in private, but I do have a difficulty with certain films in the public arena, despite the classifications &mdash; and this particular film is classified as adult and over 18.  However, a difficulty arises because of the proliferation of videos over the last decade.  I have no doubt that &ldquo;Basic Instinct&rdquo; will be appearing on video in the not too distant future and it will be available freely throughout the stores in this country.</P>
      <P>I like to class myself as being open-minded and liberal.  Since I lived outside this country in my formative years and this had a very strong influence on me &mdash; and Senator Murphy mentioned the early days of the State &mdash; I cannot be accused of being, as a young Catholic Irishman, coralled and not seeing the other point of view.  I like to think that I had an open upbringing and that my overseas experience has helped me to come to conclusions about life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am attempting to make in singling out this particular movie is that much of what takes place is a graphic portrayal of explicit sexual acts &mdash; all in wide screen and full living colour &mdash;<Col N="1847" /> which in my opinion had very little to do with the story line, which is quite a good story.  It is a thriller.  Essentially, I went to it because it had a good story line; it is a good murder mystery.</P>
    <P>I was amazed &mdash; and not because it was in Dublin; I would have had a similar reaction had it been in New York &mdash; that into the mainstream cinema has now come the type of graphic sexual detail I thought had been reserved for adult only videos or the type of thing you would watch behind closed doors.  It is precisely that type of movie that legislation of this kind should deal with.  What will happen with that movie when it comes out on video?  When the new censors come to look at it will they be presented by the film distributors with an edited version, or will they be given the full cinema version on the basis that since it had been shown in the public cinema, why should they present an abridged version?</P>
    <P>I am only using that film as an example. I believe that movies of this type are increasingly becoming the norm and there is a need to have some form of policing &mdash; not for me, not for the adults in the Savoy Cinema last night, but for young minds who might be attracted to that movie by the stars who feature in it or because of the storyline and half-way through will be plunged suddenly into a world of soft porn.  I believe there is a will in the EC not confined to Ireland to ensure there is not censorship which is an emotive word to use but a system of checks and balances.  I am not going to criticise Dutch or Danish society.  I have been in both countries and I have to say that Ireland, warts and all, has less social upheaval and, relatively speaking, fewer sexual crimes than in either of those countries.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris may call it hypocrisy but I call it having a responsible attitude towards those who must be protected. I am talking about young minds. All of my contribution is directed towards those in their formative years who, and I am reluctant to admit it, need some form of guidance because older people are more aware.  We live in quite an evil world where we need checks and balances. Some societies that have reduced these checks and balances have spawned a type of entrepreneur who, given any chink in the law, will immediately move to exploit it and could not care less as long as he or she is making a dollar.  It does not only apply to censorship but to a range of laws.  It applies to the availability of drugs.  Surely all Senators must accept that society has to be built on certain basic premises, that we need a consensus on what is not acceptable behaviour.  In that context legislation of this nature is vital.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the assistant censors.  As the Minister has pointed out, thousands of videos are coming through.  I agree with Senator Murphy that I do not know how they are going to decide rationally on what is suitable for viewing by the rest of us.  They will perform an important function and being human beings, they will make mistakes.  No Department could draw up the criteria to decide on who was most qualified to decide on what is acceptable.  The principle behind the legislation is to provide some form of checks and balances.  The people who will be put in charge of this area will try to do the as best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of society Senator Murphy talked about is dead and gone, thank God.  It was not only unique to Ireland. He talked about the reference to the <Col N="1849" /> word &ldquo;shift&rdquo;.  It was not long before that and it may have been at the same time, that people throughout Europe covered piano legs with fabric because they were considered obscene.  Times, fashions and trends change.  It is not relevant to compare what pertained 50 years ago with today's modes or attitudes.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of this Bill. Even though I am not in favour of censorship <i>per se</i>, I accept that we must have some form of social checks and balances. I know that Senator Norris is straining at the leash and far be it from me to prevent him form getting on his hind legs and criticising all I have said.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have a lukewarm welcome for the Bill.  I share many of the reservations expressed by Senator Murphy in relation to our censorship history and I refer to the manner in which we established the Censorship of Films Board in 1923.  It is a considerable irony that in 1923 when we were in the middle of a civil war following the establishment of the new State we should find time to produce relatively extensive legislation to ban and censor in order to protect public morals.  We were establishing ourselves as a free State and one of our first acts of independence was to draw a curtain around that free State to protect it from certain types of information.  If we look at the definition of censorship in the Act the Minister will agree that it is vague and could be interpreted as a dislike for any graphic treatment of sexual practice and a certain prudity in relation to behavioural details rather than as a real concern for the quality of society.  I will go into that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Murphy indicated, we have had an unfortunate tradition and history of the enforcement of censorship, particularly in relation to literary works.  We are an extremely prolific nation with a large number of world renowned authors but virtually all of our distinguished writers have come within the ambit of the censor and have had their books banned at one time or another.  When we look <Col N="1850" /> back at instances of banning in later years we wonder what the hubbub was about and how it reached the proportions it did. Of course, many writers said that getting a book banned was valuable free publicity and ensured that sales went up around the world and under the counter at home in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have a particularly bad reputation for the exercise of censorship.  It seems to have been informed by petty, puerile, prudish considerations in many cases.  I know the Minister will probably agree with what I say and would not wish us to continue down that road.  It is important to raise these issues because they refer to our self image, to how we perceive ourselves as a nation.  We have had from the foundation of the State a certain chauvinistic belief that the Gaels were in some way superior to outsiders.  The State came into existence in an atmosphere of triumphalism.  It was a form of self-delusion from which we have never recovered.  We are continually seeking to put a wall around the island as if this little island out in the Atlantic must be preserved in all its authentic purity and Gaelic goodness.  We regard our tradition and history as wonderful with no warts at all.  We believe that certain things do not happen in Ireland so, therefore, we do not need legislation to regulate them.</P>
    <P>There has been a strong Jansenist religious input into our censorship history which is sustained by clerical authority which images private and public morality largely in sexual terms.  That tendency has had a malignant influence on the manner in which we perceive private and public morality and Irish legislation has reflected this to our disadvantage as an adult State and society.  That is the baggage we bring with us to this debate.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have found ourselves questioning rights to information about fundamental entitlements.  We saw it most recently in the interpretation by the High Court, and subsequently by the Supreme Court, of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, even though it was an <i>obiter dicta</i> that certain information must be withheld that might lead <Col N="1851" /> to the procurement of abortion.  We got ourselves into a dicey situation by introducing that amendment and not making regulations as to how it would operate.  I do not want to go into the background of the amendment which has placed us in the ludicrous position where one section of the population enjoy rights to travel refused on gender grounds to another section.  If we go back into our history we will find the roots of that situation.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely painting in the background to the censorship legislation before us and it is my last point in that respect.  We ban people from a particular channel of communication when it may be preferable to take a regulatory position rather than impose an outright ban.  We tread on delicate ground in our interpretation of public morality and freedom of expression.  The broadcasting medium covered by section 31 of the Broadcasting Act is a State medium and is subject to State controls which should devise appropriate means of processing information and not impose a total ban on certain speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to look at the definition in section 7 (2) of this Bill of what the censor is to look for.  A certificate is granted by the official censor &ldquo;unless he is of opinion that such picture or some part thereof is unfit for general exhibition in public by reason of its being indecent, obscene or blasphemous or because the exhibition thereof in public would tend to inculcate principles contrary to public morality or would be otherwise subversive of public morality&rdquo;.  The Minister will agree that the definition is vague and wideranging.  The censor has the power to act on his opinion without even a proviso that it be a reasonable opinion. His power extends from relatively specific areas of concern to something as broad as &ldquo;or would be otherwise subversive <Col N="1852" /> of public morality&rdquo;.  In other words, there are no parameters to what the opinion of the censor can determine. We all know that opinions change dramatically, not only from decade to decade, but from year to year.  A week is a long time in politics and in the present circumstances we seem to change our views quite dramatically within a short space of time.  An opinion held by someone ten years ago may be quite different now.</P>
    <P>Legislation that is framed so broadly is open to abuse.  The Minister will appoint the censor and the assistant censors. These ladies and gentlemen will have within their remit power of decision as to whether a video or film is fit for viewing by the Irish people.  The mechanism of appointment is flawed if the Minister makes the appointment.  The definition as to how censors will operate within their area of responsibility is also flawed.  The criteria for decision making are flawed in that they rest on the opinion of the authorised person.  It is unsatisfactory legislation and it is not good enough to express provisions in those terms.  The least the Minister could do, seeing that we are in the process of introducing amendments which recommend mostly the addition of extra censors to the list is to extend the criteria and definitions here to match those in the video recordings legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the workload of the assistant censors will be largely in the area of video recordings.  The video recordings legislation contains clearer parameters than those specified here and includes some of the same provisions. One shared provision is that the official censor will view the material first to determine whether it would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection and, secondly, in an enlightened provision to determine if it would be likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or <Col N="1853" /> national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>That is a more specific type of approach.  In the first instance it focuses on crimes that could be committed, not on a question of opinion as to whether something is indecent or otherwise.  Secondly, it focuses on the question of racism against minorities or against particular groups in society, an area we should focus on much more.  It spoils it all, however, with the last concern, &ldquo;lest the material would tend by reason of the inclusion in it of obscene or indecent matter to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it&rdquo;.  It gets loose towards the end with questionable effect.  At least the Video Recordings Act has attempted to be specific about the categories in which censorship should be permitted.  While the official censor is appointed by the Minister with narrow terms of reference and the power to express his opinion as to the suitability of videos or films, then we are going to encourage complaints and risk of abuse of the power to determine what should be banned and so on.</P>
    <P>The Appeals Board is the second arm of the censorship mechanism and I place the same question mark around its operation. The appeals mechanism, as I understand it, takes place at the behest of the Minister who appoints the members of the commission or of the Appeals Board.  Consequently we are coming very close to allowing an appointed person to be the judge in their own case since the Minister is the appointing authority throughout.  We need a more independent approach.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether it is proper to have an Appeals Board or censor established by the Minister?  It is not properly a judicial function?  Is it constitutional that somebody appointed in this fashion should exercise the equivalent of a judicial function?  It is a judicial process that should properly be exercised in the courts.</P>
    <P>Secondly, is it proper that a decision should be taken in advance?  The normal procedure is that something is presented and in the absence of a complaint is not removed.  From the Minister's statement <Col N="1854" /> here it appears that what the assistant censors will be doing is looking at the films already in circulation.  It will not be a prior examination but a <i>post factum</i> one.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his concluding remarks to reveal whether he feels that we are adhering to section 34 of the Constitution which vests judicial process and judicial powers in the courts. We are giving a large body or powers to the official censor who must merely express an opinion and we are giving considerable powers to an Appeals Board which is also appointed by the Minister, thereby ensuring that no independent process is observed in the examination of videos or films that come into the State.  We are talking about an industry and about livelihoods and about due process of law taking place in this State.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Mooney's concerns about some of our neighbours who have gone down the road of debauchery by legislating for certain matters that we seem more anxious to prevent rather than to regulate.  I do not know of any statistics that would prove the moral environment in this country is better than in any of the other EC member state.  This is a complex issue.  There is no doubt that we have a culture of violence on this island.  Violence is counter-productive and contrary to public and private morality and no other EC member state has a similar history of violence to Ireland.  In terms of sexual morality there is no doubt that we are obsessed with it and that obsession is evident in our attitude towards books and films and video recordings.</P>
    <P>Lastly, this legislation obliges us to depend on the opinion of an individual person as to suitable mores for our society.  Recently a film came before our censors which did not depict graphic sexual activity but which contained strong feminist message and it seems that the decision taken to ban that film was largely on the basis of what was perceived as a feminist attack on macho attitudes. The opinion of a film censor may reflect the time warp that person occupies and may not reflect the changing cultural mores of society.  The Minister should <Col N="1855" /> address the manner in which we conduct our business in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill.  I will not call a vote on it because I think it would be useless, but I would like my opposition to this Bill in principle to be noted by the House.  This is despite the fact that I spoke on the video Bill and managed to get inserted some of the clauses to which my colleague Senator Costello referred &mdash; the clauses extending the provisions of that Bill to take into account the travelling community and the gay community.  I did this although at the time I also expressed my reservations because I am in principle opposed to censorship.</P>
      <P>I do not have to go into the historical accounts given by Senator Murphy to remind Senators that this House was disgracefully involved in the saga of the <i>Tailor and Ansty</i>, the tale of Timothy Buckley of Gouganebarra, whose innocent book which reflects the reality of country life in Ireland, was excoriated in this House.  The record of the proceedings of the Seanad was removed and mutilated on the pretext that the citizens of Ireland might go out and buy it in large quantities with the intention of self-pollution and corruption.  It was a laughable concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a disgraceful history in terms of censorship.  This is linked with hypocrisy. I listened with wry amusement to Senator Mooney's fatuous self-congratulation about the moral standards of this country and the comparisons which could favourably be drawn between this country and Denmark and Holland.  Let me put on the record that, in my opinion, the moral climate of both Holland and Denmark is infinitely superior to what obtains here, with its shifting and ambiguous public postures of morality.  I was very impressed reading, during the recent controversy about abortion, the fact that in Holland, a society frequently held up to contempt for its liberal postures of various sexual manners, because of the fact that there is extensive and explicit sexual education in schools, free <Col N="1856" /> accessibility and availability of contraceptive devices of all kinds, and abortion on demand, there is a lower level of abortion <i>per capita</i> than we know of in this country despite the fact that it is outlawed.  May I say also that there is a considerable appetite for pornography and violence in this country?  I hear people round the town talking about various public houses which show obscene videos on Sunday mornings after Mass. That tells the whole story of Ireland in my humble opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to this film &ldquo;Basic Instinct&rdquo;.  I violently object to the film &ldquo;Basic Instinct&rdquo; because of its negative and highly discriminatory attitudes towards the gay community; in fact the filming of this item was picketed in Los Angeles and San Francisco because of its bias against the gay community.  Nevertheless, I do not believe that it should be censored.  Senator Mooney referred to graphic and explicit treatment of sexual matters, what is wrong with it?  Why are people so ashamed of sexuality?  Why are they so offended by what the poet William Blake calls the &ldquo;human form divine&rdquo;?  Why should two people making love, or the visual portrayal thereof, be regarded as disgusting or nauseating?  I do not think it is, and I do not see any reason why it should be censored.  I do not know what people have to be ashamed of. The naked body is a beautiful thing. Look at the pictures of the Renaissance, Greek statuary, look at the celebrations of the body in books like D.H. Lawrence's <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover, Women in Love, The Rainbow and The Plumed Serpent.</i> Lawrence rightfully said we know only really one thing, what it is to be alive now and in the flesh.  Whatever the dead know, they may know something else but they do not know that.  I am, thank God, not dead yet and I glory in being alive and in the flesh, inadequate as I am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator X as my colleague Senator X, Y, Z kindly prompted.  This is an argument that must be counted.  The Senator said a good murder mystery was spoiled by graphic sex scenes.  In other words, blood and gore is fine, it is entertainment for the kiddies and so on, but why do you have to spoil it with all these nasty sensual details?  I am sorry to say &mdash; perhaps I am a bit odd, and as this House knows, there is well tested evidence of that point &mdash; but I would reverse the order and think that a nice story of human sexuality which would gratify many people, not all of them concentrated in the back row of the cinema, was spoilt by the unpleasant details of human murder, evisceration and mutilation. That would be the way I would sort out my values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider censorship, we must appoint a censor.  Who is this person? I notice that the censor is continually referred to as &ldquo;he.&rdquo;  In other words this is presumably a heterosexual male who will do all our choosing for us and decide <Col N="1858" /> what he considers suitable for viewers.  I do not propose to yield my adult choice to some anonymous bureaucrat who is given the powers of choosing what I see, particularly in the light of the extremely vague wording of the criteria as regards the material he will be employed to judge.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unsuitable for viewing', films which protray sex in a totally objectionable manner,&rdquo; what does this mean?  We talk about &ldquo;extreme and ghastly violence&rdquo; or &ldquo;uninhibited pornography&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; comes from two Greek roots &mdash;<i>porne graphein</i>, meaning the writing of prostitutes.  Vera Hollander's, <i>The Happy Hooker</i>, or the book by the blue-blooded New England hostess on massage artistes are specifically what is meant by pornography according to the lexicographical definition, but I do not think that is what is meant.  If you look at the vague terminology, books that come to my mind, or films of these books, are <i>Macbeth, the Bible, the Odyssey</i> and Dante's <i>Divine Comedy.</i> They all contain explicit sexual references and murderous details of human savagery.  I consider this whole question of definition an extremely difficult one which has not been sufficiently addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like to express some compassion for the censor and his or her assistants.  We have heard about how frightfully damaging it is to watch even one of these films, yet we propose to subject some unfortunate individual to the concentrated dosage of 600 or 700 of these films.  Have the Government made any provision for the containment of this individual when the impact of these videos finally comes home to roost, and he sets off on a trail of carnage and rape all over the country &mdash; if, of course, they believe, as I do not, that these films have the directly corrupting effect that is pompously presented to us in the argument for this Bill?  What is the fate of these unfortunate people if they are to be shot over the edge by watching all this muck, filth and dirt?  It seems to me to be completely illogical, and I am against censorship.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the history <Col N="1859" /> of literary censorship, and this is a very serious subject.  Senator Murphy referred to the <i>Tailor and Ansty</i> controversy.  It is not that long ago since issues of the index of prohibited publications were published. I cannot remember exactly their title.  It was most extraordinary reading because the censor, whether censoring books, films or videos should possess one special talent, namely, the capacity to discriminate; in other words, to tell the difference between filth and high art. However, apparently during the years the censor was unable to detect any difference between Plato and the &ldquo;Porno Screw Colourbook Illustrated&rdquo;, Volume One, or Boccaccio and the bum biters' annual.  A mind that cannot detect any difference between this kind of material is, in my opinon, so lacking in discrimination that he or she is unworthy to be a censor.</P>
    <P>We may congratulate ourselves that this era is now past, but I wonder if it is. I have had material removed from my post over the years.  A postgraduate student of mine sent me a personal letter and included a paperback novel in which he thought I might be interested.  Regrettably, it contained no explicit or graphic descriptions of sexuality, but because of the cover it might have been inaccurately assumed to contain lewd material.  In Sheriff Street sorting office that book was removed from the package containing the personal letter and a little note put in saying, &ldquo;the following book has been abstracted and referred to the Censorship of Publications Act&rdquo;.  That was about ten years ago and, in fact, I referred to it in a case I took to the European Court.  Let us not assume this is still not happening. I have been advised by the English Department in Trinity College, Dublin where I work that in the past couple of weeks a consignment of books ordered by the English Department in Trinity College, Dublin has been interfered with in the post office.  A parcel from Blackwell Publishers in Oxford was posted Royal Mail Parcel Post International Standard Service on 15 May 1992, delivered to the English Department <Col N="1860" /> in Trinity College on Thursday, 21 May 1992 and opened the following afternoon.  Instead of the 20 reference books, all Blackwell publications, which were expected, only 13 such books &mdash; some damaged and some lacking dust-jackets &mdash; were found inside.  The only agency intervening between sender and addressee was the Irish Customs service. In substitution, however, there were six non-Blackwell Publications and it is rather interesting to note them.  They were Helen Frank's <i>Mummy Doesn't Live Here Anymore;</i> Jennifer Lynch's <i>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, A Twin Peaks book;</i> Nikki Bradford's <i>The Well Woman Self-Help Directory</i> published in association with Marie Stopes Well Woman Health Clinics, Sidgewick and Jackson, which contains a chapter on abortion and a list of addresses and telephone numbers for clinics and advisory services in Great Britain; <i>The Oxford History of the Classical World; The Hutchinson's Softback Encyclopaedia</i>; and David Crystal's <i>The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Language.</i>  Those books were substituted for the missing ones which included <i>The Encyclopaedia of the Enlightenment, the Encyclopaedia of the American Revolution</i> and books on the cultural history of the Renaissance.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious to me what happened. There was a mass examination of postal material, particularly parcels containing books, and they were scattered all round the place and we got somebody else's parcel, I do not know what on earth they imagine that <i>Mummy Doesn't Live Here Any More</i> has to say to the English Department of Trinity College, Dublin or, although it is very welcome, <i>The Woman's Self Help Directory</i>, including the names of all those abortion clinics and so on.  That is not a service of which, I have to say, I stand currently in need.  It is extraordinary when we are censoring telephone numbers that we will not allow <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper in, but they abstract material of professional interest to an English Department and substitute this melange of rubbish instead into a list of books.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to be very careful in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> I made the point in relation to the video Bill about what would happen the unfortunate censor if he or she were exposed to all this material and part of my reasoning seems to have been taken on board because I note the Minister stated that, &ldquo;in addition, experience elsewhere has shown that persons employed on the examination, and classification of video films, maintain consistently better standards of judgment if employed for short periods and given long breaks&rdquo;. Obviously, they show a tendency to crack under the strain.</P>
    <P>This is largely a laughable matter.  I do not believe it will work.  I do not think that people should be subjected unwillingly to offensive material but, just as in the case of the drinks trade in the United States of America in the 1920s, when you prohibit something you automatically create a black market.  Professor Murphy argued very cogently with regard to the classification of videos when he said it is really unworkable in terms of home entertainment.  It is not practical to imagine that parents would say to a child &ldquo;you are only 17 years, 11 months and 29 days so off to bed while we watch this video&rdquo;.  However, classification may be helpful in one way that Senator Murphy did not allude to, and that is that when a parent intends to exercise responsible supervision over children, the existence of a classification system will assist them in indicating to children the categories of video they consider to be suitable for viewing by minors.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think this is unworkable. The only thing that could be said in its favour is that it will take a few miserable wretches off the dole queue, probably corrupt and pervert them, but they may well have some kind of a whizz while they are being corrupted.  I do not think it is serious legislation and I find it impossible to take it seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a few points on the record.  This House has a miserable history as far as censorship is concerned, making an absolute laughing stock of itself in relation to <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  I read that book some 25 years <Col N="1862" /> after it was dealt with in this House and I could not understand what Senators at that time found so objectionable about it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I believe censorship will not work in this case.  The State feels obliged or under pressure by certain sections of society to legislate for morality. That is not possible.  We are meddling about with morality in the area of contraceptives.  We talk about whether contraceptives should be available to children or teenagers at 18, 17 or 16 years of age, when the whole world knows that if an 18-year old can buy them the obvious thing he or she will do is to sell them on the black market to younger children.  We feel that if we have legislation on the Statute Book then that is enough; whether it can be enforced or not does not seem to matter and that is not good enough.</P>
      <P>There is a particular concern here about sexual morality, but there are other kinds of morality &mdash; or lack of morality &mdash; that are very disturbing and to which we do not seem to give much thought. We have plenty of evidence in regard to a lack of morality in certain circles over the past number of years.  However, as far as video nasties are concerned, minors should be protected, but that is not the function of the State.  That is the function of parents but parents nowadays seem to want to abdicate their responsibility in this area and call upon the legislators to protect their children from the influences of bad books, bad television or videos.  It is impractical for the State to do that. How can we keep out video nasties that are beamed by satellite into our homes, how can we control the videos coming into this country when we have complete freedom of goods and services.  It is just impractical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not oppose the Bill but at the same time, I will not support it; I just want to put on the record that I believe it is ineffective.  If it works, fine, but in the final analysis the only way minors can be protected is by parents taking responsibility to protect them and not expecting the Government to employ people to read books, view videos, films <Col N="1863" /> and so on.  That simply does not work; as a previous speaker said, it creates a black market and there is evidence of this worldwide.  As Senator Norris said there is the evidence of the prohibition in the United States and the European Community have enacted legislation banning products.  It has made millionaires out of gangsters and criminals out of hard working people.  That is all I have to say on the subject, but I hope parents will realise that the State cannot protect their children; their protection is the parents' responsibility and theirs alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  As the Minister explained in his introductory speech, this Bill is simply to enable the provision of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, to be brought fully into operation.  I think there is general agreement that the video market needs to be adequately controlled to prevent the circulation of violent and pornographic material.  All the necessary controls were provided for in the 1989 Act.</P>
      <P>What we are about now is simply providing the necessary resources to the Censor's Office so that the last link in the chain of controls provided for in the 1989 Act can be brought into operation &mdash; the classification of all videos.</P>
      <P>I will deal briefly with some points raised by Senators during the debate and I will try to amalgamate as many of the points as I can.</P>
      <P>Censorship, whether of books, films or videos, is a difficult issue.  There are those in society on the one hand who would like to see very strict standards, one might say very conservative standards, applied in deciding what books, films or videos should reach the marketplace.  On the other hand, there are those who would argue that any form of censorship is wrong and that people should be totally free to read or view what they want. Therefore, in operating a system of censorship in a democratic State one must, like in all things, try to achieve a consensus and a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> Censorship cannot be so strict as to prohibit anything which might give offence or be unacceptable even if only to the most conservative of citizens.  It can only be aimed at preventing the circulation of what the majority of society find unacceptable or that which clearly presents a threat to the common good. People who earn their livelihood in the book trade or the film and video trade should not be unduly restricted in conducting their business.  Neither should readers or viewers be unduly obstructed in their choice of reading or viewing material.</P>
    <P>The Video Recordings Act, 1989, was drafted on the basis of this philosophy. It aims only to prevent the supply of those video films which the public generally would not wish to see circulating in the country and to provide a system of safeguards especially for young persons. While Senator Murphy agrees that minors need to be directed, on the one hand he seemed to think that in some cases there was a necessity for this and in others there was not.  I found it difficult to decide whether he supported the Bill or was against it.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that the legislation does not regard the censor or the assistants as omnipotent moral arbiters.</P>
    <P>With regard to prohibiting the supply of videos, they must exercise their powers stricly in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.  They can only refuse to supply a certificate for a video if they are satisfied that it is unfit for viewing for a number of reasons; first, if it would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection; second, if it would be likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation; and third, if it would tend by reason of the inclusion in it of obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it.  That is the <Col N="1865" /> general trend of the type of things covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In terms of classifying a video as being suitable for general viewing or suitable for over 18s only, the censor, and the assistant censors under his or her guidance, will be doing no more than ensuring that videos are labelled in such a way as to offer a guidance to parents as to the type of subject matter which may be on the video.  For example, simply because a particular video may be classified by the censor as being suitable only for viewing by persons over 18 years, this will not guarantee that it will not be viewed by a person under that age.  Once the video is taken home from the shop it is a matter for parents to supervise its viewing.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide guidance so that people will know what is on the video.  To a large degree, it is for parents and others to ensure that the rating classification is complied with.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a few other points raised.  I was asked what powers will be given to assistant censors and how will the film censor maintain a consistency in standards.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to reserve four specific functions to the film censor.  These are the power to review a decision made over seven years previously in the case of a cinema film; the power to give a higher classification, that is, one indicating suitability for younger viewers in the case of a video film; the power to revoke a prohibition order in respect of a video film and the making of reports to the Minister for Justice on the censor's activities.</P>
    <P>Assistant censors will be conferred with all the other powers under the legislation. However, they will only perform the functions allocated to them by the film censor and, in performing these functions they will be subject to the general superintendence of the film censor and obliged to consult with him.  In other words, they will act for the censor and will be obliged to consult with him.</P>
    <P>It would be the intention that all persons appointed to the position of assistant censor would receive individual and collective training when appointed and that <Col N="1866" /> regular consultations and group meetings will be held by the film censor.  Such measures will ensure that a consistency in the standards of certification and classification will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to satellite television and the Minister shares his concern about satellite television broadcasting video nasties.  This is the responsibility of another Minister, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  I understand that the broadcasting of television between states in Europe is being dealt with by a European Community directive at present and I suggest that point should be taken up with the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly raised the problems in relation to the publication of prohibited titles.  The 1989 Act requires a censor to publish each prohibition order in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  These orders only take effect when they are published and it is questionable if the courts or the Garda would take action against any persons supplying prohibited videos if the titles of the videos were not made know in advance.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked about the qualifications for the position of assistant censor and if women will be appointed. Of course women can be appointed and I have asked the technical people to examine why the words &ldquo;he or she&rdquo; cannot be inserted in the legislation.  The Minister for Justice makes the appointments and there are no special academic or technical qualifications for the position of assistants provided persons have a practical common sense attitude and possibily have an interest in films and videos, would be non-prejudicial and could perform their functions and tasks objectively.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised an important point &mdash; whether there may be a conflict between the powers given to the Censor and the Appeals Board and Articles of our Constitution.  I have asked that the points he raised be examined before Committee Stage because I am not in a position to deal with that point now, but between now and Committee Stage it will <Col N="1867" /> be possible to deal with it effectively. Senators Norris and Murphy both raised important points but it is not possible to go into great detail on them now.  May I draw the Senators' attention to the Tenth Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism on the control of video nasties which was dealt with in this House.  It was argued that the introduction of controls was an unwarranted interference with people's freedom to watch what they like in their own homes, However, the committee considered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude now.  The commitee considered that there comes a point when the freedom of individuals must be controlled for the common good. There is a need to protect the public and particularly young people.  The report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism refers to the effects of witnessing scenes such as those protrayed in some of the video nasties available in this country at present.  The aim is to remove the objectionable and revolting material from circulation.  At that time the committee considered that the general availability of video nasties had a corrupting influence on some members of our society and that some controls were required to combat this evil influence.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their valuable contributions.  Between now and Committee Stage it will be possible to consider some of the individual points made in more detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recognises the historic importance of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), notes the Government's already significant contribution at UNCED preparations, and agrees that the Government should contine to work for a successful outcome to UNCED both directly and through the co-ordination of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by thanking Senators for this opportunity to address the Seanad on the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED); this is the most comprehensive international effort ever mobilised in favour of the environment. It is consistent with the broadly based consultative approach that has characterised UNCED preparations that elected representatives should have a full opportunity to debate the issues involved.  UNCED was considered in the Dáil earlier this month and I hope to be able to give some expression to the views emerging from this debate, and that in the Dáil, in my own contribution to the conference.</P>
      <P>More than two years of intensive negotiations for UNCED have now taken place; these have engaged an unprecedented number of countries and international agencies. these preparations will culminate in next week's Rio Conference from which decisions of historic importance for environment and development are expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conference is a remarkable step forward in linking environment and development issues to the ultimate benefit of human kind.  The highly publicised withdrawal from attendance at the conference by the EC Environment Commissioner Mr. Ripa di Meana cannot detract from the major advances made in the UNCED preparations.  All of us would <Col N="1869" /> like to see more specific agreements in particular areas, but many decisions remain to be concluded in Rio and we must participate actively to get the best agreements possible.  All 12 EC member states will be represented at Government level and I assure you our views will be forcefully put.</P>
    <P>UNCED has been driven by three fundamental considerations.  First, that the protection of the environment is increasingly a global enterprise and concern, for which global solutions are essential; second, that poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems.  These must, therefore, be addressed within a framework which takes account of the needs of the developing world; and third, that sustainable development is the key to all the solutions involved &mdash; that is, development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</P>
    <P>Ireland strongly supports the UNCED process.  We have participated fully at all four major Preparatory Committee Meeings for UNCED, including the last one in New York in March at which I myself presented the conclusions of the Dublin Conference on Water and Sustainable Development.</P>
    <P>We have participated in all EC and OECD preparations for UNCED. Ireland's particular contribution to UNCED preparations was to host a major UN conference on Water and Sustainable Development in Dublin in January of this year.  My Department have produced a national report for UNCED which has recently been submitted to the UN authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are providing assistance to Irish environment and development NGOs to attend the UNCED Global Forum which is taking place in parallel with the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>ENFO and the Department of Foreign Affairs have financed the production of an educational pack on UNCED to be circulated to schools by DESC, the <Col N="1870" /> Development Education Support Centre.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also be strongly represented at UNCED next month.  The Taoiseach has already made clear his commitment to the Conference and will attend the concluding summit of heads of state and government.  There will be ministerial representation at UNCED for other appropriate periods by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Environmental Protection, who will both be contributing to this debate, and by myself. The official delegation will also include four parliamentarians, two of them representing womens' interests.</P>
    <P>In 1983, the UN General Assembly established a World Commission on Environment and Development, representing the developed and developing world, popularly known as the Brundtland Commission after its chairman, Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report, <i>Our Common Future</i>, was published in 1987 and forcefully concentrated public opinion on the new concept of sustainable development and on the important relationship between environment and development.  In the words of the Brundtland report:</P>
    <P>it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues; many forms of development erode the environmental resources upon which they must be based, and environmental degradation can undermine economic development.  Poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The Brundtland report concluded by calling on the UN General Assembly to adopt a programme of action for sustainable development and to convene an International Conference to review progress and to promote follow-up arrangements. This appeal sowed the seeds of the UNCED process.</P>
    <P>The basic concerns of UNCED are continuous with those of the Brundtland Commission, although there is now a <Col N="1871" /> more refined understanding of the interaction between environment and development issues.  The UNCED agenda has cyrstallised around a number of urgent environmental problems: climate change and biodiversity, on which global conventions will be signed; deforestation, on which a conference statement will issue; desertification, and Agenda 21 which will seek to identify viable environmental strategies across a range of sectors for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental question facing UNCED is that of the financial and other transfers and support structures necessary to permit the developing world to assume its environmental obligations. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, will speak on the issue of financial assistance to the developing world.  In principle, however, Ireland supports the provision of new and additional resources and we are prepared to explore the possibilities for this within the constraints of our current economic situation.</P>
    <P>UNCED is also expected to agree a set of fundamental legal principles for the guidance of environment and development policy in the future.  This is to be known as the Rio Declaration or Earth Charter.  These principles are all-embracing and highlight in particular the importance of environmental protection and the need of developing countries.  Ireland has supported the Declaration as strong statement of political intent which heads of state and government should endorse.</P>
    <P>Agenda 21 will define the programmes and activities needed in specific environmental and cross-sectoral areas to implement sustainable development for the future.  The topics covered are comprehensive and include protection of the atmosphere, oceans and freshwater resources, deforestation, and waste management. Cross-sectoral issues include poverty, consumption and demographics and human settlements.  Wide-ranging agreement has been reached on most of Agenda 21 but final decisions are needed on issues of finance, technology, and institutional follow-up to the Conference. <Col N="1872" /> These, and in particular, the question of finance will require difficult political negotiation at Rio.</P>
    <P>The recently agreed conventions on climate change and biodiversity will be open for signature at UNCED.  Both conventions involve specific commitments. In the case of climate change, the commitments will relate to controls on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of biodiversity, countries will be required to protect species and habitats and to integrate conservation considerations into other policies. The fact that the climate change convention does not include a legally binding target of stabilisation of CO³ emissions has led to expressions of disappointment. However, the convention is still a major achievement and the participation of the United States, the world's largest emitter of CO², must make it effective.  The EC will be pressing for the early adoption of Protocols to the convention setting out more detailed targets for control of greenhouse emissions.</P>
    <P>I would now like to recall Ireland's particular contribution to the UNCED process by the hosting of the International Conference on Water and the Environment in Dublin in January of this year.  This Conference was convened by the World Meteorological Organisation and attended by some 500 participants, including government designated experts from 100 countries.  The Dublin Conference was mandated directly by the Third Preparatory Committee to review the freshwater work of UNCED with particular reference to implementation, mechanisms, programme targets and costings.  As I have said, I presented the results of the Conference to the Fourth UNCED Preparatory Committee meeting in New York.</P>
    <P>The freshwater chapter of Agenda 21, which is acknowledged to be one of the clearest and most forceful, incorporates much of the language and many of the ideas of the Dublin Statement and Report on Water and Sustainable Development.  In presenting the results of the Dublin Conference in New York, <Col N="1873" /> I called for the dedication of a major share of the funds flowing from UNCED to freshwater management and provision. Improved freshwater management is not just an environmental imperative, it has enormous potential to improve human health, human settlements and agricultural production. Better water management is a core issue in the environmental and development relationship.  It links many of the problems addressed by UNCED and it should allow these to be resolved simultaneously.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me today I have chosen to concentrate on the international background to UNCED, but the lasting success of UNCED depends, of course, on all countries implementing the agreements reached in Rio.  The Government are committed to the concept of sustainable development.  Ireland places a high value on its natural environment. Our clean and green environment is rightly perceived as sustaining the quality of life in this country.  Ireland's good environment is important economically because it enhances the quality of our agricultural production and facilitates its marketing.  It is also advantageous to tourism and in attracting high class industry and services.  It is a fundamental natural asset which will be fully protected and preserved for future generations.</P>
    <P>The Irish national report to UNCED provides an overall view of the interaction between environment and development policies across key sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection and sustainable development in Ireland are supported by the specialised environmental legislation which has been developed over the last 15 years.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, is the most recent addition to Irish environmental legislation.  The new Acts sets out a number of guiding principles to which the Agency must adhere in the carrying out of its functions.  These principles include the need for a high standard of environmental protection, the need to promote sustainable development, the precautionary principle, the polluter pays, <Col N="1874" /> and the need to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between environmental and developmental considerations.</P>
    <P>Principles alone will not achieve results.  Concrete measures are also necessary and these too are provided for in the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  The new system of integrated pollution control licensing will deal with all emissions to the environment from activities with serious polluting potential and will require the application of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.  The system will recognise the environment as an integrated system to be preserved and renewed rather than as a collection of expendable assets.</P>
    <P>A national environment action programme was published by the Government in January 1990.  This was the first comprehensive environment programme ever adopted in Ireland and is in line with the international trend towards a programmatic and strategic approach to national environmental management. The methodology of the Irish environment action programme is clearly based on the identification and setting of targets and policy objectives.  These are being subjected to regular review by means of progress reports, the first of which was published in July 1991.</P>
    <P>The environment action programme places a high value on environmental awareness, information and promotional programmes &mdash; all designed to enable people to act positively towards their environment.  This emphasis on environmental awareness and information is consistent with UNCED policies.  ENFO has been established as a publicly accessible information service.  It has had an enthusiastic response from the public with over 1,000 visitors per week during its first year and a half of operation.  Computerised access to ENFO systems is also being made available through the main public libraries.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, UNCED faces the global community with fundamental decisions about its future.  Despite the many difficulties involved, I am optimistic about the political willingness to <Col N="1875" /> address the challenges.  UNCED does not, however, represent a panacea or a once for all solution to the formidable problems which it will confront.  The Rio Conference is only a beginning: the hope must be that it will set new thresholds and objectives for the ongoing development of sustainable policies into the next century.  The Irish Government will make every effort to ensure this outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by thanking the Minister for coming to the Seanad to discuss this very important subject.  As the Minister said from 1-12 June Rio de Janeiro will host the UN conference on environmental development, known as UNCED.  This Conference, also known as the Earth Summit, is where all the Governments will gather to find a common basis for action of universal concern to all humanity.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Conference on Human Environment, which was held in Stockholm in 1972, led to the setting up of the United Nations Environment Programme. Events like Bhopal in 1984 and Chernobyl in 1986 signified a new era of concern.  In 1987 two very important documents appeared: the first was the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, more commonly known as the Brundtland report, and the second set out the environmental perspective to the year 2000 and beyond, a strategy approved by the UNEP governing council, later to become the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development &mdash; UNCED 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aims of UNCED 1992 were, first, to examine the current state of the environment since 1972; second, to set up strategies for action to deal with environmental issues in the socio-economic development process of all countries; and third, to protect and enhance the environment and take measures to prevent environmental degradation at source. Specific areas to be examined will include the following: protection of quality and supply of freshwater; management of <Col N="1876" /> land resources by <i>inter alia</i>, combating deforestation, desertification and drought; and to combat climate change depletion of the ozone layer and transboundary air pollution; conservation of biological diversity; and environmentally sound management of biotechnology and waste, particularly hazardous waste.</P>
    <P>The Rio de Janeiro conference has failed in my view to put a single greatest threat, not only to the environment but also to peace, development and the very future of mankind on the agenda, namely, the population explosion. Rumour has it that it was the influence of a certain Church, which will be nameless, which prevented this happening.  The present population growth is simply not sustainable.  The world population today is about 5.4 billion by the year 2020 at that growth rate it will be 8 billion and by the year 2060 it will be 16 billion.  In other words, the population is doubling every 40 years, which means that by the year 2100 it will be 32 billion.  That is not sustainable.  Any approach to tackling the environmental problems which ignore this problem is, in my view, doomed to failure or at best only partial success. Almost all of this population explosion is occurring in the undeveloped and underdeveloped world, such as Central and South America, Africa, South-East Asia and the Indian sub-continent.</P>
    <P>The present population levels are already putting enormous strains on the environment causing deforestation, soil erosion and desertification in the poorer regions which can cause problems for the entire globe.  Industrial growth, consumerism and wanton waste are the real threat in the developed world.  Our generation in the developed world are enjoying a standard of living which we are not really entitled to by depleting the capital that has built up over millions of years in the form of fossil fuel, natural gas and other resources, and at the same time investing virtually nothing to develop alternative sources of energy and alternative materials to ensure that generations yet to be born will have satisfactory substitutes for the resources <Col N="1877" /> we will have wasted and exhausted in a few short generations.</P>
    <P>The US is the main culprit in this regard consuming as it does 30 per cent of the entire annual oil consumption although it has less than 5 per cent of the world's population.  The consumer society is at its most extreme there but, thankfully, there are emerging signs of very strong movement towards recycling and taking greater care of the environment, and strong moves towards the use of biodegradable materials, particularly packing materials.</P>
    <P>The European Community could do much more for the environment, such as using the surplus land we now have, to produce energy crops and timber, our two biggest imports, and promoting greater efficiency in the use of energy. As long ago as 1912 the man who invented the 20th century's most efficient engine, Dr. Rudolph Diesel, said: &ldquo;The use of vegetable oils may be negligible today, but such products could well become as important as mineral oil and coal tar products&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Today, we have another German designed engine specifically designed for the use of vegetable oil.  Technical reports on it show that it works as satisfactorily as the diesel concept and even more satisfactorily in the case of vegetable oil.  All we lack in the Community now is the political will to take on the oil lobby and the will to forego the tax revenue on mineral oils by using untaxed vegetable oil.  This, in one stroke, would help us to launch a new era in the field of energy for transport and make a significant contribution to cutting down on aerial pollution.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read the following in the <i>Financial Times:</i></P>
    <P>In Mr. Diesel's day, in spite of his inventions, most transport was based on genuine live horsepower and the animals derived their energy from hay and oats.  Perhaps it was easier for him to conceive of a similar source of power for his engines than it is for the present generation, more used to relying on non-renewable fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> The question we must ask ourselves is: why are we still using up precious reserves of oil when we could be running our tractors, lorries and cars on fuel derived from crops grown fresh every year on our farms?  Moreover, if we were using such low carbon fuels the level of air pollution would be much reduced and both the environment and human health would benefit.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>Clearly oil is too cheap and the cost of growing non-food crops too high for the environmentally attractive idea to be viable.  No one would wish to see the price of oil rise by the necessary amount for fear of provoking world recession.  Farmers could not grow the appropriate crops at such reduced return.  Times have been changing. Last week's Brussels agreement on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, for instance, will mean that prices to farmers for crops like cereals, oil seed rape and in due course sugar beet will be much closer to world levels, in other words, lower.  The fact that there will be compensation for the loss of income should be viewed separately.  The relevant point is that it will be cheaper for industry, or whoever, to buy crops from farmers that will narrow the gap between them and the fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the European Community proposed, and the UK Government accepted, that a carbon tax, designed to encourage consumers to use fuels that cause the least air pollution should be imposed to raise the cost of fossil fuels mainly responsible for the problem.  The proposal has not yet been endorsed by Community Environment Ministers, but the delay appears to be only technical and has something to do with drafting. Assuming that this is the case, while the speed of the introduction and initial extent of this tax remains to be determined, it is likely to become Community policy and over the time will raise the price of fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, it has been agreed that the levels of excise duty charged on all <Col N="1879" /> biofuels &mdash; that is, those derived from vegetable sources &mdash; should be limited across the Community to 10 per cent of those charged on fossil fuels they replace.  Add all these measures together and it is clear that the cost gap which existed only weeks ago is now much smaller, always accepting of course, that this is the result of political manipulation rather than market forces.  It might not be too fanciful to believe, however, that the environment and green policies in general will continue to receive favourable treatment by Governments for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Community would not be treading a new path if it developed a biofuel industry.  With regard to the use of fossil fuels in Austria, for instance, such an initiative is already well advanced.  Farmers grow oil seed rape, sell it to the Government, at a subsidised price to processors who then convert it into fuel for tractors and lorries, and sell it back to them.  The performance of the vegetable powered vehicles is said to be only marginally lower than it would be with fossil based diesel.  The conversion from one to the other can be done in any farm workshop. I have already suggested that there is a new engine &mdash; the Elsbet engine &mdash; which needs no conversion.</P>
    <P>How much of the success of this venture relies on aid from the Austrian Government is not immediately clear, but lack of other sources of fuel was clearly the motivation; at least it has proved it can be done.  Neither is diesel fuel the only one that can be replaced from farm based sources.  In Brazil &mdash; another country without its own fossil fuel resources &mdash; many of that country's cars run on fuel derived from alcohol made from sugar cane.  It can also be made from maize or wheat starch. During the seventies' oil crisis US fuel companies set up plants to manufacture what they call &ldquo;gasohol&rdquo;.  Now that the oil crisis has fallen it is seldom seen, but the technology exists and <Col N="1880" /> given a favourable cost comparision could be reactivated.  Moreover, there are many other and yet unexploited industrial uses for farm crops.  It is well known that it is possible to manufacture plastic from wheat starch. What is more, the product is biodegradable making it environmentally desirable.</P>
    <P>I would like to add at that point that I see plastic as being one of the greatest nuisances that has ever appeared on farms and it is becoming ever more of a problem.  While it is extremely useful, I am afraid it is going to leave us a legacy that we will regret in the future.</P>
    <P>Disposable nappies made from farm-based starch are already being widely used in the US, as are engine fuel filters and absorbent gels.  They, too, have superior environmental properties compared with fossil based equivalents and after use need not be buried in landfill sites but can be composted and returned to the soil as an organic fertiliser.  There is even a type of printers' ink made in the US from soya bean oil.  Presumably, it enables journalists to eat their words if the need arises! Could it be that the non-food uses of farm crops is an idea whose time has come?  Will the combination of global environmental concern and the realisation that reserves of fossil fuels are finite, persuade Governments to take the extra step, now shorter than ever before, to make such enterprises viable?  Certainly it will have to happen sometime when the oil runs out.  It would be potentially disastrous if the present concern about surplus food production that prevails in the European Community were to blind politicians to the opportunities that could be provided by efficient, cheap and renewable crop production.</P>
    <P>That is what appeared in the <i>Financial Times.</i>  I agree with it.  There is a problem for the moment with the relative cost; it is a problem that is diminishing and instead of paying farmers to produce nothing off their land we should be devising <Col N="1881" /> a process whereby they would be using that land to produce renewable sources of energy.</P>
    <P>There are many other things we must do in the Community and in Ireland. Starting nearer home, we have an appalling record of lack of concern for our environment.  When I walk the streets of Dublin or Cork I am always appalled at the amount of litter.  We are making little or no effort to conserve energy by increasing the amount of insulation in our homes or draught proofing our homes. That is a cost saving exercise that can be profitable.  It is not just our homes but our factories, our offices, our Government buildings and so on.  We must be continually striving to be more efficient where energy is concerned.</P>
    <P>The key to the energy problem could, to a large extent, be a key to many of the problems of pollution, particularly aerial pollution.  We have problems with water pollution in our lakes, rivers and our seas. We are not doing enough.  There have been great improvements as far as farming is concerned.  There are far fewer accidents occurring now than there used to be with pollution from farms getting into inland lakes.  We cannot be complacent, we must be ever vigilant to ensure that we protect our environment. We have all got a responsibility, all of us who have inherited a good environment, to pass it on as well as we found it and, if possible, better to generations yet unborn.  I am afraid the record will show that across the globe, we are going to leave that environment in a much worse condition.</P>

      <P>Although Ireland is a small country in terms of geographical land mass both internationally and in the European context, we are fortunate to enjoy the benefits and lifestyle of a developed country while still having a relatively unblighted environment. Indeed, most of our European neighbours have an industrial based economy, the fact that our economy is agri-based, and most of our industry arrived late to Ireland, has ensured that our environment <Col N="1882" /> has survived most of the perils of modern day development.</P>
      <P>During our highly successful Presidency of the EC in 1990, Ireland hosted the first meeting of all the Environment Ministers from the EC and their counterparts from eastern Europe to discuss the environmental problems common to us all, and in particular the environmental neglect of the eastern bloc countries.  Earlier this year Ireland also hosted the International Conference on Water, one of the most vital and often abused resources of this planet.  Our record in environmental awareness and conservation while not totally blemish free, is far ahead of other countries with similar living patterns.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development &mdash; UNCED &mdash; will be by far the largest gathering of world leaders for a global summit on any issue.  Such is the importance of the issue that it merits the attendance of over 100 Heads of State or Governments as well as up to 30,000 other participants.  UNCED was initiated by a resolution of the UN General Assembly in December 1989.  Next month's world summit to be held in Rio de Janiero will hopefully see the signing of three important environmental charters. The earth charter is a general statement of principles dedicated to the importance of preserving the environment. Agenda 21 is an action plan for the environment for the 21st century which includes special provisions to manage &ldquo;global commons&rdquo; trade, technology transfer, debt, etc.  International conventions will be held on common areas of concern such as climate change, global warming and biodiversity, including its protection against ever increasing threats.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority and also a national representative, I am aware that the question is no longer local or national but global in its nature, although it must be said that any efforts to redress ecological damage must begin with the individual before impact will be felt both nationally and globally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national environment action Programme <Col N="1883" /> was published in January 1990. This is the first comprehensive environment programme and systematically sets out objectives for protection and improving the environment across the relevant departments and public sector activity and is founded on sustainable development.  The action programme was drawn up against a background of growing international concern for the environment.  The programme will set out targets and policy objectives and will be subject to review by regular progress reports.  The plan will entail overall public expenditure of £1 billion over ten years on pollution control and enhancement of amenities.</P>
    <P>Under the environment action programme the Government established ENFO, the Environmental Information Service, in September 1990.  At the moment ENFO has a drop-in information centre in the city centre in Dublin and plan to extend into the regional areas in the future.  ENFO has a full range of information services available, including leaflets, videos, reports, journals and international data bases.  ENFO also links in with public libraries and has already had over 1,000 visitors per week in the first year of operation.  As a member of a local authority I can say it is a service we have used widely over the last five years, holding regular meetings of our sub-committee on the environment. It is a most helfpul service.</P>
    <P>CFC and halon gases are not manufactured in Ireland.  However, this does not mean we are blameless when it comes to contributing to the whole in the ozone layer.  Ireland is party to the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol of 1987. We also ratified the London Amendment to the Protocol in 1991 to help rectify the ozone problem.</P>
    <P>Although we in Ireland do not manufacture these gases, we still use a sizeable amount each year.  The EC has now agreed strict limits on the emission of ozone depleting substances.  The proposal to phase reduction throughout the EC and to ban the production of CFCs, <Col N="1884" /> halons and carbon tetrochloride has been agreed from 1995, with an intermediate cut of 85 per cent by 1993.  The EC will also urge and encourage other countries to follow suit.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for the Environment has contacted the significant suppliers and users of CFCs and requested them to develop alternative programmes to reduce and effectively eliminate the use of these substances.  Recycling of CFCs from freezers and refrigerators now qualifies for local authority grants.  Consumers are now more aware of the need to use ozone friendly aerosols and the large variety of these sprays on the market is proof of the recognition by the manufacturers and the success of the campaign.</P>
    <P>Ireland is developing a national strategy on climate change based on energy conservation, efficient fuel switching and increased afforestation.  The Department of the Environment have gone a long way to improving the air quality in Dublin by banning the sale and distribution of bituminous coal from September 1990. The Government have also actively campaigned for the conversion of home heating systems to either gas or electricity. Indeed, over 21,000 homes were converted to gas systems in Dublin in 1990 and 1991.  Fuel subsidies to those on welfare or other low income groups are provided to aid in minimising the cost of smokeless fuels.</P>
    <P>The Government are also actively promoting the use of lead-free petrol by reducing excise duty on unleaded petrol and conducting advertising campaigns to promote its use.  New cars and industrial vehicles are now subject to new directives to regulate emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons from petrol engines and particularly emissions from diesel engines.</P>
    <P>The Government also reaffirm a two-year commitment to accede to the Helsinki Convention on transboundary air pollution.  This aims to effectively eliminate acid rain and would commit us to cutting SO 2 emissions by 30 per cent. Investment in a good public transport system such as rapid rail or electric tramways <Col N="1885" /> would also be a priority as by encouraging commuters to leave their cars at home the air quality in our cities can only improve.  Other positive results would include fewer road accidents and less noise pollution.</P>
    <P>The high demand for energy that modern living commands for both domestic and industrial use is at the root of many of our environmental problems. Many of our Euro-neighbours use nuclear energy to keep up with this constant demand.  This, however, is not an option for Ireland because of the safety aspect.  One has only to remember the tragic Chernobyl accident to realise the inherent dangers.  Nonetheless, we are still high energy consumers with appetites which need to be satisfied.  The completion of an undersea link to the United Kingdom gas grid will ensure the constant availability of clean, safe natural gas for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The 33 major local authorities are the main agencies for the implementation of environmental policy in Ireland.  Each one, although somewhat autonomous in certain areas, for example, planning, operates under the umbrella body of the Department of the Environment.  There are also 54 urban councils operating environmental regulations.  Other new organisations acting as environmental watchdogs are the Environmental Research Unit, the Marine Institute, the Radiological Protection Institute and legislation for the new Environmental Protection Agency has recently been enacted.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have already committed themselves to several principles for furthering the cause of environmental protection: the principle of sustainable development; the precautionary principle; the integration of environmental considerations in all policy areas.  The most important of these is the policy of sustainable development. This means achieving economic growth without diminishing our natural resources for future generations.</P>
    <P>The Earth Summit is historic in its conception that we all recognise that the earth which we all share is not an instantly <Col N="1886" /> renewable source which we can use or abuse at will and suffer no retribution. The time for repaying the bounty we have enjoyed for so long is now because if we fail we leave nothing for future generations.</P>
    <P>The scenario of a polluted earth is horrendous in pictorial terms, a planet devoid of life, swirling in clouds of poisoned air and putrid water, stripped of all that was once so plentiful and orbiting in space probably dead for all eternity.</P>
    <P>It is up to us, the developed nations, to take the steps to ensure that this never happens.  We must aid and educate not only our own people, but those developing nations who aspire to our materialistic lifestyle at such a great cost to their natural habitat.  The world summit in Rio is the first concrete step in this direction. We in Ireland are glad to contribute and play our part.  Let us hope it is not too late.</P>

      <P>In that case he will probably get in in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously what we are talking about today is very important.  It relates to the most basic fundamental questions, how the planet is managed, how it is used for the welfare of everybody who lives on it. In the past 20 or 30 years it has become quite clear that there are major problems facing the world arising from the excesses of industry, arising from wholesale pollution and indeed wholesale destruction of the environment in some cases.  As Senator Raftery said, there is an obligation on every generation to leave the planet in at least as healthy and as wholesome a state as they found it.  Certainly that would not be true of recent generations. There is no doubt that there has been considerable deterioration in the <Col N="1887" /> quality of the environment worldwide over the past quarter of a century, and indeed in the past generation.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must recognise that many of the issues we are talking about are very badly understood.  The scientific base on which to make decisions is very inadequate.  Many of the predictions are based entirely on speculation, more of them are based on hypotheses are badly tested, on estimations and calculations which contain enormous levels of error. However, we have to live with that situation. It is simply not possible to collect all the information in a satisfactory manner and, accordingly, people are going to rely on these modelling procedures and all the rest of it in an attempt to try to estimate how things will be in 20 or 30 years time if we continue to behave in a series of differing patterns.</P>
    <P>As I say, we will have to rely on scientific opinion, on scientific speculation, and we are going to have to make decisions based on those grounds which, of course, is anything but satisfactory. Given that that is the position, it is important that decisions are made on the principle that we should be cautious, that we should err on the side of safety in relation to what is done regarding the environment.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for people having the understanding that the data is inadequate and, accordingly, there is no real value in adopting definite positions. We need to know that things may change and to be in a position to adapt ourselves to the changing circumstances arising from the availability of new information and from the capacity to forecast changes to a far greater extent than we can at present.  It is also important to recognise the role of the scientific community in these matters and it is particularly important to recognise that their role should be one of presenting the facts. When scientists become advocates, it is equally important that those who are listening to them recognise the metamorphosis that has taken place and interpret them in the same way as any other advocates would be interpreted.  In other <Col N="1888" /> words, a scientist should be interpreted in the context of somebody who has a case to make and is seeking to convince people of one point of view or another. It is very important that those distinctions are fully understood.</P>
    <P>Often times I do not think that is the case either in relation to environmental problems, or indeed in relation to many other problems.  I have often felt in regard to some outside scientists coming into the country that one of the first questions that should be asked about them is, who has invited them to come?  Who is picking up the tab and who is sponsoring the trip?  If you get the answer to that it will help you greatly in interpreting what they have to say either on one side of the case or another.  You will find there are certain people who only invite certain types of scientists and those who tend to be down the middle do not get as many invitations as perhaps do some of the more shrill elements.</P>
    <P>In relation to the main problems facing the world, undoubtedly the problem of increasing population is a very stark and grim one.  Senator Raftery fairly well illustrated it when he talked in terms of effectively what is an exponential growth rate and that can be expected to continue unless something is done about it.  Like the growth curve in science, obviously the numbers will continue to increase but, of course, at the top of the growth curve you come to a stage where the whole thing begins to turn down again and that is the danger.  When that happens in the human population, the turning down of the growth curve unfortunately has absolutely appalling effects.  We see some of the horrors of war and starvation on the television every night and to some degree, certainly in the case of the starvation problems, they can arise because of an inability to control population levels.  They also arise for a whole series of other reasons and I do not want to underestimate them.  Many of those reasons are political.</P>
    <P>In regard to this country's position, some of the major pollution and environmental problems are not really directly within our control.  I do not think there <Col N="1889" /> is a great deal this country can do about the problem of topsoil erosion or of the destruction of the rainforests.  These are tremendously important problems but our influence in relation to them is very much going to be a peripheral one where we would hope to influence indirectly some of the key players who have an important role in determining the rate of which those problems are controlled.</P>
    <P>In regard to the thinning of the ozone layer, we certainly have our part to play here.  I understand we use of the order of 2,500 tonnes of CFC gases in this country each year.  That is a relatively small amount in the context of the total usage of CFC gas and in the context of the total impact that the use of CFC gas has on the thinning of the ozone layer.</P>
    <P>I understand we have made a national wish that the usage of CFCs would be reduced by the year 1995.  We all seem to agree with that but we are not prepared to get down to brass tacks and make regulations which will ensure that we reach the targets we set ourselves.</P>
    <P>The same applies to global warming. We would like to see the emissions of carbondioxide, methane, sulphur dioxide and other gases reduced but we are not getting down to brass tacks.  We are not implementing laws which will control the levels at which these gases are emitted. Even very small increases in environmental temperature per decade will have very profound effects and we cannot turn our backs on those problems.  Indeed we have to play our part.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to be more positive when it comes to laying down controls on the usage of fossil fuels. However, it would also be naive not to acknowledge the control of the use of fossil fuels will bring certain undesirable side effects.  The usage of fossil fuels is directly linked to the development of industry.  It may be possible to make some adjustments to that linkage but there is no doubt that there is a clear relationship between the use of fossil fuels and industrial development and that in turn affects employment levels and so on.  To some degree, we will have to face <Col N="1890" /> some short term difficulties in order to reap a longer term benefit.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of the United States in refusing to accept targets and to get down to the serious business of imposing controls on the worldwide use of fossil fuels I has to be seen as a great disappointment. The Americans are major players; they account for approximately one quarter of all the carbondoxide emitted into the atmosphere.  They are the market leader and if they are not prepared to adopt hard measures to control the use of fossil fuels, it will be very difficult to ensure a serious reduction or a serious control in the emission of fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>Our total emission of CO² would be relatively small.  I think we should adopt a positive position to the carbon tax which is being considered at the European level, although one can only be disappointed at the recent responses from Europe.  It may be easy for us to adopt a fairly positive attitude to the carbon tax because the results of the ESRI study would seem to indicate that it is probably going to be in our interests to do so anyway.  This means we can make a virtue of this by taking a lead in Europe.  In relation to the environment in Europe generally, we should be much more aggressive than we are in trying to set the pace because, in the longer term, that is where the action is for this country.</P>
    <P>I want to again mention our contribution to Third World aid.  I regret the levels of aid we provide are so low, I am disappointed that the Europeans were not more positive when it came to setting real targets which would have to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said on a number of occasions in this House on the control of the use of pesticides and the control of the intensive developments in agriculture.  It is very desirable that we would be more vigilant than we have been in those areas and one can only view with alarm reports from the United Kingdom where farmers are suffering from the toxic effects of organophosphate sheep dips which have been used in intensive agriculture, and one hears of similar cases in Ireland, <Col N="1891" /> although they are obviously not as widespread as in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>There are two or three points Senator Raftery raised with which I would agree. Our attitude to litter is deplorable.  The litter that is strewn all over the place after a pop concert, a football match, etc., is appalling.  One gets the impression that there are people in this country who dump litter on the streets as a way of expressing themselves.  Sometimes people act in an aggressive manner as if they wanted somebody to challenge them and they could start a row.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the conservation of water leaves a great deal to be desired. This is the time of year when we are liable to have water supply difficulties in the city of Dublin.  There are many reasons for this but I think we have not done enough to conserve water, a basic resource.  A person will last only a few days without water, yet we take it for granted, and assume it will always be there, that it comes through the taps almost by magic.  I am in favour of having a good water supply but there is a strong reason to be more concerned and to conserve it rather than waste it.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the labelling of ecologically friendly products.  I gather there is considerable scope for improvement in the levels of labelling and some companies have exploited the anxieties and concerns of members of the public by putting eco labels on their products which, in many ways, are anything but environmentally friendly.</P>

      <P>I welcome Minister Smith to the House this afternoon and thank him for his contribution to this debate. The Progressive Democrats will be supporting this motion; that will not surprise anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Conference on Environment and Development will have profound implications for the country.  It will have very significant international implications and the fact that 100 Heads of Government are going to assemble in Rio and that there are going to be, as one newspaper described it, a swarm of 10,000 <Col N="1892" /> officials attending the conference indicates a rapidly growing awareness of the significance of conserving natural resources.  It was described in one newspaper article I read this morning as the future of spaceship Earth.  That is a good description.  Ten years ago a conference like this would not even have been contemplated. Our awareness of what we were doing to our environment and the planet was so low that it would not have occurred to anybody, except the most farsighted, that such a conference was necessary.  That makes me wonder about some of the people who are most vocal in defence of what they call sustained systems of agricultural production, sustainability in general and talk about things as extreme as closed eco systems. These people do not always get the hearing that they deserve because they are the voices now crying in the wilderness; ten years ago their voices might have led to the development of this Conference to which I think we all subscribe.</P>
    <P>We are becoming more globally aware; the global village is assuming relevance. Television has brought the global village into our sittingrooms. We now see developments across the world that a few years ago we only heard about by way of report and did not fully understand.  Now we can see the dramatic changes that are being made.  We have seen what happened in East Germany through industrial development.  We have seen what happened in eastern Europe.  We see what happens to the tropical rainforests. We see the spread of the deserts.  We can very easily identify with the damage that has been done to the planet &mdash; and it is not just all through population growth and through more people having to try to live in a confined space, although that undoubtedly has something to do with it.  Therefore, the scale of the task that confronts the Governments that are going to attend the Conference in Rio is an enormous one.</P>
    <P>I noted that at the conclusion of his speech the Minister said he was optimistic about the political willingness to address the challenges, and I would say that is <Col N="1893" /> correct.  He also said that the Conference did not represent a panacea or a once and for all solution to the formidable problems it will confront.  I think that represents a very accurate summary of what can be hoped for from the Conference; that it is such a task, that there are so many Governments and so many conflicting interests involved that there are going to be considerable difficulties in reaching a consensus.  I believe, nevertheless, there is a broad willingness on the part of the developed countries to protect the environment and to try to protect the future of spaceship Earth.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised, and I notice the Minister made reference to this in his remarks as well, that the EC Commissioner for the Environment decided he would not &mdash; I see the Minister shaking his head; I am going to agree with him in a moment so he should not worry &mdash; attend the Conference because it was alleged in the newspapers he was not very pleased that the EC Ministers failed to endorse his proposals for an energy tax to help cut carbon dioxide emissions.  His stance strikes me as quite extraordinary on two fronts.  First, in relation to his responsibilities as an EC Commissioner, if he, as an EC Commissioner, does not know it is the EC which brings forward the proposals but it is the Council of Ministers which decides, not the EC Commissioner, I think he should reconsider his position as a member of the EC Commission.  It is not his responsibility to decide what the policy will be; it is the Commission's responsibility to bring forward the proposals and to leave it to the Ministers to make the decisions.  If we can bring Maastricht into this debate, at least we can continue to look forward to a situation where this country has an input into those decisions and it will not be decided unilaterally by members of the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Commissioner, in his attempt to impose his will on the EC Commission, might look at the record of his colleague, Commissioner MacSharry, in terms of his success in getting his proposals through the political system when they were met with universal hostility <Col N="1894" /> from all quarters when they were originally put forward.  I think the Environment Commissioner is just like a spoilt child who has not got sweets and has decided he is going to stay away from the event; if he feels that strongly about it he might as well resign.  I agree with the Minister.  It is not going to make the slightest bit of difference whether he turns up or not.  I think the Minister made that clear in his remarks.</P>
    <P>I have read the national report to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which has been prepared by the Minister's Department. It sets out in quite concise and clear terms where this country is at in relation to its economic development and to environmental matters.  It emphasises the importance of a clean environment to the welfare of the country.  I think this is a very significant point and, again, it is one about which a developing awareness is just emerging.</P>
    <P>If our agriculture, if our farmers, are to survive and prosper within the new environment which the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has brought to us, then a clean environment is critical to the future welfare of food exports from this country and to farming.  In my view, and I think again this is becoming widely accepted, it is critical to the whole question of job creation, not just in the food industry but in industry in general.  That point is emphasised in this report, it is emphasised in the Culliton report and it has been emphasised in several official reports which we have received in the past year or so.</P>
    <P>We have the whole question of tourism. Obviously, if we are to develop our tourism properly and to our national advantage, there is the need to have our environment in a pristine condition so that people can come from the very heavily populated areas of Europe and other parts of the world, where there are huge environmental pressures, to a country where there is space, where there is clean water and where there are unrivalled natural assets.  The development of tourism must be to our national advantage. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to <Col N="1895" /> protect all these assets and our record in that regard to date has not been all that it might be in protecting these assets. They must be protected, not just for philosophical reasons or for reasons that people who are extremely comfortable think that a hedgerow in a county needs to be protected, but because it is in our own economic interest; it is central to our whole economic welfare to protect these priceless assets which have been left to us by previous generations.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, we have made advances in the past few years and I hope we continue to make advances.  I commend what my colleague in the Progressive Democrats, the Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection, Deputy Harney, has done in relation to smog in Dublin and in bringing the Environmental Protection Agency Bill through this House and the other House.  Here we had a very detailed, prolonged debate, many amendments were made to the Bill and it was greatly improved in its passage through this House and the other House. These are the type of measures we must continue to adopt in the interest of the welfare of our citizens.</P>
    <P>At the outset I spoke about sustainability; this word has become a buzz word.  I attended a conference in Cork earlier this year which talked about sustainable agriculture.  The problem about sustainability is that everybody has a different definition of sustainability. There were some people at that conference who believed that the only sustainable system of agricultural production was to live on a farm without any input from outside energy or from outside sources of fertilizer and just to be able to provide for the needs of the family from that piece of land.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, given the prognostications about population growth and even given the society we have at the moment, that is simply not feasible.  It may be very nice for somebody to go and live on a smallholding in west Cork having made their money in the Ruhr or in the industrial heartland of England; but that is not for the people who have <Col N="1896" /> lived for generations in that part of the country or any other part of the country because it is simply not possible.</P>
    <P>That is not to say, of course, that the very intensive systems of agricultural production which are so widespread on the Continent should be adopted here.  I note that in the report which has been prepared it says that over the past 20 years consumption of fertilizer nitrogen in Ireland has quadrupled and that the bulk of this addition has been attributed to the changeover from hay to silage.  It goes on to give usage figures for phosphorous and potassium, but the figure I think is most relevant is that for nitrogen, where it says that in 1988-89 62 kilograms per hectare of nitrogen fertilizer were used on Irish farms.  It might have gone on to say that that is less than half of what is being used on English farms and I think it is less than a quarter of what is being used on Dutch farms.  Therefore, while the situation might not be as good as it could be, by international standards it is certainly far better than nearly all of our European competitors.  I note the document goes on to point to the very low levels of nitrate in our rivers.  There are only a few exceptions where the admissible concentration specified by the EC directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption has been exceeded. It is satisfactory that at least our water is in a good condition, but we have to ensure it continues to stay in that good condition.</P>
    <P>Returning to this matter of sustainability and the tropical rainforests, I have heard very well-meaning young people in Ireland talk about the need for a closed environment within the tropical rainforests many thousands of miles away, that this environment cannot be touched.  That is grand if you are living in suburban comfort in well-to-do housing estate in Montenotte or Foxrock, but I do not know how to tell the person who is living in the forest in a structure which is probably covered by nothing other than grass that they must forego the economic benefits to themselves which are associated with the exploitation of that resource.  If it is the wish of the developed <Col N="1897" /> countries of the world to sustain these resources in the underdeveloped countries of the world the conclusion is obvious: the developed countries of the world must pay the bill.</P>
    <P>It is quite illogical for people who are driving to conferences in cars which are consuming fossil fuels, who are living in houses that are heated by fossil fuels, to argue that people who are living in abject poverty should not be given the opportunities to develop their lifestyle to a standard only half that of the people who argue this case so eloquently and so vocally.  I have serious difficulties about how we are going to square that circle in terms of keeping the resource.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the need to keep the resource and I acknowledge the environmental damage that is being done by the destruction of the rainforests.  I still wonder about the people who are living in those regions and how their economic welfare can be advanced.  It strikes me that the only way that can be done is through action by the wealthy developed countries in the world, just as we have action in the European Community on a much lower level to protect people living on the periphery of the European Community. The question is: who is going to pay for the protection of the Amazonian jungle or for rainforests in other parts of the world?</P>
    <P>I note that when the Minister spoke about development aid he said that his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs would speak on the issue of financial assistance to the developing world.  He continued:</P>
    <P>In principle, however, Ireland supports the provision of new and additional resources and we are prepared to explore the possibilities for this within the constraints of our current economic situation.</P>
    <P>All I would say is that our record in this country does not bear favourable examination, that we spend 0.2 per cent of GDP on development aid.  The EC, if my figures are correct, spends 0.5 per cent and the objective is to bring it up to 0.7 per cent.  I understand the economic <Col N="1898" /> constraints which are imposed upon Government and I realise the need for prudence so that we can improve the standard of living of our people, but I think we could be significantly further than we are going in relation to our development aid.  It would be illogical for us to go to Rio and argue for more understanding for the problems of the developing world, more support for the developing world, without putting our money where our mouths are.  There is a core question involved here &mdash; how much is the wealthier western world prepared to pay for the measures which we all regard as essential for the protection of the planet?</P>
    <P>We must turn to our own domestic situation, having looked at the global aspect.  If we are to have a convincing case and make convincing arguments when our delegation attends the Conference in Rio, we must be able to point to how well we are putting our own act together when it comes to protection of the environment.  We begin with agriculture, and I have talked about this question of sustainable agriculture.  I subscribe to the view that we must head towards a more sustainable system than we had in the past, because there are economic benefits to Ireland in such sustainable agriculture.  For example, I believe we could do far more to exploit organic farming, to exploit the image, which I hope we have of green and pollution free food.</P>
    <P>In relation to organic farming itself, I submit to the Minister that serious consideration should be given to supporting the transition which a farmer has to make from a traditional and intensive system of farming to an organic system.  There is a four-year period when it is extremely difficult to sustain income in making the transition from the intensive system to the organic system and the only way I can see of overcoming that problem is to develop some system of aid which will ease the transition.  Such systems are already in place in the Scandinavian countries, so there is a precedent for them.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to our <Col N="1899" /> inland fisheries.  Paragraph 2.4.7 of the report says: &ldquo;The most serious problem facing inland fisheries is the deterioration of habitat.&rdquo;  Again, it comes back to the tourist question and the whole point of integrating our tourism, our natural resources, our agriculture and our industry. There is no doubt about it, all the rhetoric in the world about the development of tourism is just so much hot air when you start at Galway and travel through Costello, Screeb, Gowla, Kylemore, Inagh up to Delphi and find that the sea trout are gone.  I do not know how anybody can talk about development of tourism if, at the same time, we allow a resource of that value and of incomparable international standing just to disappear before our eyes.  This has been going on for four years and we still do not know the reasons, or appear to not know the reasons.</P>
    <P>The so-called Sea Trout Action Group have suggested, among other reasons, that it is to do with the proliferation of the salmon cages in the sea, that as a result of the chemicals being used on the salmon the sea lice are migrating from those salmon and are destroying the sea trout.  The point is that this is a resource which has been there for generations.  It is an incomparable resource.  I have fished in most of these places.  I have met people who have travelled from America, who have hired a car in Shannon Airport, who have gone up the west coast, who have stayed for a month, who have hired a gilly for a month.  Those people will go to Alaska, New Zealand or wherever the sport is.  They can leave an immense amount of money there.  The few hundred pounds I have left there every year for 20 years is neither here nor there.  Certainly, if enough people go, there must be some significance.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister for the Marine in the last day or so has said, if I am quoting him correctly, that there will be an investigation.  The urgency of this matter is such that we need to put major resources into it.  What has been happening up to now has not been adequate. I take the point which was made earlier <Col N="1900" /> by Senator Upton when he talked about science, having a sort of scepticism about what science tells us, and the inadequacy of science.  This is a case where the inadequacy of science has been fairly sharply shown up.  I make a direct appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to try to rectify the situation, because I have seen hoteliers in the west devastated by this. I understand the need to develop aquaculture &mdash; there is reference to that in the report &mdash; but I do not understand why one development has to be inconsistent with the preservation of another resource.</P>
    <P>The other point that needs to be referred to is the whole matter of water abstraction.  That is fairly topical at present with the problem of water into Dublin.  I live on the Liffey in Kildare.  I know what water abstraction is doing to the Liffey, and what it has done in the past few years.  I hope I have the figure accurately &mdash; I think I do &mdash; and that is that 70 million gallons a day are being abstracted from the River Liffey.  Of course the people in Dublin must have clean, drinkable, potable water; but the people who live along the Liffey also have a natural resource at their door which has to be protected.  Again, in my recollection the level of the Liffey over the past five years has gone down.  If abstraction goes up from 70 million gallons to 120 million gallons, as I think it is proposed, what is going to happen the Liffey?  What is going to happen to the sewage we allow enter the Liffey?  How are we going to flush out the system if the water is not in the system to do it?</P>
    <P>I will make a suggestion.  This matter can be overcome; I know where the water is &mdash; in the River Shannon.  The River Shannon is not much further away than Ballymore Eustace is from Dublin.  There is fairly flat ground between the Shannon and Dublin.  People living around the Shannon know they have too much water nearly all the time.  I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach can verify that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At last we are going to drain the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1901" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to drain the Shannon and we have a practical way of doing it.  If all the money comes through the Structural Funds, and I am confident it will, some of it would be well spent bringing Shannon water to Dublin.</P>
      <P>As regards the natural environment of the Liffey, the problem of the Dublin water and how it might be overcome, somebody suggested having a second reservoir. My suggestion is to build a pipe. There is a pipe in Libya about 1,000 miles long which pumps water from the mountains in the south to Tripoli.</P>
      <P>We then come to the question of ground water.  I know from the report prepared for the Conference that 22 per cent of our water supplies come from ground water.  To what extent are we prepared to protect the ground water? There is reputedly a huge reservoir of ground water under the Curragh.  We have a situation in County Kildare which I will bring unashamedly to the Minister's attention.  I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree that this is relevant to the debate.  It is to do with this proposed dump, a landfill site in Kill.  Kill is a village that has won awards for flowers and has won a Tidy Towns award.  It is in the middle of the bloodstock industry area.  Good quality water is essential to the bloodstock industry.  I do not understand how somebody, on environmental grounds, can even contemplate a development like this, when it is considered that the main water supply to Dublin is running through a pipe adjacent to this site.  How much are we prepared to do within our own country to be consistent with the arguments we are going to make when we go to Rio?  The matters within our own remit must be controlled.</P>
      <P>Another domestic matter is the question of roads and the marvellous motorways we are going to build with the Structural Funds so that we can get people quickly out of the west of Ireland on to the boat and ship them abroad. Paragraph 2.8.3 of the report says in regard to the development of motorways:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular care is taken in route selection and design to avoid the demolition <Col N="1902" /> of houses, to prevent severance of communities, to bypass sensitive areas and to minimise visual intrusion.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that whoever wrote &ldquo;to prevent severance of communities&rdquo; visit the people of Kilcullen, Kildare or Celbridge and tell them how that is consistent with the way the motorways have been designed to leave those communities isolated.  It is not consistent.</P>
    <P>Continuing on the matter of the roads, the report says:</P>
    <P>On the debit side, major road improvements can be environmentally disruptive by causing visual intrusion and leading to severance of communities. However, in the planning of projects, attention to location, layout and other factors can avoid or minimise these effects.</P>
    <P>In its conclusion on that section the report says:</P>
    <P>Under the programme, environment impact assessment and public participation are essential parts of the planning and design process for new projects.</P>
    <P>To what extent were the residents in these areas consulted when it came to building these marvellous highways that are going to bypass their communities and leave them severed?</P>
    <P>I am glad that the report mentions the exclusion of nuclear energy as a power source.  There is a passing reference to Bord na Móna, but in view of the time constraint, we will not go into detail. Senator Raftery referred to the use of energy crops, such as oil seed rape, wheat or sugar beet, to produce fuel.  I agree there is potential there, but I think we have not yet got to the point where that potential can be exploited economically. As far as I am aware, and I stand corrected on this, there is a negative energy balance in producing the fuel from these sources to put into machines to drive them.  In other words, it is going to take more energy to create one gallon of this environmentally friendly fuel than the value of the fuel itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> If we take it that the Common Agricultural Policy reform will reduce the price of cereals, they would have to be reduced by one-third of what they are at the moment before these proposals could come into economic focus.  There is a lot to commend them.  As the shortage of fossil fuels becomes more and more apparent, when we do not have the motor cars to drive on the big highways and when we return to the horse and cart, perhaps then we can talk about using the other fuel systems.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senators Upton and Raftery said about litter.  There is too much demanded of local authorities and national Government in relation to cleaning up the country.  The country is our country.  There was a protest march outside the gates of the House yesterday and you should have seen the amount of litter left.  I doubt if that litter ever entered their consciousness.  It is the citizens' country and it is not always the local authority's job to clean up the litter. People should bring home their litter, put it in the bin and then let the local authority get rid of it.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of his address the Minister said the Rio Conference was just a beginning and that it did not represent a panacea or a once and for all solution to the formidable problems which it will confront.  I think he is right in that.  I wish well those who are going to this Conference on behalf of Ireland.  I am sure they will conduct themselves, as they always do, with the interests of the country at heart and will contribute to a more environmentally friendly satellite earth. At the end of the day, if we are consistent in our arguments, we will have to put our money where our mouth is &mdash; and when I say &ldquo;our money&rdquo; I mean that of the western developed economies &mdash; to pay for the things they think they need to protect the less developed parts of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I call Senator Costello.  I understand Senator Haughey is also interested in contributing and I believe the Minister also wants some <Col N="1904" /> time.  I would ask Members to bear that in mind so that everybody can speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should start by referring to Senator Dardis' remarks and by welcoming his innovative and imaginative way of draining the Shannon.  Those of us who come from the west would welcome an approach that might take some of the excess water from that part of the country and bring it to the desert area of Dublin where it is needed.  Even though I am a member of the city council, I am always amazed that in a country that has so much water annually, if there is a week of relative dryness we immediately find ourselves almost in a panic and that the reservoirs in the capital city, which is not that large, seem to be inadequate to meet the people's needs.  I understand we are coming close to providing the necessary resources in the next year to increase our capacity by about 20 per cent, so perhaps we may not need all that water from the Shannon after all.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators that this is a very important motion and debate which I wish we had had earlier.  It is a little disappointing that we could not have the opportunity to discuss all the environmental issues and issues relating to development policy in the Third World when there may have been opportunities for input into government thinking at the various consultative conferences that took place prior to the one scheduled next month in Rio de Janeiro.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach is leading the delegation which is appropriate and lends status to it.  I hope this country will give the question of world environmental protection and development the priority it deserves.</P>
      <P>The UNCED conference is being described as the Earth Summit, an appropriate description.  It is a United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and I hope it will be the first of many and that next time around we will be more specific with regard to objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's remarks that it is intended to agree there a set of fundamental legal principles for future <Col N="1905" /> guidance of environment and development policy.  I hope that will be achieved. I worry that we might achieve less than that but if we agreed a declaration of intent underpinned by fundamental legal principles that would be a good start.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a bad record in environmental matters.  We were anxious to attract multinational companies to this country without considering their possible environmental impact and we have suffered as a consequence.  The attitudes of political parties and of the general public has been to attract industry at any cost.  It is less than a decade since one of our more radical parties advocated the establishment of an oil refinery in Dublin Bay without considering possible consequences for the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are the garden of Europe and we should market ourselves as such but we have done the opposite.  We have allowed scandals to develop in areas where we should be projecting a strong environmental conscious image.  Our beef industry is in tatters at the present time, partly because of angel dust, the failure to eradicate TB in the industry and poor marketing techniques which fail to emphasise the quality of our product.  That leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>Pesticides have been in regular use; lakes have been contaminated and fish kills have become the order of the day. Sea trout have suffered as Senator Dardis outlined, from the use of pesticides in fish farming and also from the seepage of raw sewage into the water supply.  I was on a well-known lake last Sunday where approximately 200 anglers in a competition caught only 13 trout between them which is a reflection on the way in which some of our tributaries and major lakes have been depleted of nutrients and consequently fish stock.  We have much work to do to redress this.</P>
    <P>We are negligent about energy conservation also.  We over-consume energy by approximately 75 per cent in the industrial sector leaving an enormous capacity for improvement.  Likewise, public policy on public transport could be formulated with the intention of limiting the consumption of fossil fuels by motor <Col N="1906" /> vehicles.  We use resources coming from Europe for structural development such as the building of motorways which Senator Dardis referred to as bringing our emigrants from one part of the country to the boat but motorways entail petrol consumption which will deplete the supply of fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>Progress in environmental affairs has been almost entirely due to EC directives. The EC has been beneficial to us in that respect and as a result of directives we now insist on environmental impact studies before permitting major developments that could have severe environmental impact.  We have dealt with a number of those in recent years.  The eastern by-pass proposal is still on the boards.  The Ryder's Row proposal to cut through an 18th century building and the proposed incinerator at James Street both necessitated environmental impact studies as a result of EC directives.</P>
    <P>Waste disposal is now subject to an important EC directive that must become operational in all member states, obliging states to provide at least secondary treatment for all waste disposal by the year 2000.  That will impose substantial obligations on us which we should be preparing for already.  Again, the impetus for change comes from outside rather than within the State.</P>
    <P>Maastricht will bring environmental benefits because it will establish environmental protection as a Community-based effort rather than permit individual states to act in accordance with their own wishes.  The movement from Community action to mandatory directives from the EC on the environment is an important one.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that Rio de Janeiro will not become a talking shop.  I hope that the Italian Commissioner's decision not to attend the Summit will not damage its prestige.  He should not have taken that drastic decision; the best thing is to get in and fight one's corner.  It will be a pity if we end up with only a discussion document after 100 countries contribute enthusiastically and intensely with nothing legally binding after the work has been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> The possibility of a carbon tax for energy conservation and to inhibit global warming must be considered and I am disappointed that Ireland should express reservations in the matter.  We release billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year thus contributing to global warming.  We have a national responsibility to take action in this matter.</P>
    <P>The second stage of this motion is in relation to development aid which is equally important because the world population is increasing.  It is about five billion at present, and is expected to double within approximately 50 years. That may precipitate a world crisis and pose considerable problems for all of us. It is a pity our foreign aid contribution is no more than 0.17 per cent of the United Nations recommended target of gross domestic product.  I am not happy with the Minister's statement that:</P>
    <P>Ireland supports the provision of new and additional resources.  We are prepared to explore the possibilities for this within the constraints of our current economic situation.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is imposing conditions.  We are a long way behind the 0.7 per cent required by the United Nations.  The least we could do is develop a timescale so that by the year 2000 we would have bridged the gap and reached the UN aid target.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Irish non-governmental organisations that will be accompanying the official delegation are not part of that delegation and that their expertise will not be included as it has been in other official delegations.</P>
    <P>The UNCED is an important conference. We must not allow the environmental situation to go unchecked.  At present there is global warming, pollution, depletion of the ozone layer and the world is in danger of becoming increasing hostile to life.  We have an obligation to make sure that it remains fit for us and for our children in years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Minister Daly to the House.  It is important that this House should discuss the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, otherwise known as the Earth Summit.  It has been described as the last chance to save the earth and the planet, a dramatic phrase which signifies the importance of this conference taking place in Rio de Janeiro.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately there are indications to suggest that the Conference may not be a success.  There is a great deal of pessimism about the Rio deliberations.  It has been said that the road to Rio is paved with every good intentions, and that is as it should be.  Nevertheless, practical action must emerge from this world conference; we cannot rely on rhetoric alone. It must not be turned into a major publicity exercise and nothing else.  It is the last chance to save the earth and we need a meeting of minds to set out a course of practical action to tackle world environmental problems.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal of the EC Environment Commissioner from the Conference is not helpful although I gather from the Minister for the Environment who was here earlier that he is not worried by it.  He may know something about that man's personality that I do not.  It does not seem auspicious that an EC Commissioner has seen fit to withdraw from the Conference.</P>
      <P>The role of the USA has been discussed extensively and it appears that they are not sincere about bringing about changes at Rio.  The culture of the United States is based on consumption.  This is election year there and suggestions to impose carbon taxes to cut consumption and to give massive subsidies to the Third World go against the promise of the American dream.  The problems faced by the USA are shared by other world economies.  There is a disparity in material wealth between north and south and one half of the world prospers at the expense of the other.  That situation is typified in America and shows how difficult it will be to reach solutions in Rio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Conference at Rio de Janeiro every success.  It has caught the imagination <Col N="1909" /> of the people.  Young people are being taught about it in schools and are asking their parents what they are doing to save the environment.  That is a hopeful sign and I am glad that the issues are on the table and will be discussed.</P>
    <P>The public are demanding environmental action.  We have had several major tragedies in the last few years such as the Chernobyl disaster and the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer.  Green issues in general are coming to the fore as a result of public demands and public action.</P>
    <P>Individuals can do much to curb environmental decay.  The environment begins with the consumer and the household. One may cycle to work, bring bottles to the bottle bank, avoid dropping litter, make donations to foreign agencies and so on, plant trees and conserve energy in other ways.</P>
    <P>We have a great aid tradition in this country with Bob Geldofs Live Aid and our tradition of missionary work.  Overseas development assistance is extremely important and I suggest that we need to increase our contribution.  The question of global warming is important and the suggestion for a carbon tax should be looked at.  It has been suggested that the earth is getting warmer by three tenths of a degree per decade as a result of which polar ice caps are threatened, oceans will swell up and low lying areas will be affected.  I understand that the Netherlands is worried about this for obvious reasons.  Again the major problems in that regard are coal and oil.  The question of a carbon tax challenges our philosophy of competitiveness and industrial development.  It will take brave decisions but something must be done to prevent the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Tropical rain forests cover 6 per cent of the world's surface and provide a home for up to 90 per cent of the earth's species. It is extremely important that decisions be taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a direct relationship between population increase and poverty and there must surely now be a need to reduce the rate of population growth.  This is an <Col N="1910" /> extremely sensitive area and I understand that the Vatican and the USA are anxious not to take major decisions on this crucial issue.  Half the world lives in dire poverty and major initiatives must be brought forward in relation to population growth in the Third World.  We have to challenge the old moral philosophy in order to tackle this problem.  It will call for brave decision but the nettle will have to be firmly grasped.</P>
    <P>By the end of this century, up to 50 per cen of the population will live in cities posing major environmental problems in relation to sanitation, car pollution and so on.  I have briefly sketched over some of the major environmental problems. Ireland could make a worthwhile contribution through the conservation actions of individuals.  We need to tackle the problem of acid rain in Ireland.  We have signed the Helsinki Convention. SO 2 emissions will have to be curbed and the ESB in particular will have to adhere to its terms.</P>
    <P>I wish the deliberations well.  I hope we adopt Agenda 21.  Action has to start now on an important matter so that we may hand on the environment to further generations in a better condition than it is at present.</P>

      <P>Few international conferences have attracted such interest and anticipation as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which opens in Rio de Janeiro in just under a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the Conference can be measured by the unprecedented number of Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, who have announced their intention to attend.  It is also unique in the exceptionally high level of interest which it has aroused among the ordinary citizens of the world.  Evidence for this can be found each day in the world media but also in the broad range of interest groups who will participate in the global forum which will run in parallel to the Conference itself. These include parliamentarians, non-governmental organisations, trade <Col N="1911" /> unions and many other sectoral representative bodies.</P>
    <P>Interest here in Ireland in the many important issues to be discussed at Rio has been significant.  The recent debate in Dáil Éireann and today's debate in this House reflect the concern shown by Members of the Oireachtas and through them the people of Ireland at the serious threat to the planet and mankind of the uncontrolled exploitation of the earth's natural resources.</P>
    <P>There is a growing realisation that unless action is taken urgently to protect the environment by elaborating programmes of sustainable economic development, ecological and economic catastrophe will ensue.  For that reason the global agenda before us in Rio links economic development with environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The position of developing countries is one to which particular attention will be paid.  Very often it is these countries that are confronted by the greatest level of environmental damage as their peoples exploit their natural resources to sustain life.  For these countries as well as for developed counties, programmes of sustainable development are essential.</P>
    <P>These development programmes must meet the needs of present generations without placing an intolerable burden on future generations to meet their own needs.  This concept of sustainable development implies that economic growth must provide fairness and opportunity for all the peoples of the world and must do so without destroying the finite resources of our planet.  It is a concept which, as a result of the agreements reached in Rio, will shape future programmes of economic and technical assistance between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>If the concept of sustainable development is to guide our future thinking about how we control our resources, there are a number of principles on which we should base our approach; future development models must put people at the centre of their operation.  Partnership is essential for development co-operation; the adoption <Col N="1912" /> and use of environmentally sound technologies must be a key element of aid programmes.  These technologies should also be safe and when transferred to developing countries should be adapted to meet their specific needs; the environment must be seen as a finite resource which cannot be exploited at will by markets and private investors; and all sectors of society must be mobilised in the implementation of models of sustainable development.  Wherever possible, control should be placed in the hands of local communities.  Unless these communities believe in the programmes and contribute to their survival, they will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>These principles underpin the Action Plan &mdash; known as Agenda 21 &mdash; which will be adopted at Rio.  It is an ambitious agenda covering almost all the global environmental problems facing nations today &mdash; climate change, ozone layer depletion, transboundary air and water pollution and the contamination of the oceans and the seas.  The social and economic dimensions of the problems are also addressed, including action to combat poverty, changes required in consumption patterns and the impact of population trends.</P>
    <P>If the developmental and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 are to be met, it is clear that a substantial flow of new and additional financial resources to developing countries will be required. Some estimates put the needs at $125 billion per year.  While this figure may be contested by the industrialised countries it nevertheless amounts to more than a doubling of what is at present given in official development assistance to developing countries.  On top of that must be added the financing for programmes to address global issues such as deforestation and desertification which has been estimated at $15 billion annually.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether these estimates reflect realistic assessments of the likely cost of implementing sustainable development policies, it is clear that significant levels of funding will be required. The Twelve member states of the.  European Community have agreed that <Col N="1913" /> increased financial resources must be allocated.</P>
    <P>In our own case, we recognise that our aid programme, when compared to most of our EC partners, is modest in size. Nevertheless we are determined to do what we can.  In the Programme for Government we have committed ourselves to implement a planned programme of increases in Ireland's ODA, in the period 1992-94, so as to achieve a higher contribution by the end of that period.  This decision has been taken in the context of very difficult economic circumstances at home and in a situation of very tight budgetary constraint.  Nevertheless, the Government are conscious that the Irish public have been very generous with their voluntary contributions to organisations working in the developing world and it is proper that more should be done if at all possible.</P>
    <P>The European Community and other donor countries attach importance to making the maximum use of all financial resources and mechanisms in the most effective way.  These include the multilateral development banks and funds, the relevant specialised agencies and other United Nations bodies.  All of these financial mechanisms can provide various types of funding arrangements specifically adapted to the particular needs of developing countries.</P>
    <P>The decisions which will be taken at Rio will have important implications for the way in which donor countries design and implement their bilateral aid programmes. In future, the integration of developmental and environmental programmes and projects will become a priority for official development assistance.</P>
    <P>Ireland's bilateral aid programme has a strong and visible environmental dimension.  We are not involved in large scale infrastructured projects which can have a major destructive impact on the environment.  Ireland concentrates on the development of the effectives, sustainable management of existing natural resources.  We ensure that all new development projects, including those proposed by non-governmental organisations, <Col N="1914" /> are subject to environmental impact assessments at the planning stage. If a project is seen to have a negative impact, aid is either redirected or discontinued.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development cannot be achieved without the efforts of the international community through programmes of development assistance.  A supportive international economic climate and, within that, an open trading environment which does not discriminate against the economies of developing countries is also essential.  Greater efforts must, therefore, be made to improve access to markets for exports from developing countries.</P>
    <P>In that context the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the GATT should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible. This will provide greater security and predictability in the international trading system as well as further liberalisation and expansion of world trade thereby enhancing the trade and development possibilities of developing countries.</P>
    <P>Last week I attended the annual meeting of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers in Kingston, Jamaica, where I had the opportunity of hearing directly from the leaders of developing countries about their preoccupations concerning access to the Community market for their products. They talked very openly of their fears that the preferential position they enjoy on the Community market under the Lomé Convention might suffer as a consequence of the conclusion of the GATT negotiations.  I am glad to report that the Community was able to reassure these countries that it would do all it could to protect their position in the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to imagine that the Rio Conference will provide answers to all the environmental and developmental problems facing the world today.  Many will argue that the agreements which emerge from Rio fall short of what is really needed to make a permanent impact on environmental degradation and to lay the foundation for effective <Col N="1915" /> models of sustainable development.  I would not agree.</P>
    <P>To begin with, two very important conventions will be signed &mdash; one on climate change the other on biodiversity &mdash; which together represent a major advance on what it has been possible to achieve at international level up to now.  They reveal a determination and a commitment on the part of all nations, but especially those responsible for much of the environmental damage, to address the forces which lead to such damage. New and additional financial resources will be made available to fund these conventions and to help tackle some of the fundamental structural problems of developing countries.</P>
    <P>These new resources will help developing countries to adopt programmes of sustainable development so essential for the alleviation of poverty which is vital for proper and effective environmental management.  Let us not forget that 40 million persons worldwide face starvation daily.  That is the background to this Conference.  Rio is not the end of a process; it is the beginning.</P>
    <P>Last week I saw for myself the efforts which have been made by the Government and the people of Jamaica to reconstruct large parts of their infrastructure and economy destroyed by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988.  It was an example of what can be done because it must be done in the aftermath of a natural disaster.  The Rio Conference offers us an opportunity &mdash; which we must seize &mdash; to take steps to tackle the damage which man has caused to his environment and to move towards the fundamental goal of enhancing human welfare throughout the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking time to listen to this debate.  It is the second occasion in the last 24 hours that he has been here for Adjournment Matters.</P>
      <P>In this Adjournment debate I am referring to the report of a speech made by the Minister at the Fifth European Conference of Ministers responsible for Social Security, in Limerick.  During that speech the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>We must be prepared to have an open mind and be prepared to face the probability that in the long run our present social welfare system may not be sustainable and may have to be changed.</P>
      <P>When you decode that for political reality, what it seems to me to be suggesting is that we may be talking in terms of cutbacks in the present levels of social welfare.  That is how I interpret that, given the normal practices in relation to Ministerial announcements.  The emphasis is on bringing good news, and if good news cannot be brought then we get a type of coded language which indicates that the bad news has to be worked out for oneself in terms like &ldquo;not sustainable&rdquo; or &ldquo;may have to be changed.&rdquo;  Usually, those terms mean that things are getting worse, or will get worse.  If things are pleasant and are going to be good, then typically in the political &ldquo;lingo&rdquo; that is used, those positions are spelt out in explicit terms and, indeed, the good news is that nobody is left in any doubt about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view the Minister's remarks with great concern.  We are talking of the escalating unemployment of 20 per cent.  It is in that context that the statements are very worrying.  They also raise fundamental questions in relation to the Government's attitude to the social welfare system.  Is the Minister suggesting that the country is going to be unable to sustain the present level of social welfare payments?  If that is the case, what are the implications of that?  Where are the <Col N="1917" /> changes going to happen or, to be more precise, where will the cutbacks come, if that is the reality?  If it is not the reality, why would the Minister, given that he is a very experienced politician, put that type of a flier into the system?  I would be interested in hearing what exactly he proposes.  If he is talking about cutbacks in the social welfare system, then it is very important that he should spell out what those cutbacks are likely to be.</P>
    <P>The reality of the social welfare system is that for many people it does not provide them with the most basic necessities of life.  On the day after the Minister's speech was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and on the following day on the same page of that newspaper, there was a report of a statement from the Combat Poverty Agency and extracts from their annual report.  That report stated that families on social welfare simply cannot pay for adequate clothing or everyday household goods.  They are not able to decorate their homes or replace furniture. That is the reality for many people who are on social welfare.  It would be extremely disturbing if we were talking of further cutbacks on those basic necessities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the report, also says that most social welfare payments remain significantly below what the Commission for Social Welfare identified in 1986 as minimally adequate levels.  Even the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> recognised the need to increase social welfare levels as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to clarify his statements, to spell out exactly what they mean and if we are going to be faced with cutbacks in social welfare, then it is very appropriate that we hear them now rather than at some stage in the future. Are we engaging in the early part of a process by which a series of cutbacks will be made known to the public?  In other words, are we trying to soften public opinion in relation to the social welfare system?  How can that attitude be reconciled with the attitude the Government adopted to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare?  Essentially, I am <Col N="1918" /> asking for clarification of precisely what the Minister was alluding in his Limerick speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify my remarks last week.  Senator Upton is referring to my comments as reported in the media, during the Fifth Conference of European Ministers for Social Security which I had the honour to host in Limerick last week.</P>
      <P>Let me say that it was a very successful conference which was held under the aegis of the Council of Europe and attracted distinguished representatives from 27 countries to our shores.  The theme of the conference was Social Security and the Labour Market.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the future funding of social welfare services should be raised in that context.  Let me put my comments of last week into their proper perspective.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that a common trend in relation to social security spending is being experienced by national governments across Europe.  That trend is reflected in an increasing financial burden arising from factors such as rising unemployment and the ageing of the population. We, in Ireland, are no different. Our rate of unemployment is unacceptably high and, as a result, it is a major constraining factor on the development of our economy.</P>
      <P>That is just one example of an expanding expenditure item in the social security area.  When the full range of social security expenditure is taken into account, we find that it is growing at a significant rate each year while the scope for raising additional revenue to finance that expenditure is becoming increasingly constrained.</P>
      <P>Where does that leave us for the future?  Very clearly, unless the economic and financial situation improves significantly, we will find it more and more difficult as a nation to finance the range of social welfare services currently available to most people on the basis of an automatic entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me hasten to add that my comments <Col N="1919" /> in this regard are not new.  I made precisely the same point in the other House during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, a number of weeks ago.  What I said at that time was that the notion that social security in this country was self-financing was a myth.  Employers and employees pay into what is called the social insurance fund but the Exchequer also makes a very large contribution to that fund which makes good the deficit between what is received by way of contributions and what is paid out in benefits and pensions.  The size of the Exchequer contribution this year will be £143.6 million as shown in the published Estimates for my Department.</P>
    <P>It follows, therefore, that with our rising number of unemployed and the high dependency rate inherent in our demographic situation, the cost of social welfare payments to the Exchequer will soon reach the stage where it will be very difficult to fund the present level of benefits.  That, indeed, is the prospect that may well face a future Social Welfare Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am being alarmist in what I have said.  I have always been interested in the financial aspects of social welfare expenditure.  I see my views as being a realistic appraisal of the situation at the present point in time, but what can we do to protect our level of social welfare payments in the light of the problems facing us in the future?</P>
    <P>As I see it, we need to consider whether a fundamental review of our social security systems is necessary which will address the question of targeting our scarce resources to those most in need. We have already made some progress in this regard with the introduction of earnings limits for entitlement to some benefits.  As I have said, this is not an attempt to dismantle the pay-related social insurance system but rather to grapple with it for the benefit of everybody in the future.  In addition, we need <Col N="1920" /> to deal with the problems caused by the sheer complexity, range and multiplicity of our social welfare schemes by simplifying and streamlining the system so that it can be more easily managed and understood.  My Department are currently examining those issues and I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals for consideration by Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton refers to the political &ldquo;lingo&rdquo; as it is commonly interpreted by politicians and the media.  I am a realist in politics; I have to be a realist as a Government Minister.  That is the context in which I made these comments last week.  It is not something I have not referred to before, both inside the Houses of the Oireachtas and in newspaper articles.  It is something we have to face up to.  We have a tendency in Ireland, probably more so than in most other countries, whether in politics, business or other areas of disliking to face reality some of the time.  What I have just done in the past couple of weeks, since I became Minister for Social Welfare, is to put the reality of the situation on the record.  That is what I did last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was a tradition that one was allowed one comment or one question following the Minister's reply.  I do not doubt the Minister's record in relation to speaking straight from the shoulder.  I acknowledged that in this House in the past.  I accept that but, at the same time, I think nobody could hear those remarks without being alarmed by them and without being concerned that we are talking in terms of the possibility of real cutbacks.  Will the Minister let us know if that is the case? Is the prospect of cutbacks and reductions in the present level of social welfare a real possibility?</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 June 1992.</P>
