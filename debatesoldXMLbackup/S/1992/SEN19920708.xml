      <P>I have notice from Senator Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Minister for Education to appoint Government nominees to the governing body of UCC.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Murphy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take the second stage of Items Nos. 2 and 3 together from now until 3.30 p.m. with a sos from 3.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.  From 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. it is proposed to take item No. 16, motion No. 49 and to return to Items Nos. 2 and 3 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.  May I make one suggestion to the House?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that we cannot agree to the taking of Items 2 and <Col N="1536" /> 3 as outlined by the Leader of the House this morning.  It is no secret at this stage, in this House particularly, that the passage of these Bills &mdash; the original, the amended version, the many lists of amendments on Committee Stage and the new amendments that came in even last Wednesday to the other House &mdash; has caused major concern.  Our difficulty is that sufficient time has not been given for negotiations with local authorities, with the IVEA, particularly since last Wednesday when new amendments on Report Stage were again entered in the other House.  I would ask the Government Parties, particularly the Leader of the Government Party, to allow sufficient time to elapse for detailed discussions at local level in relation to the implications of the Bills today.</P>
      <P>Can we be seen in this House to allow central Government to jackboot local government?  We need time, we must not rush it as this session comes to an end. There are enormous implications in these Bills and a lot of common ground could be found if they were not rushed through this House today, with the inevitability of Committee and Report Stages being rushed through either on Friday or some day next week.  We need time to tease out the issues concerned at local government and vocational education committee levels and then come back to this House and do justice to our very important part of government in this country.</P>
      <P>May I also request the Leader of the House to allow us to discuss the sacking of the Chairman of Telecom Éireann? Thinking about the Bills I have just been speaking on and the proposal to appoint chairmen of governing bodies, the day of allowing Ministers to appoint bagmen or bagwomen willy nilly is gone.  We need a debate on why the Telecom Éireann board voted no confidence in their chairman and this House needs to discuss a most important body, a body that is very concerned about possible privatisation. We should discuss whether that should be an issue at all.  May I ask the Leader to allow a debate in this House before we close this session on the problems at Telecom Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your indulgence to note the fact that last night we had the 57th or 58th victim of violence in the North of Ireland.  Cyril Murray was a teacher in Holy Cross School in the Ardoyne area of West Belfast, recently retired, a man who had given a life in service to his pupils, to his community and to his school.  He is just another tragic, innocent victim of violence in Northern Ireland and I would like to extend our condolences to his colleagues, his community and his school.  He is no different from any of the other 57 or 58 victims but the fact is he was a teacher and a colleague.  I know the House will join with me in offering condolences to his staff and all the people associated with him.  He had recently retired, a man of 51 or 52 years of age, looking forward to an easier way of life.  This has been taken from him.  After working in the most tragic and stressful area of this island, he was not even allowed to enjoy peace in retirement.  I do not think his name has been announced yet, but I presume it will be announced shortly.  I should perhaps not have mentioned his name on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I would certainly have to go along with Senator Doyle on the time limit.  These are complex pieces of legislation and it is important they are teased out in detail.  I would be opposed to a time limit at this time.  I would ask that the Leader change his mind on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be concerned at the build-up we are seeing here in relation to these Bills.  As a general rule, I am not too opposed to limits on the amount of time allowed at Second Stage, but I am very concerned about the build-up and about what is going to happen on Committee and Report Stages.  I clearly see that we are moving towards a guillotine on an absolutely essential Bill, which is vital to elements such as the vocational education committees which appear to be about to be eliminated.  They will be treated in much the same way as the old committees of agriculture were treated, <Col N="1538" /> when they had only a short spell after the relevant Acts came in.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Telecom and the reasons behind the sacking of the chairman and on the various issues which seem to be crucial factors in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join with Senator O'Toole in expressing my condolences on the tragic death of a teacher in Northern Ireland last night.</P>
      <P>May I also ask for a debate on the whole question of dismissal of the chairman of Telecom Éireann and the statement by the Minister for Communications, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, that he is to be paid £30,000 by the State?  The whole circumstances surrounding the appointment and the dismissal require to be debated.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Order of Business for today, I have been calling for some time for a statement from the Leader of the House in relation to when the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Colleges Bill were to be discussed in this House and I got no clear statement about the length of time and when they were going to come before us. The Bills have been in the other House for over 12 months with three Ministers for Education.  We are to deal with them in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Order of Business. We are to deal with them in two days.  That is what has been presented to us.  That, in any circumstances, is a guillotine.  Considering that we have just received a Green Paper to discuss the future direction of education, it is a scandal. The least we could do is to leave these Bills over the summer period until we have the opportunity of teasing out a lot of the relevant material relating to third level and vocational training which is incorporated in this legislation so that we would have the opportunity of coming to it after reflection.  That would be the time to discuss these Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Leader of the House <Col N="1539" /> at this late stage not to force through these Bills before the summer recess but that they should be left until the autumn so that there would be proper consultation, proper consideration, proper reflection and the opportunity to incorporate the ideas of the Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to make my stand in relation to the rushing through of these Bills.  When the Dáil rises on Friday, what will happen to the amendments we will be putting forward?  Have we to accept now that we are merely going through the motion of discussion of amendments unless there is an agreement that the Dáil will come back to sit again to go through amendments that we will put forward in this House.  This happened a couple of years ago; it is very sinister and it is not democratic.  I do not accept that this Bill should be rushed through. If it has taken 12 months, surely another few months would make no difference. Will our amendments be taken and will the Dáil be coming back to consider them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues. There is an untoward haste about the disposal of two Bills that were allowed to languish in the other House for 12 months without any great urgency while various Minister came and went and carried on their various processes of discussion.  I would invite my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, who are aware of the concerns of many of their own electorate about these Bills, to tell the Minister that they want time to talk to people about them.  It is they who can pursuade, if not convince, if not threaten, the Minister that a different course of action should be taken &mdash; if not in the interests of education then in the interests of their relationship with their own constituents. I would suggest therefore that they would perhaps pass on that message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Leader will the almost invisible Minister for Education be here to deal with the Bills, or will it be his long-suffering and increasingly overworked <Col N="1540" /> junior Minister who will be dealing with it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.  I call the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, I was not finished.  That was a question. I want to reiterate what Senator Jackman said.  What is the meaning or significance of Committee Stage of these Bills next week or this week if the Dáil has adjourned?  Is it not really a farce? Why do we not simply adjourn on Friday and come back on 1 September and carry on where we left off?  That would be far more logical.  The amendments could go back to the Dáil when the Dáil get around to coming back.  That would be logical in the sense that it would cause no great delay and no procedural problems and we would not go through this Mickey Mouse farce of pretending to do something we cannot do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my job as Leader of the House to ensure that the legislative programme of the Government is brought through the House, and that is what we are doing here.  We are giving all day today to the Second Stages of both Bills and we will see how we get on there. We are here all day on Friday as well to deal with the Bills in question.</P>
      <P>With regard to a debate on Telecom, I will communicate with the Minister to see what her views are on that.</P>
      <P>I must take Senator Doyle up on the comment on bagmen and bagwomen.  Is the Senator insinuating that all the chairpersons of all the boards in the country are bagmen and bagwomen?</P>

      <P>I would remind the House that Item No. 3, the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991, is being debated with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1989, Bills were introduced to confer university status on the then National Institutes for Higher Education at Limerick and Dublin.  These were historic Bills since they established the first universities since the foundation of the State.  The two Bills before the House today are no less historic since they mark a stage of development of the non-university sector of higher education which warrants putting it on a statutory footing and vesting more authority and responsibility in the individual institutions in the conduct of their day to day affairs.</P>
      <P>The development of technical education can be traced back to the middle of the last century.  Technical education as we know it today had its origins in the Commission on Technical Education appointed in 1926 &ldquo;to enquire into and advise on the system of technical education in Saorstát Éireann in relation to the requirements of Trade and Industry&rdquo;. The commission reported in 1927 and its main recommendations formed the basis of the Vocational Education Act of 1930. Vocational and technical education developed very satisfactorily under the structures established by the 1930 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> The 1960s saw a major thrust in the development of technical education with the publication of <i>Investment in Education</i> in 1962 and <i>Training of Technicians in Ireland</i> in 1964.  The then Minister for Education, Dr. Patrick J. Hillery, in May 1963 signalled the Government's intention to arrange with appropriate vocational education committees for the provision of a limited number of technical colleges with regional status.</P>
    <P>In September 1966 a steering committee on technical education was established to advise the Minister generally on technical education.  The 1969 report of this committee formed the basis for the establishment, between 1970 and 1977, of the present network of regional technical colleges.  The steering committee broadly defined the role of these colleges, and by implication the role of other technical colleges, as being:</P>
    <P>education for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional level, notably in Engineering and Science, but also in Commercial, Linguistic and other specialties.</P>
    <P>The steering committee related the colleges to economic growth, both nationally and in their own particular regions.  Strong emphasis was placed on the need for continuing adaptation of the colleges which would be determined largely by initiatives at national and local level.  This adaptation has, in fact, happened. In the early years most of the work of the colleges was concerned with leaving certificate and other second level education as well as apprentice and technician training.  The development of the colleges over the years has seen a phasing out of second level education and a scaling down of apprentice training coupled with an increased involvement in certificate, diploma and degree level courses.</P>
    <P>The growth of the colleges has been phenomenal.  In the period since 1980 whole-time student numbers in the <Col N="1544" /> regional technical colleges have risen from 6,500 to almost 20,000, an increase of over 200 per cent.  In the same period whole-time enrolments in the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology have risen by over 100 per cent from 4,000 to 8,800.  The vocational education committee third level colleges, therefore, have over 28,000 whole-time students, which represents almost 40 per cent of the present total enrolment at third level in the country.</P>
    <P>Provision for apprentice and part-time study has always been a significant feature of the work of these colleges.  The extent of their contribution in this area can be judged from the fact that part-time students, including apprentices, account for over 20 per cent of the whole-time equivalent student numbers in the colleges.</P>
    <P>In the 21 years since the first of the regional technical colleges was established, they have developed and adapted to the stage that they can truly be said to have come of age.  These Bills represent in a symbolic sense the key usually associated with such an event.  They are the key to greater autonomy, to self-governance and to an improved and more effective interaction with business and industry which is a vital function of third level institutions in the modern world.</P>
    <P>These concepts are of equal importance in the Dublin Institute of Technology. The institute was formally established in 1978 by the City of Dublin vocational education committee on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to bring about better co-ordination of the work of its six third level colleges.  It would be wrong, however, to date the development of technical and technological education in Dublin from this time.  From the establishment of the College of Technology in Kevin Street in 1887, the third level colleges of the City of Dublin vocational education committee have developed into the Dublin Institute of Technology, the quality of which is well recognised and which is being established on a statutory basis by the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill.</P>
    <P>Over the first half of this century the Dublin colleges developed a wide range <Col N="1545" /> of technical courses, mainly on a part-time basis.  The late 1940s and early 1950s saw the development of the first whole-time post-leaving certificate courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges. The increasing pace of technological change brought new demands in the 1960s when a series of full-time technician courses were established for the first time in Ireland in response to the requests of a number of major employers.</P>
    <P>The 1970s were a period of considerable progress for the Dublin colleges: several new programmes were established and the number of both whole-time staff and students increased significantly; the foundations for the establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology were laid in 1970 when a joint academic council was set up to coordinate and oversee the third level academic work of the individual colleges, with a membership comprising appropriate senior academic and elected members; 1975, saw a partnership agreement with the University of Dublin under which degree awards are made available to successful graduates from a number of the higher level courses; an Apprenticeship Board was set up in 1976 to coordinate and oversee the work of the apprenticeship sector; and in 1978 the Dublin Institute of Technology was formally established by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to coordinate the work of the six colleges.</P>
    <P>In 1987 we saw the completion of the major extension to Kevin Street College, and a major new extension to Bolton Street College was opened in September 1990.  Work has commenced on the new college to be built at Bishop Street to accommodate the Colleges of Commerce and Marketing and Design.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology now offers a very extensive range of courses at apprenticeship, technician, degree, professional and post-graduate levels.  As I said earlier, there are currently over 8,000 whole-time students and some 15,000 part-time day and evening students, including 5,000 craft apprentices, enrolled.  Some would claim that <Col N="1546" /> this makes it the largest higher education institution in the country.  The wider activities of the institute include a number of special centres to provide specialised training and computer based services to industry and an increasing involvement in research and development.</P>
    <P>As the institute prepares to enter its second century of educational endeavour, it is particularly appropriate that its tremendous achievements should now be marked by this Bill, which will establish the institute on a statutory basis and through its provisions facilitate the continuing development and progress of the institute.</P>
    <P>The changed nature of the activities of the vocational education committee third level colleges over the years has led to concern about the limitations placed on them in having to operate under the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  This Act, since it relates predominantly to second level education, is inappropriate to third level institutions in the way they must operate today.</P>
    <P>The International Study Group on Technological Education was fulsome in its praise of the way in which these institutions have fulfilled their role and have become a significant and vital element in higher education.  The group nevertheless pointed out the difficulties about the legal basis for the involvement of these institutions in research and development work for business and industry and recommended that statutory provision be made for them.  These difficulties were further highlighted in the NBST discussion document <i>Barriers to Research and Consultancy in the Higher Education Sector.</i></P>
    <P>Activity in the research, consultancy and other industry and business linked areas is an important element of the role of higher education institutions in contributing to national development.  The lack of adequate statutory provisions to allow the regional and technological colleges to engage fully in these activities represents a serious problem.  These Bills seek to address this problem in two ways: First, they seek to strike a reasonable <Col N="1547" /> balance between freedom and autonomy for the institutions in their day to day operation while maintaining meaningful links with the vocational education committee system; second, they will enable the institutions to engage in research, development and consultancy work for business and industry as well as to enter into arrangements, including participation in limited companies, so as to exploit the results of this work.</P>
    <P>While continuing to play a vital role in the provision of highly skilled personnel essential to our evolving industrialised economy, the institutions will also be able in the future to increase and improve their interaction with business and industry and reach their full potential in contributing to national technological development.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline to the House the provisions of the Bills.  My remarks on the individual sections apply to both Bills and I will indicate points of difference as they arise.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the Acts coming into operation on a day appointed by ministerial order.  Section 2 deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bills.  Section 3 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill establishes the existing nine colleges, the new Regional Technical College, Tallaght, and the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology as regional technical colleges. These are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill.  Section 3 also provides for establishing the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music as schools of Cork Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for bringing other educational institutions within the scope of the Act and for such institutions or part of them becoming part of a regional technical college in the future.  Provision is also made for a change of name for a college, if required, in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provides for the establishment of the institute and for the incorporation of other educational institutions or a part of an institution into the institute <Col N="1548" /> in the future.  Section 4 sets out provisions for membership of colleges and the institute.  Section 5 outlines the functions of the colleges and the institute.  The principal function will be to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State.</P>
    <P>In the case of the regional technical colleges this provision will be with particular reference to the region served by the college.  In particular, the colleges and the institute will provide courses of study and enter into arrangements with appropriate authorities for the award of degrees, diplomas, certificates and other educational awards.  They may also engage in research, consultancy and development work, either separately or with other institutions, to provide services in relation to such work and enter into arrangements, including participation in limited liability companies, to exploit the results of this work.  The Dublin Institute of Technology will additionally award its own diplomas, certificates and other awards, excluding degrees.</P>
    <P>The function of the colleges and the institute will also include, where appropriate, the institution of scholarships and prizes, the maintenance of assets and the acquisition of land.  Additional functions may be assigned to the colleges or to the institute by order of the Minister, made with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Degree awarding powers could, at the appropriate time, be assigned to the Dublin Institute of Technology under this provision.  In the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, this latter provision was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure that the function of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards could be assigned to the institute at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the establishment of governing bodies.  In the regional technical colleges the governing body will consist of a chairman and 17 ordinary members and the director of <Col N="1549" /> the college.  The governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology will consist of the chairman, 18 ordinary members and the president of the institute.</P>
    <P>The ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the appropriate vocational education committees in accordance with the following &mdash; and I emphasise on the recommendation of the appropriate vocational education committees &mdash; six vocational education committee nominees; three staff representatives; two student representatives; one representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; one representative of the University of Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology Bill); and five persons nominated by organisations the vocational education committee considers require representation having regard to the courses and activities of the colleges and of the institute.  I hope Members will take note of the membership because this seems to have caused confusion, for whatever reason I do not know, but I think it is quite clear in the Bill.  This section also provides that the Minister in making appointments to a governing body shall ensure an appropriate gender balance.  The Second Schedule in both Bills sets out the detailed arrangements in relation to governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Changes to section 6 in the Dáil included provision for an additional staff and student representative on the regional technical college governing bodies and an additional student on the Dublin Institute of Technology governing body and provision for the chairman to be appointed by the Minister. Section 7 provides for the functions of the governing body, which will be exercised subject to general policy and to the programmes and budget approved annually. The functions will include managing the affairs of the college or institute and performing the functions conferred on the college or institute by the Act.</P>
    <P>This section provides also that a governing body shall, in performing its functions, have due regard to the preservation, promotion and use of the <Col N="1550" /> Irish language and to the preservation and development of the national culture; to gender equity and equality of opportunity in education; and to the statutory responsibilities in the provision of vocational and technical education of the vocational education committees.  These latter provisions were included through amendments tabled or accepted on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the dissolution of a governing body where the Minister is satisfied that its functions are not being duly and effectively discharged; or it fails to comply with a lawful order, direction or regulation of the Minister; or it fails to comply with any judgment or order of any court.  The section provides also for the appointment of a body of persons to carry out the functions of the dissolved governing body and for the re-establishment of a governing body within one year of the dissolution.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill provides for the appointment of a person to be director and chief officer of the college.  The person appointed to be chief officer of the Dublin Institute of Technology will be known as the president.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule of both Bills provides for other matters relating to these posts and provides that a person employed as principal of a regional technical college at the passing of this Act, will, if he so consents, be the first director of that college.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provides for directors of the institute who shall be responsible to the President and may be assigned such responsibilities in relation to the institute as the governing body decides.  A person employed as principal of an institution from which the institute is constituted will, if that person consents, be appointed a director of the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 11 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide for the appointment by the governing body of an academic council to assist it in the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work <Col N="1551" /> of the college or institute and to protect, maintain and develop the academic standards of the college or institute.  These functions of the academic council will include to design, develop and assist in implementing courses of study, to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement the course of study, to make recommendations on programmes for research and development work and to make recommendations for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 12 in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide that a college or the institute may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants, as subject to the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, the governing body thinks proper.</P>
    <P>These sections set out a number of other general provisions in relation to staff including the following: officers and servants will hold office or employment on such terms and conditions and be paid such remuneration and allowances as the college or the institute, with the approval of the Minister and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may determine; the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980 will apply; and certain provisions of the Vocational Education Act, 1930 and the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944, relating to suspension and dismissal of staff, will apply.</P>
    <P>In the Bills as initiated it was proposed that staff would be appointed as officers and servants of the college by the vocational education committee on the recommendations of the governing body and that they would also be officers and servants of the vocational education committee for the purpose of certain sections of the 1930 and 1944 Vocational Education Acts as well as the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980.  This dual structure caused confusion and concerns was expressed as to how it would operate on a day to day basis.  Clarification of this issue was sought in the <Col N="1552" /> Dáil.  Following further consideration of the matter the Bills were amended to provide that staff would be appointed by the college or the institute as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 13 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide for matters relating to existing staff who will become staff of the college or the institute.  Staff employed by a vocational education committee on work concerned with the administration of a college or other institution covered by the Bills may also be designated by the Minister for employment by the college or institute. Existing staff who become staff of a college or of the institute under this section shall not receive less remuneration or be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than those applying before the coming into operation of these Acts.  This section provides also for redistribution or re-arrangement of duties following consultation with relevant unions.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 14 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill set out the provisions in relation to the annual submission, approval and implementation of programmes and budgets for the colleges and the institute respectively.  They provide that governing bodies will annually prepare and submit to the vocational education committee operational programmes and budgets.  These will be submitted to the Minister with or without modification and will be approved by the Minister with or without modification.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 15 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide for the preparation and submission of an annual report and for the provision of such other information as may be required.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 16 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide that annual grants may be paid to the colleges and the institute out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 17 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide that <Col N="1553" /> a college or institute must keep proper accounts which will be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  These sections provide also that copies of the accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 18 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide that the college or institute may charge fees or make other appropriate charges for services or events.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 19 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill deal with the transfer of property and liabilities.  Land will be vested in the college or the institute and provision is made for the transfer of all other property and liabilities. In the Bills as initiated it was proposed that land and buildings would be held by the vocational education committee in trust for the purposes of the college or the institute.  Following further consideration of this question the Bills were amended to vest the land in the institutions themselves as this was more in line with the aim of devolving the maximum degree of responsibility within the framework of agreed policies, programmes and budgets.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 20 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide that contracts in force and legal proceedings pending before the establishment date will be preserved or continued by substituting the name of the college or the institute for that of the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 21 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill provide for inspection of a college or the institute for the purpose of reporting on the efficiency of the instruction being given or on any other matter relating to the operation of a college or the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill provides for a modification of section 7 (5) of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944.  This will <Col N="1554" /> provide that whenever an officer of a vocational education committee is suspended under the 1944 Act the committee may, if it thinks fit, make <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the suspended officer in lieu of the remuneration which, but for that suspension, would have been payable to that officer.  This new section is to give effect to a Government decision on the matter following concerns about situations where a formal inquiry and decision on a suspension may take considerable time to complete.  Non-payment of remuneration during what could be a lengthy period was considered to be an excessively harsh penalty.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of both Bills provides for the expenses incurred in administering the Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of both Bills provide for the making of regulations with regard to the operation of the colleges and the institute and for laying such regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of both Bills provides for the short title in each case.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the Bills establish the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology as self-governing institutions while providing for a strong continuing role for the vocational education committees.  They provide a framework for the operation of the institutions subject to general policy and within the operational programmes and budgets drawn up annually by the governing bodies subject to the approval of the appropriate vocational education committee and the Minister.  They give each institution, through its governing body, the responsibility and necessary authority to manage and administer its own affairs within approved policies, programmes and budget.  They establish governing bodies with appropriate representation from the vocational education committees, the staff, the students, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other interests appropriate to the activities of the institutions.  They provide for a president and directors for the institute and directors for the regional technical colleges.  They provide for the appointment of academic councils for the <Col N="1555" /> institute and regional technical colleges. They provide a statutory basis for participation in research, development and consultancy work, including, where appropriate, participation in limited companies in order to fully exploit results of such work.  They provide that the Dublin Institute of Technology will continue to have authority to award qualifications other than degree awards, which function can be conferred later by ministerial order made with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay a well deserved tribute to the vocational education committees under whose management the colleges have grown and developed.  These committees provided the base from which the colleges from such small beginnings have grown into the fine educational institutions which they are today.  These Bills will provide them with a statutory framework within which they will move to a new phase of growth and dynamic development.  It is fitting, therefore, that the role and ethos of the vocational education committees will continue to be strongly reflected through the provisions of these Bills.</P>
    <P>Governing bodies will be required to have regard to the statutory responsibilities of the vocational education committee, the vocational education committees will have the single largest representation on the governing bodies, they will have the power to nominate the organisations they consider require representation on the governing bodies and they will have a strong role in the annual agreement of programmes and a budget.  Some of the amendments made go a long way towards alleviating the fears of many members of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a particular tribute to the women and men who have given so much of their time, energy and effort as members of the boards of management and college councils in the regional technical colleges and as members of the governing body, the joint academic council <Col N="1556" /> and the college councils of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Their contribution to the development of the institutions has been a much valued one and I have no doubt that their expertise, enthusiasm and interest will continue to be available under the new structures being established under these Bills.</P>
    <P>The principals and staff of the colleges and of the institute have made an enormous and unique contribution to the success and development of these institutions over the years.  In thanking them I have no doubt that this contribution will continue and will be enhanced as a result of the provisions of these Bills.</P>
    <P>While the partnership between the institutions and the National Council for Educational Awards will continue, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the significant contribution to their development which has been made over the years by the NCEA.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical Colleges Bill is a recognition of the major strides made by these colleges over the past 21 years. It is also a recognition of their coming of age as a distinctive section in the higher education system.</P>
    <P>Similarly the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill acknowledges the outstanding contribution which the institute has made in the field of higher education and lays the foundation for the future development of the institute in a new and unified structure which will build on the solid base of achievement of individual colleges.</P>
    <P>These Bills are very comprehensive and they do all that is required to give the institutions the necessary autonomy and freedom in the conduct of their day to day activities which is in keeping with the state of development which they have reached.</P>
    <P>The legislative base which they give will allow them to operate effectively as a vital part of our third level education system.  These institutions have a distinctive challenging and dynamic contribution to make to higher education.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about their capability and capacity to meet the challenges <Col N="1557" /> ahead and thus to contribute to the enrichment and diversification of the educational provision available to students on the one hand and, on the other, to meet the economic, technological, social and cultural development needs of the nation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend these Bills to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, to the House.  He has had an extremely heavy workload since these Bills were introduced.  While I am glad to see him, I am very disappointed that we have not yet had an opportunity to meet the Minister Deputy Brennan in this House.  It is extraordinary that since Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Education and that is going back some time &mdash; we have not had the privilege of meeting any Minister for Education in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point now because I may not have the opportunity to do so again.  I have been a Member of the Seanad for three years and this is the first opportunity I have had to deal with an educational Bill.  It may be as long again before another opportunity arises.  I had hoped the Minister for Education would be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to put on the record my objection to and my irritation that no Member of this House was invited to the launch of the Green Paper.  I find it extraordinary that we, as social partners, were not considered important enough <Col N="1558" /> to be at the launch.  I will talk about ESF later.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, has given a comprehensive introduction to the Bill.  It is obvious that since these Bills were introduced in November 1991 considerable changes have been made.  This Government do not have an education policy as far as I can see but Fine Gael have a definite education policy.  Government amendments have been at variance with earlier amendments, depending on which Fianna Fáil Minister held the Education portfolio.</P>
    <P>The only time we debate education in this House is in response to Fine Gael Private Members' motions.  The Bills presented in November 1991 have been changed dramatically by each Minister for Education and I found it extremely difficult to find a thread of continuity in relation to policy running through them. The word that comes through in any educational debate is &ldquo;equity&rdquo; and I will refer to equity as regards access to third level.</P>
    <P>The Bills are being introduced at an extremely important time because post-Maastricht, it is essential for us to be in line with our EC partners when it comes to policy, academic qualifications and student mobility.  We are not in line with them when it comes to access to third level education and free third level education. The recent reference to ESF funding caused alarm.</P>
    <P>It is important that regional technical colleges be put firmly in the third level sector; the Dutch and the British would have been happier if they had been given second level status because then they would not be competing for funds post-Maastricht. It is essential that they are solidly placed in the realm of third level institutions and the Bills give them that status.</P>
    <P>I would have liked the name regional technical colleges to have been changed. Such an amendment was introduced on the different Stages in the Dáil and we will continue to address this point in the Seanad.  I do not have a hang-up with regional technical colleges as a name, but I think the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; still has <Col N="1559" /> second level connotations; I would have preferred &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo;.  If they were &ldquo;regional polytechnical colleges&rdquo;, it would not substantially alter the title of the Bills but it would reflect the all-embracing, multi-faceted status of the colleges.</P>
    <P>In Limerick, the term COACT was all-embracing in the sense that it included art and design, commerce and technology. Though the name was a bit unwieldy, it had a distinctiveness and reflected the ethos of that college.</P>
    <P>Will the Dáil be recalled if amendments are accepted on Committee Stage or are we talking in a vacuum?  We understand the need to have the Bills passed to give these institutions third level status, but we are very unhappy with the lack of consultation and the time given to debate the Bills.  I expected to spend the summer reading through these Bills in great detail, and I would have enjoyed doing so.  The Minister, Deputy Aylward, on that eventful, hot, June weekend met the irate members of IVEA and by so doing, respected the consultative process. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Minister, Deputy Brennan.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned that we have had a number of versions of this Bill &mdash; the first introduced by the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke; this was changed by the next Minister, Deputy Davern; Deputy Brennan, the present Minister, changed that Bill; it was amended on Committee and Report Stages; and now we have this version.</P>
    <P>I found it extraordinary that the Minister of State complimented the vocational education committee's for what they have done for education because it reflected a change in attitude.  He was at great pains in the latter stages of his presentation to ensure that their work was appreciated.  They were pioneers in the area of providing extra curicular activities for the disadvantaged and indeed one could say that they pioneered the whole adult education programme.  It could be said that vocational education committees are ahead of their time.  It is important that their major contribution <Col N="1560" /> to Irish education be recognised.  They have been seen for too long as the cinderella of the system as we moved more and more towards the academic aspects of education.</P>
    <P>We were not waiting for the Culliton report to remind us of the necessity to put more emphasis on vocational education and training, though I disagree with the notion of two separate streams.  I favour an integrated process and I hope that the Bill will result in the colleges embracing the humanities to a greater degree as well as the cultural and artistic world, as exemplified by the College of Art and Design in Limerick, which I will speak about later, and in relation to science and technology, electronics and business. The only element within the regional technical colleges that perhaps needs to be addressed more is the area of humanities. Outside of that they are all-embracing. What they are doing is reflecting what education should be about.  We have been looking for this for some time: that one would work right through the different systems from the day one enters a school, until one emerges with a degree or diploma.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick, set up as a national institute of higher education, took some time to become all-embracing, but it has achieved that now with the integration of the humanities faculties, the colleges of education, etc.  The regional technical colleges are in an ideal position now to show what education should be, and not on the lines of the Culliton report, which keeps the academic and vocational aspects of education separate.  The all rounded person is not a technocrat only.  One could be an academic and have technocratic leanings. One could be a technocrat but have a very well balanced philosophical approach to life.  Integrated education produces a well rounded person.</P>
    <P>I am dwelling on the ethos of education because it is extremely important.  Later on I can go through the provisions of the Bills.  We want education for life; we want education for the whole person.  We do not want to go off on different tracks and educate people solely for employment <Col N="1561" /> purposes.  We should not lose sight of the fact that in this country we are still lauded as being foremost in the educational field. The Scottish system is close to ours, but the store and value we put on education has stood us well.  It will do so as long as we are not carried away by buzz words and forget what education is all about.</P>
    <P>The buzz words at the time of the Maastricht referendum are very relevant to the Bills before us today, particularly in the light of democratic accountability. People were told that decisions would be brought down to basic levels and that there would be a move away from centralised structures.  We were told something would be done about the democratic deficit.  Now that we have explained to the general public what the principle of subsidiarity is all about, we should ensure that this is reflected in their day-to-day lives.  This is what enthused people to vote for Maastricht.  We can take all those buzz words and we can apply them to regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Many of the infamous 40 amendments that appeared on that memorable June weekend are gone and new amendments brought back the vocational education committees in a limited fashion.  There was an about-turn in response to lobbying, deputations and a parliamentary party meeting.  I do not see anything wrong with that as it is part and parcel of politics.  I do not like &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; politics at the best of times and I certainly do not like it in the context of education because it is too important an issue.</P>
    <P>We do not want centralised system of education.  It is very important that the regionalisation concept be actively pursued in relation to the regional technical colleges.  When I say the regions, we must take into consideration vocational education committees that are not necessarily involved with the regional technical colleges.  Take Limerick as an example. We will be going out to Senator Honan's constituency, where there are representatives from Clare on the advisory council of COACT, of which I am a member, soon to be the Regional Technical College, Limerick.  It is very important that the associated authorities have <Col N="1562" /> an input into how the regional technical colleges work, because one should never underestimate the knowledge of local councillors when it comes to the issues on the ground.  This includes such matters as who can or cannot afford to send their children to third level institutions and what are the basic facts as regards accountability.</P>
    <P>As a member of the vocational education committee I know that every penny is accounted for.  I am sure Senator McKenna would agree with me that the vocational education committees put great store on accountability and on the input made by vocational education committee members, councillors and associated members.  They have struck a balance between officialdom and what is happening on the ground.  There was a fear in the past that the academics knew everything and somehow we were second class coffee beans.  That is not the case in the realm of education, because the practical input made by those who are in touch with what people want is an essential aspect.</P>
    <P>As regards the controversy surrounding the June amendments, I am glad that the Minister backtracked.  I had hoped the Minister, Deputy Brennan, would be here to hear what I have to say. I hope he is aware of the needs of rural Ireland when it comes to setting up new regional technical colleges.  Hopefully, a new regional college will come onstream in Castlebar.  It is great to see the members of a community come together and realise the catalyst a regional technical college can be in relation to the economic, industrial, commercial, cultural, intellectual and educational life of the community.</P>
    <P>There is also a regional technical college planned for Thurles.  I would be very anxious to see this.  I am sure Senator Doyle will make great play for a regional technical college in Wexford. Eventually, I can see that the regional technical colleges in the major cities will have a status that will be equal to the status afforded to Trinity College, UCD, UCC, Maynooth, the University of Limerick <Col N="1563" /> and Dublin City University.  We want status for these regional technical colleges.  We do not want only nine regional technical colleges and six colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology; we want many more.  The basic thrust of the memorandum on higher education, which relates to the European Community, emphasises over and over again the need for third level education in order that Europe will be able to withstand the competition now emerging from Korea, Japan and South East Asia, where the pumping of moneys into education has to be seen to be believed. Although in middle life, I am anxious to learn and I would be able to master languages more successfully if I had another chance at life.  One can do much at middle age and have enthusiasm, but flexibility for learning is confined to youth.  Minister Aylward is smiling because he is in that category and I am sure he would be adept at learning Japanese and other languages.</P>

      <P>I want to make it known to the House that there are 20 young people in the Gallery visiting Ireland from Lithuania to learn about farming.  We welcome them to Ireland and hope they will have a nice stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Lithuanian students, perhaps we will have a partnership between one of the emerging regional technical colleges and Lithuania with exchanges of Lithuanian students and Irish students.  Education is all about partnership and it is symbolic that these young people should be here today when we are debating a matter which is of such importance to our young people.  These students are in the same age group as our third level students.  We have been very pleased in this country with the numbers of students availing of third level education. In this memorandum the importance of access is emphasised.  I am not being political but ESF funding and the announcement made by the Minister the other day do nothing for the people who <Col N="1564" /> have made representations to me about access to third level.</P>
      <P>This document is important because it introduces the notion of equity which Minister Brennan has mentioned over and over again.  If we were to count the number of times the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; is used in <i>Education for a Changing World</i> we would be here for quite some time.  A point was made about £50,000 per annum and the £15,000 per annum earners living next door to each other.  The £50,000 earner's child will still have access to third level, the £15,000 earner's will not.  If only one student cannot get through to third level because of the means testing element that student is deprived of an opportunity.  That situation must be addressed in the context of this Bill where we are talking about regional technical colleges and European Social Fund money.  It would be ironic if at the end of the day the Minister went back to 20,000, which was the number of students that would be financed from Brussels.  It was the requirement for £2,600 which caused the problem.  Because of this means testing, students, who eventually will go on the dole at a cost to the Exchequer of £50 a week might have a job for life which these regional technical colleges could prepare them for at a cost of £39 a week.  I feel strongly about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Members on all sides of the House who responded to a request that the Minister be asked to reconsider income levels.  I appreciate and welcome the means test threshold limit being raised but it has done nothing for members of a deputation who were here yesterday from my own area.  These parents have worked for 30 years with one objective &mdash; not to retire happily ever after, not to go to Bermuda on a holiday, not to have some dream of theirs realised, but to ensure that their children would have a third level education.  Now they will not be able to afford to send their children to regional technical colleges. Colleges have no relevance unless they are full of young people.  As I said, if only one person is disadvantaged as regards access, it is one too many.  How to enable <Col N="1565" /> children from disadvantaged areas to attend third level is a more complex issue. As a teacher for 25 years in an inner city school in South Hill, which has 80 per cent unemployment, I know that the percentage of those students who might obtain a place in a regional technical college would not bear reckoning.  That problem cannot be solved overnight, but must be worked at by all of us.  This is not politics but education policy.  We have to look at various means by which students might avail of third level education.  The take-up of grants is greatest by the self-employed. That is an equity issue which is not adequately addressed here.  It will have to be addressed by the Revenue Commissioners and through improved funding.  Under Maastricht if we get more funds from Europe they should be put into access to education for the disadvantaged. The Minister in <i>Education for a Changing World</i> emphasises the plight of the disadvantaged.  A long term policy is required here and we will be pursuing it strongly during the six months of debate on this Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at what it says in the Green Paper concerning the vocational education committees.  It is important to look beyond the regional technical colleges.  Even though Minister Alyward complimented the vocational education committees over and over again for their role in education, and rightly so, I am concerned about the four skimpy paragraphs in the Green Paper on the subject of the vocational education committees.  I would have thought they merited greater attention and concentration. I am sure that was one of the reasons everybody in education reacted so vehemently.  I am glad to see Senator Honan nodding; she is a very practical woman and always speaks out on issues she feels strongly about.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees involvement in adult education, literacy and community education, youth and sports services and a range of special services is extremely laudable but the vocational education committee has always done that work.  There is one line in the paper which says that the <Col N="1566" /> vocational education committees will play an important role in the development and provision of vocational education and training, but nothing is spelled out there.  To say that they will be coordinating, that they will have a support role at local level in the proposed expansion activities, is all peripheral stuff.  That refers to the area in which the vocational education committees have always been successful.  I would like to know what Minister Brennan has in mind for the vocational education committees.  It is obvious he had nothing in mind for them midway through these Bills where these 40 amendments would send them skiting off to where I do not know.</P>
    <P>I would like Minister Brennan to take a tour of the vocational education committees throughout the country.  If he intends staying in Education he would do well to see what they are pioneering. As a member of a vocational education committee I have been in a position to evaluate, compare and contrast vocational education committees.  I was astounded by the innovative streak of the vocational education committee and by the fact that they are not hamstrung by centralised Government to the same degree as second level institutions.  In Kilfinnane, County Limerick, the vocational education committee developed a pursuit centre which receives students at the moment from other EC countries and which has been a great value to the local community.  Is all of that going to be written out?  That was a link with regional technical colleges with an emphasis on languages.</P>
    <P>The mind boggles as to the potential of this centre.  It is creating tourism opportunities for the local community. The parents of these children are coming to learn languages.  The benefits have spilt out into the greater Limerick area and over the borders into Cork.  It has been a major success story for County Limerick.  An old vocational education committee building &mdash; obviously, well-built at the time of the Education Act &mdash; was enhanced and not allowed to become derelict.  It was not going to be bought by anybody so it was developed into an <Col N="1567" /> education centre and became a success story.  These are the things that Minister Brennan does not seem to be aware of. That centre is evidence of entrepreneurship, innovation, and enterprise culture.  We were not waiting for Maastricht or Culliton to put enterprise culture on the map.</P>
    <P>Enterprise culture has been going in education in Ireland at first, second and third levels but, unfortunately, as I always thought, it was taking place in a vacuum.  We were there for parents in the early stages with examinations and parent-teacher meetings, but education were never seen as partners in the development of a community.  I feel strongly that the ethos of a town, city or village is built around its educational institutions.  I sound a note of warning to Minister Brennan and I hope he has now backtracked on this and that he will not wait for the six months discussion.  He should abandon the closure of small schools until he has carried out a study of each school.  Parents will decide whether they want one teacher or multiteacher schools.  I can see that Senator McKenna is irritated with me.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage, it is important that we look at the Green Paper to see what is said there about the vocational education committees and the regional technical colleges.  The Green Paper is not a document; it has nothing to do with these Bills.  These Bills are part and parcel of it.  I want to know which comes first?  Is the cart before the horse?  Obviously it was in relation to the vocational education committees.  We have seen the rôle of the vocational education committees confined to four <Col N="1568" /> skimpy paragraphs.  It was obvious in the Green Paper that the vocational education committees were going to be axed. I am getting annoyed because it is important that this Green Paper should show the light for education in the future.  Only that Minister Brennan was brought back to basics, that vocational education committee structure would have gone, as intimated by the few skimpy paragraphs in the Green Paper, <i>Education for a Changing World.</i></P>
      <P>I would like to look at another aspect of the Green Paper that worries me.  Perhaps on Report Stage the Minister will be able to tell us about this new body, CEVA, which seems to be an amalgam of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are discussing the Bill and I would appreciate if the Senator would stick to the Bill.  If the Senator wants to make reference to the Green Paper in certain related places that is allowed, but she cannot ask a question on the Green Paper discussion document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the Chair's ruling.  For three years we have not had a debate on education in the House and many issues raised today could have been debated previously.  Education is so important that I find it extraordinary that we have not had an opportunity in three years to debate it, except in Private Member's time.</P>
      <P>According to the Bill, there will be major movements back and forth on the rôle of the NCEA.  I go back to Minister O'Rourke's introductory statement which I accept totally.  I have given credit on many occasions to Minister O'Rourke for her input to education.  She stated here in her opening remarks the need to strike a reasonable balance between greater freedom and autonomy for the institutions in their day to day operation while maintaining traditional links with the vocational education committee system.  That is the basis of these Bills, both of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and I accept that totally.</P>
      <P>The institutions are allowed to engage in research, development and consultancy work for business and industry, including participation in limited companies so as to exploit the results of their work.  These objectives are laudable. Only for opposition in the Dáil by Fine Gael and Labour those two objectives would have gone out the window.  Thanks are due to the firm commitment and steering of the Fine Gael and Labour spokespersons on education in the Dáil; they worked towards their objectives despite aberrations by the Government at various times.  I compliment them for keeping their objectives in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that has emerged today is the result of the Opposition's contributions.  I <Col N="1570" /> include Minister Aylward in my compliments because he was quick to respond to the practical amendments that were put down.  I would prefer to be dealing with him as Minister for Education; he has a great understanding of the subject.</P>
    <P>The technical education success story has been mentioned many times and the vocational education committees must take credit for much of it.  In 1990, there were 22,200 students, the latest figure I have, and I hope there will be employment and opportunities for mobility at the end of the line.  The expansion since 1986 has been extraordinary and amounts to 10,600 students.  It is wonderful to think that the regional technical colleges were able to respond so quickly and so readily to national requirements.  They had ESF funding but they also had an innovative approach and a great feel for education.  We did not have to wait for the Culliton report to tell us that the area of technology and science needed to be addressed.  I compliment all concerned on responding so quickly to provide the skills needed in science, technology, computers, electronics, art and design, culture, etc.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Minister Brennan is not here now because I have a few points to make to him relevant to the Limerick colleges which will still be known as COACT until this Bill goes through. Everybody is aware both nationally and internationally of the status associated with the College of Art and Design there and the fashion awards students there have carried off.  It has been an extraordinary success story despite the lack of accommodation, drab conditions and facing the most difficult circumstances. Its success is a testimony to the commitment and expertise of the staff of the principal, Mr. Dennison, and of all concerned. It is one of the success stories of Limerick.</P>
    <P>At present the college is looking for another site, but wishes to remain in the city centre.  I hope Minister Aylward will make Minister Brennan aware of their desire to remain in the historic city of Limerick.  They do not want to go out to Moylish College to a greenfield site.  They <Col N="1571" /> want to stay in the heritage precinct, as it is known, within the environs of King John's castle, the courthouse, and George's Quay, where they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are two sites in question and we hope the site chosen will be in the inner city of Limerick.  Students need the agencies and services in the city and would not benefit from being located miles out in the suburbs.  Everybody recognises that, and Limerick City vocational education committee are aware of it.  The ethos of the College of Art and Design must reflect the ancient city.  Students look for inspiration to their surroundings and there is more potential for inspiration in the antiquity of Limerick city than out in the suburbs where students would be deprived of the aesthetics and background of a city.</P>
    <P>In relation to Limerick, as any Members here who have visited Limerick will know, the city has a number of third level college architectural black spots.  I would describe them at this stage as almost derelict, because they were badly built and did not reflect third level status. It must be galling for students in Limerick to compare their buildings with the tremendous campus of the University of Limerick, where it is a case of hats off to Dr. Ed. Walsh.  Accommodation at the moment is urgently needed there and I hope that the commitments given to build in Limerick will be honoured.  I will push for my own area here, as I know other Members will for theirs.</P>
    <P>I hope that all the new buildings for regional technical colleges and colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology will reflect the 1990s and the next century and will be seen as worthy of the tremendous work being done in these colleges.  The present buildings in Limerick are a reflection on the architects.  I do not know who designed them but he should be the last person anybody would approach on the subject of aesthetics.  Money is required to provide wonderful buildings, but a lowly house can be well designed. I do not know how students can bear to work in these buildings with low ceilings, <Col N="1572" /> long corridors, heavy machinery and drab surroundings.  Paint improves them, but does not alter them.</P>

      <P>Setanta would be palatial by comparison.  Unless you were involved there, one visit would ensure that you never returned.  The buildings are environmentally unfriendly, which must also be taken into account.  Whatever architects are engaged for the next phases of these colleges, I hope they will be tried and tested and capable of constructing beautiful institutions and establishments. There is no point in having a nice title unless there is a good building to go with it.</P>
      <P>These Bills are being rushed through Second Stage today.  The Second Stage of many less important Bills has gone on for weeks and weeks, and here we are trying to condense two important Bills into a short time.  It is going to be difficult to finish and I will not be finishing for some time.</P>
      <P>It is urgent that these colleges be awarded appropriate status; there should be no politics in relation to that.  I do not mean this minute but sometime this year. If we wish to liaise with partners within the EC for programmes and to be involved with Comett, Tempus and Erasmus, it is important that the links should be forged now.  It is important that the status of third level colleges be established so that nothing will stand in the way of their making contacts abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proper contains references to functions, composition, <Col N="1573" /> budgets, the role of the director and the various other aspects that are not too contentious.  Despite Minister Aylward's comments that we should be happy at this stage, we are not happy with the membership.  We wanted the vocational education committee to be members.  There was a debate on this in the Dáil which I will not open again. Membership is honorary, which is all the more reason why the vocational education committees should partake of the glory of the present stage because they were instrumental in bringing technical education to its present position.  It is important that they be included with other honorary members, if one wants to call them that.</P>
      <P>Section 4 provides that the members college shall be the governing body, the academic council, members of staff, registered students, graduates and such other persons as the governing body may appoint to the membership.  I would like the vocational education committee to be included in membership of the colleges and this will be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The next section describes the functions which are well spelt out.  They are the provision of vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, social, industrial and cultural development of the State; we are happy with that.  regional technical colleges will be able to enter into arrangements with the NCEA, though I still wonder with whom they will enter into arrangements because of this new creature, CEVA, that has emerged in the Green Paper, seeing it is of relevance to the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  The research, consultancy and developmental work provisions are fine.  The awarding of scholarships and prizes is fine also and so we come to the governing bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards research and development, I hope the regional technical colleges will be independent of, while retaining links with, the universities.  A tremendous amount of research and development is going on at the moment in our third level institutions.  I am aware of the link <Col N="1574" /> between the University of Limerick and Plassey Technological Park, which is working well.  It is in an embryonic stage with Japanese involvement.  I hope the research and developmental role of the regional technical colleges will not be diminished.  I hope the regional technical colleges work may be integrated with that of the universities &mdash; for instance, Limerick regional technical college with the University of Limerick.  I know that Cork Regional Technical College has a link with University College, Cork, but I do not think there should be any clash or competition.  Competition is all right only if it brings out the best on both sides.  I hope that beneficial linkages will be forged there.  In the future I do not want regional technical colleges to be regarded in one way and universities in another. There will be mutual toing and froing between the colleges, particularly from post diploma and certificate stages on to the degree stage.  I presume that all of that will be worked out by the Higher Education Authority.  I feel strongly that within a region, if one cannot get cooperation between third level institutions there, one is not adhering to the concept of regionalisation.</P>
    <P>The research and development work of the regional technical colleges will be a catalyst for improving the economic life of a region.  The facts illustrate that the economic life of regions having third level institutions takes off and prospers.  We want to keep people within the regions and that is why it is so important that there should be access to regional colleges for students of those regions.  It is interesting to note that in the Regional Technical College, Limerick &mdash; or Regional Polytechnical College Limerick as it will hopefully be called &mdash; there are students from the Thirty-two Counties. Although the regional colleges will take in students primarily from their own areas, there will be a unified approach to the needs of all areas.</P>
    <P>Why was there disagreement between the three Ministers as to how many members should constitute this governing body?  It is not a very difficult matter to resolve.  I would have liked the <Col N="1575" /> governing body to consist of 22 members as Minister O'Rourke suggested.  That would have reflected the views of all the bodies that should be involved and would not have been unwieldly.  Before the Bill was amended in the Dáil by Fine Gael and Labour the number of members was 15 but that has been increased to 17.  We will still be pressing that amendment.  I know Minister Aylward would love to see the end of this contentious issue but the vocational education committees want seven members, not six and five rather than three to be members of a local authority.  Surely the Fianna Fáil Senators will be aware that this will create no great problem and that increasing the number of members from three to five should make Fianna Fáil councillors very happy.</P>
    <P>I wounder if the vocational education committees would have been side-stepped to such a degree if the uninterrupted Fianna Fáil rule of decades had continued. Many of the vocational education committees, for instance County Limerick vocational education committee, are now Fine Gael run, or, at least, its Chairman is Fine Gael; obviously it has Fianna Fáil representatives on it.  Has this axing job anything to do with Fine Gael having suddenly interrupted that long term reign?</P>

      <P>I am glad a representative of ICTU will be on the body.  Having a nomination from the Labour panel and having been an active member of ASTI, I would wish to see a trade union member on that body.  Trade union members do not see themselves exclusively as the representatives of workers.  There were references in the Dáil to the employers having a representative, but I do not see it here.  I would have liked to include representatives of FÁS and Eolas and I will be putting down amendments to that effect.  I know there is scope for other bodies to select members, but, because of the close liaison between the vocational education committee and European Social Funding for education and training, there should be a representative of FÁS on the governing body because they get a large portion of the ESF budget for training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of equal importance to have a representative of Eolas.  I could mention <Col N="1577" /> CERT and others but I choose Eolas and FÁS because of the importance of research and development.  The role of research and development and integration is very important.  A chapter in the Culliton report devoted to education refers to research and development and the role Eolas should play.  A representative of these bodies might find his or her way in through another route but I would have preferred to have them specified in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the gender issue has been taken on board but, if it were not, you might as well throw out the Green Paper before we even debate it because equity is related to gender equality which is a very big thread running through the Green Paper.  If Minister Brennan has the concept of equity in mind in relation to the Green Paper, he should have had it in mind in relation to this Bill but he did not until it was mentioned to him by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the legalities are in using such terms as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  I hate using the word chairman because it rules out 51 per cent of the population.  Is there a legal reason for using the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;?  I am happy to be a chairperson.  I suppose I should be &ldquo;Jackperson&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Jackman&rdquo; but I will not go into that today.  Why this issue was not addressed immediately is beyond me.  &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo; is far more acceptable to me than &ldquo;madam chairman&rdquo; because that creates confusion in people's minds as to how to refer to one.  People do not know the protocol.  Chairperson is unambiguous and can be used to refer to a man or woman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; would be innovative for the regional technical colleges.  I am sure they would be the first educational establishment to use the term.  As they are known for innovation, this is another way they can lead the way.  I give this matter so much importance because we are talking about education.  Women keep the education system operating from pre-school on &mdash; whether we are talking about Montessori or Froebel systems. We do not have a pre-school policy, but that is for another day, nor is it mentioned in the Green Paper either.  The gurus of this world are wondering what is going to happen the balance of male/female teachers in primary schools and I am sure Senator O'Toole will dwell at length on this.  What will happen if children do not have the role model of the man in the classroom?  What sort of boys and girls are we going to be producing at the end of the day?  Even if all primary school teachers were women, I still believe they would be able to bring out well developed students.  The gender equity would not be a problem there. There are women teachers all the way through the primary sector, but out of the 3,200 principals only 1,400 are women.  This is not bad; but when you consider that 80 per cent of primary teachers are women you see that it does not reflect gender equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level the same thing happens. People will say women do not get promotion because they do not push for <Col N="1579" /> it.  Some women do, but not all.  Why do the other women not push for it?  Equality committees in INTO, ASTI and TUI have been exploring this.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that there is no equality committee at third level.  That is a matter we will be raising again in relation to the Green Paper.  There is a great lack of female representation in third level teaching.  Why is there no equality officer at that level?  A boy and girl leave third level and their last experience of education has been male dominated. They go out as educators or to other professions having been educated predominantly by men.  They go into business and become leaders of the community.  How are they going to sell the idea of equality in the workplace if they did not get it through their educational experiences?  This is a golden opportunity for the regional technical colleges to show that they believe in equity.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>In making appointments to a governing body pursuant to subsection (4) of this section the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented and shall ensure an appropriate gender balance as determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>That is the same old jargon we always hear; but, as far as I am concerned, we are 51 per cent of the population and we want 51 per cent of the representation. We are not getting even 50 per cent.  I do not accept that the Minister can just appoint a token woman from time to time.  We want it to be one of every two. As we want a male student and a female student.  We want the academic staff members to be male and female, the nonacademic staff members can be either male or female.  In relation to the trade union representative we want women to have as good a chance of being nominated as men.  We want the vocational education committees to ensure that they have women involved.  There are women in vocational education committees and <Col N="1580" /> it is hoped that they would have an input. At the end of the day we want the chairperson to be a woman.  We also want a woman principal.  The nine principals at the moment are nine men.  There is no reason why a woman would not hold one of those posts.  There is a whole area there that consists of a few little lines which were pushed in by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on eliminating the nomination procedure for membership.  I know there was a lot of soul searching, but I am glad it is an election process rather than by nomination. I am sure Deputy Aylward was involved in having that pushed through. That is to be recognised and accepted and I am very pleased about it, but it was not achieved without a tremendous amount of hassle from the people who were trying to get this through in the other House.</P>
    <P>I will go on to the Second Schedule relating to the election of the chairperson, as I would insist on calling him or her.  I was surprised at this provision, particularly in view of debates on nominated persons in relation to Telecom.  We have had nothing but trouble over recent years in regard to these nominees.  I would much prefer people to be elected. What is wrong with electing the person? The Bill would suggest that the Minister has the preponderance of wisdom required to make this decision.  I would much prefer to have a collective body electing a member rather than having a nominated person put in.  It is hard for a nominated person to be accepted.  One has to fight one's election.</P>

      <P>As regards the chairperson, the vocational education committee can be written off; there is absolutely no reference to any input by the vocational education committee. Paragraph 2 (2) states: &ldquo;The chairman shall be appointed by the Minister and may be removed from office by the Minister.&rdquo; That would be done by Minister Brennan.  I would not want that, particularly in the light of his less than great intuition in selecting nominees in other areas.  That is the kernel of the issue as far as I am concerned.  There is no problem with an election.  You go through the process, emerge from it and are accepted. You do not have governors or governing bodies looking for your resignation if you are elected.  They put you in and they can take you out.  That is something which I feel very strongly about.</P>
      <P>In relation to many of the functions of the director, the vocational education committee has again been written out.  I hope there will be flexibility as regards the regional technical colleges moving towards degree status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the whole question of degrees and ESF funding.  In the case of many students who would have continued to degree status, their parents would have taken cognisance of the second two years as regards the family <Col N="1582" /> budget and they would have needed the ESF maintenance and so on for the first two years.  We must keep in mind that parents planning for their children's education relied on the ESF funding to give them a breather which would enable them to afford the later years leading to degree status.  I presume that the Bills will give students the opportunity of going into universities in the region after certification and diploma, that integration will be further developed in new areas of expertise, and that new disciplines and new degrees will be coming through in our universities.  I hope the regional technical colleges will not be swamped in the degree area by having a lower status accorded to their degrees than that of a degree under the NUI system or that of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>On coming in here three years ago I asked for representation in the Seanad for the University of Limerick and Dublin City University.  I will certainly be looking for representation for the regional technical colleges when they are fully fledged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone through the most contentious areas in relation to the problems that had to be sorted out in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There is one further matter I wish to raise and it relates to something which I hope will never happen again, an epistle from Minister Brennan to the vocational education committees for the information only of the Fianna Fáil councillors on the vocational education committees. I see this Bill as Minister Aylward's Bill, because he has given it most time and seems to have taken on board the issues that were causing concern.  Minister Brennan's letter was sent to the chief executive officer marked &ldquo;For the information of Fianna Fáil Members only&rdquo;.  It was not accepted and it embarrassed our Fianna Fáil colleagues.  We get on extremely well with our Fianna Fáil colleagues on County Limerick Vocational Education Committee, some of whom are educators.  I deplore that sort of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what we want in the Colleges Bill and it did not require Minister Brennan's letter to us to know the basic objectives.  I know it was a reaction to representations from the IVEA.  I cannot understand this sort of behaviour.  The Minister said in his letter that he wants to give the college full responsibility for their day-to-day operations.  That is what they would need.  He wants to maintain the colleges within the overall ambit of the vocational education committee sector by requiring them to submit plans for approval by vocational education committees and subsequent approval by the Minister and by providing strong representation <Col N="1584" /> of the vocational education committees and the governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Why did he have to write this letter when all this is in the Bill for us to debate? He went on to talk about successive Ministers listening to representations and seeking to address legitimate concerns without violating the basic thrust of the Bill, with which IVEA say they are in agreement.  There is a whole reference to all the times the Minister met them, but as far as I can see he met them only once, on 6 May, when he received detailed proposals which he promised to examine carefully.</P>
    <P>I have already complimented Minister Aylward today.  He did meet with the irate IVEA members and was there to face the music.  He listened to their representations and then introduced a series of additional amendments in the Dáil. He took responsibility.  I know Minister Brennan may have been in hospital at the time; but I just wonder if Minister Brennan, without any input from Minister Aylward, were taking this Bill through the House, where would we be today?  I am not happy with it as it is, but I am happy with certain aspects of it.  I would query Minister Brennan's whole stance in relation to this Bill.  I would like to know whether they are Minister Brennan's or Minister Aylward's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter goes on to say that vocational education committees may initiate action and gives a whole list of what the vocational education committees are going to do.  They will have the power to appoint ordinary members. The Minister's power to direct governing bodies to cease providing courses is being deleted; we were delighted to see the Minister accede to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the format of programmes and budget, the Minister's role is being changed from that of &ldquo;determining&rdquo; to &ldquo;approving&rdquo;, in response to an IVEA request.  That is to be welcomed. In relation to seeking information from a college, the requirement <Col N="1585" /> that the vocational education committee could only do so &ldquo;with the agreement of the Minister&rdquo; has been removed.  I am glad to see all these things going out, but they have only gone as a result of the IVEA pushing Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Chairman, in the Bill, as initiated, was to be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  Bearing in mind the need to have an independent Chairman and in line with the position in other third level institutions an amendment was proposed to provide that the Chairman would be a Ministerial nominee.</P>
    <P>What is meant by independent?  Does it mean independent of the governing body or simply that he will be independent because the Minister says so?</P>
    <P>I still believe the chairperson should be elected, not nominated.  What happens if this independent chairman has no educational background?  Culliton came out with conclusions in relation to education and there is not one educator involved in the Tansey-Roche report.  That seems to be the flavour of the month, that people outside education know far more about education than the practitioners.  I do not accept that.  I am not saying we know everything or that matters should be determined exclusively by educators.  We have brought in people in the area of curriculum development, on course committees and right through the system, but I do not want people outside education dictating the whole ethos of education.  I would not go in as a chairperson of the medical establishment without having a clue about what goes on in the medical area, or go into the legal establishment without any knowledge of that profession. Why does education seem to be the ragbag into which everybody and anybody can be shoved?  The reason is that people say they have gone through the system.  We have seen this as teachers: if the child does well, it was because she was bright; if she does badly, the teacher was to blame.  I am not saying all parents believe that but there is a certain percentage <Col N="1586" /> who think they know a lot about education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator McKenna agrees because that is a fact of life.</P>
      <P>Now it has gone beyond primary second level into the whole of third level. The Minister, if he does not accept our amendment, is bringing in this independent nominated chairman, who will solve everything although he may not have an iota of understanding of education. We will be watching who the men and women are who are appointed in respect of the nine colleges and the goods will want to be delivered from the point of view of the needs of the colleges, of the vocational education committee, the staff, the governing body and from the directors' viewpoint.  Given the way nominees are going at the moment, it will be a hard, tough job.  Perhaps, at the end of the day nobody will want the nomination. We might have to come back to the process of holding an election.  Being chairperson of a board carries a lot of responsibility.  One can be in today and out tomorrow.  We may be back to the idea of an election if our amendment is not accepted.  That is what should happen in the end.</P>
      <P>Minister Aylward, in his summary, made all the belated comments I would want.  I do not see them as belated.  As a member of the vocational education committee I can say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the vocational education committee for what they have done right through the decades. I wish the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges the best of luck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will have an exciting time in the future in carving out a role in relation to educating our people and in the development of regionalisation.  Perhaps the vocational education committees will have accountability, the principle of subsidiarity will prevail and there will be growth, particularly in the west which has <Col N="1587" /> lost its young people.  We are looking forward to an exciting time in education.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have a wide debate on education when this document, to which many references have been made in the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, comes before us.  I would like to have seen more involvement by the vocational education committees, and we intend to put down an amendment to that effect.  I am sorry they have suffered so much in the past number of months through the vagaries of a changed policy.  It shows the power of lobbying; if there had not been such widespread lobbying, the Bill put forward by the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, would have been accepted. Deputy O'Rourke said that she would take on board amendments.  Women will always see the practicalities involved. This may be perceived as a sexist remark, but when it comes to practicalities women know what the people want and we ensure as best we can that their needs are met.  I hope that the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology will be able to do the work given to them in the concept of the new Bills. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, will take on board our amendments. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Brennan, will take the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to the House and formally congratulate him on his appointment.  He has been an extremely busy Minister since he was appointed to this portfolio.  In view of the fact that the Minister for Education became ill and was indisposed, a very heavy burden of responsibility rested on his shoulders and had acquitted himself excellently in that area.  I take this opportunity to thank and compliment Deputy Aylward for meeting with the IVEA representatives at very short notice and affording them the opportunity to discuss their viewpoints.  I assure him that it has been very much appreciated in the IVEA <Col N="1588" /> sector and on their behalf, I convey my sincere thanks to the Minister for his openness and willingness at all times to meet with them.</P>
      <P>I was a little saddened Senator Jackman did not give a full welcome to the new increase in the ceiling for third level grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed it but said that the issue has not been addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a measure for which every sector and every interested body in education has been pressing for quite a considerable time and the recent announcement is a magnificent step forward. As the Minister said, he would do much more were it not for the financial constraints.  One has to recognise that a major step forward has been taken in this whole area.  I hope that process will continue and that those who wish to avail of third level education will not be constrained by a lack of financial support. As regards the whole area of ESF grants as they relate to third level colleges, I want to emphasise that regional technical fees for college are not means tested. Many parents and students are confused about this issue because it has not been highlighted sufficiently and I want to put that fact on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay a special tribute to the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology for the marvellous work they have done since their establishment over 20 years ago &mdash; the Minister, in his speech, acknowledged their work.  I pay tribute to them, not just as a public representative but also as a vocational teacher and one who has been associated with the vocational education committee sector since I began my career a number of years ago.  In my role as a vocational teacher I had the opportunity of dealing with the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology and I have the height of praise for the staff in these colleges and, indeed, for the boards of management.  They are a very professional, committed and dedicated <Col N="1589" /> people.  The Minister also paid tribute to them.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have always taken a very open and flexible approach to the needs of their students and the people in their region.  They have been willing to experiment with various courses and they never lost the human touch which is the essence of education. We must, at all costs, defend the human element, which is a vital ingredient in the whole education sector.</P>
    <P>The colleges have always taken a special interest in the welfare of their students.  Strong ties have been maintained with the local community, with manufacturers, business people and with industry in general.  This close relationship has often led to the placement of students who qualify from regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It also ensures that a pool of expertise is available to the colleges and to the students when required.  While retaining the human touch the regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have expanded rapidly since their inception 20 years ago.  Indeed, I would argue they have been the success story of the Irish educational system in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister outlined in his speech, the number of students in regional technical colleges has increased by more than 200 per cent in that time while the number of full-time students in the Dublin Institute of Technology college has doubled.  Equally important is the fact that the number of courses has also increased in line with demand and this reflects the preparedness of the colleges to adapt to whatever needs arise at any given time.  The rapid response to demand was possible because of the local democratic base from which the colleges emanated and from which they operate. They anticipated needs and responded accordingly, and that is one of the secrets of their success.  I hope the Bills before us build on the fine tradition and enhance the adaptability, flexibility and responsiveness of the colleges.  When talking <Col N="1590" /> about regional technical colleges we should remember their importance to the communities and the regions in which they serve.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that he wants to strike a reasonable balance between the greater freedom and autonomy of the institutions in their day-to-day operations and the input of the vocational education committees.  I would say to the Minister that the Irish Vocational Education Association, who represent the vocational education committee sector, have absolutely no objection to that philosophy.  Indeed, I would have to say that the vocational education committee sector was the very first education sector to plan and set down a blueprint for change in a document produced by the IVEA before the Green Paper was signalled.  The IVEA recognise and acknowledge the need for change and for developing to local level responsibility for the day-to-day running of schools. The vocational education committee sector do not wish to see the control of the colleges being centralised as that would be detrimental.</P>
    <P>I would question the thinking of people in some quarters that the present governing and administration procedures have inhibited growth of the colleges.  I do not believe that is so.  I have already outlined the growth in student numbers &mdash; the Minister referred to that matter &mdash; and the increase in courses over the past 20 years, which is extraordinary, particularly in view of the financial constraints on the colleges in those years.  The existing governing structures have served the colleges very well, allowing for local and regional participation.  I would be concerned that the proposed structure would result in less power for the board of management and locally elected representatives and would allow less academic freedom and flexibility in responding to the changing demands in local communities.  It is extremely important that the vocational education committee link be maintained and developed where possible.  I hope that of passing these Bills we do not interfere with that link, which is absolutely crucial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> The rôle of the vocational education committee and the local elected representative is extremely important.  The local representative is a vital cog in the whole area of democracy and devolving power to local level.  As regards the preparation of Bills and the setting up of structures, I acknowledge that the civil servants are dedicated and committed. They are exemplary in the manner in which they carry out their duties. However, as they are not elected representatives they follow a different agenda, and I am not knocking or criticising them for that.  They hold different views as to the needs in particular areas.</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk in recent time about decentralisation.  Decentralisation involves much more than transferring a number of civil servants from Dublin to provincial towns.  It should be about devolving power from the centre to the regions.  The regional technical colleges were one of the best examples &mdash; one could argue they were the only real example &mdash; of decentralisation. With their foundation the provincial towns and cities were renewed and reinvigorated.  Local economies were boosted, employment was provided directly in the colleges and ancillary services and local businesses flourished.  The arrival of the student population gave a fresh injection to the local economies. Those who provide accommodation in the areas involved prospered.  The ancillary and spin-off effects of the colleges were absolutely astounding in that many towns that were on the decline were brought back to life.  Because the colleges were directly responsible to their communities they showed more flexibility and adaptability than any other education structure, and that has to be acknowledged and recognised.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred to universities and the need for more co-operation and interchange of courses and students between universities and regional technical colleges, and I see nothing wrong with that.  I speak as one who was privileged to be a university graduate in the sixties and had the <Col N="1592" /> regional technical colleges taken a similar attitude to that taken by universities to the changing society in Ireland at that time they would not be the success story they are today.  They would have progressed very little from the days of simply providing part-time courses and apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to Senator Jackman's contribution &mdash; I know she will forgive me for doing so &mdash; in relation to the naming of the regional technical colleges and the fact that they should be called polytechnics.  I refute the connotations of disadvantage, as I am sure do the colleges, in relation to the title &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo;.  Their record over the past number of years since they were established speaks for itself.  The increase in numbers in the regional technical colleges of more than 200 per cent and in the Dublin Institute of Technology of more than 100 per cent is evidence of the standing in which they are held by the people.  I want to go on record as saying that in many instances students who acquired a sufficient number of points to attend university opt for the regional technical colleges because of their more practical, open and flexible approach in relation to the provision of courses.</P>
    <P>Local democracy is vital to the development of regional technical colleges. It is vital that this input be maintained and strengthened in the development of the Irish education system.  We must ensure at all costs that our regional technical colleges are not in the future geared towards a more academic type syllabus, making them responsive to local communities, businesses and indeed, industry.  To argue that the local public representative does not have a role to play in education is to misunderstand the facts.  There must be checks and balances in any democracy. Institutions must be answerable to the public and must respond to the local needs and to public opinion.  This opinion is best articulated at local level by public representatives and at national level by the Oireachtas Members.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees <Col N="1593" /> have responded extremely well to the needs of their communities.  As has been mentioned earlier, when they were set up their brief was limited.  They were seen at the outset, largely as responding to the needs of disadvantaged people. They took that on board and did a tremendous job.  Any educationalist or other person who carried out a study of the education system would have to acknowledge the tremendous contribution of the vocational education committees in relation to the whole area of the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that brief they developed into the mainstream second level courses and then moved into third level.  Every area in which they were involved has been a success.  We cannot underestimate their contribution over the past years.  The committee who originally prepared the brief for the regional technical colleges were quoted earlier by the Minister, and I would like to quote from another section of their report:</P>
    <P>If they are to make the most effective contribution to the needs of society and the economy they must be capable of continuing adaptation to social, economic and technological changes. Initiative at local and national levels will largely determine how far this vital characteristic will develop.</P>
    <P>The success of the colleges has proven the wisdom of that type of approach.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the amendments introduced by the Minister to these Bills. I compliment the Minister and appreciate the way in which he responded to the representations made to him in relation to the importance of retaining a strong vocational education committee input and influence.  As one who represents that area I believe that the amendments did not go far enough, but I appreciate the constraints within which the Minister operates.  I acknowledge and welcome the fact that he did respond within the brief given to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman made great play about the Green Paper and about references to the vocational education committees in that document.  In the context <Col N="1594" /> of the debate on the Green Paper I would urge the Minister to give the greatest possible consideration to the vocational education committee sector as a vehicle for further development of Irish education. The vocational education committees still have a vital role to play.  They have not let the Irish education system down in the past and I do not think they will do so in the future.  I again welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge the tremendous work he has done since his appointment.  I wish him the very best of luck in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator McKenna in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Aylward, to his post and I wish him well.  I have no doubt that he will bring to the post the energy which he brings to any job he takes on and I look forward to working with him.</P>
      <P>In general my response to this legislation is a very positive one.  It is not an area in which I have great expertise and I know nothing about the row between the vocational education committees and the Minister on this matter, but I would like to raise some questions.  I agree with the comments made by Senator McKenna about the need for local representation and the involvement of local public representatives in the educational area.  The INTO raised that point in their submission to the New Ireland Forum.  I agree with that thinking in respect of all sectors of education.  I find it extraordinary &mdash; this is a matter that is never referred to by Members of the Oireachtas, probably because we have a vested interest in the area &mdash; that we all accept, without a murmur, the exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas from participation in the work of these colleges. This is something I would like to hear the Minister justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be a vague justification for it if there was a different method of making regulations.  However, the Minister has taken the advice of his civil servants one more time and taken the power of regulation from the Oireachtas.  All legislation that has come through this House in the last few years has contained <Col N="1595" /> the same negative provision &ldquo;if it has not been changed within 21 days&rdquo;.  There is no justification for excluding Members of the Oireachtas from participating in the governing bodies of regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I would put a question to the Minister to which I would ask him to respond. Considering that Members of this House may become members of the local health authority, the regional health authority and the regional tourism board, why are they excluded from involvement as members of governing bodies of regional technical colleges?  This is not a major issue, but our role should not be diminished in any way.  I do not think there is a conflict of interest in this area and I ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the need for gender equity and equality of opportunity as one of the main thrusts of the Green Paper &mdash; this is also evident in these Bills.  However, I have to agree with Senator Jackman's comment on the actual terminology used. I do not care what the draftspersons say, but it is unacceptable to use the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; in this day and age.  It is offensive and is exclusive in its meaning. I know that is not the intention, and many women will disagree with me, but I will certainly be proposing that we change thw word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  I do not like the cumbersome word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;; the neuter gender word &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; is acceptable and should be used.  I ask the Minister to accept a proposal on Committee Stage to change the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo;, with consequential changes throughout the Bills.  I recognise that in the Second Schedule there is a statement to the effect that the chairman shall be called by whatever title the governing body wish that person to be called. That is cumbersome language and I do not know whether it reflects the point I am making or the fact that third level colleges very often put different titles on people in this role.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that matter.  It would be a small change which would cost nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I listened to the Minister for Education speaking yesterday in the other House about the need not just to believe in something but to carry it through.  He was explaining the position of third level grants in the Private Members' debate last night.  It is not enough to say these things, you must also take action.  Somebody will have to tell the draftspersons that &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; if not &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;&mdash; I favour the word &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo;.  The INTO, of which I am a member, changed their rules some years ago to respond to that point.</P>
    <P>Without a shadow of a doubt the regional technical colleges have been a success story not only in the vocational or the training system but in the education system.  To think that they are successful in one or two areas only diminishes their authority.  They are a very effective and successful part of the education system and they deserve our support.</P>
    <P>I want to raise some questions about the role of the vocational education committee because I envisage problems arising in this area.  From listening to the debate so far, reading articles in the newspaper and meeting members of the IVEA in the last number of months, I am not quite sure how this system will work.  I represent the university sector here, but I find it the most nauseatingly exclusive sector within the education system.  I would not have objected to the Minister putting constraints on universities, making them answerable to a local educational committee.  Why should the universities be allowed to hide behind walls, say, in Dublin 4 without being held answerable to any local education authority? They have an autonomous governing body.  If we want to give the regional technical colleges the same status they should have the same authority.</P>
    <P>Am I right in saying that a governing body will have to seek the permission of the vocational education committee if they want to seek an overdraft facility? Considering that a governing body, as an authority, can be sued and can sue, it is extraordinary that they will not be <Col N="1597" /> entitled to seek an overdraft facility. After all, both the students and staff of the colleges can do so.  I wonder what will happen if a college draws up a plan and need an overdraft or bridging finance and the vocational education committee say no.  I would like to know how that difficulty will be resolved as I cannot see how it can be resolved under this legislation, particularly if there are bad relations between them.</P>
    <P>The ordinary members of a governing body will be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  There are gaps in the wording and I wonder what will happen if the Minister does not like what is being recommended to him.  Will he or she be able to refuse to make the appointment?  Nobody has authority in this case.  We have a situation where neither the Minister nor the vocational education committee has the authority to appoint the members of the board.  While the vocational education committees have the power to make recommendations to the Minister, it is the Minister who will make the appointment.  I am not sure if the Minister will have discretion or what will happen if he decides that a person is unsuitable for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Under this section of the Bill a vocational education committee will be required to nominate two persons &mdash; Senator Jackman made this point also &mdash; who will then be recommended to the Minister.  This provision has led to confusion, and I do not think the section is well drafted.  We should be clear on what will happen if the Minister feels that somebody is completely unsuitable.  For example, what will happen if they recommend somebody whom the Minister feels will use the college as a training school for terrorists?  This is not so far-fetched especially when one considers that previous Governments found themselves in all sorts of difficulties some years back when they decided they did not want to deal with people of a certain political colour.  If the Minister gets the list and says that he does not think a particular person is suitable and that he is not going <Col N="1598" /> to appoint him, what will happen then? While it is clear that the Minister will be able to dismiss an authority or a governing body, I am not clear on what will happen in this case.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the question of the overdraft, I would like to refer to the annual budget of the governing body. Section 14 (3) states:</P>
    <P>The Vocational Education Committee may, in respect of the programmes and budget submitted to it under this section, either approve of such programmes and budget without modification or, following appropriate consultation with the governing body, approve of the programmes and budget with such modifications as it thinks fit to make.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary way to do business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Does the Senator have a copy of the Bill as passed by the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am referring to section 14 (3) which will allow a vocational education committee, in respect of the programmes submitted to it, and following consultation with the governing body, to make such modifications as it thinks fit.  It will also allow the Minister to lift the phone to announce that he is going to make changes to the programme submitted.  Not only will the governing body have to seek permission to seek an overdraft facility but the vocational education committee will be able to decide on their budget.  If they do not hold the purse strings they will not be autonomous.</P>
      <P>While I wonder if there is a need to impose constraints I can see the need for transparency and budgeting.  I am aware that the Minister will ask in response &ldquo;how can I satisfy everyone&rdquo; but it is important to bear in mind that there are two points of view.  The reason I am speaking about this matter is that I think it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1599" />
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is not Secretary of the INTO for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I want to put that point of view across.  While I can see the need for budgeting, I am worried that their programme of work may be changed or modified by the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>If a governing body wants to offer a new certificate, diploma or degree course and the vocational education committee say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, then that will be the end of the matter.  While I have a difficulty with that, I am not anti-Vocational Education Committee.  I think, however, that we need to be clear on the authority of different groups.  I am of the view that all educational institutes in an area, be it the local primary school, university or regional techical college should be answerable to a local educational authority similar to the vocational education committee.  What is happening here is that the politicians are protecting the members of vocational education committees for particular reasons.  I am of the view that local educational committees should be given responsibility for every educational institution from pre-school to primary school, secondary school, vocational school, regional technical colleges and university.  I think nobody could argue with that suggestion as it would enable us to ensure there is public local representation on each one of them. I can certainly commend that suggestion to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I raised the question of the Members of the Oireachtas and I want the Minister of State to come back to us on it.  In relation to the issue of transparency I am aware that the Minister for Education has a keen interest in the question of inspection which is dealt with in section 21:</P>
      <P>The Minister may authorise inspectors and other officers of the Department of Education and such other persons as the Minister may deem appropriate to report to the Minister on the efficiency of instruction given in the College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> I would like to know who in the Department of Education is going to inspect these colleges and report on the efficiency of instruction because I am not sure if they have the necessary, expertise although I have no objection to that arrangement.  Does this mean the Minister is going to extend the remit of the inspectorate to cover the third-level sector to allow them carry out this task? It would be much better if the Minister deleted the reference to the Department of Education so that the section would read as follows: &ldquo;The Minister may authorise inspection as he or she deems appropriate to report to him or her on the efficiency of instruction given in a college&rdquo; It should not be confined to officers of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>On the subject of officers, I note that a passing reference is made in the Bill to &ldquo;servants and officers of the college&rdquo;. However I cannot find a definition of &ldquo;servants and officers&rdquo; in this legislation. I await the Minister's response.  What are the definitions of &ldquo;servants&rdquo; and &ldquo;officers&rdquo;?  What is the difference?  How will they be appointed?  To whom will they be responsible?  Will they have access to the structures outlined in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, and other legislation dealing with the unfair dismissals and appeals tribunals?  Those words should be deleted if the definition is not clear.  If they were included because somebody thought it was a good idea, they should be deleted because their inclusion will only lead to confusion and problems down the line.</P>
    <P>I support the provision in the Bill which gives the Minister power to dissolve a governing body because Ministers have been given a job to do and they should be answerable to the Oireachtas and the people.  What I dislike about this is the negative approach adopted.  I believe the regulations should have to be approved by the House rather than the approach adopted in the Bill &mdash; that every regulation made by the Minister shall be laid before each House as soon as may be after it is made if either House, within 21 days on which that House has sat after such regulation is laid before it, passes a <Col N="1601" /> resolution annulling the regulation or part of it.  As every civil servant knows, that would probably be too late because each regulation always carries the words &ldquo;without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister can make and take action on foot of regulations which can only be annulled by the Houses of the Oireachtas on the basis that anything done in the intervening period is valid. That is undemocratic.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the proposal to increase third level grants.  This is a positive and welcome step.  This is the most progressive development in education for 20 years.  The Minister and Government should be complimented on their work in this area.  However, I should put the matter in context with particular reference to what is being done by the social partners, workers, employers, the Government, Members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives in tackling the major problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The findings of every study and survey point to the following fact, namely, a person with a qualification is more likely to find employment.  The regional technical colleges play an important role in that process.  Senator McKenna spoke about the need to maintain close contact with the local business community &mdash; this view is reflected in the Green Paper &mdash; but it is nonsense to suggest that employment can be created if the education service serves business.  That is not true and can only lead to problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The trend in the United States is in the opposite direction.  What employers need is a flexible and well educated person who can then be trained to do a specific job.  A bright, intelligent and well educated person will be able to do a particular job easily.  On the other hand, people with a specific qualification may be slow to change and grasp new opportunities. The major corporations in the United States are no longer taking on people with a qualification in business studies or marketing; rather they are taking on people with a general qualification because that person can be <Col N="1602" /> trained to do specific tasks.  I do not want courses to have a narrow focus because we will only create problems for ourselves later given that technology is changing. We need to have people who are flexible, willing to be retrained and able to grasp new opportunities.  In the computer world each person can now expect to be retrained or change positions four or five times in their career.  That is an important point.</P>
    <P>There is a need to increase participation in third level education. Increasing third level grants is a welcome move but we should make it easier for the people to avail of third level education. We need to ask ourselves who are the people who can avail of third level education and where do they come from? The move to third level education depended on their academic performance in second level schools which, in turn, depended on the quality of education provided at first level.  While I welcome the move announced within the last two days and praise the Government it will not lead to increased participation in third level education by people from deprived areas.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that if the local school does not have the money to build an extra classroom, to buy a computer or to send the children on school tours, then their parents will have to pay if they have the money.  The better off the parents of first and second level student the more experience the students will get.  This, in turn, should lead to a better academic performance on which the decision to participate at third level will be based.  That matter has not been addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we want to increase the participation in third level education of all groups in society, the backgrounds of the children will have to be considered from the moment they enter the education system. The Minister may say I have a vested interest in first level education and that would not be untrue but that does not make the points I am raising less valid.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether Senator Jackman dealt with the following issue but she was slow in getting around to the <Col N="1603" /> question of franchise in relation to third level education.  Section 4 of both Bills which deals with the membership of the colleges and institute lists the people who will be members in paragraphs (a) to (f). With the exception of the graduates, each of these will have an input in relation to the structure of the governing body.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Minister of State that the position is different in the universities.  In the older universities graduates have the right to elect representatives to the governing body.  For instance, the graduates of UCD elect six members to the governing body.  Every-time this issue is discussed here Senator Honan looks across at me and thinks that there is some kind of threat, but every graduate of every third level institution should have the right to vote in the election of the third level representatives in the Seanad.  I said this six years before I was elected to this House.  Therefore I have been consistent on this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the graduates of the colleges should be enfranchised. They should have a vote in the election of third level representatives to this House.  I recognise that this would require a constitutional amendment, but it should be done if the matter has not been covered already by the enabling legislation and the changes made in 1980. However it is even more important &mdash; perhaps this is more germane &mdash; that they should have a vote in the election of members to the governing body.  Given that that is the position in UCD, UCG, UCC and other places, why are we diminishing the status of the graduates of the regional technical colleges?  It is the same old story.  In allowing the universities to be oblivious to the local vocational educational committees and making the people listed responsible we are saying that these older universities are somehow better and stronger institutions, but that cannot be right.</P>
      <P>Surely, the graduates of those third-level colleges should have a vote in the election of members to the governing body.  This could be done by extending the membership of the board but I would be wary &mdash; I disagree with what Senator Jackman had to say on this &mdash; because it would be a nightmare if we had 18 people on a committee.  I am of the view that the smaller the committee the more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with the membership of the governing bodies, states that &ldquo;five persons shall be nominated by such organisations as the vocational education committee considers require representation...&rdquo; I am not sure who they will be and the Minister of State did not expand on the matter in his speech, which was 23 pages long.  Since it has not been clearly defined who these people will be, perhaps that number could be reduced to three, with the other two being elected by the graduates.  The graduates of the colleges should have a vote and a say.  I support the idea that the students, the college staff, both academic and nonacademic, <Col N="1605" /> and the ICTU should be able to nominate a representative.</P>
    <P>I am always conscious of the fact in relation to legislation such as this that there is a political agenda and there is no doubt with regard to the First Schedule, that if we superimpose it on a map of Ireland, there is a problem in the west. No matter which way one looks at the matter a solid case can be made on behalf of Castlebar, County Mayo.  I do not want to get involved in a local political row or wrangle and that is not the reason I raise the matter.  If one looks at a map of Ireland this becomes clear.  I am aware of all the arguments &mdash; one could say that Sligo is only 50 miles away and Galway 55, but if people go to school in a particular place they will put down roots there.  Indeed one of my own children is attending the third level college in Limerick which in some respects is home to him.  That bothers me.</P>

      <P>A strong case can be made on behalf of Castlebar.  Therefore, the Minister of State will forgive me if I table an amendment to the First Schedule to include the words &ldquo;Regional Technical College, Castlebar, County Mayo&rdquo;, which is a huge county.  I will await the Minister's response.  As I said, a strong case can be made on its behalf.  The education system in County Mayo has contributed a lot and it should not be excluded from the First Schedule.  The Minister must respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which I consider to be good legislation.  The points I have raised are marginal ones and have been raised in an effort to be as helpful as possible.  I ask the Minister of State, if <Col N="1606" /> at all possible, to take on board some of the proposals I have made.</P>
    <P>I compliment the parliamentary draftsman and advisers for the way in which they have drafted this legislation.  As usual, the public servants have done us proud.  It is fine legislation and will stand the test of time.  While I know there are differences of opinion in relation to the question of accountability to the vocational education committees, nobody will disagree with the general thrust of the Bill which is both welcome and long overdue.  It gives a new status to the regional technical colleges which is well deserved and which has been well earned over the past 21 years.  They have made an invaluable contribution and long may they continue.  In giving them every possible support we should ensure that the legislation does not focus on vocational education only; it should be as broad as possible.  As I said, we should give the colleges our support as well as giving them autonomy.  This legislation will be of importance in the future in creating employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am sure he will be relieved to learn I am not going to discuss the Green Paper.  I am going to confine my remarks to the Bills before us which, as Senator O'Toole said, are to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should stress the importance of the regional technical colleges and their role in education over the past 21 years.  I believe we are all familiar as well with the standards of excellence in the various colleges that make up the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There is an enormous range of courses available to our young people within the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Their function is to provide vocational and technological education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of this State.  That is certainly quite a long menu and it is one, we must agree, with which they concern themselves with and <Col N="1607" /> on which they do a good job.  I hope the Bills will give the necessary flexible legislative framework under which the adaptation and development of these colleges can be fostered and encouraged.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be an acknowledgement of the role of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technological colleges if degree awarding powers were granted.  I know that is something for the future, but it is something that I think should come about as quickly as possible.  It would be appropriate in so far as the Bills seek to give increased autonomy to the institutions, and it is a move I certainly welcome wholeheartedly in our education process. I know that the colleges are very aware of the necessity to build up entrepreneurial skills, marketing and business administration and of making education relevant to the employment needs in the country.  I will refer to this later on.  I did not quite agree with the emphasis Senator O'Toole gave to the situation in the States, but I will come back to that later.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report emphasises that we should be conscious of the need for the development of skills appropriate to our employment needs at home.  It has unfortunately been a feature of Irish society to downgrade the type of education received at vocational level and in doing that to concentrate more on the humanities.  I do not think that is to say that we should now go overboard in the opposite direction and I do not think that is implied.  What we are talking about here is the whole picture.  Education should be about the development of the whole person.  That is not something we should abandon, but is an aspiration we should cling to.  It is necessary to strike a balance and, unfortunately, we have really come down too far on one side. In most countries third level education tends to be divided into what can be described as the more traditional universities and, on the other hand, institutions dedicated to technological training and development.  I want to refer <Col N="1608" /> mostly to vocational training and education.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges have a primary role to bring about a change in attitudes here.  Having taught for a number of years and worked as a guidance counsellor, I always found it a little bit disheartening that academic skills were valued so much more than other skills which might be more appropriate in later life or more appropriate in the workplace. As so many people have said, the regional technical colleges have provided the opportunity for very many of our young people to receive third level education, and many of them within their own immediate area.  Obviously, one of the great benefits of this is the contribution that the colleges have made in economic, cultural and social development of their regions.  A case has been made earlier for particular regional colleges. It would be very remiss of me not to point to the undertaking that was given a number of years ago in relation to the three regional technical colleges in the Dublin area.  At that time my own constituency, the area of Dún Laoghaire, was nominated as one of the suitable locations.  Despite the fact that a site was purchased and plans drawn up, nothing ever happened.  As we are referring in general terms to regional technical colleges, I wonder if the Minister would let me and the people of Dún Laoghaire know what the prospects are and whether or not it is a runner.  I imagine we would not exactly be first in the queue, but it would be nice to know do we figure at all.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties people have in relation to the whole vocational education committee area.  It is important to arrive at a balance between the need for autonomy by the colleges and the desire of the vocational education committees to maintain their relationship.  There are many sensibilities there that have to be addressed.  It is extremely important that the colleges be genuinely developed.  It is to be welcomed that in the Bill's guidelines the principle is established that the colleges have a role in research and training. Also to be welcomed is the development <Col N="1609" /> towards serving the business interests of the particular region.  Senator O'Toole seemed to infer that there was something wrong in this development.  I do not think that is the case.  A lot has to do with the approach of the colleges and of the regions themselves.</P>
    <P>Because of the heavily academic weighted nature of the leaving certificate many students who want to pursue further education find themselves blocked from going to university.  This is one of the reasons why such an anti enterprise culture prevails and why appreciation of the value of other skills has been clouded.</P>
    <P>We have seen a tremendous increase in the number of students attending colleges. I believe something like 20,000 is the latest figure.  Unfortunately, despite the fact that there are ever increasing numbers attending third level education, we still lag behind our EC partners.  From that point of view I would like to welcome the announcement made last night in relation to third level grants.  I believe that will be helpful.  I hope the Bills will give added incentive for research and development so that the relevance of the regional technical colleges' role will be enhanced further.  We need to train our young people to compete in the marketplace here and also, because of the increased mobility within the European Community &mdash; and unfortunately because of our own employment situation &mdash; we need to give them the skills to compete elsewhere too.</P>
    <P>In no sense do I want to separate the two Bills in this debate because there is a considerable overlap in the autonomy that will ensue as a result of the Bills, but in a general sense I think it is important to underscore the excellence of both.</P>
    <P>I have no interest in talking about the long history of development of the colleges. All of that has been well delineated already.  One thing we hear a great deal about here is how service industry is the key to the future and how we will find jobs there for our young people.  I believe that such loose talk about service industry shows that people do not know what they are talking about.  In order to build a <Col N="1610" /> society with employment prospects and good levels of income we have to develop a service industry with high added value, such as information technology.  We cannot undervalue the role of the regional technical colleges, and indeed of the Dublin Institute of Technology, in this.</P>
    <P>This is where I differ to some extent from the point Senator O'Toole was making earlier.  How vital this is can be seen from the US experience.  There highly paid, high added value manufacturing jobs, resulting in high levels of disposable income, have declined to be replaced in many instances by low paid, low added value jobs.  Over the last 15 to 20 years incomes have declined in real terms because a higher proportion of the workforce are in those low added value, low paid jobs.  The multiplier effect of that is self evident.  One of the reasons the US economy is so sluggish is that it is a society which has been really bled of cash.  We can also see where the highly skilled, high added value and, therefore, highly paid jobs are.  They are not in the States any more; they are in the Far East, in Japan, and in Europe as well, Germany, for instance.  The lesson is undeniable.  Training is a priority.  Skills to maintain the type of service industry which can command wealth for our economy are vital.  That is why these Bills are to be welcomed, even if they are to an extent overdue.  I do not have any problem about getting them through because they are important.</P>
    <P>The colleges and the Institute of Technology need a general policy framework and the freedom to exercise their autonomy.  There should be as great a degree of flexibility as is necessary to permit the development of those colleges, enable them to respond to the needs of the workplace and to help develop a healthy economy through the ability of our young people to develop the skills to enable them to find work here.  They should be enabled to have the type of relationship within their region to allow us build upon their skills in order to create more jobs.  That is terribly important.  It is only one factor.  It is not a <Col N="1611" /> solution to our unemployment problems, but it is certainly an area that should be thought about and should be built upon.</P>

      <P>This is a very important piece of legislation. In the three years we have been in the House these are the first two Education Bills we have had.  Yet we have had to discuss them together on the same day and we are going to have, I understand, a maximum of two days to discuss them.  Next week we will have another Education Bill dealing with higher education grants.  In the space of two weeks we are to have three pieces of education legislation.  In the space of three years we did not have any education legislation, but now we will be forced to put this legislation through this House of the Oireachtas in that short space of time.  I must express my greatest disappointment at the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I just refer to a point the Senator and other Senators have made?  I recall that within less than two years we had the Limerick University Bill and the Dublin University Bill.  The Senator is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were localised Bills as distinct from broad national Bills, which the present Bills are.  These Bills deal with the major issue of policies in relation to vocational and technical education and indeed business and commercial education at third level.  This is apart from the whole underlying principle in relation to democratic control of <Col N="1612" /> education which also has to be teased out.  I think therefore it is reasonable to refer to it in this context.  It is particularly relevant to the Seanad because the Seanad is the House which has six Members elected from the colleges of higher education, albeit the universities. Therefore, there is a specific panel relating to education.  To see two enormous pieces of legislation, plus further legislation coming in next week, dealt with in this limited fashion is disappointing. What makes it so limited is the fact that the Dáil will have ceased to sit by the end of this week.  The day we will be finalising these two pieces of legislation there will be absolutely no possibility of going back to the Dáil with any amendments.  In effect, therefore, we are talking in a vacuum in relation to any proposals we may have on these two Bills or on the Bill that will be coming before us next week.  Irrespective of any other point I might make, I regard that as an insult to this House and it is certainly not the way to do business.  I regret very much that the Minister for Education is not here to hear me say that.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could also refer to my disappointment that I was not invited, either as a Senator or as a member of the City of Dublin vocational education committee, or as chairman of a college council or as a former president of a teachers' union concerned with education, to the launch of the Green Paper on Education.  It would have been appropriate for the Department of Education to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not directly relevant, but it reflects the overall point I am making and that I wanted to make to the Minister: that the Minister is showing a lack of concern for those of us in this House concerned with education.  A good proportion of Members of this House are concerned with education, not only in professional terms but also in local authority terms, because many are members of vocational education committees and <Col N="1613" /> have given much service in the areas we are discussing at present.</P>
      <P>Overall, I welcome the fact that a statutory basis is being given to the colleges, whether it be the regional colleges or the six colleges that make up the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I welcome the fact that a level of autonomy is being granted to them.  I must say that I am not opposed to the streamlining of the colleges, whether at regional or national level, and I think that the decision to do so was a good one.  I would express reservations about the manner in which it has been done.  I think we have been putting the cart before the horse in relation to all of this.  We decided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that there would be a Green Paper published on education, that there would be a White Paper to follow it and that there would be an overall Education Act by the end of last year.  December 1991 has to be the time for the conclusion of deliberations on the Green Paper.  We were then to have an Education Bill which would operate as an umbrella legislation dealing with the whole area of education at primary, second and third levels.  These two Bills would then incorporate the policies and directions discussed in the legislation.  Unfortunately, we have not had that.  We have just had the Green Paper published and there has been no opportunity to discuss the implications of it in relation to the Bills before us.  A large section of the Green Paper deals with higher education and specifically with vocational and technical eduation and particularly with the area of the enterprise culture the Minister is so fond of promoting.  We have not had an opportunity to reflect on that.  We have not had an opportunity to debate that or in any way to incorporate it into the provisions of these Bills.  That is the wrong way to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was introduced in the Dáil in June 1991 by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  It was revised by the new Minister in December 1991 and the vocational education committee role, which had been taken out of the Bill originally, was to a <Col N="1614" /> large extent replaced by the new Minister. It is interesting that it should have been because he was a Minister who was very close to the ground in relation to the input into the regional colleges by the vocational education committees and into the Dublin Institute of Technology. At local authority level he was a man who was very much aware of the input to education that had been made by the democratically elected representatives on those bodies.  Then the new Minister came along and he again reduced the vocational education committee role to a considerable degree.  I will not go through the various elements of it, but first there was a swing from reduction to replacement, reduction again in June, and then at the beginning of July the new Minister accepted some amendments that increased the vocational education committee role to an extent &mdash; in other words, there was a level of rowing back.</P>
    <P>All of this reflects an enormous confusion about the Bill.  The Bill has undergone a number of sea changes in the space of 12 months, an enormous number of sea changes as three different Ministers came into office.  That further makes my point about the need to have the discussion on the Education Act first before we first go down this road at this time, 63 years after the passing of the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  We should not be acting in a rash fashion before we have the overall comprehensive debate on education with the input from all over the country.  The Minister has said he will take it to every corner of the country, that he will leave it open to the public, that he will be present at many of the debates, that he will take on board the ideas that are coming forward.  In relation to the third level of vocational education, all of this will be lost.  There will be no input.  I can assure the Minister that when he goes down the country in the autumn &mdash; he postponed doing so and far be it from me to suggest a motive &mdash; he will be asked why he rushed through the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Colleges Bill before he gave the people on the ground, the grass roots, a <Col N="1615" /> chance to speak.  Here we are talking about parents and people who are interested in education because they are concerned about themselves and their children.  He will be asked why the Bill was not postponed to enable them to put their views to him.</P>
    <P>In relation to the situation at the present time at third level there is no doubt that there is an enormous increase in the number of students in recent years. Education is one of the areas that has really taken off in this country.  It will be generally agreed that we have one of the finest educational systems anywhere in the world at primary, second and third level.  It would be hard to disagree with the statement that there has been greater innovation in educational development in the vocational sector than anywhere else.  I think it would be universally recognised that in terms of curriculum development and expansion of courses the vocational education system has responded well.  This applies to continuing education, adult education, apprenticeship, post leaving certificate courses, almost every type of development. Indeed the Minister in his address this morning, said that the International Study Group on Technological Education were fulsome in their praise of the way in which these institutions have fulfilled their role and have become a significant and vital element in higher education.</P>
    <P>This is something that has been working very well and the old adage is: why change something that works very well? The Minister gave certain reasons why the changes have taken place, and I will address those later on, but the track record of the vocational sector has been second to none.  I say that as a person who has operated as a teacher in the non-vocational sector, in the voluntary secondary sector.  I am full of praise for the vocational sector and what it has done.  I understand it.  Approximately 130,000 people at the present time are doing adult education courses in the colleges throughout the country.  There are 26,000 doing post-leaving certificates <Col N="1616" /> courses.  That is an area that has literally mushroomed over the last decade, an area that has been pioneered by the vocational system to such an extent that an accreditation body was established recently to give creditation to the very large number of courses that are now coming on stream.  There are 10,000 apprenticeships approximately at the present time and 28,000 students at third level in the colleges.  All of that adds up to approximately 200,000 students other than second level with some 70,000 second level students.</P>
    <P>In fact, the vocational education system has become a system of further education rather than a system of second level education.  It was seen as a system of second level education in 1930 when it was established, but because it has responded to the continuing needs of education &mdash; scientific, technological, industrial, business, commercial &mdash; it has now reached the stage where it has become the parent rather than the child of the system.  About three times the number of people are now studying at third level or further than there are at second level.  It is not sufficient to say that the system is largely a second level system.  It is not; it is now largely a further education system, and from the point of view what we are doing here today is all the more important.</P>
    <P>May I refer to some of the statements which have been made by those who are the representatives of the practitioners in the system, whether it be the vocational education committees or the IVEA itself?  I am sure the Minister is acquainted with some of the statements which have been made, in public and in correspondence with the Minister.  As late as the 3 July, and that is including all the amendments that have been introduced so far, the general secretary of the Irish Vocational Education Association, having met the Minister for Education, was writing in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The IVEA is still not reassured and is deeply concerned about the future of the colleges. vocational education committee members are still not convinced <Col N="1617" /> that the current Bills are in the best interests of the colleges and students.  The Bills have changed very significantly due to extensive amending over the past year.  We fail to understand why adequate time is not being permitted to consider the full effects of the amended Bills.  This is particularly relevant in view of the fact that the legal and administrative arrangements cannot now be put in place for implementation next September.  In view of the vital position the colleges must hold in national economic and labour market policies, it would seem very appropriate to be cautious about such fundamental changes.</P>
    <P>That is precisely the point I have been making, that we are railroading through these two Bills at a time when we are about to embark on the only major education debate that has taken place in the country in this century.  It is coherent; the fundamental groundwork has been done; it will be operating initially on a six month basis and then continuing on to the preparation of a White Paper; we will have further public discussion and then head towards actual legislation.  It is the first really coherent, overall discussion on legislation in relation to education.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister some idea of the thinking of the vocational education committees at the time.  The County Carlow Vocational Education Committee &ldquo;supports the IVEA in its fight to maintain a role for vocational education committees in the management of the regional technical colleges.&rdquo;  The Laois Vocational Education Committee &ldquo;condemns the proposed Colleges Bill as an antidemocratic move to exclude local democratic control of regional technical colleges and to replace it with centralised bureaucratic control and calls for the Bill to be shelved pending an open national debate on education.&rdquo;  In Donegal, the same thing &mdash; local democratic structures, the need for a comprehensive debate on education.</P>
    <P>Whether you agree with it or not, the point remains valid that there is concern <Col N="1618" /> throughout the country that this is being rushed at the point when the real debate on education, or educational policy and educational direction is about to take place.  People are worried and those who are worried are local elected representatives. They are not cranks; they are people who have been elected throughout the country, who are the entities of local democracy.  The words being used widely are &ldquo;centralised, bureaucratic control&rdquo;, &ldquo;anti-democratic&rdquo;, &ldquo;the need for local democratic structures&rdquo; and the role of the vocational education committee being &ldquo;undermined or abolished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the IVEA representatives met the Minister at the end of June, they are still not reassured that the Minister has taken sufficiently on board their recommendations and that the vocational education committees and local democracy will be protected.  That is the real issue: the abolition of local democratic structures and their replacement with centralised control.  The colleges are the property of the people and to ensure that they remain their property there must be a sufficient element of local and regional control and not centralised control.  Those are the concerns that have been expressed to me and which are being expressed widely throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Similar concern is expressed by the City of Dublin vocational education committee, not only by the committee but also by the chief executive.  Here is an example of a letter from the City of Dublin vocational education committee, written on 26 June after the Minister's amendments became available on 24 June:</P>
    <P>While supporting the idea of giving a more clearly defined legislative basis to the Dublin Institute of Technology and greater scope and autonomy to manage their own affairs, the Committee is very seriously concerned that the partnership between Colleges and Vocational Education Committees and the Department of Education will be so seriously eroded that it will not be possible for them to continue to provide <Col N="1619" /> an educational continuum between second and third level in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>That is real concern.  What we are seeming to introduce here is a direct and total break with second level education.  The ability to integrate the system and to provide continuing education seems to be eliminated from the provisions in this legislation.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is the wish of Committee that the Colleges Bill would not be finalised until a more enhanced role for Vocational Education Committees has been defined in the Bill.  The Committee is saddened that the massive contribution which has been made by Vocational Education Committees in meeting the demands of a growing young population and increased participation rates in Colleges has not been recognised.  The success of that contribution has not been accidental and Committees claim a major portion of that success.</P>
    <P>The Committee is strongly of the view that the Dublin Institute of Technology should continue as an integral part of the Committees Scheme and that the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee should continue to be its Parent Body so that it can discharge its statutory obligation under the 1930 Vocational Education Act in respect of the development of technical and vocational education at second and third level.</P>
    <P>The current Bill seeks to end the direct responsibility of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Committee wishes to continue to have a meaningful and significant role and function in relation to the continued development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It regrets that the current Bill does not adequately provide for this.</P>
    <P>That is the position of the vocational education committees throughout the <Col N="1620" /> country in relation to the regional colleges, and of the City of Dublin vocational education committee in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology, for which it has specific responsibility.</P>
    <P>Those are the concerns with the Bill and I must say that I share those concerns. I would have thought that they could have been dealt with by a more extensive and comprehensive approach both to this legislation and the Green Paper.  Having put that on the record, I would like to spend some time having a look at the Bills themselves, and particularly at the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome putting on a statutory basis the position of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional colleges.  It is overdue.  I would have preferred that it was done in a different way, by amendment to the 1930 Vocational Education Act rather than introducing legislation which now has to establish a whole new relationship between the vocational education committees and set up new structures. We had a good working situation there that could have been amended rather than starting with the fundamentally different proposal now before us.</P>
    <P>Let us take section 5.  It contains the main functions of the new institute and that is all very welcome to me.  I am delighted to see the range of activities of vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State proposed in this area.  I welcome also the scope that will be given for research and development, providing a joint link-up with the business sector and the participation in limited liability companies. This is all very welcome.  There is provision for funding and a catch-all phrase that allows us to do this and other things as well.</P>
    <P>In that area there is only one major item missing, namely, the awarding of degrees.  I know this has been discussed before and I am sure we can discuss it again.  It was raised in the Dáil.  I understand <Col N="1621" /> there were amendments in the Dáil in relation to degrees but they were not accepted.  If we are going down this road of establishing a new Dublin Institute of Technology, we should ensure that we endow it with the maximum status which would be appropriate to its new designation. For that reason I do not think we should limit it simply to diploma certificates, honorary awards, scholarships and prizes, with the possibility of degree awards, whether of a primary or of a post-primary nature, being conferred at the discretion of the Minister in consultation with the vocational education committee at a later stage.  That is not the type of reservation we should have in this Bill.  We should be brave and true in relation to where we stand.</P>
    <P>If we are interested in allowing the institute to confer awards then we should state so: we should not simply leave it as a hypothetical situation that may or may not happen in the future or that is subject to the vagaries of an individual Minister. We have seen already the extent to which this Bill has been changed by individual Ministers as they came to office for a short space of time.  In the space of the 12 months this Bill has been before the other House and it has come before three Ministers, each of whom put a different stamp on it.  Now that we are bringing it finally to fruition, we should be quite clear where we stand in relation to the making of awards and the awards should include degree awards, post graduate and graduate awards.  I have no doubt that of itself would be one of the best means of ensuring that it has a status and autonomy of its own, even more so than the individual structures we have talked about introducing here, and that it is seen nationally and internationally as a body that confers its own primary degrees and postgraduate degrees.</P>
    <P>Effectively, the institute is the largest third level institution in the State.  I would point out the extent of courses that are run there, particularly specialised courses that are not run in any other institution. There are courses, for example, in mechnical engineering in Bolton Street, in catering in Cathal Brugha Street, a diploma <Col N="1622" /> course in ophthalmic optics in Kevin street and an environmental health course in the College of Catering. These are specialised areas that are particular to the Institute of Technology and we should recognise that by ensuring that we award the institute the ability to confer degrees.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is going to go through as drafted, perhaps we could take that one point on board.  I would consider it to be perhaps the most important one.  We are making a fairly fundamental break with the past.  We have a structure whereby there is the conferment of degrees through liaison with Trinity College and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We have the NCEA and we have the new body that has been set up to validate degrees, the NCRA.  What we have not got is the ability of the institute itself to actually give its own primary and post-primary degrees.</P>
    <P>There is a range of proposals in the Green Paper in relation to validation and certification for the vocational and technological side in the future.  I was amazed to see those proposals.  They have an enormous bearing on this Bill before us. As I see it, the proposal here in relation to the new body, the Council for Educational Vocational Awards, CEVA, is that it would bring together all concerned in education, training and business interests, including the social partners.  It would have a wide remit covering all aspects of vocational training provided by both the educational training agencies, including apprenticeship training, as well as taking over the role of the NCEA in relation to third level courses outside the university sector.</P>
    <P>The university sector can independently give its own degrees.  They have that status but with what are you going to lump our third level colleges?  You are going to lump them with FAS, with CERT, with the NCVA, with second level, with unemployment courses, with all sorts of courses that are a long way from degree status.  You are simply going to devalue an institution which we are now trying to put into a particular framework as an institution that will have a <Col N="1623" /> reputation for learning and for professionalism in the area of technology, commerce, business and so on.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have again made a terrible mistake.  This decision probably came about because it appeared that the NCVA was established last year largely to validate the post-leaving certificate courses; it simply was a badly thought out proposal and it has never got off the ground properly.  However, for some reason somebody got the brilliant idea of combining all of the non-university degrees into this hotch-potch of a validating or certificating body, which of course will not do justice to any area.  On the one hand, the Minister is distinguishing between second and third level.  Now he is not only certifying the courses by bringing together second and third level, but he is bringing in FÁS and CERT as well.  Primarily, he should be separating them.  FÁS is essentially an organisation concerned with the unemployed. The vocational sector is concerned with training and education.  We should be much more careful in the way we deal with our business.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the awarding of degrees is not determined in this Bill and the fact that there is a proposal in the Green Paper that goes in the opposite direction, I think we have here another area where we are going to find ourselves badly let down when the situation arises in relation to the status of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the conferring of awards.  Certainly I will be proposing an amendment in relation to the conferring of degrees and the validation of primary and post-primary degrees in the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (b) of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, by order revoke or amend an order under this subsection.</P>
    <P>In other words, these important functions are going to be conferred on the new institute but, just like that, the Minister may, wilfully, with only the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, by order <Col N="1624" /> revoke or amend an order under this section.  This applies to every one of those fine policy statements and functions that have been set out in section 5, which is the meat of the powers of this new institute, which points the direction it is going to go and gives the new definition of education and training &mdash; vocational, technical, economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial and so on.  The Minister may get rid of the lot of them, or any of them, and the only person he has to refer to is the Minister for Finance.  I think that section should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will also be suggesting an amendment in relation to the governing body in section 6 (1) where there is tautology in relation to lines 20, 21 and 22 and lines 34, 35 and 36 of section 7 (1).  The area is being covered twice, whereas it should properly come under the functions of the governing body in section 7.  I will therefore be seeking to delete section 6 (1), namely, the end of lines 20 &ldquo;and the Governing Body, save as otherwise provided by this Act, shall perform the functions conferred on the Institute by the Act&rdquo; because it is covered later on in its proper place under functions of the governing body.</P>
    <P>The constitution of the governing body has been an issue of very considerable concern as well.  I believe that the amendments that have been taken on board have been very helpful.  I see that there has been quite a shift in the balance of members in terms of the nominations and I think this is reflected in a more democratic result and that we will have a more democratic structure in relation to the governing body.  The proposals that were there prior to this certainly were unacceptable to me and I am glad to see how the nominations have been increased.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the powers that are given to the Minister in relation to the chairman, that the chairman is appointed by the Minister and not by the vocational education committee.  I would have thought that the normal thing would have been that the chairman would have been chosen from the members, which is the <Col N="1625" /> normal way it happens, and that is the proposal in relation to the Deputy Chairman. But I see in the Minister's contribution this morning that that is not the road he is prepared to go down, that it is more along the lines of a semi-State body where the Minister makes the appointment. I would think that it should be made either internally by the nominated people from the various representative organisations &mdash; the vocational education committee, the academic or nonacademic staff, the students, ICTU, those representing industry and so on &mdash; or else that the vocational education committee should make the recommendation with the Minister approving. I would like that aspect of it changed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference to gender equity under the equality of opportunities provisions in section 7 and I am glad the Minister has taken those amendments on board.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (6) states:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, the Governing Body shall have regard to the statutory responsibilities in the provision of vocational and technical education of the Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be quite a loaded phrase.  I wonder perhaps if the Minister in his reply could tease out what that responsibility is.  Are we taking on board the range of statutory responsibilities that are provided in the vocational education committee and that these are being now combined with the new statutory provisions outlined here as the functions and proposals of the institute and of the regional colleges?  It is a pregnant phrase. I am sure it will be something that will be looked at by vocational education committees throughout the country and I would like the Minister to try to tease it out a bit further.  Is it his view that what have been stated already as the new functions in fact are more wide reaching and that all that is intended by this statement here is that the existing functions will be incorporated into it and that the Minister does not see it as being an extension <Col N="1626" /> of anything that is said in terms of section 5 previously?</P>
    <P>Section 9 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The selection of the President shall be a function of the Governing Body in accordance with the procedures, which shall include the composition of a selection board, determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am just not clear on the wording of that.  Are we talking about the composition of the selection board being determined by the Minister, or are we talking about the procedures?  If it is the procedures, who will make up the selection board?  If we are talking about the composition, I would have reservations about the Minister choosing a selection board for the appointment of the president? I would like some clarification in relation to that section as to what the responsibility of the Minister will be in that area.  That is carried on in section 10 (2) which again I would like to have clarified.</P>
    <P>I have not any problem in relation to the academic council.  As I mentioned, I would like to see the making of awards by the institute, and obviously the academic council would have a role there in making a recommendation.  As we can see from the various subsections of section 11, which deals with this, there is no such role.  The academic council can recommend the award of scholarships and prizes and the conferment of all sorts of honorary awards, but obviously it has no role in relation to the conferment of a degree.  Obviously, it would have a role if degrees were given, because of standards and certification requirements.  I feel that the intention of the Minister to allow the institute to make awards is very questionable, because there is no further role given in the course of the Bill to allow recommendations by the academic council in regard to how these might be conferred and what recommendations they might make as the academic professional body there.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the trade union aspect of the staff as well.  That is covered in section 13, I am concerned about the <Col N="1627" /> provision in relation to existing staff and how we are going to rearrange and redistribute duties.  I can assure the Minister that he is entering a minefield here.  We are talking about a very large number of people employed in the regional colleges and in Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  How is this going to work?  Will people be transferred into areas where they have no expertise?  What say will they have in the matter?  Section 13 (2) (a) simply states here</P>
    <P>The Institute may, following consultation with any recognised staff associations or trade unions concerned, redistribute or rearrange the duties to be performed by officers or servants to whom subsection (1) applies and every such officer or servant shall be bound to perform the duties allocated to that officer or servant in any such redistribution or rearrangement.</P>
    <P>I an assure the Minister that there will be an enormous number of problems in relation to that.  I hope that whole area will be dealt with sensitively, that there will be full discussions with the trade unions in advance of it, that it is not simply something where the Minister will have a word with the trade union and it is left at that.  Then the heavy hand comes in and there is a rearrangement and redistribution. That certainly will cause strikes and all sorts of industrial action.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the role of the vocational education committee enhanced in relation to the programmes and the budgets of the colleges.  That is a welcome decision by the Minister.  It ensures that there is an element of input by the vocational education committee in terms of the direction things are going, the programmes that are determined on and the way the money is spent.  That is to be welcomed and I am glad the Minister has taken that on board.</P>
    <P>I also like the idea that accounts will be prepared and that there is a specific timescale within which to present them. I do not like to see the Minister being <Col N="1628" /> responsible to a rather extraordinary degree in this area; nevertheless it is good that audited accounts must be prepared and brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with the transfer of property.  I do not consider that one needs to own property to direct the policies of an education institution.  It depends on the structures in the institution and the willingness of those who run it.  It is of paramount importance that the governing body be a reasonably democratic structure.  I would not get hung up on whether the property is strongly vested in the vocational education committee; it would probably be a better way to do it but my major concern is with the existing structures for education, the direction of policy and ensuring that vocational education committees have a say in the programmes that are drawn up and how the money is funded.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with section 23 which states that the Minister may make such regulations with regard to the operation of the institute as he may, from time to time, see fit.  I dislike catch-all phrases of this nature where power is given to the Minister from time to time as the Minister sees fit.  I dislike that in any legislation and that part, including section 2, should be deleted from the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule deals with the governing body.  I referred to that already any my concern about the appointment of the chairman.  I would like the Minister to amend paragraph 2 (2) of the Second Schedule to read: &ldquo;The chairman shall be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee and may be removed from office by the Minister, or that he or she would be chosen from among the nominated and elected members.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a person who has been selected for the governing body may be absent without penalty for six consecutive months.  That is a considerable period.  Since members are only appointed or elected for a period of 12 months subject to renomination and selection, that is far too generous.  Anybody who receives the honour of serving on the governing body should be present <Col N="1629" /> for are least a third of the time; that period should be reduced at least to four months, if not three months.  It is not often that I describe the Minister as being generous but he has been on that issue.</P>
    <P>In relation to people who cannot be nominated to governing bodies, I am not pleased to see that, as a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, I cannot be nominated to a governing body and as a Member of Seanad Éireann, I am specifically disbarred. In fact, an interesting group of people are disbarred &mdash; elected representatives to the National Parliament, people who are bankrupt and people who have suffered sentences of imprisonment. I am not sure what category I would fall into given the fact that I spent a brief term in prison.</P>

      <P>It shows what one has to do to represent one's constituents these days.  It is common nowadays for people to be involved in protests and demonstrations for just causes.  We have had protests by students, farmers and trade unionists and, as a result, some of them were sent to prison.  Paragraph 6 (1) (e) of the Second Schedule reads where somebody &ldquo;is sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo;.  Even if one has been in prison for a day one is disbarred, and it does not matter what the offence was.</P>
      <P>The other day we discussed the electoral Bill which contained a provision disbarring a person from standing as a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann if they had received a sentence of six months.  In other words, one is entitled to stand as a public representative representing maybe 10,000 people in this House or in the Dáil but one is not entitled to sit on the governing body.  The rules are different.  If one serves a sentence of imprisonment one is disbarred from the governing body whereas one can be a Member of the Dáil if one's sentence was less than six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken on board some <Col N="1630" /> suggestions I made and said he would look at them again.  I gave the example that a person could be sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment for the unauthorised sale of contraceptives.  Now the Minister for Health is making that legal. Somebody who broke the law and spent six months or perhaps a year, in prison for such an offence now finds that under the legislation introduced recently no such offence exists.  Nevertheless, the offence remains on their record.  That too, could be looked at and I would like to see an amendment that where somebody &ldquo;is sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a jury court of competent jurisdiction&ldquo; it would not be a trivial offence and it would be a verdict of one's peers.  I would like to know why a Member of the Oireachtas should not be allowed to sit on the governing body.  I am sure the Minister has a reason for that.</P>
    <P>Those are the main aspects of the Bill with which I am concerned and I would like to see changed.  At present there are 10,000 apprenticeships in the Dublin Institute of Technology system, and I wonder how we will deal with them.  Will this scheme continue?  Will these apprentices continue to work outside and attend classes at Bolton Street, Kevin Street, etc., during their training?  It is not clear from the Bill.  Many people are concerned because the Dublin Institute of Technology system crossed the barriers between many areas in education.  It was not the university, narrowly defined, third level education that followed on directly from second level.  It covered a broader area.  An apprenticeship is one of the major areas where one does not depend on one's qualifications from second level education or leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>Will the role of vocational education training, now devolve to FÁS or to second level institutions?  Will apprenticeships remain within the third level colleges?  Will it be left to the individual vocational education committees and to the governing body?  I do not know.  I would like to hear the Minister's reply to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> As regards funding, we have had many complaints recently about the Minister's decision to alter the present arrangements ESF funding and bring in a form of eligibility qualification.  That resulted in much confusion as people had to opt for courses on 1 February and did not know if they would get the requisite funding. The Minister decided to eliminate the allowance that was given formerly, for which there was no means testing. People who would have expected to get the full ESF grant for training and for living purposes are now not going to get it.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he is going to raise the eligibility levels, and that is to be welcomed, but it is still unclear what will happen in the autumn when people who applied for courses for which would have been eligible under the old system find they are not eligible, even though they applied in the early spring expecting that the old system would still be in operation.  The Minister's decision was made only a few days before the cutoff time for decisions in relation to the CAD and the CAS points scheme.  It is my opinion that the Minister had no business stopping the money which came from the European Social Fund.  The first thing he should have done was to establish a review committee to look into the overall situation in relation to third level funding, which badly requires to be overhauled.</P>
    <P>As regards the budgetary provisions, will the budget be streamlined?  We have a very bad situation in relation to the Department of Education where we never get a budget for the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Estimates are given, but the year is over before we know what is going to be allocated.  We operate in a vacuum, not knowing whether we have overspent or underspent. No budget is given in advance. That has been a criticism of the Department of Education in their dealings with the Dublin Institute.  Will the new accounting and auditing procedures ensure that the Department of Education do their job properly as well?  My concern <Col N="1632" /> is that there would be adequate budgetary provisions so that the new colleges and institute will be on a par with the universities and that there will be parity of funding for all third level institutions, perhaps on the <i>per capita</i> basis the Minister was talking about at second level.  If we are to enhance the status of third level colleges then we should enhance their funding.  I know that there is provision for participation in limited liability companies and that resources can be got from the industrial sector, the European Community or from research and development; but, nevertheless, the Department of Education must ensure that they treat the new institute and the new colleges on a par with the universities.</P>

      <P>I am not altogether happy with the Bills but at the same time I welcome the changes and the amendments made by the Minister.  It is the first time that legislation came into the Seanad, since I became a Member in 1977, in which four Ministers were involved in so many months.  It is not easy to be quite clear about what exactly is before us without reading it with great care and that I have tried to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the amendments made by the Minister to this Bill in the Dáil last week.  I listened at the time with care because of my deep concern.  Maybe there was more national concern than was realised at the provisions in the Bills. Many dedicated persons have served well <Col N="1633" /> for many years on the vocational education committee committees.  I do not have any trouble with changing the structures of committees, but I would like the change to be for the better.</P>
    <P>Vocational education training in Ireland may be traced back to the introduction of Bills in 1891 and 1899 empowering local authorities to initiate commercial and technical programmes. We are changing the Act of 1930 to the Acts of 1992.  For the record, there could have been more consultation but I want to record my thanks to the Minister, Deputy Aylward, for being available at all times to meet people when they wanted to talk before the Second Stage of this Bill came into this House.</P>
    <P>These Bills are not dealing with elected people or members of vocational education committees but will affect the students of this nation now and in the future.</P>
    <P>I must admit that I am more at ease dealing with local government, environment and health issues than with educational issues.  I was looking for somebody to advise me before I came into the House to speak on these Bills. One person I spoke to said the staff wanted the Bills changed; another person suggested it was the Department; another said the Minister, Deputy Brennan, wanted the changes; and another said it was the vocational schools. Whoever wanted change and whatever changes we make when we pass Bills must be for the betterment of students.  In the past &mdash; I say this as a long serving member of Fianna Fáil &mdash; we made mistakes in the fields of health and agriculture.  It is not that I do not accept change but I must be convinced that the change is for the better.  Some of the changes we made in the past were a mistake.</P>
    <P>I would dislike it if the only role left to vocational education committees was to look after the disadvantaged.  That will not be so now with the amendments.  I remember that was the role of vocational education.</P>
    <P>I have been associated with vocational education for 40 years now.  I have seen it move from what it was then to what we <Col N="1634" /> have now.  This is why I am a little worried and I hope the Minister understands what I am saying.  He knows me well enough to know that if I have a worry I will mention it to him either here or outside the Chamber.</P>
    <P>Until the mid-sixties vocational schools and their committees were just seen as providing apprentices and junior hotel staff.  It was my close friend, Dr. Paddy Hillery, then Minister for Education and our Dáil representative at the time, who gave them a new role in providing intermediate and leaving certificate courses.  I remember quite clearly how positive Dr. Hillery was at the time and how strongly he felt, with the advice of people like my late husband, Derry, that vocational education should be lifted and taken onto a new plane.  I have seen the number of students attending the vocational school in Ennis increase from 270 students to 670 today.  I worry about changing something that is so successful.  We had regional colleges in the seventies and they have made a major impact under EC management. Here again we are changing something that was successful under vocational education committees management.</P>
    <P>There is something very human about the vocational committees and the success of the colleges.  I look at the concept of Shannon and see how massively successful it has been.  I ask myself why change it.  There we have an industrial base, with students from the colleges and the vocational schools and we also have the tourists.  Our chief executive officer and the other chief executive officers have played a major role in that whole area.  The small amount of space given in the Green Paper to vocational education worries me.</P>
    <P>We will be discussing the Green Paper in the autumn and I am putting down a marker for Minister Brennan in that regard.  Mistakes were made in the past and I have strong views on this.  I make no apologies for it because I saw the work done by the agricultural committees and the health committees taken away from them.  I just worry about what we are doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> This is an ideal opportunity to co-ordinate educational services at county level in manageable units, with representation from all interested sections, local elected representatives, teachers and parents. The county is a recognised traditional unit for provision of realistic mechanisms for co-ordination and delivery.  Local co-ordination has borne fruitful development in counties like Cork, Clare, South and North Tipperary, Kerry, Carlow, Kilkenny and further up into Laois/Offaly.  I am familiar with those areas.  Religious managements have taken initiatives in those areas, always for the common good.  If these managements were formally united as equal partners, major development and rationalisation possibilities would be feasible.  The Minister has not taken the option of co-ordination in his Green paper.  He speaks more of streamlined vocational education committees.  What is a streamlined vocational education committee?  When those two Bills go through will there be further streamlining of the vocational education committees?  I am concerned about that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann supports the appointment of an all party Oireachtas Joint Committee to examine and make recommendations about the issue of funding of political parties and candidates <Col N="1636" /> and the expenditure of money at election time and other times; that the Committee be governed by the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the need to ensure that the democratic process is strengthened by an equitable distribution of resources; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the need to ensure transparency in relation to the source of funding, size of contribution and expenditure at election time.</P>
    <P>To survive in politics political parties need huge amounts of money.  For the major political parties the type of money involved can only be obtained from big business.  It is no longer acceptable that this money should be passed under the table without any limit on the amounts or any public awareness of the possible strings which might be attached to such payments.</P>
    <P>At election time money is an important determinant of who wins power.  Anybody with doubts about this has only to consider the enormous amounts of money spent by political parties on national promotional campaigns during elections.  There is no doubt also that individual candidates spend large amounts of money promoting themselves.</P>
    <P>There is no clear information available on the total amount of money spent by individual candidates.  Those who can afford it lash the money around without restriction or restraint and with no obligation to let the public know the manner in which the money was spent to manipulate opinion.  It is clearly unsatisfactory that the democratic process is open to such manipulation without public awareness or statutory control.</P>
    <P>Running elections at the moment is big business.  For the major parties the budget runs into millions of pounds.  It can be estimated that the total amount of money spent during national election campaigns by all the parties amounts to, I would estimate, somewhere between £5 million and £10 million.</P>
    <P>During the 1989 Dáil and European <Col N="1637" /> Parliament elections I understand that Fianna Fáil spent of the order of £3.2 million; Fine Gael spent £1.5 million; the Progressive Democrats spent £0.8 million, which represents about half of what they spent in 1987; the Labour Party spent about £100,000 on that election and that includes the money spent on both European and Dáil elections in that year and breaks down to a base of about 40-60 &mdash; in other words, about £40,000 on the Dáil elections and £60,000 on the European election.  These figures are the estimated amounts spent by the parties centrally and in general they are exclusive of what individual candidates might have spent.  If one assumes that it costs an additional £10,000 at least to elect each TD, then this would account for about another £2 million.  When various other expenses are accounted for, it is easy to see how the total figure might approach £10 million.</P>
    <P>Individual candidates have been reputed to spend as much as £50,000 on their campaigns in addition to the amount of money the party spends nationally.  In 1977, I understand that one former major politician is reputed to have spent £42,000 on his election campaign.  On a vote basis each vote cost him an amount between £3 and £4.  These figures are based on estimates and information provided from what would usually be considered a reasonably reliable source. However, if any member thinks that these figures are incorrect I would invite them to bring forward their own figures so that the record can be put straight. Indeed, if I am incorrect, I would welcome anybody in an authoritative position and who has access to the data laying it on the record of the House so that we will get the facts straight.</P>
    <P>The most basic campaign which would have any chance of success would cost of the order of £10,000.  Anyone who doubts this figure would be well advised to have a look at the main cost headings for a campaign.  Based on my own experience, I estimate that the major cost items would be as follows: posters costing between 50p and £1 each could, in total, cost as much as £1,500.  The number of leaflets <Col N="1638" /> used and distributed during a campaign is incalculable but the following items might be taken into consideration: canvassing cards are old-fashioned but necessary; an election address is unavoidable if free post is to be used during the campaign; issue based leaflets are essential for establishing differences between the party the candidate represents and the other parties; and a &ldquo;good morning voter&rdquo; leaflet is desirable in the Bertie Ahern mode and tradition.  The Minister for Finance did not invent it but he has perfected its use.  Labels, rosettes and so on are useful in geting a name across, especially in the case of the bigger parties who might be running newcomers. The cost of leaflets, rosettes and promotional literature can run to anything between £5,000 and £10,000 depending on the quality, the amount and the type of printing.</P>
    <P>Election headquarters are also necessary. In the Dublin area that generally means renting a shop, which costs in the region of £1,000 and in any well run election that would be a necessity.</P>
    <P>There are also many other desirable extras, such as the use of a mobile phone, banners, transport on polling day and secretarial assistants which, even in the most modest campaigns, would account for a few thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>Polling day is a major source of expense.  The cost of ensuring that personating agents are present at all voting tables in a typical constituency would cost between £3,000 and £5,000.  It may be worked out on the basis of £30 a day which I am told is the going rate for Fianna Fáil Party personating agents.  I would welcome correction if anybody on the far side thinks I am wrong.  The constituency I contested in the last general election had in excess of 100 election tables.</P>

      <P>I have informed the Leas-Chathaoirleach that I may be quoting a discounted urban rate and that expenses might be higher.  Dublin South-Central had 110 polling stations, at the last election <Col N="1639" /> which would involve costs of £3,000 to £5,000 for personation agents.  It may be more in some constituencies especially rural ones.</P>
      <P>I have listed basic categories of essential requirements which few Members of the Dáil would not have used in the course of their election campaign.  These figures do not take into account optional extras, such as press advertisements, money spent on both alcoholic and nonalcoholic drink and on other sustenance for election workers and supporters.  It does not take into account expenditure on PR companies which some politicians seem to resort to at election time or the renting of large hoarding advertisements which can cost between £500 and £1,000 during an election campaign.  These hoardings can be used for statements such as &ldquo;When the going gets tough the tough get going; Vote Bertie Ahern No. 1&rdquo;, a slogan used in one of the more recent campaigns by the Minister for Finance. I do not want to sound critical of the Minister because I have a tremendous admiration for his projection capacity at election time and I am sometimes bewildered when I look at the enormous numbers of votes he piles up running into five figures, somewhere in the 10,000 to 20,000 vote range.</P>

      <P>I was merely referring to an advertisement which a colleague mentioned to me this morning.  The reality is that with very few exceptions it is impossible to run a campaign with any hope of success for less than £10,000.  It is clear that many typically successful campaigns cost a good deal more than twice this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the large amounts of money given by meat companies to some political parties in the past, it is easy to understand how some campaigns are financed.  Why should small companies decide to invest huge amounts of money in political parties?  Are these <Col N="1640" /> investments made because these companies have an overwhelming desire to facilitate the democratic process?  What is the basis of the different levels of investment by these companies in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats?  Are these companies taking out an insurance policy with regard to the possible outcome of the election?  Can we be sure that these investments are not made on the basis of some unwritten and unenforceable <i>quid pro quo?</i>  Would these investments have been made by those companies if it was clear that the beef tribunal would make all this business public?</P>
    <P>The disclosure of the level of investment by small obscure meat companies which form part of the meat sector, which in turn is a modest part of the total food industry, which comprises a fraction of all the economic activity in this country, raises the question of how much money is being pumped into political parties by the business sector.  Is it good for democracy that small obscure meat companies should invest large amounts of money in political parties that in their opinion are the right parties to be in power?  That matter relates to what went on at the beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>The information available makes it obvious that the major political parties in this country could not survive without the financial support of big business.  I find it unacceptable that this inquiry is being made behind closed doors.  There is a clear need for full disclosure of the contributions by big business to political parties. At least the public should know who is paying the piper so that they can draw their own conclusions as the tunes are played.  Given the power of money to influence the outcome of elections, there is a clear need for a ceiling to be put on the amount of money any candidate should be allowed to spend.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place in the wake of a series of scandals relating to the activities of some people involved in big business.  These scandals have shaken public confidence in the democratic process. The right conduct of elections is vital to that process.  This country cannot <Col N="1641" /> afford to turn its back and adopt a position of disinterest towards the capacity of people with loads of money to manipulate the system so that their cronies get into power.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pretend that the Labour Party do not receive modest amounts of money from business interests during elections.  The type of campaigns the Labour Party run is clear evidence of the modest nature of the sums of money received.  I have no objection and I am in favour of full disclosure of these sums of money as long as there is a clear understanding that they are received on that basis and that the requirement for full disclosure applies to all other political parties.</P>
    <P>In the case of the money the Labour Party receives from the trade union movement &mdash; I have no doubt that some of our colleagues on the other side of the House will mention that &mdash; amounts of money are modest and are also described as such in the annual reports of the Labour Party and of the trade unions so there is nothing underhanded about it.  It is upfront and it is on the record.</P>
    <P>It is important that the funding of political parties and the impact of same on the democratic process should be examined by the Oireachtas.  The information revealed at the beef tribunal adds a special urgency to this issue.  The motion before the House this evening is an evenhanded, sensible and balanced motion.  It seeks that an all party committee should examine the question of party financing and the role of various agencies in that financing and that this should be done in an effort to strengthen the democratic process.  It also seeks to introduce control over and requests limits to the amounts of money which may be expended on election campaigns.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the advice which a wise spouse of a county councillor gave me during the last local election campaign. I asked her what her husband was at.  She said he was canvassing in one of those far off areas, and then I asked her if an advertisement which his party had placed in the local paper had been of any use.  She said: &ldquo;I wish to goodness <Col N="1642" /> someone would do a worthwhile thesis on the reasons people vote for certain candidates and on the value for money spent on various types of activity during elections.&rdquo;  I also welcome such a study. It would save many people a lot of money and prevent them from making some very foolish moves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this Labour Party motion in relation to the funding of political parties, the funding of candidates and the expenditure of money at election time.  Our proposal is to set up a joint all-party committee of the Oireachtas to look into this matter for the purpose of ensuring that the democratic process is strengthened, and that there is transparency in relation to accountability. For that reason we are not satisfied with the amendment presented here because it misses the point entirely.  We are not concerned with State funding of political parties in this motion but with ensuring accountability and transparency. Where money is provided to political parties &mdash; I do not know what money is provided to individual members &mdash; that is a matter for the Oireachtas and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has a function to regulate such matters.  We are talking about the wider national constituency and the manner in which political parties and candidates, prior to coming into the Oireachtas, acquire and spend money for election purposes.  We want to ensure accountability and that is a matter of great public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears talk everywhere of politicians being on the fiddle and not being trustworthy.  There is a perception abroad that we are not credible representatives of the people because we are not financially accountable.  Democracy relies on credibility and accountability. Abuses, whether of a gerrymandering or of a Tammany Hall nature, undermine democracy, and as upholders of the democratic system we should make certain that our affairs are in order, properly run and above suspicion at all times.  The danger of diminished trust and credibility is that a democracy may degenerate into <Col N="1643" /> oligarchy and dictatorship.  We have seen where lack of respect for institutions and for the democratic process has produced undesirable consequences.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation is the most complex of political systems.  We have adopted it because it gives maximum opportunities for expression to the maximum number of people.  It results to a certain extent in a proliferation of parties, large and small, individual candidates, non-party candidates and single issue candidates.  All these categories of candidate are welcome and we must ensure that there is no discrimination against any.</P>
    <P>The largest constituency of all may be those deprived of employment.  There are 280,000 people registered as unemployed in the Republic, a large constituency with a limited say in the democratic process. We must ensure that property or house ownership as an electoral qualification, as happened in the past, is not now replaced by wealth as a qualification.  This would mean that one could not successfully contest an election unless one had enormous wealth.  For that reason we must ensure that a ceiling is imposed on the amount of money political parties may spend in any election and on the amount that an individual candidate may spend.  If that were done, the actual source of funding would no longer be the critical issue it is at present.</P>
    <P>Accountability is not impossible to achieve.  Britain and Italy have introduced measures to ensure accountability and I am sure that similar measures apply in other democracies.  Every political candidate is allowed a certain budget and may not exceed that.  Invoices and receipts for all items of election expenditure must be produced preventing candidates from spending large amounts of money outrageously, on gimmicks and so on, and discriminating against poorer citizens in electoral campaigns.  Funding for political purposes must be disclosed as to source, must be accounted for and must be audited.  Similarly there should be a presentation of audits before the Oireachtas.  If we adopt accountability <Col N="1644" /> measures we will find ourselves with a healthier system and encourage greater voluntary involvement in the democratic process.  Candidates would need more assistants and new ideas and issues would be allowed to come more to the fore. The inequitable situation prevailing at present in relation to citizens' rights to stand for parliament and to contest and election on an equitable basis would not be interfered with.  An ethical situation would be established guaranteeing transparency and accountability and would, of course, bolster democracy in the process. In the last analysis we would have the support of the public, our greatest critic, upon whom we rely for election.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing today is an ideal format by which we could go about setting our house in order ensuring that there is no question of abuse from any source, business or otherwise.  We have seen the ugly head of big business influence raised during the beef tribunal disclosures over the last number of weeks. Thay may be the tip of the iceberg although I hope not.  We must ensure that that situation will not recur by learning our lesson from this tribunal and establishing structures that will allow the democratic process to operate on an evenhanded basis and make it accountable and open to the public.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;acknowledges the extent and transparency of the financial assistance at present provided by the State to political parties and individual Members of the Oireachtas both directly and indirectly, in support of the democratic process, and accepts that it would be appropriate that other matters in this general area should, in the first instance, be left to any initiatives which the Committees of Procedures and Privileges might wish to take in relation to them.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Senator Upton outlined the election <Col N="1645" /> expenses of parties and candidates very well; in many instances he was able to boil it down to the last penny.  His manner of outlining these items was not lost on the Members of the House.  He used phrases like &ldquo;I understand&rdquo;, &ldquo;speculation&rdquo; and &ldquo;reliable sources&rdquo;.  Coming from Senator Upton, these phrases surprise me because I would have thought that, coming from an august university institution, he would be a man of facts who would not rely on speculation, on informed sources or on understandings. To that extent I am surprised but perhaps I should not be.</P>

      <P>I would be surprised if Senator Upton believed everything he read or heard.  I know he is above that and it is strange that he should indulge in the type of statement made here this evening.  It is ironic that he should declare the Labour Party to be upfront.  He told us that his party get a contribution from the trade union movement but he said it was a modest sum.  When speculating about other parties' expenditure, he gave it to the last penny; when it came to his own party he described it as a modest sum.  I ask Members, who is codding whom on this occasion?  He makes no suggestion about auditing the accounts of the Labour Party and there is no suggestion as to the extent of their private funding. The Labour Party want to open the gates so that everybody can see what is happening and, lo and behold, everything is modest.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are being opportunistic. They see there is great hype about contributions at present.  There have been newspaper articles about people making contributions to political parties.  Being the party they are, not missing the opportunity, they say, &ldquo;this is a source of publicity and let us use it&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It &ldquo;acknowledges the extent and transparency of the financial assistance at present provided by the State to political parties and individual Members of the Oireachtas both directly and indirectly.&rdquo; I say to the members of the Labour Party that the Government are making a major financial contribution to the leaders of the various parties and to the various secretarial and administrative assistants in the system.  I would also point out to them that as a national party, the Fianna Fáil Party have a national collection. There is no problem about that.</P>
      <P>People come up to us as they come to other parties who hold national collections. What they say when they get near the Church gate is: &ldquo;here is a pound for democracy&rdquo;.

It might be a Fine Gael person giving a pound to Fianna Fáil or the other way round but they do it for the sake of democracy.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind my friends who were once on the socialist left but now, I understand, have gone to the right that there used to be a party called The Workers' Party.  I wonder where did their funding come from.  Was it from eastern Europe?</P>

      <P>There is speculation and documentary evidence that The <Col N="1647" /> Workers' Party did get funds from eastern Europe.  When you talk about democracy and about those funds, you ask yourself the question: what were those funds given to that party for and what was the ultimate purpose?</P>
      <P>Is there something very wrong with our political system?  Can these political parties exist?  Are they offering a true democracy?  Are we as political parties, doing anything untoward under the system that is operating at present?</P>
      <P>Basically what I am saying here tonight, through the amendment put down by the Leader of the party, is that there are many questions that have to be asked and answered.  It is appropriate that we use this opportunity to refer this matter to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges where we have many sensible people around the table who have intelligence.  We should give them an opportunity to look at what is a serious issue.  I do not doubt that political parties at present have difficulty with their finances. For instance, if we were to go out to the people in the morning and say that Fine Gael were £1 million in debt and Fianna Fáil perhaps £1.5 million in debt and ask the people to take us out of debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be supporting the motion here this evening even though, with the greatest respect to the scribes behind it, I find some of the wording a little woolly.  I support the sentiments expressed in it and I would like to see an all-party committee debate the issue of funding of political parties and the issue of transparency.  Without getting into details, we will be supporting the Labour Party motion before us tonight on that general basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A healthy open democratic system depends primarily on vigorous political parties.  I acknowledge the role of the <Col N="1649" /> Independents, lest we all be chided when we have a contribution here this evening from them.  A healthy democratic system depends on vigorous, properly constituted, political parties and it is to that I am addressing my remarks specifically this evening.</P>
    <P>The question of funding political parties has been with us for some time now but has assumed a new importance since the beef tribunal exposed details of funding from this rather controversial corporate sector to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.  What we do not know in this area, we are promised we will know before the tribunal is over.</P>
    <P>In Ireland not only is there no law which governs the funding of political parties but our Constitution does not even mention political parties at all.  Our legal system has no role in their operation. However, under the legislation governing the salaries of public representatives, leaders of political parties in the Dáil receive allowances in order to help them carry out their parliamentary activities.  Political groups of seven members or more are entitled to these grants and some parties &mdash; Fine Gael in this instance &mdash; put that grant directly towards the very costly funding of our headquarters.  Other parties may use that money differently.  I would like to see the size of grouping entitled to these grants reduced to five and I would like that to apply not only in relation to this matter but generally in the Dáil.  I make that point in passing.</P>
    <P>Political parties are generally regarded as unincorporated associations or private voluntary bodies in this country.  Their existence is not regulated by statute.  All of us must look at this immediately and see if there is an omission here.  As a result these parties are not obliged to keep accounts or publish them, although most parties do keep accounts.  Parties can appoint trustees to hold property and represent them legally in court. However, they are not legally obliged to do so and their appointment does not make a party a trust in the legal sense of that word.  The disclosure of donations <Col N="1650" /> is not compulsory.  No provision for tax deductions is mentioned by the law.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for campaign expenses at election time was abolished under the Electoral Act, 1963, and, while I did not have time to research that specifically, I imagine the reasons for that abolition would make good reading.  The electoral system in this country, being based on individual candidates and not on party lists, does not pre-suppose the existence of parties, although they are recognised in the Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of those facts in talking to this motion and the amendment, as we talk of political parties as if they were legal entities in this country. They are not recognised as such and we need to spend some time rectifying what I consider to be an omission in our system in that regard.</P>
    <P>All parties are experiencing serious difficulty collecting the large sums of money needed to develop political organisations. There is a real problem on the one hand, in that all political parties are now grossly under-funded and are carrying large and potentially unmanageable debts.  On the other hand, the obsession with fund raising activities is driving members away from the political process itself, as the highly motivated activist can no longer sustain the effort required to raise the necessary finance.  This is the core issue, not whether we need rosettes, should buy drinks for the activists at election time, pay personation agents or whatever.  The whole political process is being undermined as we are driving the highly motivated activists away because they cannot stand the pressure of raising funds locally and nationally for the party which they support.</P>
    <P>This constant quest for funding is seriously undermining the political process in several ways.  First, there is a growing perception that parties can be undermined by indebtedness to big business. Let us face it, this is the unwritten script of the beef tribunal.  The question in the air is, was a party undermined by corporate funding?  Justly or unjustly, it is the common held view that export credit <Col N="1651" /> insurance was linked to corporate donations.  I think that is unjust, but it is the perception of the man in the street.</P>
    <P>Second, the democratic process can be undermined by the fear or reluctance of parties generally to challenge the Government of the day on minor issues lest an election be precipitated and a party's indebtedness increased, particularly at a time when the banks may not extend credit to them.  This is a most important issue also.  It is not a question of who wears the rosettes and what they cost.</P>
    <P>Are parties in this House, or have parties in this House been reluctant to challenge the Government, or have the Government been reluctant to challenge the Opposition lest an election be precipitated when, financially, the parties cannot stand the strain?  If we are honest and look back over the years we may suspect that has happened on minor issues.  It has never happened on an issue of confidence or a big issue but on minor issues, I feel there has been pressure over the years.  Third, as I said, committed party activists are being driven away.</P>
    <P>Finally, through lack of funding, the capacity of parties to sell their message is seriously undermined.  With the revolution in the media today, and in the field of communications technology, the party that cannot afford to get its message across in the media is seriously undermined and with it, the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The state should fund political parties on a basis of £1 per vote on Dáil elections. I would like this all-party committee to consider that proposal, having reduced the group for a political party from seven to five.  I believe that elections should be funded by the State with strict spending limits imposed on each candidate and full accountability and transparency, transparency meaning full legal and financial accountability in relation to the party and candidate concerned.  I would suggest a £1 per vote and a rebate system on achieving a certain percentage of the quota for general election funding.</P>
    <P>It is early days yet and we would have <Col N="1652" /> to tease out exactly what all this would mean.  The electorate may not like it. Initially, they will oppose it but it is the norm in the developed world now, particularly in the European Community.  In Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain provision is allowed for the day-to-day spending of their political parties and they reimburse a certain amount of expenses incurred at election time.  All these countries, plus Belgium, Holland and portugal, require disclosure of the identity of people or companies donating over and above a certain amount.  I would very strongly support that view.  With this goes transparency and full accountability, i.e., full legal and financial accountability by the parties of their expenditure and income.</P>
    <P>Candidates' spending at election time would be strictly monitored.  This would effectively stop the buying of votes, where the stronger the party the more they can spend, the more they can influence the public and the more they can ensure a favourable outcome.  Fianna Fáil, even at this time, help certain candidates in key marginals through their trustee fund at headquarters.  Apart from the local constituency funding, they send money in from headquarters to key marginals. The role of TACA over the years has not been mentioned.  I know it is now abolished and, effectively, another committee has been set up in its place, but I have witnessed the altar boys of TACA in the sixties as they grew in stature and went up through the ranks, up to six months ago, to become the high priests at Charlie's altar.</P>

      <P>I would also like to comment on The Workers' Party funding from Eastern Europe and the Labour Party funding by the unions.  We need transparency, Fine Gael needs transparency in its funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Taoiseach's promises for open Government and to remove politicians from the culture of the fixer that had pervaded here in recent years, we need up front funding by the State of all parties.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> would be the transparency the electorate expect from <Col N="1654" /> all political organisations so that we can allow our activists to get on with the real business of politics which is the shaping of public policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial issue is that politicians are seen to be elected fairly and democratically and then seen to act independently.  Since becoming involved in political life I have come to develop a healthy regard for the integrity of the vast majority of politicians.  The problem with the introduction of any kind of financial element is that whatever the real circumstances under which politicians operate, there is no question of doubt, that the ordinary member of the public has become increasingly cynical about the way in which politics operate in this country, very largely because they believe that politicians and political parties can be influenced by financial inducements. Events of recent months have simply confirmed them in his view.</P>
      <P>I listened with some interest to some of the other contributors talking about the need for transparency and the need to be open.  Of course they have to be open now because the beef tribunal, if it does nothing else, is doing a good job of exposing material that was previously hidden.  This hits not just the Government party, it hits every major party in the State, and goes further to confirm what people may have felt about political life.  It is extremely dangerous if people are given the impression that political influence can be bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest when I heard about the demand for transparency, because I recall some years ago putting down an amendment to legislation going through this House which would have required not just a register of interests but also a register of payments received by political parties from various interests, whether industrial, commercial or indeed from any sectional interest operating as a lobby or private interest group in this country.  It was roundly opposed not just by the Government but by every one of the major parties.  I have to say, with the greatest deference to my friends on the Labour benches, that I cannot actually <Col N="1655" /> remember whether they opposed it; I do not think they did.  The reason I have not included them is that, regrettably, I cannot describe them as a major party in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter confined to Ireland. I listened during the week to a rather unusual presidential candidate in the United States of America being engaged in conversation.  One of the things that was being raised, both by him and about him, was whether or not this was another example of the American presidency being bought.  The point that was made in return was that, at least if it was being bought, it was being bought by his own money and he was going to return it to the people of America.  I think that is a rather frightening prospect, this kind of paternalist notion that a man can use all those millions in order to acquire the highest office &mdash; and it is an executive presidency in the United States &mdash; and then return it graciously to the groves of democracy.</P>
    <P>May I also say that I am disturbed by a number of the revelations that have come out.  Now, I do not want to seek to impugn the integrity or honesty of any of the politicians involved, but can I put it this way.  Businessmen live in a very realistic world.  I have sought over the years to secure funding for various beneficent operations I was involved in, in the form of sponsorship from Irish companies and from multinational corporations. Believe me, in order to get £5,000 out of a very large company you have to produce a logical brief and very detailed expansion on precisely what they can get in return.  They just will not look at sponsorship in a kind of generalised, sentimental, do-gooding sort of way.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Senator Lanigan.  Why would they?  The reason I have got substantial sums of money from a number of companies and corporations is that I am able to go to them and say this is what you will get for your £30,000, which, for example, Arthur Guinness <Col N="1656" /> gave to the Joyce Cultural Centre.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, with your wide experience of life in the civilised reaches of the West of Ireland and your long experience of the realities of political life in Ireland, you will be able to answer this question: what precisely is the <i>quid pro quo</i> when very large companies lollop out sums of money in excess of £30,000?  There are records here of £30,000, £35,000, £40,000 being handed out.  I am not suggesting that Ministers or leaders of Opposition parties were directly influenced or that they took specific decisions in an atmosphere that had been coloured by such donations.  But I am perfectly certain that the hard headed, realistic businessmen who handed out this kind of hard currency certainly believed that, although they might not be able to summon in a Minister and give him his orders, they were creating a context in which what they said would be received favourably. There is no question in my mind, or in <Col N="1657" /> the minds of the vast majority of the Irish people, that such cash grants are related to the creation of an environment in which a positive view would be taken of those providing the money.  That seems to me to be hard, logical sense.  Nobody gives money for nothing.  It is interesting to look at the sums involved.  If they were so altruistic, and so interested in the democratic process, why did they not decide to bolster up some of the smaller parties?  Why did they give the very largest contributions to the Government parties, and give money according to a descending order of influence?  If you really want in the most idealistic sense to promote democracy, you do not promote the largest party in the State, you promote the weaker one.  Perhaps they might even have been tempted to support some of the lone Independents who maintain the highest standards of parliamentary integrity.  I do not, in fact, rule out the possibility of money being given, and may I lay my cards four square on the table?  I, too, have received money.  I did not receive it from Larry Hagman.  I did not receive it from Larry Goodman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just ignore him.  One of the things that helped me to make up my mind to run on that occasion was that I called a meeting of some supporters and one of them actually gave me a cheque for £250.  He was a non-party person, somebody with whom I had worked on legal matters.  He was a practising member of the legal profession.  His views, he found, coincided with mine. Somebody else came to the meeting who did not have time to spend on this and was not that much involved in politics. That person left a little note with six points on it.  I did not open the envelope until the next day.  Wrapped around the six points was a cheque for £500.  There was no question that my opinions were being influenced.  Those two people knew perfectly well what I stood for.  I think they felt that there was an opening there for this kind of radical liberal view to be expressed and they wanted to support it. <Col N="1659" /> I would be very happy for that kind of information to be placed honestly and squarely before the people of Ireland. There is no such thing as a free lunch or even a Mae West free dinner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure how we should respond to this motion because it has been put down just to get a little bit of publicity by a group of people who know bloody well that they get financial support themselves.  Senator Norris has agreed that he gets certain financial support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not enough.  This is the nub of the argument.  He has agreed that it is the &ldquo;not enough&rdquo; argument that is at stake.  He would suggest people in the majority parties might get a little bit more than the others, who do not get enough. In my lifetime in politics I have got a few pounds from people but in terms of their support, financially, I have never been able to give them back a political response.  I got their support because people believe that as a Member of the Oireachtas I can help this country to progress. They did not give it that I would go to a Minister to get a certain programme through.  Financial assistance to Members of the Oireachtas has always been given by people outside the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Members should be paid commensurate with what we do in terms of legislation.  We should be full-time politicians and paid accordingly.  The Minister and his advisers and senior civil servants are paid about five times more than we are paid.  Legislators should be paid for the work they do.  The Seanad is sitting four days this week.</P>
      <P>At £17,500 a year, we are not paid to be legislators, but to be assistants.  If a person gives me £500 in an election campaign, he does not ask whether I am going to pass legislation.  He probably gives it because he feels that as Senators we are not paid enough to legislate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> I have heard arguments about the need for transparency in public and private funding.  In the future I hope that any body who gives me a financial inducement does so because I am a friend and not because he is going to get anything in return.  I have been involved in politics for many years and have been offered financial inducements but I have never gained financially.  Altruism has been mentioned but there is no altruistic person in this country.  Politicians will always receive financial support.</P>
    <P>Setting up an all-party committee will not change people's attitude towards giving a few pounds to Members of the Oireachtas.  The democratic process would not be strengthened by an equitable distribution of proceeds.  That would mean that every company who wish to give a few pounds to a political fund would do so on the basis of the percentage of votes for each political party. For example, they would give 55 per cent of the money to Fianna Fáil, 50 per cent to Fine Gael and so on.  Nobody would give money in that way.  People give money to those they feel will work for them and who may be able, at some stage, to put pressure on a Minister or a Government.  That is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>People have always given a few pounds towards election campaigns and they will continue to do so.  We acknowledge the extent of financial assistance at present provided by the State to political parties and individual Members of the Oireachtas, and I sincerely hope that continues.</P>

      <P>Before I call the next speaker I would like to explain that under the order of the House, as there is a greater numbers of Fine Gael Senators than Labour Senators, I should call a Fine Gael Senator.  However, Senator O'Reilly has kindly agreed to allow Senator Harte to speak first.  I put that on the record lest a precedent be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Any precedent created in this respect was created by me because I gave way many times and made concessions. <Col N="1661" /> However, I thank Senator O'Reilly for his gesture.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Keeffe spoke about dealing with facts, which are events, truths and realities, but he did not proceed down that road.  He misquoted some facts and made innuendoes about where funds came from.  Funds were never given to the Labour Party by any eastern countries. Some time ago when Deputy Lenihan was leader of the Fianna Fáil group in this House the issue of contributions was revised.  On that occasion I informed the then Senator Lenihan exactly how much is provided by the trade union movement, and I will repeat what I said then. Any Member who allows his name to stay on the political register contributes 28 pence per year.  If he signs a form to the effect that he wants to be excused from paying the political levy the money goes into another fund &mdash; there are five funds in the union.</P>
      <P>There are about five trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party and often we were delighted to receive about £13,000 per year.  Individual members who are members of a union may receive a grant from the union provided there are sufficient funds in the union political fund.  Somebody foolishly suggested &mdash; I think it was Senator Lanigan; he must have lost his political acumen &mdash; that we are discussing this matter to get publicity. On a day when the President addresses both Houses, it is unlikely that we will get much publicity.  It must be accepted that there is some sincerity in our efforts and that we are genuine about this matter.</P>
      <P>There is no mention in the motion of State funding, nor is there any reference to the desirability of State funding of political parties.  While we do not see political funding as the panacea for all ills, especially in respect of accountability, inevitably in any joint party committee it raises its head as one option for consideration.  There has been much talk about what is happening, but we want to see action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our objective is clear.  We do not believe that democracy is being served well in circumstances whereby one political <Col N="1662" /> party can afford to risk spending £1 million to cover an election while another party cannot risk spending more than £50,000 or £60,000.  That kind of activity only weakens the democratic process and our objective is to strengthen the democratic process by putting in place a more equitable system.</P>
    <P>All the evidence before us shows that there is no community support, nor should there be, for political parties who are not prepared to disclose private sector contributions.  Failure to do so is aggravating to the public, particularly as the parties do not have to show they have used the money wisely and properly.  This matter should be examined.  Openness is important, and this motion affords all political parties an opportunity to ensure transparency.</P>
    <P>The motion is about ethics, and we can only succeed in that aim by ensuring that political parties are encouraged to compete with each other on the basis of well researched ideas, policies and initiatives. In the present circumstances we cannot do that.  There is nothing democratic in one political party having the resources to communicate effectively their ideas to the public at large while other parties with good alternative ideas are denied, because of lack of resources, the fullest possible scope to communicate these ideas effectively.  We cannot allow a continuance of the buying of votes mentality. It is crazy that one candidate can spend £30,000 on his private campaign while his competitor struggles to find £5,000 or £6,000.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a committee is essential if we are serious about preventing shadowy businessmen from calling in their IOUs.  Many serious incidents have contributed to the cynicism by the public of politics and politicians.  Let us rid ourselves of that tag and we can do this by setting up a joint committee to cover every aspect of the matter, including contributions from trade unions, etc.  If we accept the setting up of an all-party joint committee, which would deal with the major unanswered questions that concern the public, we will have done a good day's work, and without much publicity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> I agree with the principle of the amendment but in its reference to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges it does not effectively amend the motion. Therefore, while we accept the amendment in part, it does not meet our objective. I am sorry for rushing through my contribution, but having been facilitated I want to give other people an opportunity of speaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The great thing about this country is that we have a democratic system which allows freedom to individuals to join and be part of the political system.  In all my years in politics I have always cherished the freedom to join and leave a party.  All of us know of people who were members of political parties but because of disagreement or whatever they decided to leave the party.  That is the essence of democracy as it works on the ground, people realise that Governments are not doing a good job they have the right to contribute money to another party to help bring about a change of Government.  That is a right which has to be protected.  I strongly believe that those who advocate publicity of contributions to political parties are the very parties who, since the State was founded, have been taking money out of people's wages, with no questions asked and no records kept.  These people now request disclosure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for your protection. I am well aware of how the system works.  Many people have asked me how they can discontinue contributing to a certain political party out of their wage packet.  I told them they are foolish to give money if they do not believe in the party to which they are contributing.  That practice has existed for years and no records or statements are kept of the accounts of organisations or the way the money is spent.  The Govenment party, of which I am proud to be a member, have dispensed with the practice of keeping records of contributions. When collecting money at church gates or wherever we no longer write names and send out receipts.  If people put £10 on the plate I thank them. We identify these people locally as supporters and contributors and we are most grateful to them.  Like every other political party, we have a system of collection. There is no point in coming in here and pretending you are naïve.  That charade is evident in the motion before us.  Political parties exist only because they receive contributions from people who believe in them.  Thank God we have received sufficient contributions to sustain the party down the years.  We need money at the moment because our party is in debt.  That is a matter of public knowledge and we are not afraid to disclose that.  The average intelligent person knows that if he throws £100 or £10 on a plate his daughter or son who is looking for a job is not going to get one the <Col N="1665" /> following week.  He knows that is not a possibility, but he also knows that it is important to sustain a Government who are doing a reasonable job.  That is the kernel of the matter and the public who contribute to political parties know what it is all about.</P>
      <P>The publicity about the Progressive Democrats sending back £10,000 and the publicity surrounding the tribunals that are taking place has nothing to do with the fundamental issue of politics.  The people involved in those cases believe you can use the political system, but every time that has been tried it has failed.  These people never succeed.  The average person who believes in a party contributes to them in an open way whether at the church gate or wherever, and he knows he will not get a receipt. As long as I am alive I will collect contributions at church gates and I will not send out receipts for these contributions, which are welcomed.  I and my colleagues in the political party are sustained on contributions received from the public. I will never come into this House and apologise for accepting contributions because that is the basis of our existence as a political party.</P>

      <P>I think most people agree that there is much cynicism about politicians and politics.  All of us in this House know that much of that cynicism is misplaced and is not justified.  A recent MRBI poll established empirically that public perception of politicians is very low.  I am convinced that the current events in the Four Courts and at the beef tribunal together with the recent spate of publicity, is a major contributing factor to cynicism about politicians.</P>

      <P>It creates bad public perception of political practice.  On occasions, as Senator Lanigan said, people make donations to political parties for altruistic reasons.  While many people are very genuine in making bona fide contributions, without wishing to influence politicians, unfortunately, that is not always the case.  It would be in the best interests of all political parties to establish a system of State funding of parties.  There should be openness about the operations of political parties.  The systems used in Germany and Denmark are worth looking at and I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>It would be churlish of me not to regard the Minister here tonight as a person who is serious about the business of politics. I would urge him to take on board the notion that it would be in the interests of all political parties to put this matter on a level footing by bringing in a system of State funding.  Such a system would benefit all political parties.  There would be no question of inherent injustice because the system would be based on electoral performance and on the number of votes for each party.  There would be an openness and a clarity about it.  The system would provide for public audits of political party accounts &mdash; in other words, it would have to be clear to the public who is funding whom and to what degree. These matters are important.  It may be known to me personally that people who contribute to my election campaign do so for the right reason and that I am not engaging in malpractice by going to county managers to get planning permission for people who fund me. However, the worrying consideration relates to public perception, which is not good at the moment.  The system will have to be seen to be fair and open, as is the case in Denmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no option but to bring in State funding and ensure public accountability and an open approach.  Such a system would be in the interests of individual politicians.  Nothing is more compromising for politicians, be they members of town commissions in Bantry, Cootehill or wherever, members of <Col N="1667" /> county councils or Members of the Seanad or Dáil, than to have to depend upon major donations from big business in order to contest elections.  People are conscious of this on an ongoing basis and it cannot be good for them as professionals or in developing their perspective on various matters.</P>
    <P>I believe we should introduce State funding.  It would be an equitable system that could be operated properly.  There should be openness in regard to the funding of parties so that the public are fully aware of the position, that would work to keep democracy functioning and to eliminate the cynicism that exists abroad at the moment.  I ask the Minister to consider setting up such a system as a matter of urgency.  If we continue with the present system alienation of the public from all the mainstream parties will increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of political funding is as old as democracy itself. Indeed, several countries have moved in recent decades to either introduce legislation or to amend existing legislation in this area.  Surprisingly, Ireland and what is called the mother of all parliaments, the House of Commons, have been somewhat slow to introduce legislation in this area.  The British and Irish parliamentary systems provide for annual assistance from public funds to help political parties carry out their parliamentary work.  In Britain this is limited to parties which had at least two members elected at the previous general election or one member elected and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast.  Therefore, there are certain restrictions, as indeed there are here.  The Irish system is based on the number of seats won in the previous general election, but there are few checks and balances when it comes to the wider question of political funding by individuals, groups and corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the principles behind the motion.  I believe, however, that the Government amendment requesting that such matters should, in the first instance be left to <Col N="1668" /> initiatives which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses might wish to take in relation to this matter is the wisest course.  However, in common with my colleagues on all sides of the House, I would urge that this matter, which is now firmly on the political agenda, be addressed, preferably prior to the next general election.</P>
    <P>I belong to the school of thought which believes that political parties in the democratic process should be funded out of the public purse.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that in sister democracies in America, Canada and especially Australia, our legislative colleages have been way ahead of the posse in this regard.  In America, for instance, the biggest changes have been made in the area of campaign financing of presidential elections. Until 1976 campaigns were financed largely from contributions from wealthy individuals or groups who believed their interests could be advanced by association with the president and party in power.  This was a wide open system that allowed for unlimited contributions and spending.  Presidential campaign costs rose in America, and I will give some idea of the scale of costs involved.</P>
    <P>In 1860 it cost an estimated $100,000 to elect Abraham Lincoln while some 112 years later it cost $60 million to elect Richard Nixon.  The most recent figures available from America indicate that in the US federal elections of 1988, that is, the national elections, almost $1,000 million was spent by candidates seeking federal office &mdash; the Presidency, the Vice-Presidency and fewer than 500 contested seats in the Congress.  Since the early seventies, a new wave of political reform arose in America, at federal and state level.  The Federal Election Campaign Act, 1971, and subsequent amendments, have regulated campaign financing and provided for federal matching funds for the primaries and for full funding of general election campaigns subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to an interesting section of the US Act of 1971 which could perhaps be included in any future legislation that might be <Col N="1669" /> contemplated here.  Americans now indicate on their tax returns whether $1 of their taxes should go to the federal election campaign fund.  This initiative was first used in 1976 and might be worthy of consideration in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>The reason for this flurry of legislative reform, not just in America but indeed in Canada, Australia and other English speaking democracies, was that the public funds provided in national campaigns were and are intended to diminish the need for contributions from wealthy &ldquo;fat cat&rdquo; donors and interest groups and, especially in the pre-nomination period in America, to make the nominating process more competitive and so encourage candidates to broaden their bases of support by seeking out large numbers of relatively small contributions.  My colleague, Senator McGowan, touched on this issue in the context of major political party funding in this country, which in the main is made up of relatively small contributions taken, as is the Irish custom, outside church gates or in door to door collections.  I would like to see this continue.  However, there is a move within Parliament &mdash; and as I stated earlier, I would encourage this &mdash; to seek more public funding, particularly for elections, and so diminish, and I hope eliminate the need for political parties to request, sequester or lobby corporations for large contributions.  I agree with Senator McGowan that raising this motion might give the impression to the general public that there is something dishonest about paying into a party fund. Of course, that is not the case and I think most people recognise this.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Canadian example. The history of Canadian politics is littered with party leaders and Cabinet Ministers who were involved in questionable dealings as a result of financial contributions being made by vested interests.  Until recently the large industrial and financial interests of Toronto and Montreal provided nearly all the funds required by the main political parties in Canada.  Fund raising in Canada was organised at committee level where the various political parties formed committees <Col N="1670" /> which were then responsible for raising the money for their campaign funds.  These main fund raisers were not responsible to the elected party organs and rarely held elected office but were appointed by the individual party leaders. They were usually co-opted from the legal or financial communities or else they inherited their position from older family members.  The usual reward for members of these fund raising committees when the party achieved office was appointment to the Senate or to the Bench.</P>
    <P>However, because of scandals in various provinces, including Ottowa itself, and because of the effect of the American Watergate scandal in the seventies, there was a movement for the control of election expenses during the sixties and seventies in Canada.  That has now been tidied up under the Election Expenses Act, 1974.  Reforms have been adopted by the majority of provinces in Canada and the role of party funds which was formerly ignored by the legislature has now been recognised in that country. Control bodies have been instituted and ceilings imposed on party and candidate spending and contributions.  In Canada, disclosure of the amounts and sources of income and expenses is mandatory. Incentives for individual donors &mdash; again, I suggest that this might be worthy of note in future legislation in this area &mdash; have been provided in the form of graduated tax credits favouring smaller gifts.</P>
    <P>Let me turn briefly to the model that I believe we should look at, that is, the Australian model.  Since February 1984 the Commonwealth Electoral Act, 1918 has been amended and provides for public funding of election campaigns, disclosure of political donations or gifts and disclosure of electoral expenditure.  Last year the Act was amended to require full disclosure of all income, expenditure and debts of registered political parties. Registered political parties, independent candidates and non-party Senate groups in Australia are eligible to claim public funds and seek reimbursement of their election campaign expenditure.  Candidates and Senate groups are required <Col N="1671" /> to submit returns disclosing gifts received and electoral expenditure incurred in relation to the election while registered political parties are required to submit annual returns of income, expenditure and debts.  Interestingly &mdash; this point was raised during the debate on our Electoral Act &mdash; the legislation in Australia on registration of political parties states that the electoral commission will refuse to register a party if the name comprises the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;, some Senators take note.</P>
    <P>On the question of disclosure of political donations or gifts, the Australian legislation is of interest.  They define a gift as any disposition of property, including money, for which no payment is made or for which any payment is inadequate. They state that a return must be made within 15 weeks following the date of the poll and that it must show the total value of all gifts and the total number of donors, the amount or value of each gift &mdash; this is their definition of &ldquo;a gift&rdquo;&mdash; from a donor who gave $1,000 or more to a Senate group or $200 or more to a candidate, the date on which each gift was made and the name and address of the donor.</P>
    <P>This provides plenty of food for thought in relation to any possible legislation that might be contemplated.  I hope this matter will be dealt with in legislation sooner rather than later because I believe it would be of help in changing perceptions, misplaced or otherwise, in the public mind about the manner in which donations are made by groups or by individuals. Having carried out some research on English speaking democracies, it seems that legislation was not introduced in response to any public clamour but rather because parliamentarians themselves realised that they were vulnerable on this issue in the public arena and should, as a necessary extension of the parliamentary and democratic process, introduce legislation to tighten up the position with regard to political contributions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Government's commitment to reform of the Oireachtas <Col N="1672" /> in general and, in that context, I look forward to an opportunity to debate these matters.  I hope the Minister will return at some stage during the term of this Dáil to propose legislation of this nature.  I am confident the Government will do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. My only complaint is that it is not as explicit and blunt as it should be.  I will happily disclose my election expenditure and its source, if my bank manager permits; the source of my funds is my salary and the bank manager and I received a total of £20 in the last 12 years in donations.  While I would not dispute the honesty of the Members of this House who say that donations do not influence them, somebody is codding somebody because I am sure that the people who give donations think they will make a difference &mdash; that is the problem.</P>
      <P>I know the Members of this House and the other House are not crooks but the public thinks we are crooks.  We have to change that perception.</P>
      <P>Political parties are very good at that when they get professional advice during election compaigns but once an election is over, they forget all about it.  We then have to wade through this quagmire of public cynicism.  Week after week at the beef tribunal at Dublin Castle we hear about donations to political parties and people who took high moral positions and claimed they were above all this, but the reality is that most of these donations are given to the three main political parties; they are not given to the Labour Party or the Democratic Left and, most assuredly, they are not given to members on these benches, although I cannot speak for Senator Ó Foighil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in a dispute about the contents of Senator Lanigan's pockets and I accept what he says is true, but people do make donations.  If this is a noble gesture as Senator McGowan would have us believe, why are they so determined to <Col N="1673" /> keep them secret?  If people want to make a contribution to political parties then they should be required to make this public.  It should be remembered that the trade unions must make it public and must include the amount of the contribution in their accounts, which are subject to stringent controls under the legislation that governs the trade unions. If parties receive money, this should be made known publicly.</P>
      <P>I am not an enthusiast of the concept of State funding for political parties because I believe it would lead to a splurge on elections; that instead of spending the almost obscene amounts of money that were spent on recent elections, twice as much money would be spent &mdash; the money the State would provide plus the amount received in other donations.  We must review the scale of expenditure in elections on multiple multipage advertisements and multiple multicoloured handouts in addition to expensive television advertising, which is the way other countries have gone, and bring it down to a realistic level.  This is daft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because my constituency continues to expand I would be delighted, like every other Member, if a ceiling was put on expenditure.  Why then do they not outline the amounts they spend and receive?  The profound reluctance of parties to disclose to the biggest and most important tribunal in the history of the State the source of their political donations does not fit well with the &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; commitment to reduce and control election expenditure; the two do not go together.  Therefore this motion, given that it refers to the need for transparency and to elections, not just to the funding of political parties, should be accepted by the House.  If it is not accepted and we put the matter on the long finger again &mdash; I do not necessarily believe this &mdash; the public will say that we are postponing the issue to take the heat off and to allow the next issue take its place, and that during the next election campaign once again obscene amounts will be expended.  The amount spent in recent elections were obscene.</P>
      <P>All I can say to the two political parties which are now up to their necks in debt is that it serves them right.  Because they spent a fortune on a succession of elections they are now up to their necks in debt.</P>

      <P>The first thing that attracted me when I read the motion was the reference to the need to strengthen and support the &ldquo;democratic process&rdquo;. This is put forward as a principle to form part of the basis for what is sought in motion.  As a statement of principle, few people would disagree with this.  I certainly have no hesitation in subscribing to it.</P>
      <P>What does, however, cause me difficulty and annoyance is the sheer hype which is going on at the moment on the issue of the funding of political parties, candidates and so on under the umbrella of principles like this one.  The present motion is part of the hype, part of the over-reaction.  The &ldquo;war cry&rdquo; we hear is that something drastic needs to be done so that the democratic process is protected and supported, as if that process were in a state of collapse or in imminent danger of collapse.  That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case those who have tabled the <Col N="1676" /> motion have not noticed, the democratic process is alive and well in this democracy. It is as strong and as vibrant as it has ever been.  If proof were needed, we have only to look at the public's handling of the recent referendum, the ultimate expression of the democratic process.  In spite of being bombarded, through the &ldquo;democratic process&rdquo; I might add, with irrelevancies and red herrings in the leadup to referendum day, the public had the political maturity to see what the real issues were and to use the democratic process to go out and make their democratic choice.</P>
    <P>Let us forget therefore about all this hype and keep things in perspective.  Let us pull back from those airy-fairy theories of democracy in distress, or democracy in crisis, and come down to earth.  In spite of what some would try to make us believe, the democratic process in this country is in a healthy state.</P>
    <P>Of course, because the operation of democracy is an ongoing event, there will always be issues which need to be aired, to be discussed and, if need be at the end of the day, to be tackled in one way or another.  Just now the limelight is on funding issues, and that is fine, but let us not go overboard on these issues and rush into a search for quick solutions, or into mechanisms which we think will provide quick solutions.</P>
    <P>These issues are complex and have many facets on which people have different views and opinions.  We in this House, or indeed the Dáil, are not the only ones with vital interest in them.  There are no easy solutions and time is needed to allow mature positions to develop in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Take, by way of example, the question of the State funding of political parties.  I have heard the issue of total funding by the State debated on radio, for instance, both by politicians and members of the public as if parties get on State support at present, as if party members and the democratic process were left completely unsupported.  The reality, of course, is quite different.  The State, that is the taxpayers, does provide very substantial financial support for the &ldquo;democratic process&rdquo;<Col N="1677" /> through allowances for party leaders and staffing and many other facilities and expenses for members and parties. In 1992, the State's contribution is <i>circa</i> £500,000.  We owe it to the public to acknowledge that that support for the democratic process is provided, in effect, by them.</P>
    <P>On this one narrow front the issue that has been debated is whether we should go beyond what is made available and provide virtual total State funding for political parties.  This is a very sensitive issue which is of great interest and concern to the general public; but as yet, as I have said, there has been little real, properly-informed debate on it and very little opportunity for mature views to develop in relation to it, as they should.</P>
    <P>That is just one example.  Many other issues arise on the broader funding front. It is not necessary to detail them for the purpose of this motion as it is concerned more with the question of putting a mechanism in place; but what I have said applies to these other issues also.  They need to be aired and debated in public so that informed positions and views can emerge on a broad front and not just among the small group of commentators and media debaters who seem to be more concerned with getting a bandwagon rolling so that they can jump on to it.</P>
    <P>These issues need to be given time.  We must be careful not to push too hard, too soon, for solutions to them.  There are, after all, far more than us engaged in the democratic process, far more than us with vital concerns in these issues.  Let us not forget that we are interested parties in some at least of the issues that arise and we must take great care not to leave ourselves open to the charge of being judges in our own case.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I cannot go along with the proposition that a joint committee be set up at this stage to examine all the issues referred to in the motion.  In my view that would be a premature and excessively reactive step to take at this stage.  It would represent an initiative which I feel is neither appropriate nor called for at this stage and which I feel this House should not support. <Col N="1678" /> To go from where we are into the formal situation of such a joint committee of review would not be appropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, no wish that formal debate of these issues by Members of this House or of the Dáil be stifled.  It is quite right that these issues be debated and that Members discuss them in tandem, as it were, with the development of more informed public debate on them.</P>
    <P>My very strong view is that if Members wish this whole question to be formally pursued the most appropriate approach at this stage would be to leave this in the first instance to any initiatives the Committees on Procedures and Privileges might wish to take.  I recommend this approach to the House.  Whatever emerges from the committees would clearly be a very significant input into how the whole question is handled from there on.  Therefore, I ask the House to join with me in supporting the amendment to the motion and I thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>While I accept there is a need for disclosure and transparency a few points should be made.  There is an impression that members of the larger parties at election time have vast resources available to them to fight elections.  Normally, at election time, the national organisations look after national advertising while posters, leaflets and day-to-day campaign expenses are handled by constituency organisations or by the candidates themselves. Because of our electoral system, general elections are made up of 41 separate elections.  Therefore, it is my firm belief that the amount spent nationally by parties bears little relationship to the result of the votes in various constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it a virtue not to spend money on elections.  Indeed, the strength of my campaigns in both Seanad and Dáil elections lay in the fact that I did not have resources behind me.  I always depended on my community for financial support <Col N="1679" /> to ensure that I had money to keep going, in elections to the Seanad in particular. The collection of money formed part of the election campaign and allowed ordinary people to become involved in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I am against the concept of State funding for political parties because I do not think it would resolve the problems associated with corporate donations, if they are a problem.  What would happen instead is that the ordinary person who contributes between £1 and £5 to the political party of their choice would say to us &ldquo;We do not need to do this anymore because you are getting money from the State&rdquo;.  Therefore it would lead to a drop in income and to people deciding to reduce their involvement and the day our people reduce their involvement in the democratic process is the day democracy will be at a loss.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a direct relationship between spending and election results nor do I believe the Irish electorate would be as stupid as to let people buy votes.  I think people are now only beginning to realise that more and more elections are going to be fought by way of debates in the local media &mdash; in addition to the house-to-house canvas &mdash; and on television.  If we want the State to contribute in election campaigns, although most people would agree this would lead to saturation coverage, it could do so by providing more time for debate on the national airwaves and ensuring that adequate time is made available on local radio for a proper debate so that candidates can account for their actions and outline their policies.  It is my belief, from my experience of local elections, that the people who get elected are those with a record of work, who are upfront in their dealings and who can articulate their views coherently on local radio and on the doorstep.  In this debate we have under-estimated the intelligence of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Cuív mentioned that there is a perception that major parties have vast resources available to <Col N="1680" /> them.  It depends on what one considers to be vast; and if you look at it from the money which is available to my party, then the figures are vast.  If doubts exist, one of the best ways of clearing up those doubts would be to publish the amounts. However, the major parties have resolutely refused to do this and seem to have used every device available to them to resist such a move in the case of the money provided by the companies now involved at the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Ó Cuív had to say, he spoke about the relationship between spending and the number of votes obtained.  I accept that there is not a lineal relationship between the two and I have no doubt that a substantial amount of money is spent in a stupid manner which does nobody any good.  The people who spend this money have more money than an understanding or knowledge of politics.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State used the word &ldquo;hype&rdquo;.  However, I am at a loss to know where the hype is in our motion which I consider to be well balanced and evenhanded. In it we adopt a very sensible approach to the problem.  I cannot understand, therefore, how the Minister of State could use the word &ldquo;hype&rdquo; in relation to its and hope he is not hypersensitive to any mention of the question of the funding of political parties at this stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to compliment Senator Mooney on his speech, although I would not agree with everything he said. I want to compliment him in particular on the way it was researched; it contained useful data.  He seemed to put a lot of effort into its preparation and it was both valuable and useful and I have to compliment him on it.  While I would not agree with everything he said I welcome his suggestion that this country should look at the Australian model.  That is a worthwhile suggestion.  It is possible that we would reject all or part of it but we <Col N="1681" /> could start from there.  It is a constructive suggestion and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I also noted with interest that the Senator mentioned there was a necessity to introduce legislation, sooner rather than later.  I welcome his remarks.  As for the other speakers on the far side of the House, I have been driven to despair, it is difficult to take them seriously.  The motion deals with the potential for those people with large amounts of money to invest to manipulate the democratic system.  That must be a source of concern. It is important that we now get down to the business of controlling the ways in which money can be spent.</P>
      <P>I relished the opportunity to speak before and after Senator O'Keeffe; this is a luxury I enjoy only on rare occasions.  He mentioned that I had used the words &ldquo;understand&rdquo;, &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;reliable sources&rdquo; in relation to the data I produced regarding the amounts of money spent by the various political parties. The reason I used those words was they were the only ones I could use as the hard facts are not available.  I invited Members on all sides of the House who have data, either in relation to their own expenditure or in relation to the expenditure of their parties, to put it on the record and to refute what I said if what I said was wrong.  Facts were not produced. There were no figures mentioned.</P>

      <P>I quoted the figures for what the Labour Party spent in those elections.  If I remember correctly, I said that in the 1989 election the Labour Party centrally spent £100,000 and of that £100,000, to the best of my information, £60,000 was spent on the European side of that campaign and the remaining £40,000 was spent on the general election campaign.  In relation to the 1987 election, to the best of my knowledge, the Labour Party spent £200,000 on the campaign nationally.  I would invite Senator Doyle to place on the record what the Fine Gael Party spent in those elections, <Col N="1682" /> or, indeed, to contradict the figure of £1.5 million approximately that I gave as having been spent by the Fine Gael Party on the 1989 election.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I am sure Senator Doyle would have a far better understanding of what Fine Gael spent than I would have.  I have to work on the symptoms of the spending rather than having access to the actual amounts.  Where is the difficulty in publishing these figures and why will Fine Gael not make that data publicly available?</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that money is made available to political parties.  The Minister rightly said that it is of the order of £500,000 and that is welcome.  But that is not the central point that this motion sought to address.  The central point which this motion sought to address was the question of the capacity of those people who have large amounts of money to manipulate the democratic process in an unacceptable manner.  Basically, that is what it is all about; and those concerns are more acute because of the information which is now being produced and made available from Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>Normally I try to restrain myself from referring to anything that Senator McGowan says.  It is good for me, good for Senator McGowan and, indeed, good for the House; but on this occasion I will make an exception and simply repeat what Senator Harte said in relation to the money which was taken out of their wages &mdash; I hope I am quoting Senator McGowan correctly &mdash; by the unions.  It is 28p per person per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking forward to speaking on these Bills but Senators will understand that when one is interrupted after ten minutes it is difficult to resume one's train of thought.  I moved the suspension of the House at 3.30 because the President was to address a sitting of the two Houses.  At another time in history, the man who put all education systems in place, the Chief himself, was interrupted in 1923 and when he came back to O'Connell Square he said &ldquo;As I was saying when I was interrupted&rdquo;.  I would also again like to put on the record this evening Dr. Paddy Hillery's major role. The worth of a Minister's contribution in education may not be seen until many years later.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Aylward, will go to higher positions as Paddy Hillery did.  I am not talking about <Col N="1685" /> the Park; I am talking about a senior cabinet position.</P>
      <P>It is nice to have stitched into the record of the Seanad on this day in July 1992 the names of Eamon de Valera, Paddy Hillery and Liam Alyward.</P>
      <P>I understood the regional colleges were and are a success under vocational education committee management, but I come back to what I said earlier today.  I must ask myself why all the changes. Has the Minister decided on the eight regions?  There are 38 vocational education committees.  Is it going to be eight regions, or how many will we have?  What constituencies may go together?  As one who served for many years in health and local government, I have a holy horror of regions.  We have made mistakes before in regionalising Departments.  I presume there are people wiser than I who are again going down the road of regions.  If I were on the Opposition Benches this evening I would have more to say on that.</P>
      <P>During the recent Maastricht debate we told our people that some of the power was to be left at local level.  Those of us who vigorously campaigned for Maastricht &mdash; and people did go out and vote because they trusted and believed us &mdash; talked a lot about subsidiarity.  That word was used a lot.  I do not like the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; but I have to use it here because we must give the say or the power back to the people who serve and know the local scene.  I worry that we are moving from the vocational education committees and the people who have given dedicated service and have an extraordinary knowledge of what is needed for our students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Culliton report referred to job training for the future and tied it up with vocational training.  However from talking to persons concerned about vocational education, I know there is still confusion.  We are always confused now. I accept that Minister Aylward and his senior officials have tried to explain this Bill.  I must pay a tribute to the team who <Col N="1686" /> backed the Minister on these Bills.  I am talking more about the Regional Technical Colleges Bill than the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill because I am more familiar with it.  I cannot talk about a Bill if I am not close to it and if I am not convinced that I should contribute to it.  The two Bills are being taken together and I have no trouble wishing the other Bill well.</P>
    <P>Before the Adjournment I put down a marker for Minister Brennan.  I want to put it down for the second time: the bottom line is that the students are well served by the system.  It should not be changed just to suit somebody's whim or because vocational education may not be their bailiwick.  Great people have gone to all the nations of Europe and to the United States having been educated under the system that is in place.  Before he takes Report Stage next week, the Minister might talk to two or three vocational education committee chairman. This would be worthwhile if it convinced them that the amendments put through the Dáil were what they wanted. It would be better if he explained what was in his mind when he was making these amendments in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I find myself talking about mental handicap because I served for 25 years as chairman of a voluntary body and I am familiar with local government because I have served there for 35 years.  I find it is easy to relate to people in those two fields.  The Minister might consider speaking face to face to two or three chairmen of the vocational education committees and tell them what he has done.  It might be a worthwhile exercise. I leave that to the Minister's judgment.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees devoted themselves to the creation of a system of higher education through regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and they have had unqualified success.  The vocational education committees have much more to contribute to the ethos and mission of these colleges and I ask that <Col N="1687" /> they should be let do so.  I understand that the amendments have given a lot of what they asked for back to them.  I would like to make sure that the Government do the right thing.</P>
    <P>I have served in the Seanad since 1977. In the early years it was all on party lines, but in the last ten years the Seanad is playing the role for which it was initially set up.  It reviews legislation and less politics are played here than in the other House.  I do not see anyone playing party politics in this Seanad.  That is something I feel strongly about.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>The growth of the colleges has been phenomenal.  In the period since 1980 wholetime student numbers in the regional technical colleges has risen from 6,500 to almost 20,000 an increase of over 200 per cent.  In the same period, wholetime enrolments in the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology have risen by over 100 per cent from 4,000 to 8,800.  The vocational education committee third level colleges therefore have over 28,000 wholetime students which represents almost 40 per cent of the present total enrolment at third level in this country.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as we take this legislation through the House this evening. Why are we changing it when it has been so successful?  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology will consist of a chairman, 18 ordinary members and the president of the institute.</P>
    <P>The ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the appropriate vocational education committees in accordance with the following...</P>
    <P>Does that apply only to the Dublin Institute or to both the institute and regional technical colleges?</P>
    <P>I welcome section 12 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and section 13 of <Col N="1688" /> the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill. These provide for matters relating to existing staff who will become staff of the colleges or of the institute.  The Minister should deal carefully with the changeover of staff because, as a Senator on the other side of the House who is a member of a trade union said, there may be trouble with that unless it is very carefully handled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that the governing bodies will annually prepare and submit to the vocational education committees operational programmes and budgets.  I understand that the vocational education committees will have some, if not all, the say in how the money is spent. Whoever is responsible for spending the money has clout.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister paid tribute in his address to the existing colleges.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is fitting, therefore, that the role and ethos of the vocational educational committees will continue to be strongly reflected through the provision of these Bills.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a lot of public relations work already and has been gracious with his time even at weekends.  I know how much time he gets off; he does not get any; but maybe he will get to the odd match between Tipperary and Kilkenny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard in a contribution today that the vocational education committees are still very unhappy. That sentence alone in the Minister's address would help enormously if it were relayed to them.</P>
      <P>No matter what Government are in however &mdash;and I hope to stay on this side of the House if I survive after today &mdash; when I see a Bill with words such as, the Minister, by order, may do this and that, I get the shudders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the membership of the <Col N="1689" /> board, I do not know why we enact legislation which does not allow Senators become members of boards.  I have strong views on this.  The sooner we as elected people decide that we have a right to put ourselves forward, the better.  I am not talking about every Senator but Senators who have served for up to 15 to 20 years on existing boards.  In this Bill it is stated that Members of this House cannot be on these boards.  The Minister will say it is because of this, that and the other.  In the early years I used to apologise for a rise in pay, for not being on a board or not trying to get on a board. When I look around me I see geniuses who should not be on any board and I wonder what we are at.  We must go before the people to get elected to the Seanad; yet, after serving here for 15, 16 or 17 years we are not eligible for a board. The Minister should not look at me, because I do not want to be on a board. I am talking about the principle involved. You do not get elected to the Seanad unless you know your business.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill that worries me most of all is the appointment of chairman.  I do not think it is democratic or correct.  No matter who is in power, it is wrong that under this Bill the Minister has the power to appoint a chairman.  The reason I worry about this is that if a person is appointed chairman who may not be familiar with what the rest of the board are doing, there may be a reaction to that.  It sounds daft that a Minister would make that kind of an appointment, but I prefer to have harmony between board members.  The Bill states that the chairman shall be appointed by the Minister and may be removed from office by the Minister.  Has this been done before? I know the Minister will tell me in his reply.</P>
    <P>We have a great educational system.  I hope that these two Bills will add to that system and that young people will benefit from what we are doing here today. Senator Raftery, who was a former MEP and hopes to be again &mdash; rather like <Col N="1690" /> myself and the Chair &mdash; has seen our well educated students in Europe.</P>
    <P>I thank Minister Aylward for listening to me and for the amendments he made to the Bills.  I thank the Chair for his patience.  When a Government Bill is going through this House I am usually more convinced they are right than I am about these two Bills.  I saw the other system work at first hand.  I saw the extraordinary dedication and commitment of the men and women who served on vocational education committees.  They did not do it for the few bob in expenses they received.  There are some people who would never have been educated were it not for the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the former members of the vocational education committee in Clare.  Nobody will understand this better than the present Minister. My late husband, who was educated at St. Flannans College, and Tadgh Mac-Namara believed in vocational education and I would hate to undo the good they did years ago.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and his senior officials for their patience and kindness to the deputations they met at very short notice, and with great graciousness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what is in these two Bills.  I welcome some of the changes proposed therein but I disagree profoundly with the manner and speed with which the Bills were introduced and with the fact that there is a guillotine on the debate on these two most important Bills.  Why did we get these Bills in the same week as we got the Green Paper on Education?  It would appear that we are putting the cart before the horse.  Why are we amending part of the jigsaw before we have the total picture?  We are dealing already with the detail of the plan and I think it is the wrong way to go about doing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Honan that the vocational education committees have done a marvellous job in this country. <Col N="1691" /> Although I have never been a member of a vocational education committee, I worked with them in Munster, with the exception of Clare Vocational Education Committee, for more than 20 years when I served as a member of the adult education committee in University College, Cork.</P>
    <P>UCC pioneered adult education in Munster, starting with the late Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly back in the forties.  We could never have achieved anything without the full support and co-operation of the vocational education committees, which we always got with the utmost sincerity and enthusiasm.  Small though our programme was, I believe it made a significant contribution to education in Munster, particularly for those who did not get a chance in their youth and for those who wanted to go back for the love of it.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees also made another strikingly important contribution and that was when there was an explosion in the numbers of students entering third level education.  In the 1960s there were about 25,000 students in third level education.  Today there are more than 70,000 students in third level education and between the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges there are about 28,000 students.  That meant we had a phenomenal growth in numbers, particularly in the regional technical colleges.  The vocational education committees did a good job and the students acquitted themselves very well and got good employment.  As Senator Honan said, those who went to Europe to work acquitted themselves very well.  I have often said that the Irish politicians in Europe may not be the best, but the administrators and the people in the Commission and the Parliament are among the best and I am very proud of them.  We have a good education system and in that the vocational education committees play a very significant part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Having said all that and recognising the contribution made, I am amazed at the manner in which they have been treated by the Government under these two Bills.  They have been literally ignored.  The record shows that the IVEA in November 1982 made a detailed submission with the aid of senior counsel setting out proposals for a legal framework for research and consultancy; no reply was received.  In March 1985, the association made a detailed submission to the Department of Education to establish autonomous management structures in the colleges; no reply was received.  In October 1991, the association sent the then Minister for Education details of over 50 amendments to the Bills, and no reply was received.  In December 1991, the IVEA asked the Secretary of the Department of Education for clarification of the vocational education committees' role under the colleges Bill, and no reply was received.  On 6 May 1992, the IVEA presented the Minister for Education with a summary of essential amendments, and again no reply was received.  The Minister gave an assurance on 6 May 1992 that the IVEA would be consulted after he had considered the amendments, but there was no consultation of any kind.</P>
    <P>This is a despicable way to treat committees which have given extraordinarily committed service to education, and in more recent years to third level education. I am deeply concerned at the way elected public representatives are being treated in this matter.  The college principals and the TUI can get changes and assurances but elected representatives are treated with scant regard.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bills it was indicated that they would (1) retain the colleges within the vocational education committee structure; (2) provide a framework for the operation of the colleges within which policies and an operational programme and budget could be drawn up by the governing body for each college in agreement with and subject to <Col N="1693" /> approval of the appropriate vocational education committee; (3) give each college through its governing body the responsibility and the necessary authority to implement approved policies, programme and budget; (4) require the approval of the vocational education committee for any deviations therefrom; (5) give the vocational education committee, in addition, appropriate representation on the governing body of the colleges; and (6) provide a statutory basis for the participation of the colleges in research and development including, where appropriate, participation in limited liability companies for the purpose of exploiting results of their research and development work.</P>
    <P>That was fair enough and the IVEA had no fundamental disagreement with these objectives.  The amendments introduced, virtually by sleight of hand, are the most serious assault on vocational education committees since their establishment. In fact, I could say without reservation, that virtually all vocational education committee influence in the colleges has been clinically removed.  That is regrettable because, while there is a lot of good in the Bills, it is a matter of concern that these committees should be treated with such contempt.</P>
    <P>History is one thing, but the future requires something else.  I am glad to see the colleges getting increased autonomy. I am glad to see many other things in the Bills but I am concerned that there is a tendency for centralisation of planning at the time when we, as a nation, preached the virtues of subsidiarity, knocking at doors during the referendum campaign, speaking at meetings and preaching in public at hurling matches, after Mass and so on.</P>

      <P>I got a good reception in Thurles.  Again and again I emphasised the necessity for subsidiarity and the fact that this was the first time it <Col N="1694" /> was written formally into a Community Treaty.  Here we are at home undermining the very principle which we found so admirable in European legislation.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that for the future we will have continued growth in third level numbers and continuing growth in adult education and continuing education.  I understand there are about 130,000 people taking adult education courses now, and that will inevitably grow.  It is a growth industry in countries like the United States and I believe it will be a growth industry here too.  I welcome that. There will be need for a continuing and an increased contribution by regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>In relation to other items mentioned in the Bill &mdash; I promised Senators Ryan and O'Reilly that I would be brief to allow them contribute &mdash; I am very happy to see that written into it is the idea of co-operation with other institutions, both inside and outside the State.  Indeed, there is already co-operation inside the State and it is increasing.  My college, and perhaps Senator Ryan will refer to this later &mdash; whether he agrees with me I do not know &mdash; is now committed to more co-operation with the regional technical college in Cork.  This will be to the mutual benefit of both institutions and their students.</P>
      <P>What is new in this proposal is co-operation with institutions outside the State.  Many years ago, as a member of the Higher Education Authority I suggested that we should be co-operating with Coleraine and Queens Universities. That was in the seventies and, I am sorry to say, at that time it got a very cold reception from the Higher Education Authority.  We have come a bit of the way since and I hope we will go further in co-operating with outside institutions, particularly on this island, and after that throughout the rest of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research and consultancy are mentioned, and this is as it should be, but I do not think Eolas is mentioned in the <Col N="1695" /> Bill.  They should be listed among the institutions that should be involved.  Limited liability companies are mentioned, and this is fair enough.  Research is important and getting moneys for research is important, but an institution could reach a point where it would be overly dependent on those who want research done.  The figure for research grants in UCC last year was of the order of £7.5 million; we are taking about 20 per cent of total college income.  We could find ourselves doing work because the money was there; this would not contribute much to the national interest but could contribute a lot to the interest of companies outside of the State.  We could go too far down that road and we would want to be careful about it.  On the other hand it is good to see Departments within colleges and universities competing openly and successfully with other institutions throughout the community.</P>
    <P>Limited liability companies have their usefullness too and UCC was probably the first college in the country to establish a limited liability company on campus. The situation will grow as it has done in the United States and in Britain.  There are certain dangers there but they can be avoided.</P>
    <P>Mention was already made today of giving regional technical colleges the right to award degrees and in the longer term I think that would be an admirable step.  We will have to remember however that gaining international recognition and respect for regional technical college degrees will be a slow process.  Perhaps we should examine it carefully every year and as soon as it is possible I would be happy to see it happen.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the manner in which this Regional Technical College Bill was introduced and about the fact that the vocational education committees have been to a large extent ignored in it, or so they say.  I am also unhappy that we did not have this debate after the Green <Col N="1696" /> Paper was considered, with more time to tease out all details of this Bill.</P>

      <P>As somebody who works in a regional technical college I am happy with the general philosophy behind the Bill, but I am as concerned as many of my colleagues about the apparent haste to get it through.  There are serious issues that need to be discussed relating to the philosophy of education contained in the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  Some of the values about third level education contained in the Green Paper betray a certain ambivalence.</P>
      <P>I find it offensive, as I think most Members of this House will, that the third reason one could lose one's position on the governing body of a regional technical college &mdash; one reason is bankruptcy and another is imprisonment &mdash; is if one becomes a Member of Seanad Éireann, Dáil Éireann or the European Parliament. Somebody must have a strange notion about politicians because regularly in the making of rules bankrupts, convicts and politicians are grouped together.  It should not happen in any legislation.  I can be on the governing body of UCC by a variety of means.  I can be a member of the Senate of the National University.  Senator Murphy can be on the governing body of UCC as a member of staff, Senator Raftery can be on it as a member of staff; but I cannot be on the governing body of my own institution where I was a member of the board of management before this ridiculous prohibition came in.  Now I am told I am not fit to be on it.</P>

      <P>I deplore that categorisation and I will invite the Minister, however late it is next Friday, not to tell me that this has always been done up to <Col N="1697" /> now but to explain to me why it has always been done.  I am sick of people saying, &ldquo;We have always done it this way, therefore we will continue to do so&rdquo;. There is no rationale to that; it is the antithesis of rationality.  <i>Education for a Changing World</i> is the title of the Green Paper but on this there will be no change but a boring repetition.  That is meaningless. It is grossly offensive to be categorised along with bankrupts and convicts as one of three categories of people prohibited from being on the governing body of an regional technical college. It is time we did away with this clause.</P>
      <P>I want to mention differing perceptions of third level education, the first of which is the perception that there are different kinds of education involved.  No amount of philosophical talk about the equality of different strands of third level education will convince anybody.  I do not begrudge UCC a penny, but all one has to do to understand how this perception arose is to walk through UCC and then walk into the Cork Regional Technical College. There are two different categories of third level education in terms of funding, standards of buildings, support, student facilities, staff facilities, security and a host of other features.</P>
      <P>The Cork Regional Technical College operates with four security staff.  An institution with about 3,000 students and 400 staff cannot ensure that all of its entrances are manned by a security person.  It is possible to walk in and out of about ten different doors of the institution unchallenged.  There can be no sense of equality in third level education while that continues.  When one walks in the door of an regional technical college one is made aware of different standards of acceptable building standards conpared to UCC.  Those are the sort of things that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are philosophical views about universities that need to be sorted out.  I have a great belief in the importance of third level education for fostering freedom <Col N="1698" /> of thought and expression.  There is a mystique however about degrees and their alleged superior status to all other forms of qualifications.  What is the difference between a pass university degree and a diploma degree from a regional technical college other than mystique? What are the superior job opportunities for somebody who gets a pass degree in science by comparison with somebody who gets a credit or a distinction or diploma in some area of applied science? There is no distinction that I know of in entry standards, monitoring etc.  The distinction is a mythical one.  If we are in earnest about integrating different types of third level education we should forget that distinctions.  Degrees are nothing more than a higher level of qualification to something else.  It would be more logical to classify pass degrees as diplomas than to pretend that there is a suite of progress from certificate to diploma to degree.  There is no difference between a pass degree and a diploma that I can see; no logical rational distinction that can be made between them.  The solution is to equate what are of equal value.</P>
    <P>Another topic surrounded by mystique comes up in the Green Paper, on page 197, where there is mention of something I have never heard of before called &ldquo;academic drift&rdquo; in the non-university sector that causes problems.  I gather it is a sort of inertia which keeps things going. I am intrigued that &ldquo;academic drift&rdquo; only occurs in the non-university sector.  One gets the impression reading through the Green Paper that the writer is treading around the delicate sensitivities of the universities.  There are many references to their being consulted, to their views being sought, but there is a much blunter approach to the State sector of third level education, as if the same delicate sensitivities did not apply.  As one who works in the State sector of third level education I would advise the Minister and the Department of Education not to allow themselves to be bluffed by either the tradition or the perceived status of universities. <Col N="1699" /> Their degrees should be examined to know if they really make a difference.  Is the country served by producing hundreds if not thousands of pass science degree holders every year who are not really qualified to work as technicians or as process chemists because no industry will recruit them on the basis of a pass degree?  They can only end up aspiring towards second level teaching, which may not be their vocation.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper there is much talk of quality assurance.  The best quality assurance is in the marketplace.  Does the market want to recruit the people with pass university degrees?  On that criterion, the regional technical colleges have been vindicated because their graduates are recruited consistently and new positions have been created within companies to avail of their skills.  We in the regional technical colleges do not need any lectures about the need for some sort of semi-State quango of bureaucrats to assess the quality of our graduates.  We will know soon enough if industry does not want to recruit them and at present overseas companies are coming to recruit them.</P>
    <P>On the question of status, I have a throw away but interesting comment to make.  The professor of, say, Latin, in University College, Cork, is paid more than the principal of the Regional Technical College Cork.  I do not begrudge the professor of Latin a penny of his salary, but I resent the implication that there is a relative pecking order of academic status.  That matter needs to be sorted out.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said about this legislation and most of it has been elaborated to a considerable extent in the Green Paper.  The distinction between the research that universities will do and the research that non-university third level institutions will do was, in my view, thought up by someone.  Distinctions between applied research and fundamental research, between regional and <Col N="1700" /> national research are not valid.  Those distinctions came out of someone's head and have more to do with the universities keeping a firm hand on most of the funds available for research than with rationally based distinctions.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the Bill which may do much for the non-university third level sector but it is riddled with requirements for the permission of the Minister.  Could the Minister tell us how many clauses and sub-clauses have ended with &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;?  I would not mind if Minister Aylward or Minister Brennan made the decisions but we know that some middle ranking to junior civil servant will make many of these decisions according to a written set of criteria.</P>
    <P>If the criteria are written down, decisions could just as easily be made locally as nationally.  It is a bit of a myth that the Minister will decide all those things.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to give me one convincing reason the chairman of the governing body of every regional technical college should be appointed by the Minister for Education.  It is either an example of gross patronage or a gross offence to the good sense of members of the governing body that the Minister should believe that a governing body cannot appoint the best person from their own membership as chairman.  That requirement is offensive and should be taken out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past three years I have been willing, able and glad to give an unqualified welcome to Bills that have come before us from the Government side.  There have often been points on which I might have differed or modifications that I would have suggested. We have had a good record of legislation, of worthwhile, useful and important Bills.  This Bill is also useful, worthwhile and important but it gives me cause for regret that there are certain aspects of it which could be better.  It is <Col N="1701" /> an important Bill giving education the recognition it deserves and needs.</P>
      <P>Education, including third level education, should be a basic right of the individual.  People often talk about rights and the right to knowledge and to education is unquestionable.  A more practical prosaic point is the need to educate people to the maximum of their potential. That is particularly necessary in this country.  We have just had the Maastricht Treaty referendum and if the Treaty is finally approved, we will find ourselves in a market of 300 million plus.  If it is not approved, we will still be competing in a very harsh world.  There is no way we can hope to compete with a poor education system or poorly educated people.  We have to be capable of competing for the upper market niches, for the highest levels.  We have many things against us but one thing we have in our favour is that so many Irish people down the generations have been gifted with flexible minds.  Irish people are capable of getting tremendous benefit from education and of using those benefits to write novels, plays, television scripts or whatever and in business and technology to compete in our competitive world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a good record on education but we need to make more third level education opportunities available.  I do not like to talk of levels because education should never stop but should continue through one's lifetime.  Here we tend to look upon education as something with a brief timespan.  We are competing more and more with Germany, Holland and in due course with Switzerland and France where formal education tends to go on longer than it does here.  One meets German students in their late twenties who may have moved from one university to another, who may have attended the technological university in Hanover. Theirs is an ongoing system of education. There is also a series of ongoing education systems in various industries and Ireland is beginning to move in that direction. This is excellent but, unfortunately, <Col N="1702" /> many young people, capable of benefiting from further education, are not getting that opportunity.  We have been unfortunate that until relatively recently our idea of third level education was an extraordinarily narrow and warped Victorian one where people were educated to become colonial administrators and where subjects of practical nature, such as science or business, were looked down on.  There were extraordinary ideas current that unless a sort of liberal arts college was a feature of a university, then it was not a university.  I remember one distinguished, and at that time important, person say that one could not have a university with only one faculty.  That is rubbish.  Some of the greatest universities were one faculty universities.  I accept that there are many advantages in having many faculties but thank goodness that narrow view is changing.</P>
    <P>There are still unfortunate aspects to our education system such as the points system.  Many students choose to study subjects simply because they have the points to admit them and infinitely more students are deprived in one sense or another because sufficient places do not exist for them.  There is little excuse for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan and I do not always agree with each other but I almost had to pinch myself when I heard him referring to the marketplace.  The marketplace does sort it out.  If an excess of students want to do engineering or some form of it it does not take long for the message to get through from the marketplace; it comes through quicker than any sort of attempted bureaucratic control.  Sadly, there is far too much of the heavy hand of bureaucracy evident in this Bill, and I say that with great regret.</P>
    <P>I have served on the governing bodies and on academic councils of universities and medical schools and I am at present a member of a vocational education committee. One of the most worthwhile of these bodies has been the vocational education committee and I commend the <Col N="1703" /> work being done by our fellow councillors on these committees.  Often, by virtue of who they are, committee members know best what is required in a given area and more than the most well informed, well briefed and well intentioned member of the Department.  We have an excellent Department of Education, but I think we are setting up something here which we are going to greatly regret and which will probably have to be changed in due course.  I am certain of what I say and I would like to see, at some stage, a redress for this.</P>
    <P>Local councillors down the decades have given valuable service on vocational education committees whether paid or unpaid and that in practice, will now be lost.  That is a matter not only of personal regret but an extremely retrograde step which cannot be justified on either academic or practical grounds.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about certain other aspects of a bureaucratic nature, some of which have been mentioned.  I am concerned about the effective powers being given to directors.  We are fortunate in our vocational education schools to have had many excellent principals doing excellent work.  With the removal of an input from the public through public representatives, directors will have excessive powers.  The title &ldquo;director&rdquo; itself is significant and most regrettable.  I do not see why they could not have been called principals and be proud of that but the title of director is being given and judging by the considerable powers they will enjoy, a governing body only in the most exceptional cases will be able to oppose them.  That situation, should not arise.</P>
    <P>The balance between the academic council and the director is unfortunate. The statement in the Third Schedule says:</P>
    <P>The director of a college shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, control and direct the activities of the college and shall control and direct the <Col N="1704" /> staff of the college in the implementation of such activities.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the director shall be responsible to the governing body &ldquo;for the efficient and proper management of the college&rdquo;.  Yes, we must have efficient and proper management of a college but this Bill gives inappropriate and excessive powers to the directors, summed up in the title.  This is not justified on academic or practical grounds.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, the Bill is excellent in raising the status of Irish education.  It begins to bring it all together so that greater equity of status can be achieved and it is a shame to see these flaws in an otherwise admirable Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him luck in his relatively new appointment.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed that the Bill is effectively being guillotined.  This debate will conclude on Friday and with the Dáil going into recess, it is unrealistic to expect amendments to be taken on board.  It is also a source of regret to me that the IVEA believe corporately and individually &mdash; I have spoken with them today and with their general secretary &mdash; that while they have had recent consultation, they have not had adequate consultations throughout this process and that it has all been hurried for them.  They were not part of the slow, consultative process that could have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of regional technical colleges and their position, Senator McKenna when he addressed the House this morning, gave eloquent testimony to the merits and achievements of regional technical colleges &mdash; and chronicled their achievements over the years.  That chronicle of achievements of the regional colleges was continued by a number of speakers.  I concur with the opinion that the regional colleges have been an absolute success on a number of levels.  They have been successful because of their democratic nature ensuring accountability; they have been successful <Col N="1705" /> as egalitarian institutions in that through ESF funding and other devices, they have attracted a range of students from across the social divides.  They provided third level education and training and personal development for students whose aptitudes and abilities would not necessarily have fitted them to attend traditional universities.</P>
    <P>There can be no question that the regional colleges responded well to the needs of local industry and communities. They have been a focus for change and development and have aided the democratisation of education by providing courses for people who would not normally apply to universities and who may have psychological barriers about attending universities.  That has been part of the regional colleges' achievement.</P>
    <P>Relations between the regional colleges and the regional technical colleges have been good and I agree with Senators Raftery and Honan and other speakers who noted the achievement of the vocational education committees down the years.  There can be no doubt that many members of vocational education committees worked very hard; expenses were not a major consideration with them and there was considerable commitment to the job.  A number of people outside formal party politics were members of vocational education committees and very committed to that process.  In County Monaghan a reverend gentleman was chairperson of the vocational education committee for a number of years and made an almost complete life commitment to vocational education.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees have had and still have a great diversity of local personnel on their boards, reflecting all political parties, social classes and interest groupings.  The link up between the regional colleges and vocational education committees was productive.  I am not convinced that it is prudent to go down the road proposed in this Bill.  It seems that colleges want effective independence from the vocational education <Col N="1706" /> committees &mdash; this seems to be the aspiration of college principals and academic staffs &mdash; so that they can become more academic and more university like, with greater independence and status.  Colleges argue that research facilities and so on will enable them to expand their role and that is being granted with modifications by the Minister and the Department. It is questionable if we should allow that to happen when one considers the role played by regional technical colleges in the past number of years.</P>
    <P>In my area regional college education was the ultimate achievement for many people and had marvellous effects on many families.  Nobody would have contemplated leaving the area to attend a university.  Attendance at the regional technical college, was sufficiently daunting and was a major breakthrough for families who would not have had much contact with formal education previously. If we were to change the profile and nature of these colleges, perhaps change the names and, as Senator Conroy correctly points out, change the titles of the school principals to some other modern titles, we would take away the democratic quality of the institutions and leave it without that quality of accessibility and attractiveness for the students in the other socio-economic group who do not traditionally go to our universities.  That would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>There is no case for the Minister, whatever Government he belongs to, appointing the chairpersons of these governing bodies to rule the colleges.  I will be putting down an amendment to oppose that. It might be argued by a Minister that the logic in his appointing the chairperson of the body is that it will now have a national dimension.  There is no reason why a competent governing body should not do this.  I have slight reservations as to what degree this is an advance on what was a happy situation, responsive to a community need in an area, to local industry and to society.</P>
    <P>The role of Dundalk regional technical <Col N="1707" /> college in my region and that of the Cavan College of Further Studies is fantastic. The regional technical college in Dundalk has a fantastic rate of success in terms of providing a good educational service, motivation, reaction and participation in the area.  It has increased enrolment and anxiety to get in there. The same is true of Athlone regional technical college.  In Cavan town we have an excellent College of Further Studies with a great level of participation.  It is run by the local vocational education committee, has a tremendous teaching staff and courses and provides third level education to people in this catchment area who may not have the financial ability to go and live in a university or regional college town.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there was need for change in the first instance, but if we accept the reality that change is taking place it is an absurdity that there is a need for the chairperson to be appointed by the Minister. Hopefully, that can be changed on Friday by amendment, without difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I taught in a primary school for a long time and I have the privilege of being an INTO nominee in the Seanad.  Primary education is very much part of the educational continuum and is a critical part <Col N="1708" /> of it.  If we are forming governing bodies I see no reason that there would not be a representative of the primary school interest on the governing body.  People involed in primary education would have a relevant input to educational policy in their area.  While it is an advance to have the six places for vocational education committee members, it is still not adequate.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the legislation that every year the colleges will present to the vocational education committees their accounts for the year.  While on the face of it that would appear to give democratic accountability in relation to the colleges, I would ask the Minister in his reply on Second Stage to give the House an assurance about what will happen in reality.  What will the scenario be if the college ignores the request and refuses to give adequate information to the vocational education committees? Will there be any legal provision to ensure that they do this?  I get the impression that over a period of time the colleges will progressively ignore the vocational education committees.  We know that the background to this is the friction between the principles and the vocational education committees.  If that is the case, the college principals will not be anxious to be very co-operative with the vocational education committee sector they have sidelined to give them detailed audited accounts and ask for vocational education committee approval.  It would be interesting to know how the Minister proposes to achieve that.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a general point. Most people familiar with the legislation would be aware of this but it may not be known to the public.  There is a huge interest in it and a lot of the public will be listening to this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In our area we never <Col N="1709" /> interfered with the functioning of Dundalk or Athlone Regional Technical Colleges. I am a member of my vocational education committee and have been since 1985.  We did not interfere with the functioning of Dundalk or Athlone vocational education committees in any petty way. Theee was no question, as somebody suggested today, that they would have to ask for permission to buy a bar of chalk. While that may have been the theoretical situation, in reality it never was the case. There was never such a level of interference.</P>
      <P>It is not always prudent to rush towards change for change sake.  We should acknowledge that what exists at present is not an unhappy or unworkable situation. I do not accept that they cannot do their research and expand their research facilities.  There are people more clued in to the third level sector than I, but it does not seem logical to say that people could not pursue research projects or that academic staff would need changes like this to allow them to do so. In any case, the IVEA argued that they were preparing a legal basis to allow them to do their research.  Is it Máirtín Ó Direáin who has the poem about destroying things unnecessarily?  I get the impression that there is an element of that involved here, that we might be changing for the wrong reasons.  All we can do now is amend the legislation on Friday.  I hope the Minister will agree.</P>

A number of vocational education committee schools have gone too far towards becoming academic in recent years and this point was also made in the Culliton report.  Second level vocational education committee shools have tried to <Col N="1710" /> ape the local secondary schools.  I hope the regional technical colleges will not now ape the universities, and Dundalk, Tralee or Letterkenny regional technical colleges will not try to become mini-Oxfords. That is exactly what is not needed in terms of job creation, of the sociology of the area or of participation in Europe.  It is culturally wrong also.  I hope they will not get involved in such bizarre nonsense and I would like an assurance from the Minister on that.  The Minister must also give the House a definite assurance that the colleges will not lose their democratic quality and responsiveness to local people.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte mhór a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach.  Tá sé anseo an lá uilig agus is dócha, ag an bpointe seo, go bhfuil sé bodhraithe ag éisteacht lena bhfuil le rá againn i dtaobh na mBillí seo. Ach é sin ráite, ba mhaith liom tagairt do rud nár chuala mé mórán Seanadóirí eile ag tagairt dó go dtí seo agus is é sin an stádas oifigiúil atá tugtha don Ghaeilge sa reachtaíocht seo.  Mura mbeadh ann ach é sin chaithfinn a rá gur dul chun cinn mór a bheadh ansin.  Ceann de na fadhbanna atá againn i dtaobh na Gaeilge ná nach bhfuil go minic stádas ceart institiúideach aici, agus tá sé sin tugtha di sna Billí seo.  Ach, thairis sin, caithfimid anois díriú ar cé an chaoi na gcuirfear na forálacha atá molta i bhfeidhm go praiticiúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé ráite sa reachtaíocht go gcaithfear aird a thabhairt ar chothú na Gaeilge agus chothú an chultúir dúchais sna coláistí seo.  Tá sé sa dá Bhille, an Bille um Institiúid Teicneolaíochta Bhaile Átha Cliath agus Bille na gColáistí Teicniúla Réigiúnacha.  Tá mé an-sásta go bhfuil sé sin ann, ach ba mhaith liomsa moltaí a fheiceáil ag teacht chun cinn ó na coláistí féin, cén chaoi a gcuirfear é sin i bhfeidhm go praiticiúil.  I leith na hinstitiúidí tríú leibhéal i nGaillimh cuireann sé as dom go mór &mdash; agus thar na blianta rinne Coláiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh iarracht <Col N="1711" /> mhór &mdash; nach bhfuil aon stádas oifigiúil ceart tugtha don Ghaeilge go minic i ngnáthimeachtaí laethúla na gcoláistí réigiúnacha, go háirithe i gceantair go bhfuil cuid mhaith scoláirí Ghaeltachta ag freastal ar na coláistí seo.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh dualgas ar na coláistí faoin mír seo sa Bhille, plean praiticiúil &mdash; agus tá mé ag caint ar phlean praiticiúil &mdash; a chur ar bun le féachaint chuige go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ar fáil agus in úsáid go rialta sna coláistí seo. Tugadh dea-shampla i gColáiste na hOllscoile nuair a chinn Aontas na Mac Léinn ar pholasaí iomlán dátheangach a chur i bhfeidhm.  Mar shampla, bhí an lámhleabhar a d'fhoilsigh siad i mbliana déanta acu go dátheangach.  Cosnaíonn rudaí mar sin airgead, ach, má chosnaíonn, is ceart agus is cuí go gcuirfí a leithéid ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá samplaí an-mhaith de céard is féidir a dhéanamh le polasaí teanga a chur ar fáil.  Sa Bhreatain Bheag, áit a bhfuil polasaí teanga leagtha amach i gcomhréir leis an méid Breatnaise atá in aon cheantar, téann siad as a mbealach lena chinntiú go dtugtar cothromas don dá theanga ansin, agus caithfimidne an rud céanna a dhéanamh.  Go minic, dar liomsa, bímid ag caint ar an Ghaeilge, ar mhanaí agus ar dhea-mhéin, ach ní dóigh liom go leagaimid amach go praiticiúil céard atá i gceist againn le polasaí mar seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá mé an-sásta go bhfuil na míreanna seo ann ach tá súil agam go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm i gceart iad, agus go mbeidh sé le feiceáil go suntasach sna coláistí réigiúnacha go bhfuil polasaí ceart dátheangach i bhfeidhm agus go ndéanfar freastal ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá an cheist seo ag éirí i bhfad níos tábhachtaí i gcomhthéacs líon mór na ngasúr atá anois ag fáil a gcuid oideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge ag an bunleibhéal agus anois iad siúd atá tosaithe ag fáil a gcuid oideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge ag an meánleibhéal.  B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh an lá nuair a bheidh institiúid tríú leibhéal <Col N="1712" /> amháin sa tír ag feidhmiú trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Má táimid praiticiúil agus réalaíoch faoi líon na ngasúr a bheidh ag teacht amach as an gcóras dara leibhéal de thoradh ar an méid atá cheana féin sa bhunchóras, beidh éileamh ar a leithéid amach anseo.  Ní mór dúinn breathnú amach faoi seo agus tógáil go leanúnach ar an bhunsraith atá curtha síos.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Billí iad féin agus an díospóireacht mhór leathan atá ar bun faoi ról na gcoistí gairmoideachais, ról na n-ionadaithe tofa, rinneadh pointe an-mhaith, nach bhfuil ciall dá laghad le Seanadóirí bheith dícháilithe ó bheith ina mbaill de na governing bodies.  Ní fheicim cén fáth go bhfuil a leithéid de riail ann. Sílim nach gcuireann sé as d'eagraíocht mar sin go mbeadh ionadaithe tofa orthu agus creidim go bhfuil rud éigin ait ann más féidir le duine a bheith mar bhall de choiste gairmoideachais mar Sheanadóir ach nach bhféadfadh sé bheith ar choiste stiúrtha sna coláistí seo.  Níl aon chiall leis agus bheadh súil agam sa phlé leathan a bheidh ar bun maidir le cúrsaí oideachais amach anseo de thoradh an Pháipéir Ghlais a foilsíodh go bhféachfaí go mbainfí as a leithéid d'fhoráil.  Tá go leor plé déanta faoi ionad daoine tofa sa chóras oideachais agus, b'fhéidir, ó tharla go bhfuil na Billí seo go héifeachtach níl mórán deise praiticiúla anois le leasú a chur orthu.  B'fhéidir gur rud é seo go gcaithimid anois dul siar agus breathnú air i gcomthéacs an Pháipéir Ghlais.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid breathnú ar cén áit atá ag an phobal i gcúrsaí oideachais, cén áit a mbeidh siad bainte le cúrsaí oideachais ag gach leibhéal.  Ní mór dúinn a aithint as an nua gur ionadaithe poiblí iad daoine atá tofa ar chomhairlí contae agus, go hindíreach, ar choistí gairmoideachais. Tá siad tofa ag an bpobal agus tá an prionsabal á cheapadh anois gur féidir leat a bheith tofa ar choiste bainistíochta sa scoil áitiúil mar ghnáthbhall den phobal, gur féidir leat bheith ceaptha ag ceardchumann i ngeall go bhfuil tú i do mhac léinn nó i do mhúinteoir, ach gurb é an t-aon dream go bhfuil amhras mór <Col N="1713" /> fúthu ná ionadaithe poiblí atá tofa go daonlathach de réir an chórais is oscailte dá bhfuil ann, sin córas toghcháin na tíre. Is ceist bhunúsach í seo agus is ceist í a bhaineann leis an stádas a tabharfaimid do na hionadaithe tofa poiblí atá againn.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt ansin maidir le cúrsaí curriculum.  Is cosúil go mbíonn brú ann i gcónaí dul ag plé le cúrsaí acadúla.  Tá sé intuigthe cén tslí ar tharla sé seo i gcomhthéacs na scoileanna gairmoideachais. An rud atá tarlaithe ansin agus, b'fhéidir, an rud a bhain d'fheidhm na scoileanna gairmoideachais sa ghnáthchiall gur bunaíodh iad sna bailte móra, ná nach ndearnadh cónascadh i gcásanna áirithe.  Sna scoileanna cónasctha, caithfimid a admháil, gurb é an córas acadúil is treise iontu agus níl fágtha mar scoileanna gairmoideachais astu féin i go leor contaetha ach na scoileanna beaga tuaithe.  De bharr go gcaithfidh siadsan freastal ar chuile aicme taobh istigh dá bpobal féin, is cineál scoileanna pobail iad níos mó ná ceardscoileanna nó scoileanna gairmoideachais.  I ngeall air sin tá brú síoraí seasta freastal ní amháin ar dhaoine atá ag dul ar aghaidh le ceardaíocht ach freisin ar na riachtanais acadúla i saol scoláirí as na ceantair seo.</P>
    <P>Tá brú breise ann i ngeall ar an gcóras iontrála sna coláistí tríú leibhéal.  Má tá córas na bpointí i bhfeidhm, cinnte beidh scoláirí agus tuismitheoirí ag brú go láidir go mbeidh cúrsaí acadúla in uachtar. Chuala mé ráite in áit éigin le gairid, agus dúradh i mBéarla é, that parents are the most strategic planners you ever have, agus más rud é gur le leas na ngasúr, dar le tuismitheoirí, rud a dhéanamh, más le leas gasúir, mar a fheictear do thuismitheoirí é, más i ndul chun cinn atá i gceist dul agus cúrsaí acadúla a bhrú ar scoileanna agus ar cheardcholáistí, sin a dhéanfaidh siad.  Déanfaidh tuismitheoirí an rud a cheapann siadsan atá ar a leas féin.  Caithfimid, mar sin, breathnú, ní amháin ar sheasamh siar ach ar cén brú atá ar thuismitheoirí, cén brú atá ar dhaoine sa chóras dul i dtreo cúrsaí acadúla an iomarca agus féachaint cén bealach <Col N="1714" /> is féidir linn imeacht uaidh sin trí credit breise a thabhairt do rudaí praiticiúla.</P>
    <P>Cinnte, is é ceann de na heasnaimh is mó sa tír seo ná daoine atá cáilithe sna gairmeacha.  Tá go leor gairmeacha nua ann agus glacaim leis nach bhfuil siad go díreach faoi réir an Bhille seo, ach é sin ráite, tagann siad go díreach agus go hindíreach faoi réir réimse oibre na gcoláistí seo.  Tá go leor gairmeacha ann nach bhfuil stádas oifigiúil acu sa tír seo. Tá líon, mar shampla, na ngairmeacha gur féidir printíseacht a fháil iontu anteoranta le hais mar atá sa Ghearmáin. Nuair atáimid ag caint ar ghairmeacha, táimid ag caint, mar shampla, ar an nuatheicneolaíocht, go bhfuil páirt lárnach le himirt ag na coláistí a bhfuilimid ag tabhairt stádais reachtúil dóibh anseo. Ach, chun sin a dhéanamh, caithfimid a chinntiú go bhfuil córas cáilíochta ann ceart agus go mbeidh seasamh idirnáisiúnta i dtíortha eile ag na cáilíochtaí sin. Sin rud go mba mhaith liom a fheiceáil staidéar á thabhairt dó mar sílim, má tá an seasamh ag rud,, ansin beidh tuismitheoirí sásta go ndéanfaidh a gcuid clann plé leis na hábhair seo.</P>
    <P>Mar a deirim, ba cheart dúinn plé iomlán críochnúil a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí oideachais san fhómhar.  Nuair a bheidh an Páipéar Glas á phlé, tá súil agam go ndéanfaimid plé cuimsitheach, iomlán ar ról na n-ionadaithe poiblí sa chóras oideachais trí chéile, i gcóras na n-ollscoileanna, i gcóras na gcoláistí tríú leibhéal taobh amuigh de chóras na n-ollscoileanna; i gcóras an dara leibhéal trí chéile agus, ar ndóigh, i gcóras an bhunleibhéil. Mura mbeidh plé bunúsach ar na ceisteanna seo agus mura ndéanfar ar bhealach leathan é, ní dhéanfar go cuimsitheach agus i gceart é.</P>
    <P>Ar deireadh, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do chúrsaí airgeadais agus do chúrsaí airgeadais chóras an tríú leibhéal. Is léir, mar a dúradh cheana, go dtugtar i bhfad níos mó airgid <i>per capita</i> do na hollscoileanna ná mar a thugtar do na coláistí tríú leibhéal.  Tá a fhios ag an saol é sin.  Mar dhuine, a thagann ó chúlra <Col N="1715" /> láidir ollscoile, déarfainn nach bhfuil an cothromas ceart ansin anois.  Caithfear féachaint chuige go bhfuil cothromas, ó thaobh cistíochta de, ag an gcóras tríú leibhéal, go mbeidh a sciar ceart féin den airgead ar fáil ag na hinstitiúidí seo.  Is é an bharúil atá agamsa ná, go minic, de bharr go bhfuil acmhainní ag na hollscoileanna le bheith ag déanamh cáis le haghaidh a thuilleadh acmhainní a fháil, gur ar an gcaoi sin a fhaigheann siad na hacmhainní sin.  Agus is amhlaidh an scéal go minic, is é an té is láidre a éiríonn níos láidre, agus an dream atá lag agus nach bhfuil na hacmhainní acu bheith ar thóir na n-acmhainní, go mbíonn siad siar leis go mór.  Go mórmhór, creidim go bhfuil sé sin fíor i gcás chúrsaí taighde. Caithfidh positive discrimination bheith i gceist lena chinntiú go bhfaighidh na hinstitiúidí seo a sciar ceart féin den airgead.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, ní inniú ná amárach a chríochnófar díospóireacht bhunúsach ar na Billí seo.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfaí tuilleadh seo ar chúrsaí cistíochta agus ionadaíochta poiblí sa chóras oideachais trí chéile, agus ar smacht an chórais phoiblí agus smacht rialtais áitiúil ar an gcóras oideachais trí chéile.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. Níl sé i gceist agam mórán a chaitheamh ar an ábhar atá á phlé againn.  Tá anmheas go deo agam ar an obair atá á déanamh ag na coláistí réigiúnacha agus ar a bhfuil curtha i gcríoch acu i gcaitheamh na mblianta tar éis a mbunaithe. Ar ndóigh, d'eascair sé sin as an saothar a rinneadh sna ceardscoileanna ó bunaíodh iad sna tríochaidí.  Maidir leis an mBille seo, tagaim le go leor atá ann agus is beag foráil ansin a gcuirfinn ina éadan.  Tá cuid againn ag caint faoi na boird bhainistíochta, cé chomh láidir nó cé chomh daonlathach is atá siad, faoina struchtúir, agus tá aidhmeanna an Bhille faoi chaibidil againn freisin, ach tá rud amháin curtha ar ár súile dúinn, an tsárobair go <Col N="1716" /> deo atá déanta ag na coláistí réigiúnacha timpeall na tíre.</P>
      <P>Is é an feall atá déanta, dar liomsa, ná go bhfuil an t-iarthar fágtha ar lár sa Bhille seo.  I gcás Chaisleán an Bharraigh, bhí gluaiseacht ann le dhá bhliain déag ag éileamh go gcuirfí coláiste réigiúnach ar bun ansin.  Le linn an ama sin tháinig Airí agus Airí Stáit ón Chomhrialtas agus ón Rialtas in a dhiaidh sin agus gheall siad go gcuirfí coláistí réigiúnacha ar bun, ceann acu i gCaisleán an Bharraigh.  Gach maidin Domhnaigh imíonn 3,000 scoláire leo ó Chontae Mhaigh Eo &mdash; an contae is measa maidir leis an bhfadhb seo &mdash; go Ceatharlach, chomh fada le Leitir Ceanainn, agus ó dheas go Luimneach agus Trá Lí.</P>
      <P>Bhí mé i láthair ag cruinniú an tseachtain seo caite i gCaisleán an Bharraigh agus bhí sé plódaithe le muintir an iarthair agus iad ag impí ar an Aire Oideachais agus ar an Aire Stáit go gcuirfí coláiste réigiúnach ar bun.  Ní bheadh a lán le rá agamsa in aghaidh na mionphointí atá á n-ardú, an bhfuil an bord seo i gceart, an bhfuil an comhdhéanamh sin i gceart, ach is é an rud is tábhachtaí i dtosach báire ná go mbeadh coláiste réigiúnach i gCaisleán an Bharraigh agus nach mbeadh iarthar na hÉireann bánaithe arís, gan aon deis acu&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is of great interest and curiosity to my colleagues as well as I would suggest to a wider educational circle.  There has been a new governing body in University College, Cork since 1 February, and there have been new governing bodies in the other constituent colleges. I know that Senator Fitzgerald, who is here, has some interest in that matter.  I am primarily concerned with UCC but my remarks also apply to University College, Dublin and University College, Galway.</P>
      <P>These governing bodies are made up of a wide range of representatives who are elected and nominated in different ways, some of the graduates &mdash; I had the honour to be on that panel in University College, Cork &mdash; and some by the academic body, by the professors, and so on.  Since the enactment of the Universities Act, 1908, the Government have been represented on these bodies.  In University College Cork, for example, traditionally the Government appointed the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork, the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cork and, over the past 20 years, a student who was generally the President of the Students' Union.</P>
      <P>In the present governing body which assembled for the first time in mid-February, there is no Government representation, which is quite extraordinary. As far back as last September, our college formally notified the Government that there would be a new governing body but no nominees were appointed by the Government.  That body have been meeting since February and my contention is that although we are validly constituted we are not fully constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that University College, Cork, and I am sure the other colleges as well, have made frequent representations to the Government reminding them of the need to appoint their nominees.  This is quite unprecedented, and it is particularly regrettable <Col N="1718" /> that there has been no student representation for the period since 1 February and even before that.  This is bad because students are supposed to have a voice on matters such as fee increases and so on.</P>
    <P>I simply want to know the reason for the Government's inaction in this case. Admittedly, there have been three Ministers for Education in quick succession and the Government have a lot on their plate, but surely it would take only a couple of minutes either to reappoint the two bishops and the student, or if there is some other intention &mdash; and rumour has it that the Government intend to replace the traditional nominees by business people &mdash; why do they not do so?  It seems quite extraordinary that they have not acted.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that my concern is with the student vacancy.  I do not stay awake at night worrying about whether the bishops should be reappointed &mdash; that is not the point I wish to make.  I would welcome any acceptable nominees of the Government but it is extraordinary, discourteous, and negligent on the part of the Government not to have made these appointments.  They seem to take the attitude, &ldquo;We are the Government, we give the universities 70 per cent of their grants and, therefore, we can afford to treat them with contempt and dangle them on a string&rdquo;, but that is not good enough.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern in raising this matter.  Under a provision in the Irish Universities Act, 1908, University College Cork, University College, Galway and University College, Dublin were given charters and under these charters provision was made for the appointment of governing bodies in each of these three colleges.  The triennial period of office of the governing body of University College, Cork expired on 31 January 1992 <Col N="1719" /> and the triennial period for the new governing body of University College, Cork commenced on 1 February 1992.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the composition of the University College, Cork governing body is as follows: the President; three people nominated by the Government; two members appointed by the Senate of the NUI; four graduates of the university who are members of the college elected by these graduates; six professors of the college elected by the academic council; the Lord Mayor of Cork; the Mayor of Limerick; the Mayor of Waterford; representatives of Cork County Council, Waterford County Council, Kerry County Council, Limerick County Council and the joint county councils of Tipperary and four cooptions, giving a total of 28 members. The three crown nominees which were originally provided for under the charter are now the three Government nominees. This change was made possible by means of University College Cork Statute No. 61.  The Senator will appreciate, therefore, that there is quite an extensive provision for the composition of the governing body.</P>
      <P>The outgoing Government nominees on University College, Cork governing body were: Most Reverend Michael Murphy, Bishop of Cork and Ross; Right Reverend Robert Alexander Wark, Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, and Mr. John O'Connor, former President of the Students' Union, University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>I must emphasis that the non-appointment of Government nominees to the governing body of UCC in no way hinders the smooth operation of the governing body at the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that as part of the process of consultation on the Green Paper discussions will take place with all interested parties on the appropriate composition and functions of university governing bodies.  I would refer the Senator to paragraph 8.5 of the Green <Col N="1720" /> Paper in this regard.  The question of Government nominees to the governing body of University College, Cork, as well as to other governing bodies will arise for consideration in due course as part of the ongoing consultation process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but it is not very satisfactory. The Green Paper will, in time, lead to an Education Act, but by that time surely this term of the UCC governing body will have expired.  The Minister has not answered the question as to why nominees can not be appointed pending the outcome of that clause in the Green Paper and its possible consequences.  I submit that the Minister is right in that the governing body are functioning but they are not fully or satisfactorily functioning without the Government nominees.</P>

      <P>I request the Minister for the Gaeltacht to ask Údarás na Gaeltachta to carry out a feasibility study with a view to establishing an industry in Lis-pole, County Kerry, for the cleaning and combing of wool.  As a young lad I often went with my grandmother to a place called Flemingstown in the parish of Lis-pole where I was born.  This is near Dingle where the cleaning and combing of wool was carried out.  This little industry ceased to operate some time in the late forties after World War II and I am now proposing the re-establishment of this industry in west Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 £12 million worth of wool was exported out of Ireland which was not combed &mdash; in other words £12 million worth of wool was exported in the fleece in a raw state.  With that amount of wool <Col N="1721" /> being exported there has to be a place for the industry which I am proposing. Údarás na Gaeltachta should be the promoter of this industry and sheep farmers could then invest by way of shares.  I cannot understand why over the years, millions of pounds worth of wool have gone out of Ireland in a raw state, that is in the fleece, untreated.  By cleaning, combing and carding the wool there would be an added value which would be of immense benefit to the sheep farmer, the economy and the creation of much needed jobs, particularly at this time.</P>
    <P>If such an industry was set up it could also be a major tourist attraction whereby tourists could see the sheep being shorn, the cleansing and combing of the wool and then the traditional spinning wheel making it into yarn and the eventual knitting of pure Irish handmade woollen garments which the tourists could buy on the spot.  The market for pure Irish wool garments is endless and, considering the success of other Irish products abroad such as Kerrygold butter and many others, it would indeed make you proud of your country.</P>
    <P>Certainly at this time there cannot be any shortage of wool as our sheep population has grown to huge numbers.  I am, therefore, now asking the Tánaiste and Minister for the Gaeltacht to ask Údarás na Gaeltachta to carry out such a feasibility study and consult with sheep farmers and farming organisations.  The time for talk is over; what I want is action. Irish wool products in the future could become one of our greatest industries, creating many permanent, much needed jobs.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the need for extra funding for the St. Paul's centre for cerebral palsy in Dooradoyle, Limerick.  There is need for funding of an extra £27,000 through the health board and I would ask the Minister for Health to provide that money for St. Paul's.  St. Paul's centre incorporates a sheltered workshop for 14 physically <Col N="1722" /> handicapped young adults and a child therapy unit for developmentally delayed children up to five years old.</P>
      <P>The centre opened in 1988 on a three day week basis, with six clients.  In September 1991 there were 14 clients and the centre operated on a four day week basis. Clients cannot attend other centres because of the severity of their disabilities. In September 1989 the centre purchased a minibus and converted it for wheelchairs at a cost of more than £20,000.  This money was raised from intensive local fundraising.  Clients travel daily from Limerick city and county and counties Clare and Tipperary.  Door to door transport is provided for 11 of these clients.  The cost per week per person is £95 of which £38 or approximately 35 per cent of the total cost, is paid by the MidWestern Health Board.  The people attending the centre are taught invaluable skills such as independence training adult literacy, computer literacy, cookery and self-help.  This excellent service cannot be maintained on this year's allocation of just £21,000.  Audited accounts are available to show that this grant does not even cover the salaries of the staff employed at the centre.  I request the Minister to immediately provide £27,000, the sum required to maintain services at their existing level.</P>
      <P>The centre also incorporates a child therapy unit where 16 children under five years of age receive physiotherapy and occupational therapy under the direction of a consultant paediatricion.  Intensive therapy is vital to developmentally delayed children if they are to reach their full potential, and the cost of this service is £10,000.  I ask the Minister to please give every consideration to this funding to allow St. Paul's centre to carry out their excellent work, which they do so well.</P>

      <P>I request the Minister for the Environment to instruct Cork County Council to repair the damage caused by them to a roadway at Bunmona, Milford, <Col N="1723" /> Charleville, County Cork.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment previously and the Minister for the Environment replied to it.  The roadway in question is on the Limerick-Cork border, the link road between Charleville and Drum-collogher. It is a narrow road used by Golden Vale milk lorries.  A good friend of mine who lives on this road, a native of Dingle, who is also known to Senator Tom Fitzgerald, witnessed the wall of his house being damaged by a lorry when the road subsided as the lorry pulled over to allow a car to pass.  The county council filled in the roadway temporarily and a fortnight later told the owner that if he had no objection they would complete the work.  The overseer said that if the man objected he might lose his job by doing the work, which was not true.  The county <Col N="1724" /> council then dug up the roadway again, took away the stones and left it at that stage.</P>
      <P>I understand there was political interference in this matter.  As the man in question is a Fianna Fáil supporter the local Fine Gael people asked their local representative, who is a Deputy &mdash; I will not mention him &mdash; to request that the work be undone.  It was my understanding that the council would repair the damage.  This man has gone to the expense of employing a solicitor to intervene to have the damage repaired.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to instruct Cork County Council to ensure that the roadway in front of this man's house is restored to perfect condition.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 July 1992.</P>
