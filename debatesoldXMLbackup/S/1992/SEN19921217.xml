      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to raise with both the new Irish European commissioner and the Irish Government the importance of ensuring that a significant proportion of the Structural or Cohesion Funds be directed towards Irish education, in particular towards Irish primary education.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I also want to announce that on 3 December 1992 the Taoiseach nominated Brendan Daly, Pat Farrell, Terry Leyden and Dick Roche, with their prior consent, to fill the casual vacancies in the number of nominated <Col N="1114" /> members of Seanad Éireann caused by the election to Dáil Éireann of Hugh Byrne, Martin Cullen, Helen Keogh and Eoin Ryan.  I welcome them to the House and congratulate them on being appointed.</P>
      <P>I also want to congratulate all the former Members of this House who were successful in the general election &mdash; as well as the four people I mentioned, the former Senators Joe Costello, Seán Doherty, Avril Doyle, Denis Foley, Seán Haughey, Éamon Ó Cuív, Batt O'Keeffe, John Ryan and Pat Upton and I wish them every success in their new role.</P>
      <P>I understand that a number of Senators are not seeking re-election.  Unofficially I have been informed that Senator Staunton and Senator Hederman are not seeking re-election and I wish them well.  I am informed officially that Senator Jack Harte and Senator John A. Murphy are retiring from politics and I also wish them well.  Senator Harte has been a highly respected Member of this House for 20 years.  I have always found him to be practical, a man of commonsense, a lovely man.  I recall one occasion when, on a matter of principle, four Senators decided in their wisdom that they should be put out of the House.  Senator Costello went first, followed by Senator Upton Senator Ryan and then Senator Harte. Senator Harte apologised sincerely that this was going to happen.  That indicates the type of man he is.  He is a lovely man and he will be missed from this House.</P>

      <P>I did not always agree with Senator John A. Murphy but I always liked his contributions and listened to them.  When he spoke everybody listened.  He will be missed for the colour and humour of his contributions.  He will be missed for his very strong personal views on many issues, in particular Northern Ireland, on which he had very strongly held convictions and was never afraid to express them.  Both Senator Harte and Senator Murphy will be missed from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is the last sitting of the present <Col N="1115" /> Seanad, I would like to take this opportunity to wish good luck to all Senators who are seeking re-election.  I hope you are all back with us and, of course, that applies to the species known as the Independents; I wish them well too.  I also extend Christmas greetings to all Members and their families, the reporting staff, the press and to the Clerk of the Seanad and her courteous and hard working staff.  The success of the Seanad is due largely to their great work and they have helped us enormously.  I also would like to wish the Clerk success as Seanad returning officer.  I know Members also wish her well in what will be a very happy and important event for her next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items Nos. 1 to 7 and, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the following arrangement will apply.  In relation to Item No. 1, The Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, proceedings on Fourth and Fifth Stages shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 3 p.m. Items Nos. 2 to 7 shall be in accordance with the following timetable and, where proceedings have not concluded by the stated time, shall be brought to a conclusion by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to recommendations, include only recommendations set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.  The suggested timetable is that the Appropriation Bill, 1992 will be taken from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1992, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and the Financial Transfers Bill, 1992 from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.  In relation to Item No. 2, the Appropriation Bill, 1992, the Second Stage debate thereon shall be confined to one Senator from each grouping in the House.  Finally, with the agreement of the House I propose that the matter on the Adjournment may be taken at the conclusion of business.  In <Col N="1116" /> relation to groupings I will be as flexible as the House needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business may I say that most of us did not think we would be here today, we thought our last meeting was before the election was called; we are here today in a state of what used to be called &ldquo;limbo&rdquo;. Some Members have departed for another place and we have a number of maybe &ldquo;fallen angels&rdquo; among us who, I hope, will have full status after the Seanad election.</P>
      <P>I agree with the way business is ordered for today.  I do not like doing business this way, I do not think anybody does but we realise that there is a time constraint and unusual circumstances so we agree to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Nobody in this House seeking re-election has any guarantee that he or she will be successful, maybe quite a number of us here today will not be back after the election although I hope that will not be the case.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my group I wish to pay a very short tribute to the four Senators who have indicated that they will not be seeking re-election.  Senator John A. Murphy has always displayed enormous independence and moral courage, his intellectual vigour has allowed him to make an outstanding contribution to the House.  He has been a genuinely nonconformist Senator in the range and, frequently, his unexpected views.  He has occasionally been quite cranky here and Members of all parties have been at the receiving end of some of his barbs from time to time.  However, in the very best sense he showed the very valuable contribution which university Senators make to the workings of this House.  Over the years his contributions were outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Staunton, is not seeking re-election, and we will all miss his infectious enthusiasm.  However, knowing Senator Staunton as I do I would not be surprised if he turned up here after another election.  What does one say about Senator Harte who today is the sole occupant of the Labour Benches after his party's success in the election?  He is one <Col N="1117" /> of the finest and most decent of men.  He has been a genuine friend to Members on all sides in this House.  He is one of nature's gentlemen and he made an extraordinary contribution over the years.  We will all miss him.  We will also miss Senator Hederman's contributions, especially on the environment, an area of expertise which she has made her own.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group I wish all our colleagues who are not seeking re-election every happiness in their retirement, whichever form it takes.  I join you in thanking the officers of the House, and the media for their very fair and good coverage of the proceedings of the House over the lifetime of this Seanad.  Finally, across party lines I wish all colleagues who are seeking re-election the ultimate success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to explain to the House that those words &ldquo;brought to a conclusion by one question&rdquo; is the most acceptable way of saying that a guillotine will be introduced at that point.  I have always opposed that method of doing business on the basis that it is not acceptable and I am still opposed to it.  However, I accept that legislation has to be put in place before the end of the calendar year so I do not propose calling a vote.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity &mdash; at a time when we are saying goodbye to some people &mdash; to offer my congratulations to my fellow union member, Deputy Padraig Flynn, who is being elevated to the position of European Commissioner representing this country in Europe.  I wish him well.  I hope he takes with him all the wisdom he received as a national teacher in the west.  I have also decided that I should send a directive to all my members around the west coast informing them that from now on they should carry a Commissioner's baton in their school equipment waiting to be elevated whenever the opportunity arises.  I wish him well.  I hope he will get the social affairs portfolio so that he will be able to bring his expertise to the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was taken by surprise at the late decision of Senator Murphy to retire.  I <Col N="1118" /> did my utmost to talk him out of that decision.  His contributions have given breadth to debates time and time again. I can say that with conviction because much of the time I disagreed with the points he made although that was never a reason for not listening.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of this House is that points may be addressed in many different contexts.  His contribution has been extraordinary and he will be missed.</P>
    <P>I was speaking recently at the executive council of ICTU about the contribution that Senator Jack Harte made.  He was a nominee of the ICTU for many years on the Labour panel.  I have always said that I learned nothing about people since I left Dingle at 17 years of age.  However, I except Senator Harte from that home grown philosophy.  I learned from Senator Jack Harte when I came here, I always found him a reliable person.  Of all the people with whom I dealt in my five and a half years in politics, I found his gut position on issues time and time again to have been correct.  When we debated the companies Act and the insurance Act, time and again his immediate response to new situations showed him to be different from the rest of his colleagues in taking a stand that prevailed at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I might tell a story to put that in context. During the debate recently on the Family Planning Act, Senator Harte received a letter from one of the groups in support of the liberalisation of the legislation.  He wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  He said that when he was growing up he and his friends found condoms along the canal.  He said that when he joined the Army, personnel who did not use them were likely to be fined and now condoms can be bought in the local shop.  It was the essence of putting something in context which is the kind of commonsense we need.</P>
    <P>I have only known Senator Hederman since the time she was elected to this House.  Her contributions on environmental and local government matters have been tremendous and she took a keen interest in the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  I wish her well.  I <Col N="1119" /> also extend the best of luck from these benches to Senator Staunton.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that 14 of our colleagues have gone to another House. It is in order for people to look forward to going from one House of the Oireachtas to the other and I also wish them well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the words of welcome from Members.  Fortunately I have always had great respect for the Seanad.  As a former Minister of State I have been here on numerous occasions. Having been selected and appointed here I hope to be re-elected in February and to join others in this great House, the most important House of the Oireachtas. I join Senator O'Toole in congratulating our colleague from the west Deputy Pádraig Flynn, on his elevation to being our EC Commissioner.  I wish him well in his very onerous task on behalf of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch as na rudaí deasa a dúirt tú fúm cé nár thug tú &ldquo;lovely man&rdquo; orm faoi mar a dúirt tú leis an Seanadóir Harte.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil seans agam slán a fhágáil ag an Teach inniu.  Bhí mé i gcónaí mórtásach as bheith i mo bhall den Seanad.  Bhain mé sásamh agus taitneamh as an áit.  Tá brón orm ag éirí as agus amach anseo ó am go chéile beidh aiféala orm.  Sin mar atá an saol ach is léir domsa ach go háirithe go bhfuil sé in am imeachta.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for your kind remarks.  I was waiting for you to say that I also was a lovely man, like Senator Harte, but perhaps that would be too much to expect and you must have a scrupulous concern for truth.</P>
      <P>It seems only yesterday that I made my maiden speech.  Now, alas, I have to make a swan song.  I have been here since 1977.  There are very few Senators here since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was half afraid that if I remained much longer I would be like Oisín after the Féinne &mdash; Oisín i ndiaidh na Féinne.</P>
      <P>Briefly may I thank all my workers and supporters over the years.  Though I am leaving public life, I am not abandoning totally the graduates of the NUI.  I will continue to represent them in the National University Senate and on the Governing Body of University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>On this occasion I particularly want to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and your predecesors, the Clerk of the House and her two predecessors that I remember and indeed all the staff of the House. One of the great balms, on any irritations you experience, to meet with such friendliness, help, courtesy, right across the whole staff of the House.  Indeed, I had no fault to find with the media over the years either.</P>
      <P>When I say that it was a great privilege for me to have been a Member of this House what I have in mind is the historical dimension.  We tend to forget how many of our pre-Independence forbearers looked forward to and longed for the day when there would be &mdash; as they termed it &mdash; the restoration of a native Parliament.  This is expressed in all kinds of ways even in the semi-humorous aspirations of my own fellow countryman, the legendary Gaiscióch Bold Thady Quill, you will recall the verse:</P>
      <P>There was an old prophesy came to light lately,</P>
      <P>Which stated that Thady would shortly be seen,</P>
      <P>In Parliament pleading the cause of our nation,</P>
      <P>With Parnell our Chairman in famed College Green.</P>
      <P>I like to think that I made a small contribution to pleading the cause of our nation not only in articulating my views but in the legislation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has not perhaps been reformed to the extent over the years that some of us would like, but undoubtedly there has been great progress.  I am sure Senator Honan and others will agree that <Col N="1121" /> it is now a much more flexible Chamber in its procedures than it was in 1977.  Its role in Irish politics is now acknowledged more widely.  Though there was some facile talk about getting rid of it, I think nobody now doubts that, as long as the present Constitution remains, it will be an integral part of our political system.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the comradeship I have experienced here over the years, not alone of my own immediate colleagues on the University benches but from party politicians right across the House, and right across the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning in his gracious tribute mentioned that I, from time to time, had spared nobody in my criticisms.  That may be so, but I also made it clear from time to time that the reason we Independents can be independent, and can make contributions as such, is that the party politicians are there to shoulder the main responsibility.  I have never denied that.  I have always agreed with Edmond Burke who, in very different circumstances two centuries ago, said that party politics, for good or ill, are indispensable to the parliamentary system and long may it be so.</P>
    <P>Guím gach rath ar an Seanad agus go n-éirí go geal leis san am atá le teacht.</P>

      <P>Incidentally, I decided to allow a certain amount of latitude. As we are still on the Order of Business I would like Senators to be as brief as possible.  At the same time I am giving latitude to retiring Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not need much time because what has to be said has been said.  First, speaking as the leader of the Labour group and spokesperson on all matters, I would like to say that I did not go on too many ego trips but I felt like going on one when I heard my praises sung, which I really appreciate.  It has been enjoyable working with my colleagues down the years.  I want to go on record as saying that, no matter which Seanad I served in, I always managed to get on the ballot paper.  I was always grateful but looked over my shoulder <Col N="1122" /> because the people behind me appeared to be elected more easily.</P>
      <P>I am pleased at the way things have gone for me in life and in the Seanad over the years.  It is very pleasing to leave an institution after a long time knowing you are still respected.  I am sure this will not be the last time I will hear from many people here because I will be in and out of the Houses.  As they say, the first 72 years are the hardest; it is all down hill for here.</P>

      <P>As you, a Chathaoirligh were not included in the tributes paid to Members, may I extend my best wishes and compliment you, on the very honest and fair way you have supervised the business of this House.  Every Member recognises the honesty, fairness and helpfulness you have extended to us.  I join other Members in extending good wishes to Senators Harte and Hederman.</P>
      <P>May I plead that the House ask all those involved in paramilitary activities to cease operations and allow the ordinary people in the North of Ireland and the United Kingdom to go about their Christmas activities in a peaceful manner?  In the interests of harmony and peace in the country and in its future within a European context, it is appropriate that this House send a clear message that nothing can be served by the perpetration of devastation, destruction and death during the Christmas period. I sincerely ask Members to join me in requesting those involved to cease all paramilitary activities over the Christmas period and hopefully, in the future also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with your wishes, a Chathaoirligh, I will be very brief.  If Senator Murphy has found 15 years a very short time and feels he has only made his maiden speech as though it was yesterday, you can imagine how short it feels for me who was here three and a half years only.  Although it was a very short period for me, it was stimulating and very interesting on occasions.  In spite of abusive things I might have said about certain aspects of the House, I feel very proud to have been <Col N="1123" /> a Member of the Upper House of our national Parliament.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators on all sides for their friendship and camaraderie over the years, particularly the support and help I received from the University Senators who sit on the Independent benches which, needless to say, have been a very interesting and exciting place to occupy.  I join with other Members in thanking the Cathaoirleach for the fair and unbiased way he always conducted the business of this House.  I thank the Clerk of the Seanad and staff for their unfailing help and courtesy. Last, but not least I wish to thank the media.</P>

      <P>I join with those who paid tribute to the Members who are retiring. A member of the &ldquo;77 club&rdquo; I am one of the masochists who will go before the Seanad electorate in the hope of being re-elected.  I am not too sure why all the masochists are on this side of the House. Are the sensible people on the other side of the House?  Have they decided to get out before being told they are not wanted?  I am not suggesting that any of the four retiring Members would not have been re-elected.  It has been a great pleasure for me to serve with them.  I have had a long association with Senators Staunton and Harte at home and abroad and they gave tremendous service to this country.  Senator Hederman since her election has made many excellent contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator John A. Murphy and I were elected at the same time.  I do not think the Cathaoirleach's description of him as a very nice gentleman would sit very lightly on his head.</P>

I wish the four Members a very happy time in their retirement and I wish those who are seeking re-election the very best of luck.</P>

      <P>We all join in the sentiments expressed.  I welcome the four new Members.  It is worth nothing that there has been a departure from customary practice.  It is usual that when the Taoiseach's nominees go to the other House or leave this House for whatever reason, they are replaced by Taoiseach's nominees.  Three of the new Members are friends of mine, and I will get to know the other Member across the floor of the House.  I wish them well.  It is worth noting that for the first time, the new Members are not from the parties whose Members left the House.  It is customary in many councils, if not all councils, that co-options are from the same political party.  On this occasion, for the first time, there has been a departure, in the Taoiseach not appointing Members from the same parties who were represented here.</P>

      <P>I thank you for your indulgence.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and his predecessors, for their courtesy. I thank my colleagues who complimented me on my contributions to the Seanad and wished me well in my retirement.  I would like to wish my colleagues who are retiring well.  I congratulate those who were recently nominated to the Seanad. I extend my good wishes to all of our colleagues who are seeking re-election. I hope the Progressive Democrats are beginning to see some merit in this institution, having had two of their three Members elected to the Dáil.  As a Mayo man, I would take the opportunity to congratulate Deputy Pádraig Flynn on his appointment today as European Commissioner.  I hope some benefits flow to the west of Ireland as a consequence of his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> Senator Murphy mentioned that he originally came in 1977.  I can cap that.  I was elected first to the Dáil in 1973 and then spent nine consecutive years, between the Dáil and the Seanad.  I was out of politics for about eight years and then was elected to the Seanad in unusual circumstances in the last election.</P>
    <P>In the general election in 1973 I headed the poll in west Mayo and I had a very high profile during the first change of Government in 16 years.  In 1977 there was a very big swing against the Coalition and I was one of the victims of that swing in which my party lost about 20 seats; we were pretty well decimated.</P>
    <P>That summer of 1977, I picked myself up and was elected comfortably to the Seanad, but I was not feeling too happy about it, given the circumstances.  About that time an American manufacturing company visiting Westport held a party for local dignitaries and, in typical American fashion, we all had our names on our lapels.  The American president of the country was talking to people and he did not know much about Irish politics; he did not know about how the Coalition was decimated in 1977.</P>
    <P>When he came to me he saw on my name tag, Senator Staunton, and asked if I was a member of the Irish Parliament, which I confirmed telling him I had been elected about three weeks previously.  He looked reverentially at me and said &ldquo;Senator Staunton, it must have been a great year for you&rdquo;.  That was not a good year, but he was prophetic, because I had some of the best years of my life as a Member of this institution, which I hold very dear.  I was elected to this House three times.  I have made many friends across all borders.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, at this time I have another agenda, and it is not a hidden one.  It is not the end of my career although I may not necessarily be politically involved in the future.</P>

I join with the Cathaoirleach, and others, in <Col N="1126" /> wishing our Senators who are not seeking re-election well.  Indeed, often on occasions like this in public fora we are inclined to praise people who can no longer hear us, but that is not the case today.  Brendan Behan once attended a funeral and an old lady beside him said of the wreaths presented that &ldquo;It was a pity they did not send them while he could smell them&rdquo;.  Today, the bouquets can be smelled.  Indeed, it is vey appropriate that due recognition be given to the contributions of people like Senators Jack Harte, John A. Murphy, Myles Staunton and Carmencita Hederman.  I have no doubt that they will continue to actively give of their abilities to this nation in some other forum or in some other walk of life.  They still have much to offer and I have no doubt they will continue to do so.</P>

I do not propose to object to it today as that is not my function but I do want to say it is an extraordinarily bad way of doing business.  The legislation which has created the need for this change to take place, through this Bill today, was expensive; similar legislation in the UK has been changed.  It is only right that what is being sought by means of this Bill today should be conceded.  It would be unfair to the family to do otherwise. It is the function of Government to tidy up legislation which causes this kind of problem.  This is a revisionist chamber and I would ask the Government to introduce legislation, as soon as possible, to ensure that this never becomes necessary agian.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis áthais dom teacht anseo in bhur measc arís tar éis an olltogcháin.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh na Seanadóirí go léir atá anseo tofa don Teach uasal seo agus go mbeidh seans acu arís seirbhís iontach a thabhairt do mhuintir na hÉireann san bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>When my Government colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, opened the debate on the Supplementary Estimates in the Dáil on Tuesday, he took the opportunity to welcome both the old and new Members of that House.  May I now take this opportunity, a Chathaoirligh, to bid farewell to you and the other outgoing members of this Seanad.  Perhaps I should just say <i>au revoir</i> and I sincerely hope that we shall all meet again under similar circumstances in the New Year.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the annual Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the Departmental Estimates for the supply services, both non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates, which were approved by the Dáil, since the last Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>The 1992 Bill appropriates to the various services set out in the schedule the sum of £7,925,202, 753.  This comprises the original Estimates of £7,630,174,000 set out in the 1992 revised post-budget Book of Estimates, and Supplementary Estimates totalling £294,933,000.  Following the normal practice, the Bill also approves the use of certain Departmental receipts, amounting to £964,177,401 as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This year's Bill also covers two Excess Votes relating to 1990.  The minor excess on the President's Establishment arose from an under-estimation of expenditure on salaries and wages in December 1990. The excess involved is £1,488, a very modest excess indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> The excess of £94,265 on the Superannuation and Retired Allowances Vote arose as a result of the late submission of claims by a number of Departments in December 1990 for recoupment of payments made earlier in the year in respect of lump sums, death gratuities and marriage gratuities.</P>
    <P>In accordance with established financial practice, the Public Accounts Committee have examined these excess Votes and had no objections to them. The Dáil approved them on Tuesday last.</P>
    <P>Apart from authorising the Estimates and any Excess Votes, the Appropriation Bill, also has another essential purpose, in that it provides a statutory basis for the calculation of the issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the Central Fund [Permanent Provisions] Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of the following year's services before the Dáil has an opportunity to approve the Estimates for that year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if the Appropriation Bill is not passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year, the provisions of the 1965 Act would not come into effect.  As the financial year is about to end, this debate provides me with a useful opportunity for a brief review of the budgetary and economic outturn for 1992 and of the prospects for 1993.</P>
    <P>The year 1992 was an eventful one in many respects, but not particularly so in budgetary terms.  The first quarter was on target, but some drift on the expenditure side emerged by mid-year, due in particular to the knock-on effects of the adverse international economic climate on the level of domestic unemployment. A significant overrun was also emerging on the Health Vote.</P>
    <P>These, and other, additional spending demands led the Government to introduce a mid-year corrective package.  That timely intervention by the Government, assisted by strong buoyancy on the corporation tax front and by savings on Central Fund services brought the budget back on target by end-September.</P>
    <P>While some further pressure on expenditure <Col N="1130" /> emerged in the final quarter, the overall budgetary situation remained good.  It was clear, however, that the opening budgetary position for 1993 would present a formidable challenge to the incoming Government.  Accordingly, with a view to easing these pressures somewhat, the Government decided to bring forward to this year the payment of some £71 million of arrears of special increases due to Public Servants, on 1 January 1993.  We also brought forward the payment of some £20 million of expenditure on the Agriculture Vote.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures, there will be some slippage on the 1992 Exchequer borrowing requirement target of £290 million, or 2.4 per cent of GNP, but it should nevertheless remain comfortably within the 3 per cent general Government deficit/GDP ratio which, as the House will be aware, is one of the main convergence criteria in the draft European Monetary Union Treaty.  The steady downward thrust of recent years in the debt/GDP ratio will also br maintained.</P>
    <P>Despite our pre-emptive action, there is no doubt that the 1993 budget will present a formidable challenge to the incoming Government.  Increased pressure on public spending in the social area will continue in 1993.  This pressure will be all the harder to cope with because of the erosion of part of the tax revenue base due to the advent of the Single Market.  For instance, VAT at point of entry will be eliminated and the Deposit Interest Retention Tax must be modified. While the VAT loss should be partially offset by alternative measures within the VAT area, the DIRT adjustment will produce significant losses.</P>
    <P>It is essential that whatever Government comes into office, it must continue to pursue the appropriate budgetary management strategies that we have consistently pursued since 1987.  This country must continue to meet the convergence criteria, set out in the draft European Monetary Union Treaty, the most important of which so far as the budget is concernerd is the ratio of the general <Col N="1131" /> Government deficit to GDP, which is set at 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The problems, which the Government experienced this year in relation to its own finances, are a reflection of the wider difficulties faced by the economy.  But we must not lose sight of the fact that there are many encouraging aspects of Ireland's economic performance. Despite the continued international economic downturn, we expect real GDP growth of about 2.75 per cent for this year.  While this level of growth is not much stronger than the previous three years, it is an excellent performance given the depth of the recession in some of or trading partners.</P>
    <P>On the international scene, the outlook for the coming year is for only a modest and gradual pick-up in growth. According to the OECD &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; published last night, the pace of expansion of OECD output may edge up in 1993 to around 2 per cent, but is unlikely to reach 3 per cent until 1994.  However, prospects for the United Kingdom, which is still of course a significant export market for Ireland, are somewhat better, with growth projected at 1¼ per cent for 1993, compared with declines of 2 per cent in 1991 and 1 per cent in 1992.</P>
    <P>Information about domestic economic developments for the first three quarters of 1992, is now becoming available and supports the general picture of quite robust growth, which compares well with the performance of our trading partners. Despite higher interest rates, inflation at the end of the year, has turned out at 2.25 per cent and averaged 3 per cent for the year as a whole.  Excluding interest rates, the price level has actually fallen in this quarter, thus reflecting one of the positive benefits from sterling's devaluation.</P>
    <P>Retail sales up to September have increased by 3 per cent and even allowing for some slow down in the final quarter they seem likely to average 2.75 per cent for the year as a whole.  In spite of predictions earlier in the year, new car sales were down by only 1.25 per cent as of end-September and are expected to show <Col N="1132" /> a decline of about the same order for the full year.</P>
    <P>It is particularly encouraging that Ireland's industrial exports have continued to out-perform international markets, with growth in this sector expected to be about 6.5 per cent in 1992.  Growth in agricultural exports has been very buoyant as a result of the resumed live export trade and also due to the considerable sales from intervention stores. Up to September, agricultural exports grew by 30 per cent over the same period last year and growth of the Order of 25 per cent is likely for the year as a whole. Manufacturing output has also performed well and is expected to grow by about 8 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>Labour force surveys an other indicators show that non-agricultural employment has held up well, despite the very difficult international environment. Labour force survey data show a rise of 4,000 in the year to last April and there was an increase of 700 in manufacturing employment in the second quarter of the year.  Unfortunately, while growth in total employment of about 2,000 could be achieved, this has not been enough to prevent a further rise in unemployment, giving an average live register of 284,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a significant improvement in employment is now the top priority for all parties.  The key to this lies in better and stronger investment in a general environment which keeps cost increases to a minimum.  The days of easy competitiveness gains in the UK are over. We must make certain that the positive effects of the recent currency changes, particularly significantly lower inflation, are of lasting economic benefit.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the problems which higher interest rates are causing to many in the business sector, but this is the short term effect which we must endure for keeping the Irish pound strong.  The real, longer-term challenge is to come to terms with the new and very difficult external environment which has been a fact of life since last September.  We must be clear that devaluation is not the answer.  It would be likely to lead to even higher <Col N="1133" /> interest rates for an even longer period, would increase debt service costs, would add to the overall level of national debt and consequently, would disimprove the debt-GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>Even at a time of international recession, better competitiveness allowed us to take an increased share of stagnant overseas markets.  A good economic performance, underpinned by clear monetary and fiscal policies, has helped us during this difficult period.  As conditions improve, these policies will also be the platform on which to build future growth.  The Government is determined that its attention will not be distracted from the main issue of creating the right environment for growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, I should like to welcome to this House Senators Daly, Leyden, Roche and Farrell.  I congratulate them on their appointment to the Upper House of Parliament and wish them, together with their colleagues, every success.  I wish all the candidates in the forthcoming Seanad election every success.  Míle buíochas daoibh agus rath Dé ar na Seanadóirí go léir.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Appropriation Bill.  I have a very good relationship with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy, a fellow West of Ireland man, and I am very pleased to see him in the House.  Having said that, it is regrettable that the Minister for Finance is not present in the House because the Appropriation Bill and the Finance (No. 2) Bill are major parts of the fabric of financial management of the State.  The Cabinet Minister with responsibility for Finance should be present in the House to deal with these Bills.  I appreciate he may be involved in negotiations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is taken.  The Appropriation Bill is fairly mundane.  It <Col N="1134" /> will give legislative effect to the 1992 spending programme and will allow the Exchequer to continue to spend money next year, which I gather is up to 80 per cent of the amount agreed for 1992.  In essence, the Bill will allow the Government and the Minister to continue to operate up to the passing of the next budget.  When the debate on this Bill is concluded, we will move on to debate the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  I expect that many of the issues which will be discussed here today will be relevant to both Bills.  I will make some of my more substantive points during the debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to next year's budget, which it seems will be very difficult.  I believe that members of other political parties here who have been given access to figures by the Government and Minister for Finance would concur that that may be an understatement and that next year's budget will be extremely difficult.  It was comforting to hear the Minister's quotation from a recent OECD report which, despite the fact that the economy of our major customer, the UK, which takes 40 per cent of our exports has been in severe decline, it projects a growth in exports to the UK of 1.25 per cent for 1993 as against a decline of 2 per cent in 1991 and 1 per cent in 1992.  This is an encouraging statistic.</P>
      <P>Central to all these issues if we are looking at problems nationally as well as opportunities is our appalling unemployment level which is approximately 300,000.  There is no indication in the Minister's speech that the Government has a drastic plan to correct this problem. In his speech the Minister said that labour force surveys and other indicators show that non-agricultural employment has held up well despite the very difficult international environment.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour force survey data show a rise of 4,000 in the year to last April and there was an increase of 700 in manufacturing employment in the second quarter.  Unfortunately, while growth in total employment of about 2,000 could be achieved, this has not been <Col N="1135" /> good enough to prevent a further rise in unemployment, giving an average live register of 284,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>I have to question whether we are codding ourselves here.  The Minister stated that during the second quarter of the year there was an increase of 700 people in manufacturing employment, not 7,000 or 70,000 but 700.  We are taking credit for this.  When this increase of 700 in manufacturing employment is put in the context of an imployment level of approximately 300,000 we can see the enormity of the problem facing us.  We may have a good export level, a good balance of payments in proportion to GNP and a good debt level but the issue which is critical to people like me who live in west Mayo is unemployment.  For many of the people in my area the capital of their country is London, not Dublin; they regard Dublin as irrelevant when they are looking for employment.  They have to go overseas to get employment.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a question of people emigrating because they have to. Because of the way our tax regimes are structured today, many of our educated, mobile population who would have job opportunities in this country regard it as more beneficial to work in London or New York than in this country.  We are losing many of these people as a result of inadequate tax policies.  We will be dealing further with these issues in the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Many people take the view that DIRT is a huge incentive for money to flow into banks and insurance companies, that much of that money may well end up in investment in property but not manufacturing industry and that policies are not directed towards achieving a significant reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatFarrell" hpid="Mr. P. Farrell Mr. P. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great honour for me to be a Member of this House.  The Seanad has not been without its critics over the years.  I have long recognised its unique and important role as an essential component of our legislative and democratic institutions.  As a student of public <Col N="1136" /> administration in the early 1980s, I was an avid reader of the structures of the Dáil and Seanad.  It is nice to be able to replace theory with practice.</P>
      <P>This is my maiden speech and I wish to pay tribute to the work of Members of this House.  The general public have grown tired of the increasingly adversarial nature of political debate.  We are told by some commentators that we are in the age of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; society and if that is true we need to move quickly away from that condition and build a vision and an agenda for society which is inclusive, consensual and that charts a clear direction. I urge this House to make continued good use of its opportunities for a more reflective and considered approach to the issues of the day.  We must get away from the negative and sterile politics that have dominated the political agenda in recent times.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton mentioned unemployment. The remarkable achievement of the Fianna Fáil Government since 1987 in relation to that issue must be seen in the context of a very difficult international climate.  From 1971 to 1991 our population grew by 500,000, from three million to 3.5 million.  That, together with a net inflow of immigrants, has exacerbated the problem of creating jobs quickly enough.  This Government has actually created net new jobs.  The Taoiseach launched the initiative of the county enterprise boards as a determined attempt to tackle unemployment problems in local areas.  I am very conscious of those problems at local level, but I am also conscious that the Government has taken very practical steps through the enterprise boards and a host of other measures to remedy those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have confidence in the remarkable achievement of the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil-led Government in securing the considerable package of some £8 billion over a seven-year period, in the face of considerable cynicism as to whether that package would eventually emerge. It is now on the table and it will be a major benefit in the development of infrastructure and employment-creating opportunities.  I have no doubt it will <Col N="1137" /> make a considerable impact in reducing unemployment by creating worthwhile jobs.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his contribution on the Appropriation Bill.  I can readily understand the absence of the Minister for Finance in current circumstances.  In general terms the Appropriation Bill tells a story of outstanding success by the Minister, the Minister of State and the Fianna Fáil-led Government in protecting the underprivileged and improving health and social services while remaining within the overall budgetary and borrowing guidelines. The challenges posed in so doing were enormous.  The increased funding necessary for social welfare and health, the commitment to social partnership and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> had to be met and balanced against the need for continued discipline in public finances.  It is obvious that this has been achieved within general budgetary limits and that the borrowing requirement has been kept to the level set for this year.  This has been achieved not only by dogged determination and commitment to the task but also with flair and innovation.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Fianna Fáil-led Government to set up the National Treasury Management Agency was an innovative and mould-breaking step which has reaped its reward in more efficient and effective management of the national debt.  Even greater rewards await this kind of fresh and innovative thinking. The Taoiseach and his Ministers by action and deed are committed to solutions rather than problems, to action rather than words.  That has been the hallmark of this Administration.</P>
    <P>In this context the outstanding deal secured by the Taoiseach in Edinburgh is a reflection of the &ldquo;can do&rdquo; and pragmatic approach to tackling our infrastructure and unemployment problems.  We have heard criticism which has attempted to induce cynicism about this remarkable achievement.  That approach is regrettable. We should all have the good sense and the grace to join together in working towards a constructive approach to <Col N="1138" /> ensuring that these benefits are applied over the seven-year period, building a confident and forward-looking Ireland, her place assured among the nations of Europe and the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a very good maiden speech by our new Member, Senator Farrell.  On behalf of all Members present I congratulate him on a wonderful speech on his first day in the House.  I also welcome the other well known parliamentarians from the other House, the former Minister, Senator Daly, and Senator Leyden, a neighbour from Roscommon, who as a Minister contributed enormously to the business of the nation.  I also welcome our new Member from Wicklow, Senator Roche. I look forward to working with these new Members and I wish them well in their campaigns.</P>
      <P>We have an obligation to pass the legislation before us as quickly as possible. During the past few years Members on this side of the House acted in a very responsible way.  The economy is back on the rails and our growth rate is close to 3 per cent in one of the worst years for business throughout the world.  In the UK there is a minus growth rate.  The Government is to be congratulated on its magnificent achievement in sustaining growth here while our English-speaking partners in Europe have experienced a decline in their economy.  Our achievement has been due to careful planning by the minority Fianna Fáil Government from 1987 to 1989.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Farrell in congratulating the Taoiseach on his achievements at the Edinburgh Summit.  I congratulate the Irish officials on the magnificent way they handled the negotiations.  Their achievement has been a breath of fresh air to the business community and the unemployed. We look forward to a great future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job creation is being tackled by the Government.  The county enterprise boards initiative has started.  The Minister's county was the first to appoint the members of its board.  Senator Staunton made a very worthwhile contribution.  As <Col N="1139" /> an employer he can speak from vast experience.  The enterprise boards will work from the bottom up, putting real power into rural Ireland and into counties like Westmeath and Mayo, where for far too long we have been looking for this opportunity.  We have some very creative people in rural Ireland.  People from abroad are welcome but it has often been said that if the Irish were given the same consideration we could achieve much more.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Staunton is thrilled that another Mayoman, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, is to be our Commissioner. He is a man of tremendous energy and he has kept Ireland's interests to the fore in all his dealings.  I have admired him for many years and for Mayo this must be one of its best and most pleasing days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">

      <P>I did.  It is a great day for Mayo and the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to industry we noticed the difficult situation that exists in relation to sterling and the strength of our Irish pound which is creating many problems for industry.  My experience over the last number of months as a small exporter has shown me that there is a role here for the banks which they are not taking up. The banks are classifying small industry, particularly in the west and midlands, as speculators.  They are not; they are doing their utmost to hold the jobs they have and to keep the staff they have.  I do not think it is very fair for the banks to tell people they are speculating because they want to leave their income in the sterling economy while keeping the option to bank with the Irish banks.  The difference in the price of exported goods at present compared to that, say six months ago can be up to 15 per cent.  The Minister for Finance will have to take a serious look at this, particularly in relation to small industry.  At present the banks are putting enormous pressure on small <Col N="1140" /> industry particularly in the midlands and in the west.  They seem to be under the impression that these small industries are speculating while, as I said, they are trying to keep the door open for their employees and for themselves as manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>I would like the incoming Government to have a serious look at job creation in the building industry.  How many times have we heard it said that when the building industry is up and running the rest of the economy runs smoothly as well?  I know there is a recession bordering on a depression in other countries, but I am looking forward to the new Government's job creation initiative.  It is on the building industry side in particular that I think we can create a lot of employment very quickly.  Jobs can be created in the building industry in a matter of six to eight months.  As I said before, this is where Fianna Fáil in particular have always been very good in the past and I know they will rise to the occasion in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had great respect for this Chamber and having experienced something of the rigours of getting into this Chamber over the last few weeks I have an increasing and growing respect for Members who make it here every election.  This is my first contribution in this Chamber and I hope it will not be my last.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State has said, there are many positive aspects to Ireland's economic performance over the last four years.  In spite of major external pressures which have buffeted the economy the figures are good.  As one economic commentator said recently the &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; are in order, exports are booming, borrowing has been contained and an element of tax reform is in hand. There has been some unexpected buoyancy particularly in areas of agricultural exports, just to mention one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been, as the Minister said, a very slight increase in the numbers in employment, although a comment has been made, and it is a valid comment, that the increase has been very small <Col N="1141" /> indeed.  The major challenge facing us as an economy, as a nation, must be the issue of jobs.  The new Dáil and the new Seanad must, when the job of Government construction is completed, turn the diverse talents of the people who will be returned to both Houses to the issue of jobs.</P>
    <P>In this regard we must take note of the excellent result achieved by the Taoiseach and the Government in winning major fund allocations to this country.  It is fair too that we should point out to the cynics that the sneering commentary which has attended this particular issue over the last six months or so is now proven for what it has been, untruthful rhetoric which, frankly, says more about commentators than about those who struggled to win the rewards for this country.  I hope that these funds that have just been announced will be funnelled towards combating the major horror we face in society.  If we as a society wish to portray ourselves as either Christian or caring the problem of jobs must be the priority for all public representatives in all fora.  I wish and I hope that the funds we have won for this country will be focused exclusively on job creation.  The best manner in which this can be achieved would be by way of direct State investment in job creation projects.  We try in a variety of ways to create jobs indirectly by getting the economic fundamentals right, by prompting enterprise; but as we have seen all too often the jobs do not come on stream.  I would argue that this is such an important issue that there should be the broadest political consensus. Support for a national programme for job creation must be on a cross party basis.  All the social partners and all those who represent the people must support such a programme.</P>
    <P>The second point I would feel can be made in this short contribution is that we must look at job creation programmes and how they are to be implemented. The trend in this State has been to operate from the top down.  There has been a remarkable centralist approach adopted from the foundation of the State.  That centralist approach was seen to appeal to <Col N="1142" /> some imperative which is deeply implanted in the Irish administrative psyche.  I feel it is time to break away from these shackles.  It is time for fresh thinking.  Clearly the traditional top down approach has not worked and we must look for some alternatives.  We must free ourselves from the shackles of centralism and approach the problems that face this nation, and particularly the job creation problem, in an innovative way. We must seek to create jobs by initiating programmes which work from the bottom up.</P>
    <P>The enterprises boards which have been announced in recent times and which are being established at the moment are a very important start in this regard.  This initiative has relatively modest funding which I would like to see expanded.  In my view it is better to create a thousand jobs on a decentralised basis than to win a promise from a multinational of twice that number of jobs that will simply fade away when it comes to delivery.  It is appropriate to compliment the Minister for Finance on steering the nation's finances through a very difficult year.  On many occasions in the last nine months since the Finance Bill was handled by a Special Committee in this Chamber, cynics, critics and commentators suggested that we would not be able to hold the financial ship of State on course. The Bill before us, the figures which have been produced in recent times, show that in spite of all the odds, in spite of the extraordinary pressures, this Government, the Minister for Finance and his fellow Ministers have done a remarkable job and they should be complimented on that.</P>
    <P>Before resuming my seat, I would like to compliment the outgoing Senators, and particularly the Senators who have indicated that they will not be contesting the Seanad elections in the early part of the New Year.  As one of those who will be contesting those elections I would like to compliment and wish well all those who put their names forward.  It seems to be a very gruelling system of election, and I wish them safely on the road and a happy return to this House.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Senators.  I wish you and every other candidate contesting this election well. I would like to welcome the four new Members of this House, Senator Roche, Senator Leyden, Senator Farrell and Senator Daly who, no more than myself, may not wish to be here.  However, you are all very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his words of welcome to the Upper House of the Oireachtas, for his contribution as a Minister of State at the Department of Finance and his work for the west.  I thank him in particular for his work in establishing the county enterprise boards which I regard as part of Deputy Treacy's achievements as a Minister.  This initiative will have far-reaching consequences in relation to job creation because small industries in particular have felt that, for far too long, they have been out in the cold in terms of support and assistance. Coupled with this we have the great achievement of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs at Edinburgh where they negotiated a major package for this country. In relation to the county enterprise boards, the funds will be well spent and distributed with priority being given to job creation projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the outgoing Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, whose presence proved of enormous benefit to Ireland since his appointment as Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.  I have no doubt the appointment of the Minister for Justice and Industry and Commerce, Deputy Flynn, who is from County Mayo, will prove to be of enormous benefit.  It will be his job to ensure that funds come onstream from April 1993 and to act as a voice for Ireland and, in particular, for the most neglected part of the country, the west.  If I was to make a wish it would be that he be appointed Commissioner for either agriculture and rural development, regional development or social affairs.  He will prove to be a very able <Col N="1144" /> advocate as a Commissioner for all of Europe and will never forget his roots in Ireland, in particular the west.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate my new colleagues, Senator Pat Farrell who is general secretary of Fianna Fáil and comes from County Leitrim, the former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Senator Brendan Daly and Senator Dick Roche on their appointment to the Seanad.  I also wish to thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, for your words of welcome.  We hope that our appointment by the Taoiseach for a period up to the end of January 1993 will provide us with an opportunity to be elected to this great establishment.</P>
    <P>The Upper House of the Oireachtas is an institution which I have always respected.  Like the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, I have dealt with legislation on many occasions in this House such as the Patents Bill and the legislation dealing with defective products which was introduced this year.  I have always had respect for the wisdom of all Senators who teased out and made a major contribution to legislation.  In many cases they introduced amendments which were then sent to the Dáil.  The House serves a useful purpose and has enormous potential for development in the future. Like my colleagues who will be contesting the election, I hope to be a Member of this House having regard to the changes that will be made following the election of a new Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to exports, the Minister of State has outlined our achievements in this area.  I was Minister of State with special responsibility for trade and marketing up to February 1992.  In the year ending 1991 our exports reached the record figure of £15 billion and that figure should exceed £16 billion in 1992.  This would be a major achievement for An Bord Tráchtála, the Minister of State with special responsibility for trade and marketing, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and all concerned, in particular the exporters.</P>
    <P>In 1991, exports exceeded imports by approximately £2 billion.  We could certainly reduce our imports by concentrating <Col N="1145" /> on an extensive &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  At least an extra 25,000 jobs could be created in the economy if all of us were more conscious of the need to buy quality Irish products and looked to our own.  In this regard I welcome the initiative taken by the unions and the ESB.  Under EC legislation and rules Government Departments are not allowed to get involved in or finance a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign given there will be a single European market from 1 January 1993.  We should all play our part in this campaign because in buying our own products jobs can be created and people taken off the dole.</P>
    <P>In relation to the value of the punt, I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on their achievements to date.  I also compliment the Leaders of the major political parties for their support. To date we have been successful in defending the punt and I hope this will continue to be the case.  We have not been forced to devalue the punt, a move which would have led to the national debt being increased by approximately £1 billion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the fund for exporters and believe it should be increased further.  It would be more appropriate to defend and support our exporters, particularly those who export to the British market, than to devalue the punt.  In particular I am concerned about the plight of mushroom producers who have been badly affected by the strength of the punt, <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling.  They are in need of assistance and I urge An Bord Tráchtála, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture and Food to support them.</P>
    <P>We have enormous potential for increasing our exports to the rest of Europe.  For all of us 1 January 1993 is an historic date because for the first time we will have access to an open market of 350 million people in Europe.  This will be one of the largest trading blocs in the world and we are fully involved in completing the final details in relation to the Single Market.  During our Presidency of the European Community we played a major role in accelerating the <Col N="1146" /> development of this market and our support for the Maastricht Treaty is an indication that we have adopted a pro-European approach.  With a population of 3.5 million people it is vital that we seek outlets for exporters in the greater European market.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for delivering an excellent speech.  Senators Farrell, Roche, Cassidy and Staunton also made excellent contributions. I wish Senator Staunton every success in the future.  I have great admiration for him and he has been very dedicated to the west.  I also wish Senators Harte and Murphy every success in the future.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to take this opportunity to wish you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and all Senators every success in the Seanad campaign and hope that many of us will be re-elected.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank those Senators who have taken part in the debate on this important Bill. It is important that we have an opportunity to reflect on the performance of the Government during the past year in the execution of its duties, in managing the financial affairs of the country, in creating the right environment for investment and in ensuring that it achieves its targets.  It is to our credit that since 1987 we have been able to rehabilitate the economy.  We have set strict targets for ourselves and have maintained them.  We have also been performing in a tough international environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problems were compounded during the past year by the serious international currency crisis which bedevilled the international world.  It is to the credit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Government and in particular, the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance that we have been able to respond to these international crises.  In particular we have been able to use our reserves to protect the Irish pound.  Many people clamoured <Col N="1147" /> for devaluation.  People now acknowledge that it is vitally important if Ireland is to maintain its competitive edge in the international world, if we are to be prepared for European Monetary Union and if we are to hold a strong position in our negotiations towards European Monetary Union and achieve what is vital for success both financially and economically as part of the greater united Europe taking into account the fact that the Single Market begins at the start of the New Year, that the Irish pound is maintained at its present strength.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the Government that the people have responded to our leadership and ensured that there is co-operation so that collectively we can maintain the Irish currency and fulfil our desires and aspirations of expanding the economy and creating equality of opportunity for all our people, particularly the 300,000 people who are unemployed. Once again, I thank all the Members of the House for their contributions and wish both new Senators and existing Senators every success in the forthcoming campaign.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I introduced the No. 1 Finance Bill earlier this year, I announced that a second Bill would be required before year-end to complete the legislative provisions needed to be in place by 1 January next.  At the time the election was called <Col N="1148" /> the Government had been on the point of introducing a Bill containing both measures which it was essential to have enacted by year-end, and related provisions. These legislative proposals were published on 13 November.  If Oireachtas time had permitted, these legislative proposals would have been brought forward before Christmas.  However, because of the very limited Oireachtas time now available, it has been decided to make only those legislative provisions which it is essential should be in force by 1 January 1993, and where retrospective legislation would be unsuitable.  These essential measures are contained in the Bill now before the Seanad and in the ministerial regulations which I have made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals for legislation to be included in a Second Finance Bill contained a number of chapters which provided for the transposition of EC Directives dealing with the structures to apply to excise duties on alcholic drinks, cigarettes and other tobacco products and hydrocarbon oils.  <i>Inter alia,</i> these directives define the scope of coverage of these goods for duty purposes and set out those that must be relieved of duty.  They also deal with further aspects of the regime governing the control and movement of excise duties in the Internal Market, including rules for controlling the sales of duty free goods to intra-Community travellers; such sales will be permitted to continue until mid-1999. The main framework of this regime is already in place in the Finance Act, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Failure to transpose these measures into national law could mean that from 1 January 1993 we would be in breach of Community obligations and could give rise to operational difficulties for the Revenue Commissioners.  Although the normal practice has been to effect the transposition of important EC measures by way of primary legislation, the time constraints now operating indicated that on this occasion the regulatory framework provided under the European Communities Act, 1972, should be used in order to fulfil our Community obligations. <Col N="1149" /> In the light of the exceptional circumstances outlined, and the essentially technical nature of these indirect tax provisions &mdash; which, in the main, will have little practical significance on the ground &mdash; I decided to avail of this option rather than include these items in the Bill. I would point out that this mechanism for transposing EC Directives into national law is fully in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution.  The regulations have been circulated to Senators and are also available in the Library.</P>
    <P>For the reason outlined, the bulk of the Bill before us today is devoted to the completion of the arrangements for taxation of motor vehicles initiated in the Act.  A small number of minor but essential items drawn from the proposals put forward in November make up the balance of the Bill.  I would like to acknowledge at the outset the co-operation of Members of both Chambers in facilitating the smooth introduction of this vital financial legislation.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill I would briefly like to review the past year and look at the prospects for 1993.  In the budget presented last January, the Exchequer borrowing requirement was projected at £590 million, or 2.4 per cent of GNP.  As we are all only too well aware, there has been strong upward pressure on non-capital supply spending this year, particularly on social spending.  Despite the corrective action taken by the Government in July following a mid-year review of the likely outturn, it is quite clear that supply spending will be well ahead of target.  At the same time, tax revenue should produce a surplus this year, due mainly to a strong corporation tax performance. There are also likely to be savings on central fund services.  Taken together, these factors will mitigate the effect on the budget of the supply spending overrun.  The eventual 1992 outturn should, overall, represent a creditable budgetary performance in what has been a very difficult year.</P>
    <P>In particular, we can take a good deal of satisfaction in the fact that Irish fiscal performance in 1992 should again fall <Col N="1150" /> within the 3 per cent General Government Deficit/GNP ratio specified as one of the primary budgetary convergence criteria and in the draft European Monetary Union Treaty.  Steady downward pressure is thus being maintained on the debt/GDP ratio, the other criterion of convergence.  This has fallen from almost 117 per cent in 1987 to 94 per cent last year and will again decline in 1992.  We should not underrate these achievements which compared very favourably with the likely budgetary performance in other EC member states.</P>
    <P>The 1993 outlook presents a difficult challenge.  In the absence of a dramatic improvement in the international economy, the budget arithmetic will have to accommodate a further increase in unemployment. Moreover it will have to be framed against the background of limited tax revenue buoyancy &mdash; in part a reflection of the otherwise welcome low inflation prospect.  In addition, there is a number of particular factors which have negative repercussions on the revenue outlook for 1993.</P>
    <P>The inauguration of the Single European Market will involve the elimination of VAT at point of entry in relation to intra-EC trade.  This will have an unavoidable adverse impact on cashflow in the VAT area.  Proposals for alternative measures to improve VAT cash flow were published in November, but it is not essential to make legislative provision now in that regard since this matter can be addressed in the budget.  Even with measures on these lines and taking account of the provision of the Finance Act designed to strengthen the VAT system in preparation for the new challenges it faces, it will be difficult to maintain receipts in this area at the level that would have arisen under the former arrangements.  As the House will be aware, capital liberalisation has required the modification of the deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) and significant losses, both definitive and of a cash flow nature, will accrue from these necessary adjustments.</P>
    <P>The key consideration in formulating an EBR target for 1993 will, of course, <Col N="1151" /> be to ensure that Ireland continues to act in a way compatible with the budgetary convergence criteria envisaged in the draft European Monetary Union Treaty. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that even if we did not have to take into account the EC parameters, preservation of the domestic and international confidence in economic management, which is crucial to sustainable growth in employment, would point to a similar requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes a few minor, but necessary, technical amendments to the DIRT legislation.  These changes are essential to ensure the new DIRT provisions introduced in the Finance Act operate as originally planned.  The section ensures that companies opening foreign currency accounts which are DIRT free can only do so on the same basis as for DIRT free Irish currency accounts.  In particular, this means that the company will have to supply its tax reference number in its declaration to the bank when it is opening the accounts. Allowing companies hold DIRT free accounts involves a once-off cash flow loss and not an ongoing cost to the Exchequer.  Companies will, of course, continue to pay corporation tax at 40 per cent on their interest income.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also contains two provisions designed to ensure the operation of the new 10 per cent accounts is not more liberal than originally envisaged.  The section prohibits the linking of the special savings account with any other account. This is to avoid a situation where a customer of a bank or building society might open both a special savings account and another account, and arrange to have all or most of the interest paid on the special savings account to avail of the low tax rate on that interest.  For example, a deposit taking institution could offer 20 per cent interest on a £50,000 special savings account provided that another £50,000 was left in an account which paid no interest.  This section will prohibit such practices.  The section also prohibits the holding of special savings accounts in foreign currencies.  These measures are to <Col N="1152" /> fulfil the aim of the special savings accounts, namely, to keep money in the country while securing for the Exchequer the best tax yield commensurate with the key requirement.</P>
    <P>We have come a very long way since 1987 when the International Financial Services Centre was no more than an idea.  Now some 220 projects have been approved to operate from there.  These projects have committed themselves to the creation of over 3,000 new jobs and have also contributed substantial employment in the accounting, legal and general services sectors in the Dublin area.  Already some 1,200 of the 3,000 new jobs committed have been filled and the Exchequer is receiving the additional bonus of sizeable payments of corporation tax on foot of the profits earned from the international financial activities of IFSC companies.  In 1992 the estimated corporation tax yield from IFSC companies is approximately £75 million a very significant and welcome contribution in these difficult times.  There is no doubt in my mind but that the centre has been a tremendous success and I look forward to it continuing to grow and contribute to employment creation and economic development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>From time to time we need to amend, update or extend legislation to facilitate the development of the centre.  We have done so many times over the last five to six years.  Today I recommend to the House new provisions designed to ensure that certain companies in the centre can continue to trade there and contribute to its development.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances the giving of tax relief to a company could result in an increase in the overall tax burden, including foreign tax, on the company or its parent such that the company would be unable to continue to trade in the State.  To deal with such situations it is proposed that the Minister for Finance may in certain circumstances, by notice in writing, reduce the tax relief to which certain companies trading in the IFSC would be entitled.  It is also proposed to cover financial service companies in the Shannon Free Airport zone which find <Col N="1153" /> themselves in similar difficulties.  The aim in reducing the tax relief would be to ensure that such companies would be able to continue to trade here and contribute to the development of the IFSC and Shannon zone.  In keeping with that objective, it is provided that the Minister may only reduce the relief to the extent that it is necessary to secure a company's continued presence in the State.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation is not specific to any particular country.  It would be my intention, however, to use this provision in the immediate future to impose a higher effective rate of tax on certain investment companies in the IFSC which could not otherwise carry on their business in the centre for the reasons I have given.  The legislation is flexible enough, nevertheless, to be used in similar situations where it is necessary.  The EC Commission was given details of the way we propose to deal with this problem and it has confirmed that it has no objection since a reduction of an existing relief is involved.</P>
    <P>This is an important piece of legislation to help the development of the centre.  It is needed urgently, otherwise the future of certain companies in the IFSC could be adversely affected.  Accordingly, I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with customs and excise measures arising from the completion of the Single Internal Market which must be put in place before 1 January 1993.  Part II primarily provides for the balance of the legislation necessary to establish the revised arrangements for the taxation of motor vehicles from that date.  The current border controlled excise duty on motor vehicles is being replaced by a vehicle registration tax &mdash; VRT &mdash; to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, while road tax will continue to be the responsibility of the local authorities under the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The basic framework for the introduction of a vehicle registration tax was included in the Finance Act, 1992.  Part II, Chapter 1, of the current Bill &mdash; comprising sections 4 to 17 &mdash; completes the legislative provisions necessary for the <Col N="1154" /> introduction of the tax and includes measures which reflect detailed discussions with trade interests.  The purpose of the Chapter is (i) to specify the rates of VRT to apply to the various categories of vehicles; (ii) to elaborate, clarify and refine a number of definitional and control aspects; (iii) to repeal the existing excise duty provisions; (iv) to provide for a system of temporary registrations; (v) to provide for a system of pre-booking of particular registration numbers; (vi) to provide a system for partial VRT refunds in respect of cars bought by car hire firms, leasing companies and driving schools to compensate them for a reduction in VAT deductibility that arises as a consequence of the revised vehicle taxation arrangements and (vii) to provide for a role for the Revenue Commissioners in relation to road tax enforcement.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal in some detail with the rates issue.  In previous statements I have made it clear that the priority for the new tax is that Exchequer revenue from motor vehicles be maintained at the level arising under current arrangements.  I also indicated that, in so far as is possible within the constraints of maintaining overall revenue, the aim would also be to leave the price of new cars broadly unchanged.</P>
    <P>At the moment, VAT is payable on the price of the vehicle inclusive of excise duty.  However, because the new tax will be excluded from the VAT base, the VAT payable will be lower.  In order to recover the VAT on the excise element which would otherwise be &ldquo;lost&rdquo;, the nominal VRT rate will have to be higher than the nominal excise rate being replaced.  A straight conversion of the excise rate of 20 per cent which applies for most private cars &mdash; those under 2012 cc &mdash; would imply a VRT rate of 24.2 per cent, that is, the equivalent of the current excise charge plus VAT at 21 per cent thereon.</P>
    <P>The issue is further complicated because, reflecting Community considerations, rates are set by reference to &ldquo;Open Market Selling Price&rdquo;&mdash; OMSP &mdash; as opposed to the &ldquo;Recommended <Col N="1155" /> Retail Selling Price&rdquo;&mdash; RRSP &mdash; applicable under the current system.  While the RRSP is the benchmark for existing excise rates, cars are usually sold for less than the RRSP reflecting the discounts traditionally offered by dealers.  These, I understand, average about 8 per cent. The motor distributors, by opting to declare an RRSP sufficiently high to allow scope for discounting, leave themselves liable to &ldquo;additional&rdquo; duty on the amount of the discount built into the RRSP.  Although distributors have always been free to declare RRSPs which are closer to the actual selling price and thereby mitigate part of the tax charge, they have almost invariably chosen not to do so; this is presumably because they considered the higher tax charge incurred as being outweighed by the advantage of being able to offer a higher nominal discount to customers.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, the VRT charge on an individual car will be determined by the application of the VRT rates set out in this Bill to the OMSP as declared by the distributor.  If all distributors declared OMSPs which are either identical to their existing RRSPs or reflect a uniform level of discounts, it would be a straightforward matter to set rates that would meet both my stated objectives.  However, the evidence to date indicates that distributors may adopt different practices in terms of discounting existing RRSPs.</P>
    <P>This gives rise to difficulty in that, to the extent that distributors adopt different rates of discounting in their declarations of OMSP to the Revenue Commissioners, it creates a clear and unavoidable conflict between the objective of maintaining overall revenue and the desire not to disturb prices.  The VRT rate that would maintain revenue from the section of the market where OMSPs were set at RRSP &mdash; or close to it &mdash; would be too low to maintain the tax yield from the rest of the market where RRSPs were discounted.  Conversely, the rate that would be needed to maintain revenue in the section of the market where RRSPs were discounted would <Col N="1156" /> result in an increased tax charge on the remainder &mdash; with consequently higher prices.</P>
    <P>If distributors adopt different approaches to declaring OMSPs it would be simply impossible to reconcile the objective of maintaining revenue with the achievement of price neutrality in all cases, given that a single rate of VRT must apply to all models in a particular category.  While a VRT rate that would ensure that no car increases in price is a theoretical possibility, it would expose the Exchequer to a substantial and, therefore, unacceptable loss of revenue. Given that budgetary considerations, especially in the difficult circumstances of 1993, dictate that revenues must be maintained, I have decided that the best approach is to set the rate by reference to RRSPs discounted by 6 per cent i.e. slightly less than the current industry average.  This approach will secure the bulk of existing revenue and should also obviate, in most cases, the need for price increases.  Furthermore, the rate proposed enables those distributors who finally declare OMSPs reflecting discounts of more than 6 per cent to reduce price slightly.  On this basis, the rate applicable to private cars not exceeding 2012 cc will be 25.75 per cent; while for larger cars, the rate will be 31.8 per cent &mdash; the current excise duty rate for this latter category is 24.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new rating arrangements will not lead to higher car prices generally or create legitimate pressures for such increases.  In fact, distributors representing at least 70 per cent of the car market have already indicated that they will be declaring OMSPs reflecting at least 6 per cent discounts; in most of these cases, the total tax charge will be reduced.  Moreover, it remains open to most, if not all, other distributors to adopt a similar approach and thereby avoid price increases.</P>
    <P>In setting the rate for those vans derived form cars or jeeps, which are currently liable to excise at a rate of 12.5 per cent, I am taking the same broad approach.  However, in recognition of the fact that VAT-registered purchasers <Col N="1157" /> account for the bulk of this segment of the market, I propose to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by virtue of the new arrangements.  The make-up of the total tax charge as between VAT and excise/VRT is altered, with the VAT element being reduced.  The VRT, unlike VAT, is not reclaimable.  Thus, since the effect of maintaining the total tax charge constant would be to increase the cost to VAT-registered purchasers, the VRT rate of 13.3 per cent, which I am proposing for these vehicles, will leave the net tax burden unchanged for business purchasers.  Furthermore, this rate should facilitate a reduction in the retail price of the vehicles concerned for private customers.</P>
    <P>In the case of both private cars and vans derived from cars and jeeps, I am providing for a minimum VRT charge of £100.</P>
    <P>For motorcyles, the Bill provides for the replication of the existing system as far as possible.  As with cars, the nominal VRT rates will have to be higher than the nominal excise rates being replaced, to recover the VAT being lost as a consequence of the exclusion of the new tax from the VAT base.  The rates now being proposed in that context are £2.50 per cc for the first 350 ccs and £1.25 per cc thereafter.</P>
    <P>Vehicles such as trucks, lorries and dumpers, which are currently exempt from excise duty but liable to a £40 administrative registration charge payable to local authorities, will be liable to an equivalent flat-rate registration tax.</P>
    <P>Vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, which are currently exempt from both excise duty and the present administrative registration charge, will not be liable to any VRT charge.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements would, in the absence of offsetting action, reduce the amount of tax deductible for those businesses entitled to a VAT deduction in respect of cars and would thus increase their net costs.  The businesses concerned are car hire, car leasing and driving schools.  In order to leave their tax burden unchanged, I am providing in section 10 for partial refunds of VRT as required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> In section 7 I am enabling the Revenue Commissioners to establish a facility for the reservation of particular registration numbers with a significance to car owners.  Numbers which would appear in the normal registration sequence may be booked in advance for a fee; there is no question of concocting numbers.  The section also allows the Revenue Commissioners to establish a register of vehicles of persons visiting the State, where temporary registration is required. This facility replicates an existing system and typically applies in situations where, for example, a person is temporarily resident in the State and is, for whatever reason, unable to display their domestic registration plates.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that, as part of their function in enforcing the new vehicle registration tax, officers of the Revenue Commissioners would also have a role in relation to the enforcement of road tax. These powers will be similar to those already possessed by traffic wardens in relation to road tax.  As regards enforcement of the VRT, I should explain that section 142 of the Finance Act, 1992, already provides that uniformed Revenue officers can stop a vehicle, examine it and require information concerning the vehicle to be furnished.  That section also gives detention and seizure powers to Revenue officers in respect of vehicles for the purposes of enforcement of VRT. Officers of the Revenue Commissioners will be specially authorised and trained for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 15 has two limited objectives. The first is to grant to members of the Garda Síochána the same powers in relation to detention of vehicles as are available to Revenue officers in the context of VRT.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the second objective is to give to duly authorised Revenue officers the same necessary powers as the Garda have for the enforcement of road tax.  It is intended that these latter powers will be exercised where Revenue officers, in the course of VRT or registration inquiries, come across cases of road tax offences.  I wish to repeat the assurances that I gave in the Dáil yesterday that <Col N="1159" /> consultations will be completed with the Garda and the Department of Justice before this new role for Revenue officers in relation to road tax is put into operation and that the Oireachtas will be advised of the arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals for legislation to be included in a second Finance Bill, published on 13 November 1992, also contained a number of measures relating to vehicle licensing i.e. road tax. Chapter II of this Bill, comprising sections 18 to 23, provides for those amendments to the road tax regime that are specifically necessitated by the introduction of the vehicle registration tax.</P>
    <P>Under the revised taxation arrangements, vehicle registration will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Road tax will continue to be a matter for the local authorities under the Department of the Environment.  Production of a registration certificate, which will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners, will, in future, be a pre-condition for obtaining a road tax disc.  Thus, it will no longer be feasible to simultaneously complete registration and first licensing of a vehicle.  In recognition of that situation, section 20 will permit, by way of a good defence mechanism, that a motorist will not be penalised for the use of an unlicensed vehicle provided a licence is obtained within seven working days of registration; this will give the motorist sufficient time, following registration, in which to license a vehicle.  To take account of the foregoing provision, the section also provides that a licence shall be due from date of registration, as opposed to date of first use as applies under present arrangements.  Finally, the section will allow a surcharge to be imposed on arrears of road tax to encourage motorists to obtain licences on time in the case of both first licensing and renewals.</P>
    <P>Trade licences have long been available to the members of the motor trade to enable them use unlicensed vehicles in public in the course of their business &mdash; for example for test driving new vehicles. Provision is being made, in section 21, <Col N="1160" /> for the continuation of a trade licence system under the new arrangements. However, it is necessary to recast the system in the light of its enhanced importance in the new regime, where it will form part of the control arrangements, not alone for road tax but also for VRT. The revisions made should ensure that the system is not abused.</P>
    <P>As recovery vehicles, e.g. tow-trucks, will no longer be permitted to operate using trade licences and will, therefore, require a road tax disc, provision is made in section 22 for the application of an existing road tax rate to such vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for the repeal of provisions relating to the small administrative registration charge which applied under the system now being replaced.</P>
    <P>I explained at the outset why I had, after careful consideration, concluded that the regulatory route was appropriate in these circumstances to transpose the EC Directives.</P>
    <P>Further regulations will need to be made by the Revenue Commissioners to give detailed, on the ground, effect to the regulations made by me under the European Communities Act, 1972 and, as the power to do so cannot be provided for by way of regulations, provision is included in section 25 for such powers. Similarly, it has been necessary to provide, in the Bill, for the creation of certain penalties and offences to back up the provisions in the ministerial regulations and this is done in sections 26 and 27.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this matter, I wish to stress that neither these regulations nor the Bill deal with actual rates of duty which member states are obliged to respect from 1 January 1993.  In practically all cases, our rates of duty already comply with the relevant provisions.  The exceptions include the duty on heavy fuel oil and the duties on tobacco products. It is considered preferable to deal with the action required as regards rates as part of the normal budgetary process, rather than by way of regulation, even though this course of action means that we will technically be in breach of our <Col N="1161" /> EC obligations in the period between 1 January and budget day.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of Senators to the fact that similar regulations will have to be made to complete the VAT arrangements for the Single Market.  The ECOFIN Council adopted the outstanding technical measures on Monday last and these will have to be transposed into national law as a priority. I can assure Senators that these regulations will be wholly technical and will not impinge on the more substantive issue of rates of VAT.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the abolition of the 3 per cent levy on investments in life assurance products and collective investment undertakings, with effect from a date to be set by ministerial order.  As the House is aware, during the discussions on the new DIRT provisions in the Finance Bill in May, I undertook to hold discussions with the life assurance companies and others in the financial services industry to consider the impact of the revised DIRT arrangements on the provision of equity finance to Irish industry. Following these discussions, I put forward my proposals for changes in this area in the draft legislation published in November.  These proposals include the introduction of special investment accounts and a change in the taxation arrangements for life assurance products in general.  Both sets of provisions involve the abolition of the three per cent levy.</P>
    <P>The special investment accounts were to be operative from the date of capital liberalisation and the new tax arrangements for general life assurance from the first of January 1993.  To delay the introduction of the special investment accounts until significantly later than the special saving accounts could have serious implications for their successful launch.  However, because of the method of collecting tax from such investment products, it is not essential that all the provisions relating to changes in their taxation arrangements be enacted now. Many of them can wait until the next Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In contrast to other taxes on such investments, action needs to be taken <Col N="1162" /> now in regard to the 3 per cent levy.  This is because this levy is an upfront charge paid by the investor when the investment is made initially.  It would be very difficult to abolish it retrospectively.  Therefore it is proposed to provide for its abolition, but to give the Minister for Finance power to give effect to this by Order. This will facilitate the new Government in introducing the proposed special investment accounts at the same time as special savings accounts, should they wish to do so.  It will also facilitate the new Government in introducing a new general regime for life assurance companies from 1 January next should they so decide.  The final decisions will, of course remain to be taken by the new Government.  While the other necessary provisions can be included in the 1993 Finance Bill with retrospective effect, an earlier statement of the Government's intent will be necessary if the special investment accounts are to be introduced at the same time as the special savings accounts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the House for sitting specially today to deal with these Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to contribute to this debate.  I was critical of the Minister's absence before he arrived.  I would like to retract that criticism.  I understand he was involved in the Government formation negotiations.  I should like to welcome him to the House. I respect the fact that he has come here to address us in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>This Bill is before us at a very strange time, for the fundamental reason that a general election took place at a very strange time.  Had that general election not occurred at that time we would not have had this piecemeal dealing with these financial Bills and Resolutions. That general election was called at a time of great instability in money markets here exacerbated by problems in relation to the appointment of a new Irish European Commissioner which was not announced until today and which might, more appropriately, have been announced earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific provisions of <Col N="1163" /> this Bill or those not included I should say there was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> some time ago claiming that a large range of new taxes to encourage industrial investment were put on hold because the second Finance Bill had to be abandoned a week before it was due to be published because of the events to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about a number of technical issues.  Taking the latter, smaller items, some of which have to do with European Community legislation with which we are dealing, I have often taken the view that we have very inadequate control, at a political level, of regulations being adopted by the European Community. I do not think that the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, established in 1973, of which I was a founder Member, deals adequately with the relevant legislation because they really deal with retrospective legislation and retrospective issues in respect of which it can have no input and absolutely no influence. Many of us in this and the other House have been screaming for some time for the establishment of a joint foreign affairs committee which is very pertinent because of our membership of the European Community, our involvement in the United Nations, in events happening in other regions such as Bosnia and elsewhere.  From my point of view the European Community issue is of paramount importance because of the so-called importance of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC. Therefore a joint foreign affairs committe could deal in a much more aggressive manner with many such issues concerning, for example, policies on hydro-carbon tax, policies on the overall green environmental sector throughout Europe today; with regulations in relation to all kinds of piecemeal projects nationwide which are sprung on tradesmen, business men or professional people in circumstances in which there has not been an adequate forewarning system.  Fire brigade action has to be taken to attempt to change something <Col N="1164" /> retrospectively.  That is not satisfactory. Therefore, the Minister and Government would be assisted if such a foreign affairs committee &mdash; which was to be established some time ago &mdash; were established fairly soon.  Indeed that should be one of the first tasks of the new administration to establish such a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specifics with which the Minister has dealt at great length, again due to the impending Single Market issue and the deadline, there is a necessity to introduce new measures into our laws.  Otherwise we would be in breach of EC obligations, resulting in operational difficulties for the Revenue Commissioners.  A major one, apparently, is this issue of vehicle registration tax &mdash; otherwise known as VRT &mdash; replacing excise duty.  Value added tax had been charged on the recommended retail prices of cars, including excise duty. The Minister, his Department and advisers estimate that the open market average selling price is 8 per cent less than recommended retail prices so that VRT is to be charged on recommended prices, less 6 per cent.  This arbitrary choosing is causing disquiet within the motor trade.  Many people have difficulty in understanding how that 8 per cent was arrived at.  For example, there are different makes of cars, different margins for garages.  In some cases, one is talking about less than 8 per cent while, in others, probably significantly more.  But the arbitrary choosing of this 6 per cent is not regarded as satisfactory.  In so far as the consumer is concerned &mdash; in other words the taxpayer &mdash; many take the view that the provisions of this Bill load the balance very much more in favour of the Government and Revenue Commissioners, than of the consumer, that they have gone a bit too far.  That is the only comment I wanted to make specifically but I am not a technocrat.</P>
    <P>As an aside &mdash; this is in no sense a criticism of the Minister or the Government and it is not pertinent to the Finance Bill &mdash; one of the disappointments of European Community membership is the big mystery about car sale prices.  The <Col N="1165" /> ordinary punter had expected that, at a certain time, there would be a levelling off of car prices, merely allowing for transportation factors.  Of course that has not happened.  There are huge disparities obtaining &mdash; practically 20 years after our entry into the European Community &mdash; between the retail prices of cars among the various member states.  This country would have one of the highest in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the issue of DIRT tax.  DIRT is a very simple name. I think many people around the country do not really know what the initials represent; they use them without understanding their representation.  It is, of course, deposit interest retention tax.  We can see the Minister's direction here because, with the abolition of foreign exchange controls, the opportunity for Irish investors to invest in other countries, with a competitive market in banks and other institutional investment circles, there is the danger that there would be substantial outflows of money from Ireland.  Obviously our national interest must be protected by addressing that issue or possibility.  Therefore this Bill is necessary to give the Minister and his departmental advisers some powers in relation to capital movements.</P>
    <P>However, it is not as simple as that because, as we acknowledged, this second Finance Bill had been signalled long before the present Bill was published and there were numerous statements in relation to this DIRT issue. There have been a substantial number of comments in national journals, by professionals in the financial, business and industrial sectors about DIRT tax and the proposed reduction by the Minister from 27 per cent to 10 per cent.  While appreciating the reasons for this change, it has been pointed out in the media, and no doubt to the Minister in representations, that this can have a very drastic and negative effect as far as the Government's programme to create employment is concerned.</P>
    <P>We spoke earlier, on the Appropriation Bill, about the fact that the single most critical and pressing issue in this <Col N="1166" /> country today is that, despite relative stability, 300,000 people are unemployed. There is great dissatisfaction at the extremely low level of jobs being created, especially in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>If one looks at this financial services sector, whether at banks, insurance companies or trustee savings banks, this massive reduction in the deposit interest retention tax is greatly reducing any incentive for people to invest in areas of medium to high risk.  If one can invest in virtually risk free enterprises at an extremely low tax rate on deposit interest where on earth is the incentive to invest in the industrial sector?  Apart from that and despite all the speeches by Ministers and by chairmen of national banking groups it is a fact of life that if one attempts to raise funds today for employment creating projects in the industrial sector it is virtually impossible to negotiate these funds from commercial outlets. That includes State banks, such as the Industrial Credit Company.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of the Industrial Credit Company in the Lemass years was that it was to be an arm of Government to fund industry.  The role of the bank has changed completely.  It has moved into the commercial arena and into financing property in Dublin, sweet shops, shoe stores and so on.</P>
    <P>As evidenced by its title, the Industrial Credit Company, its obvious intention was to fund industrial development.  The Industrial Credit Company today is in the same business as the other commercial banks, that is, the retail trading and property sectors and there is a diminished will to get into this prime area where the State is starved for development.  Development cannot happen and jobs cannot be created unless there is investment. Unless loan funding, independent of grant funding and equity funding, is available as sure as day follows night, the show cannot be put on the road and jobs cannot be created.</P>
    <P>The position is the same as far as equity funding is concerned.  It is extraordinarily difficult to raise equity funding in this country and this is retarding investment. <Col N="1167" /> In some cases it is easier to seek equity funds outside this country than in the city of Dublin today because of reluctance to get into this area.  One of the very damaging effects in this new DIRT legislation is that it encourages investors to move their funds into risk free areas, and this is acting as a huge disincentive to people to invest in the high risk areas where jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 24 November, a tax partner in a major chartered accountants company sought a pledge from political parties forming a Government, to review the impact of tax legislation on the jobs markets. If tax legislation is being stacked against incentives for people in business and the manufacturing industry, if people are being encouraged to withdraw funds as dividends without tax, if the brakes are put on employee participation, or if people are being encouraged to put investment in deposit accounts rather than in active areas, all this will nullify the stated objective of the Government in the sector.</P>
    <P>In the IDA Mr. Kieran McGowan, the chief executive, has for some time been calling for more investment funds to be targeted for industry.  That is not happening. The Culliton report was welcomed with a fanfare.  This incentive is flying in the face of what Culliton recommended, because that increased flow of funds into the deposit area will encourage people to invest in safe enterprises, such as property, rather than in venture capital. In terms of industrial investment the Culliton report has identified a shortage of seed capital, or venture capital, as a major problem facing Irish entrepreneurs. A commentator recently stated that if the country is to develop a strong and vibrant indigenous industrial base, the Minister will have to consider some form of fiscal incentives to encourage institutions and private investors to provide risk capital for new and developing industries.</P>
    <P>There has been speculation about the BES fund &mdash; whether it was intended to be part of the original Finance (No. 2) <Col N="1168" /> Bill.  It was stated that it was the Government's intention to abolish the £75,000 cap on investments which had been enshrined in the legislation.  I am glad to see the Minister nodding.  I would like him if possible to comment briefly on the BES fund and whether he belives there should be an increase in the amount of funding into an individual industrial project, and what plans or vision he has for the continuation of that fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
      <P>One commentator said that the new DIRT accounts are out of line with Culliton for two reasons.  They are a further <i>ad hoc</i> measure introduced in response to fears of money flowing out of the country after January and they use the tax system to discourage risk taking investment in industry.  Despite apparent agreement on the need for a thorough reform of the tax system, the Culliton report concludes that successful rearguard action by the interest groups surrounding each specific relief lies behind the lack of action in tax reform.  He also said that the Government will have to break through the myopia of specific interest groups and take the hard political decisions and decisive action needed to achieve a thorough reform of the taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, this is an <i>as hoc</i> measure which looked at the requirement for 1 January, and at the scope for investment outside the country.  The natural instinct was to protect that investment and retain it within Ireland.  Since the superficial view is that we must adopt a fire brigade rearguard action to stop this, we dropped the tax rate from 27 per cent to 10 per cent.  In isolation this can be very damaging <Col N="1169" /> if we are to create an incentive for investment in the critical areas that create jobs.  We should not do this in isolation. It should be part of a broader package where under other headings there are substantial incentives to get the funds flowing into the areas we are speaking about.  I welcome the Minister's comments about the business expansion scheme.  I look forward to receiving a copy of the White Paper and would welcome his further comments in relation to the BES.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I pay tribute to the Minister for the excellent work he has done as Minister for Finance.  It is easy to lose sight of the achievements in the economic management of the country. During the years 1987 to 1989 we improved the economic situation from a deplorable level of debt.  Predictions for economic growth in OECD countries are of the level of 2 per cent next year &mdash; for this country it is 2.75 per cent &mdash; an inflation rate of less than 3 per cent. Despite all the undoubted strains put on public spending this year in the areas of social welfare and health, the Minister has been able to maintain the debt-GDP ratio at the levels required for European Monetary Union convergence and he has also maintained the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  These are remarkable achievements by the Government in the light of the prevailing economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the unemployment problem we must remember that we are in the midst of one of the deepest international recessions we have ever had, and that the other countries, too, are enduring serious employment problems.  However, we cannot ignore these difficulties.  The Government has taken relentless action in the area of unemployment.  The Taoiseach initiated the county enterprise schemes.  In regard to a point made by Senator Staunton concerning the need for investment equity, nowhere is the Government's commitment more marked than in that area.  Money has been put up front by banks and other lending institutions, through the county <Col N="1170" /> enterprise schemes, to local enterprise for the start up of projects and particularly for job creating projects.  All of these are specific initiatives undertaken by the Government to tackle the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>All the fundamentals of the economy have been maintained at an acceptable level.  All independent commentators have acknowledged the good housekeeping and good financial management undertaken by this Government.  This means that when the economic upturn takes place &mdash; that will be assisted by the GAAT negotiations by Commissioner Ray MacSharry &mdash; we will be well poised to take advantage of all the benefits which have derived from sound management of the economy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the provisions contained in the Bill.  In regard to the DIRT provisions there is a large number of people in Ireland with small savings who depend on the interest derived from those savings to give them a basic level of income.  They appreciate very much the provisions made by the Minister in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made very important changes in relation to the financial services centre at Shannon.  These give the Minister flexibility to ensure that the jobs created in that centre are maintained and that the commitment to 3,000 jobs can be achieved.  This is a remarkable tribute to the Fianna Fáil Government which had the initiative to set up the financial services centre when the cynics and the critics had so much to say about the feasibility of the project.  They have been proved wrong not only in that respect but in many other instances, too.</P>
    <P>In relation to vehicle registration tax, the Minister has struck a balanced deal in relation to a complex and difficult issue.  It is living in cloud cuckooland to say we could have foregone the revenue which hitherto was taken under excise duty, that it would simply be lost to the Revenue and would not be replaced.  The Minister has had to tackle the issue to maintain the level of tax revenue and he has done so in a sensitive and balanced way and in full consultation with the <Col N="1171" /> industry.  So far as I am aware the industry is relatively happy with the manner in which he has approached this matter.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note the Minister has addressed the issue of car hire companies so that revenue wise the effect on these companies would be neutral.  This is an important area in relation to tourism, we do not want to impose additional costs in that area.</P>
    <P>In regard to job creation, an issue referred to by Senator Staunton, I welcome the fact that the Minister is proposing, in the not too distant future, to abolish the 3 per cent levy on life assurance and investment products.  This is further evidence of the Government's commitment to create the kind of equity investment and venture capital which is so necessary for enterprise, investment and jobs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to welcome the appointment of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, as European Commissioner.  I am delighted with his appointment, I am confident he will follow in the tradition of the Commissioners we have had in recent years and that he will play an excellent role in Europe on behalf of Ireland and of the Community as a whole.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief as I did not intend speaking on this Bill.  I should like to respond to something which was said earlier in the House today by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Treacy, when speaking on the Appropriation Bill, said:</P>
      <P>In spite of the predictions earlier in the year, new car sales were down by only 1.25 per cent as of the end-September and are expected to show a decline of about the same order for the full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it acceptable to the Minister that the motor industry is going through one of its worse crises in many years?  Sometimes we forget, in our anxiety to balance the finances exactly, the contribution of the motor industry to our economy, to employment and to the social life of the <Col N="1172" /> country.  It sometimes appears as if the Departments of State are in conflict with the motor industry rather than using it is a vehicle &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; to generate employment and to accelerate the economy.</P>
    <P>Let us get some facts straight.  The motor industry, with motorists, contribute about £1.2 billion to the Irish economy every year.  This is as much if not more than we hope to get from Maastricht.  There are more than 25,000 people employed in the industry.  It is a sector that realises the demands for Government revenue and it also wishes the Minister to recognise that it cannot trade continually with its hands tied behind its back, in an extremely heavy tax regime.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reduce vehicle registration tax on cars by way of compensation for the UK's complete abolition of duty.  We cannot expect the homebased motor industry to compete with such a high level of taxation.  Over 60 per cent of car sales in Ireland are to the corporate sector.  The high level of benefit-in-kind tax in Ireland will decimate this sector of sales and consequently employment.</P>
    <P>During our four year period a business person with a company car would pay tax on 120 per cent of the original cost of the car which is made up of 40 per cent taxation.</P>
    <P>In 1981 when over 100,000 cars were sold there were approximately 24,000 people employed in the retail side of the motor industry alone.  Ten years later the burden of taxation on cars and the benefit-in-kind taxes have reduced the number of cars sold to 65,000 and employment in this sector of the motor industry has reduced to 15,000.  The irony of the whole situation is that a reduced level of taxation would stimulate demand and result in increased revenue to the Government.  Let us have some commonsense and put jobs before theory.  By insisting on the ridiculously high level of benefit-in-kind tax we will force a reduction in car sales to the corporate sector, reduce employment substantially <Col N="1173" /> and thereby reduce Government revenue.</P>
    <P>On a happier note I thank the Minister for reducing the cost of the trade based industry from the high figure which was published in earlier proposals.</P>

      <P>In relation to how the 6 per cent was arrived at in calculating the rate, 50 per cent of distributors have indicated they will declare prices to Revenue 8 per cent below the existing retail sales price.  A rate based on 6 per cent reflects this pattern which many other distributors are now following while still leaving a safety margin for those few cases where discounting to that level would not be possible. I thank Senator Staunton for his remarks in relation to the Bill and note his points about the DIRT tax.  It is a changed position.  As I said yesterday in the other House the matter will be kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staunton asked for some details regarding the proposed changes in the business expansion scheme.  It is proposed to renew the scheme for a further three years up to 5 April 1996 in recognition of the concerns expressed about access to equity capital for start-up and developing companies.  It is also proposed to abolish the lifetime cap for individual investors, which is currently £75,000 which would limit the availability of funds to companies under the business expansion scheme.  This, in conjunction with the annual limit of £25,000, which it is proposed to maintain at the current level, will allow individuals to make tax relief investments of up to a further £75,000 over the next three years.  In order to ensure the scheme's current focus on economic sectors and on firms which are both at risk and offer the prospect of extra sustainable output in jobs, it is proposed not to alter the company limit which will remain at £500,000. These changes will certainly help those <Col N="1174" /> people who tend to use the scheme to invest.  Many of them have reached the maximum of their lifetime limit and it is only correct that we should allow them the scope to make further investments if they wish.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators Farrell and Bennett for their supportive remarks.  I know the motor trade has been experiencing difficulties for a few years.  However, it is not the only sector; most industries in most countries are experiencing difficulties. When I was in Edinburgh last week my German colleague told me that three years ago a person would have to wait for up to six months for a new Mercedes but that the Mercedes plant is now operating only three days a week and 30,000 Mercedes are sitting in the factory car park.  This is an indication of what is happening in other countries.</P>
    <P>As Senator Bennett said, car tax rates were reduced in the 1992 budget.  This is important for the industry.  Senator Bennett has been an outspoken supporter of the industry for many years and has tried to get a better deal for it.  This is only right as it is a big employer and a very important industry.  I will continue to keep this industry under review to see what way we can assist it in surviving and enabling it to grow when the economic climate improves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Members of Seanad Éireann for their co-operation in helping to enact this legislation.  This is an important Bill and I think it is in the national interest that it should be enacted before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In 1988, as part of our EC obligations Ireland, along with other member states, agreed to liberalise capital movement under a directive on capital movements. This remains the current EC legislation in this area.  This will be replaced by the provisions of the Treaty on European Union in 1994.  For most member states the deadline of 1 July 1990 was laid down. However, we received a derogation to allow us to keep our exchange controls until the end of 1992.  Spain, Portugal and Greece were also allowed derogations. However, only Greece will continue to maintain controls from 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>Since 1988 we have been liberalising our controls on a phased basis.  The most recent liberalisation measures took effect on 1 January this year.  Only a few controls remain, principally those rules restricting residents from holding deposit or current accounts abroad and on short term lending in Irish pounds to nonresidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the crisis that occured in the past few months in the currency markets.  The attack mounted on the members of the <Col N="1176" /> European Monetary System has been unprecedented in scale.  The initial turbulence occurred for a number of reasons which have been well rehearsed.</P>
    <P>The weak dollar and low US interest rates, the cost of German unification and the resultant high German interest rates all combined with uncertainty over the outcome of the Maastricht Treaty and helped set the conditions for further uncertainty.  When doubts in the market grew about the sustainability of certain exchange rate parities given the economic conditions pertaining in a number of countries the crisis occured.  The Irish pound, like other currencies, was put under enormous pressure and we were obliged to support the pound by raising interest rates and intervening heavily in the markets.  This action, and that taken by other member states, was partially successful but one member had to devalue while two members of the system had to withdraw.  Hopefully, these withdrawals are temporary.</P>
    <P>Things had begun to return to some normality during October, but in November another crisis arose &mdash; Spain and Portugual devalued.  We again had to intervene to support our pound and establish a new system of extending wholesale credit to prevent speculation against the pound.  This has been successful to date.</P>
    <P>Turning to interest rates, I can assure the House that we are acutely conscious of the fact that our interest and mortage rates are exceptionally high.  I know that the Central Bank, which has statutory responsibility for monetary policy, shares our view.  Indeed, the Central Bank has taken all the steps which are open to it to defend the currency with the minimum possible impact on interest rates.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to defend the currency without increasing interest rates.  We are satisfied that the benefits which will flow to the economy from a stable exchange rate will, over a reasonable timescale, significantly outweigh the short term costs of defending the currency now.  We believe that failure to defend the currency would prove very costly in terms of investment, jobs and <Col N="1177" /> general economic well being for years to come.  Already wholesale interest rates are well below their peak levels and we are confident that once stability is restored to the currency markets interest rates will fall quickly from their present levels.</P>
    <P>During the crises exchange controls were of help to us in defending the punt. They gave us a breathing space. However, we cannot continue to hide behind controls indefinitely.  These controls are effective in the short term, but we must depend on other ways of dealing with crises, whenever they arise.  This is what happens in other countries.  As I said, controls have been reduced or fully abolished in all member states except Greece.  Portugal abolished its remaining controls yesterday.  It is unfortunate that we must take our final step in removing controls at such a delicate stage in the currency markets.  However, that is outside of our control.  The exchange Control Acts, 1954 to 1990, will lapse at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had the current exchange controls since 1954, when the Exchange Controls Act was enacted.  This established the rules for capital movements. However, we have recognised that, in the modern financial world these controls are being relaxed and are no longer effective in the new Europe.  In the Community of the Single Market, capital must be free to flow between countries, if the market is to work.  We have accepted that.  Under this Bill, a future Minister for Finance will have the power to restrict financial transfers, if necessary, in an emergency situation.  However, we do not foresee any circumstances, where these would be used to defeat currency speculation.</P>
    <P>I have set out the general background to the introduction of this Bill.  I would like to turn now specifically to the Bill. This Bill was envisaged to deal with a variety of situations.  In particular, the Exchange Control Acts were used to impose financial sanctions against Iraq and the former Yugoslavia.  With the ending of these Acts, there will be no power available for a Minister for Finance to impose financial sanctions in the <Col N="1178" /> event of the international Community taking such an action.  We are obliged, because of our UN membership, to implement UN resolutions.  I would envisage that when this Bill is enacted, the Minister of Finance will make an order, under section 4 to continue our existing financial sanctions in relation to Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the provisions in the Treaty for European Union, the Community may act to restrict financial transfers. Under Article 73 (g), the Community, acting jointly, may impose sanctions against third countries.  There is also provision to allow the Community to impose capital movement restrictions, where the Community wish to take retaliatory action where there is discrimination against Community firms, by a third country.  Such action is provided for in certain existing Directives, such as the Second Banking Directive.  The Community may also take action to prevent turbulence in the Community's financial markets or threat to the single currency. The Treaty provisions emphasise the Community, as a group, taking action. There is some provision for a single member state to act, for example, for serious political reasons, in the sanctions area.  However, any measures must be subsequently approved by the Community.</P>
    <P>These Treaty provisions are another reason for this Bill.  We must be in a position to fulfil our obligations under the Treaty.  While the Community might act by way of regulation, which are directly binding on us, we must be in a position to prevent breaches of these regulations, by means of domestic law. The Community does not prescribe punishments for offences.  Enforcement is left to the member state.  Therefore, to ensure we can fully enforce any EC decisions, we need domestic law to create offences for breaches and appropriate punishments.</P>
    <P>Under the 1988 Directive on Capital Movements that I referred to earlier, member states may, under Article 3, take action to impose restrictions on capital <Col N="1179" /> movements, where there is severe disruption to the markets.  However, we do not forsee any circumstances at present, that would require the use of this power to defend the currency.  From January next, investors will be able to hedge their investments, which they had been unable to do previously.  This is a normal and accepted practice elsewhere and we will now come into line.  I hope that this will, in time, help to support our currency and investments in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill of its nature is short and attempts to achieve it aim simply.  It is envisaged that the Minister for Finance will need to have wide powers which will allow flexibility in dealing with the variety of situations which might arise.  In the field of sanctions, they might be selective or wide ranging.  They might name a number of countries or only one.  Indeed, they may arise either from the UN or the Community, under the new Treaty provisions, taking action.  Therefore, I feel that there is a need for flexibility and, consequently, the Bill gives wide discretion to a Minister, when to act and how to draw up the implementing orders.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the normal short title provision. Sections 2 and 3 are the definitions sections and define the transactions to be covered.  Mention is made here of EC legislation in the area.  The phrase &ldquo;financial transfers&rdquo; is wide, but attempts to define it too closely could lead, inadvertently, to loopholes.  Therefore, we have put in a cross reference to EC Treaty provisions and the legislation flowing from that.  In this way, we attempt to indicate the activities to be covered.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the main provision in the Bill.  This section allows a Minister for Finance to make an order to restrict capital transfers, with other countries.  The Minister, as I indicated above, should be given powers to decide on the details of each order to meet each and every situation, as it arises.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also allows a Minister for Finance to delegate certain of his powers under this Bill.  What is envisaged here is that the Minister could delegate to the Central Bank the day-to-day operational <Col N="1180" /> details.  This is similar to what has happened under the Exchange Control Acts. The delegation to the Central Bank at present has worked well and is a model for the future.  Its central position in the financial system make it the natural body to administer any restrictions in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 5 creates the offences and includes a provision to allow for prosecution of corporate bodies.  It is a feature of other Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the penalties for breaches of orders.  Some may find these penalties high &mdash; conviction on indictment could result in a fine of up to £10 million pounds.  However, we feel that these harsh penalties are necessary in order to cater for the future, but also to deter transgressions in an area, where the amounts involved can be huge.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that an order, under section 4, should be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, within 21 sitting days.  This provision is in no way meant to lessen the input of the Oireachtas, but is necessary to ensure speed of implementation.  Sanctions or other restrictions may need to be imposed at a time, when the Dáil or Seanad are not sitting.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  We must not allow a vacuum to arise after 1 January where, without this Bill, we will have no way to fulfil our international obligations.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Senators, particularly Senator Manning and his colleagues, for allowing this legislation through.  I know it is inconvenient for the House to meet at this stage.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, will reply to the debate. Since this is the last occasion in 1992 on whch I will address this House, I wish all Members and you, a Chathaoirligh, a very happy Christmas and a successful new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the courtesy he has always shown this House.  Of all Ministers he is the one who has always taken Bills here in detail.  It is a courtesy which is certainly appreciated on this side of the House and by all Members.</P>
      <P>I find myself at a double disadvantage in speaking on this Bill.  I am not a finance man through and through.  Numeracy is not my strongest suit.  It is regrettable that we are taking legislation in the midst of a political vacuum but that is nobody's fault, it is a fact of life.  We are in a sense between elections and it is important that this legislation should go through in the time stipulated by the Minister.  The other disadvantage under which I labour is that my colleague, Senator Staunton, was to speak on this Bill but he was temporarily not available.  I said earlier that it might be 11 years before he comes back here again.  If he is not back in 11 minutes, it may be too late.</P>
      <P>This Bill seems to be entirely unexceptional. It is a technical Bill designed to achieve a purpose which all parties would approve, namely that we be in a position to impose financial sanctions on countries which have broken either UN or EC provisions or are guilty of reprehensible conduct.  There is no difficulty about the principle of the Bill.  I have read it through, but without detailed examination.  We are happy to facilitate its speedy passage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur fully with Senator Manning's comments about the Minister for Finance.  He has always made himself available to this House and it is appropriate that we should acknowledge that.  It is only appropriate that, on his last occasion here, we should acknowledge that.  As a very busy Minister at the Department of Finance he has found time, whenever possible, to be here.  On one occasion he stayed here for up to seven hours in one day and that is an indication of the regard in which he holds this House.  It is appropriate also that we should compliment the Minister of State, the Department of Finance, and the Central Bank on their <Col N="1182" /> management of our finances in recent times, particularly in the context of the IR£.  The stability of the exchange rate mechanism, the stability of our punt and of many other currencies around Europe was headlined in the newspapers for many months.  Our Minister, our Government and our people here kept their heads.  When others were devaluing and adding to some extent to the confusion and chaos in the market a small country like Ireland behaved impeccably. It is a credit to the officials of the Department of Finance and to all the people involved in the finances of our country that they held a very steady hand that they showed a confidence to the public and to Europe, by sound management of the economy in recent years, enabling it to withstand the pressures of the chaos in the international market.  We must indeed compliment the people who have looked after the economy and enhanced the standing of Ireland and the standing of the IR£ in Europe in particular and elsewhere.  Full credit is due to the people who have been acting on our behalf, led by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate mechanism played a part in all that.  There will be a change in that as and from 1 January 1993.  It is very important that we will not be on our own when upheaval takes place and that there will be a true Community response to development.  If Ireland is to benefit and to feel safe in a more integrated EC, then there will have to be cohesion of Community response to any third pressures, particularly in financial areas.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to bring us into line with the amended Treaty.  It also contains wide-ranging powers and extended responsibility for the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  From what I have seen in recent times, we are in good hands.  Support inside the EC will be forthcoming because our stance up to now has been very responsible and is very much respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I again compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy.  As it is the last time I will <Col N="1183" /> speak in this Seanad I want to extend best wishes to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to all my colleagues.</P>

      <P>I would like on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and on my own behalf to sincerely thank the House for the tremendous co-operation they have given us today in effecting a legislative conclusion to these very important Bills.  It is vitally important that we are fully prepared for the Single Market, that we take account of the serious decisions that have to be taken to protect our currencies and the transfer of capital within the Community and that we are fully in tune with other decisions and other directives that have been taken by the Community at Community and Commission level.</P>
      <P>I would like to echo the sentiments of the House in paying tribute to the Government, the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank on ensuring that we have been sustained collectively in protecting the IR£ so that Ireland can be competitive, that we can protect the country's financial position, without exacerbating the serious compounding national debt and ensuring that our firms and companies are competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are thankful for the political leadership that has been given, the co-operation of this House and the Dáil and the tremendously efficient, professional advice from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  We can all be proud of our performances in ensuring that we have been able to sustain ourselves in this very difficult international situation.  I sincerely thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the leadership you have given this House and appreciate the co-operation of the House.  It is always a pleasure to come here.  Whether I have any role in the future, I will always be delighted to come back to listen to the eminent contributions from so many fine Members of the House.  I wish all outgoing Members who are seeking re-election every success in the election.  I <Col N="1184" /> sincerely thank all outgoing Members who are not seeking re-election for their great contributions and I wish them health and happiness in retirement.</P>

      <P>Before I answer you, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to say that the last three-and-a-half years in the Seanad was a very fulfilling time for me. I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to Senators John A. Murphy, Jack Harte, Carmencita Hederman and Myles Staunton.  I would like to pay tribute to the Members who were elected to the Lower House.  I would like to pay tribute to you, a Chathaoirligh, to Senator Eoin Ryan who is now Deputy Ryan, who was our Chief Whip and to Senator G.V. Wright who were all great people to work with.  Deputy Ryan was a very fine colleague to work with.  I would like to thank Senator Maurice Manning and Senator Liam Cosgrave and the Whips of the other parties.  At times when we had problems with the Order of Business they were always most helpful. I wish to thank the staff of the Seanad, including the Clerk, the ushers and all <Col N="1185" /> those involved in the day-to-day running of the Seanad.

      <P>Before we adjourn I, too, would like to be associated with those words.  On the Order of Business earlier today I congratulated Deputy Pádraig Flynn on his elevation to the post of European Commissioner.  As a fellow teacher and INTO member, I am delighted that he has been promoted and hope that his experience as a primary teacher in the west and INTO member will stand him in good stead when he comes to deal with the Eurocrats and the Europeans, generally.  I also hope that the primary education sector will receive attention from the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is excluded from the Treaty of Rome but, for me, the most progressive <Col N="1186" /> and positive development in relation to the Maastricht Treaty is that for the first time education is included.  I also note that last week at Edinburgh the way was opened for new funding arrangements in relation to the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    <P>A document from the OECD, which was published in September of this year, clearly outlined the problems in relation to funding at primary level and established a number of facts beyond yea or nay.  First, within Ireland the primary sector receives less funding than any other sector of education and on a <i>pro rata</i> basis less money is spent on primary education in this country than in any other country in the OECD.  In addition, we have the largest classes and the least amount of resources and funding.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter today is that I would like the Government to take an interest in it.  The Minister of State has always taken an interest in education matters but I would like the Government to take a real interest at this stage.  It is a little known fact that the primary sector is the only sector which has never received any European funding.  All the other sectors, including the regional technical colleges and second level education have received funding.</P>
    <P>At this stage most of the Commissioners have been assigned their portfolios and know what their job is going to be.  This is an open secret in Brussels. I was in touch with a number of people in Brussels today to confirm this.  What is left at this stage?  Two major portfolios are still available for the Irish Commissioner &mdash; the Regional Affairs and Social Affairs directorates.  If our Commissioner is not given one of these all that will remain is what is termed a &rdquo;rag bag&rdquo; or &ldquo;mixed bag&rdquo; of lesser portfolios.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Education to highlight the needs and primary sector in Brussels and I am asking the Government to make an initial move and move immediately and use its influence to endure that the Irish Commissioner is given the social affairs portfolio.  The Minister for Education should convince the Government that there is need for it <Col N="1187" /> to use its influnece to ensure the Irish Commissioner is given the education portfolio.  It would be particularly appropriate on this occasion that an educationist be given the social affairs portfolio given that for the first time the Commissioner for social affairs will have responsibility for education.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund was set up to ensure that levels of support were equalised in European countries.  It is quite clear that this fund could be used to great effect in disadvantaged areas in Ireland and should be extended to include the education sector which is the main point of intervention in dealing with the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>I have written to the new Irish Commissioner this afternoon seeking a meeting with him and his new staff in Brussels at the earliest possible date in January. At that meeting I intend to make a number of proposals.  Among other things I intend to propose that a pilot scheme for the introduction of modern languages into our primary schools should be established; that a comprehensive literacy programme, involving the creation of literacy projects and extra remedial posts, be introduced; the introduction of in-service training and education for teachers; that we respond to the needs of those from under-privileged backgrounds in relation to education, that a building plan be drawn up to ensure that schools throughout the country have a general purposes room and that the caretaker and clerk-typist schemes be extended to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>These are all practical steps and when I meet the Commissioner I intend to price them and ensure that the Structural and Cohesion Funds are extended to include education.  Some of these are already included but in the case of others a liberal interpretation would be required on the part of people in Brussels to ensure that they are included but it is important that we note at this point that at their meeting at Edinburgh last week the Heads of Government made a commitment to education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> For the past 40 years Brussels has been dealing with the question of training, not education.  In more recent times, however, it has begun to deal with the regional technical colleges and other areas and has an interface with both third level and second level education.  Nobody has experience of being in charge of developing a primary education programme. Europe is inexperienced in making decisions in the area of primary education.  For that reason, recognising that it is completely outside the experience of DG5 &mdash; the directorate dealing with social affairs, human resources and education &mdash; I would ask the Minister to request the Government to ensure that we press for the immediate establishment of a European advisory commission on primary education.</P>
    <P>The Government should also insist that the Commission applies itself to determining a common education policy on those aspects of primary education in which member states have a common interest.  It was never intended by anyone in Brussels that Europe would make decisions on education, but there is an intention there to develop co-operation. Therefore we should identify the areas of common interest for primary education and establish a common education policy in those areas.  The last time I spoke on this matter I suggested that if we are doing away with the Common Agricultural Policy we should introduce a CEP, a common education policy.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the items I wished to refer to.  I would make it quite clear that the funds are there and the Government should ensure that some of that funding goes to primary education. I am asking for the setting up of a European primary education advisory committee and a common education policy as well as the channelling of finance from the Structural and Cohesion Funds to primary education.  I congratulate Deputy Flynn on his appointment as Commissioner.  I would ask that primary education be given consideration after decades of neglect, having been identified nationally and internationally as the only sector in education which has never <Col N="1189" /> received European funding.  That sector now deserves support and I would ask the Minister to respond in a positive way.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would pay a special tribute to Senator O'Toole on his very fine debate on this matter.  I also pay a special tribute to and congratulate my Government colleague and friend, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, on his appointment as the forthcoming European Commissioner for Ireland.  I wish him every success and congratulate himself, his family and indeed his country. I think we will all be pleased with his appointment.  He will bring to the job a fine intellect.  He has a great record of parliamentary and political service to Ireland.  I am confident he will follow in the footsteps of previous Commissioners, most notably the immediate outgoing Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, who has made a great contribution to our country, to Europe and to world affairs.  I wish Deputy Flynn every success in his new post.</P>
      <P>Ireland was one of the originators of the proposals to have a specific Education Article in the Maastricht Treaty, Article 126.  The Treaty provides for Community assistance for the development of quality education by encouraging co-operation between member states.  The main areas targeted for action in the article are the European dimension in education, particularly language teaching student and teacher mobility and academic recognition of diplomas and periods of study, co-operation between education establishments, youth exchanges and exchanges of instructors and information and distance education.</P>
      <P>Under the existing round of Structural Funds substantial support is received for the education system from the European Social Fund for vocational training and from the European Regional Development Fund for third level infrastructure. The 1992 commitment of aid is of the order of £143 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators are aware a substantial increase in Structural funds has been agreed for the new round starting in 1994, <Col N="1190" /> with the addition of a Cohesion Fund for projects in the field of environment and trans-European transport networks.  It is not envisaged that the education system will benefit from the Cohesion Fund, but the Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, has prepared a range of proposals seeking assistance from both the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund within a strategy to achieve greater economic and social cohesion in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The key national objective in the new round of Structural Funds will be to seek support for activity which increases the rate of growth of the economy and expands self-sustaining employment. Within this strategy, the aim of the education sector will be to establish greater equity in education particularly of those who are economically or socially disadvantaged, and to broaden the system so as to equip students more effectively for life, for work in an enterprise culture and for citizenship of Europe.</P>
    <P>The plans for the education sector focus on a strengthening of vocational training in the science, technology, business and language fields in the third level sector, including increased access to training for those already employed in industry; a major upgrading of education/training infrastructure to enhance the capacity of institutions to provide research and development support and a highly skilled workforce to meet the needs of industry; an expansion of second-chance education and training activity for the long term unemployed; an enhancement of programmes for unqualified early school leavers, allied with a continued investment in intervention measures to tackle disadvantage within the school system; a strengthening of the vocational dimension in senior cycle education through the expansion and further development of the leaving certificate vocational programme offering subjects orientated towards science, technology, enterprise and languages and incorporating work experience in the chosen disciplines; a restructuring of VPT-2 post-leaving certificate course to provide a common form of nationally recognised certification and <Col N="1191" /> provision for progression of high achievers to third level, with the thrust of vocational training, moving towards a dual system in which employers play a much greater role, and a comprehensive training of trainers programme in support of these initiatives.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that what I have outlined are the education sector's proposals for support in the new round.  Consultations with the social partners, with Government Departments and agencies and with regional advisory groups on the finalisation of the new Development Plan for Ireland are still under way and no decisions have yet been made as to the proposals which will finally be included in the new Community support framework to be negotiated with the EC for Ireland.  However, I am confident that the education measures, which are consistent with the policy approach for education outlined in the Green Paper, <i>Education for a Changing World</i> and with those of the Culliton report, will be given a high priority in the plans to promote growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is now the single largest Irish beneficiary under the European Social Fund.  This funding is continued by EC regulation to specific vocational education and training measures and recruitment and employment subsidies.  ESF funding has not been provided for primary education.  The House should be aware that the fund was established under Article 123 of the Treaty of Rome, with the &ldquo;task of rendering the employment of workers easier and of increasing their geographical and occupational mobility within the Community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate from what I have said that the Government will seek to ensure that the relevant Structural Funds will contribute to the achievement of our priorities as outlined in the Green Paper for the development of an equitable and effective education and training system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Finally, I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole in his demands for extra resources for the primary sector.  As a parent who has been involved in the primary sector and who has family connections with that sector, as one who represents the public in my constituency and as Minister of State with an interest in education, I readily accept the need for a review of the whole primary sector and with giving priority to funding that sector so as to ensure that it keeps pace with the developments that have taken place at second and third level.  I commend Senator O'Toole and the House for their interest in this debate. I wish Senator O'Toole every success in his future discussions and dialogue with the new Commissioner and his officials.</P>
    <P>Finally, I sincerely thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, also the Clerk of the Seanad and the staff of both the Dáil and Seanad for their co-operation during the past year.  I wish them a very happy and holy Christmas, a peaceful and prosperous New Year and every success in the years ahead.</P>
